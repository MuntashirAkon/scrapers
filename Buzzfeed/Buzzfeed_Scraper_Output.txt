Taylor Swift's New Image Has Been Turned Into An Amazing Meme And It's Way Too Good
On Friday, Taylor Swift released her new single, "Look What You Made Me Do," along with a new ~harder~ image. People soon began to compare and contrast the star's old ~lewk,~ with photos representing her transformation. It soon turned into a pretty hilarious meme. One we can all relate to, tbh. Honestly, who DIDN'T go through this? We have all been there, for real. Too accurate. People also began to use the meme to compare Taylor's new vibe to other people who have transformed. Like how Robin Sparkles turned into Robin Daggers. It's too good. Another popular comparison is Jenny Humphrey. Remember when she got h-core? Taylor can relate. There are so many options, tbh. Quinn did it. Sandy did it. The Olsens did it. Welcome to Twitter, New Taylor!
21 Hilarious Reactions To Taylor Swift's New Song

Taylor Swift's New Single Is Here And It Seriously Gives No Fucks

Guys. Guys. GUYS. GUYS. GUUUUUYYYYSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!OK, let me try to calm down a little.
 
AND YOU KNOW WHAT? Same.
After a long week of clues and cryptic videos, Taylor Swift's brand-new single is here. It's titled "Look What You Made Me Do" and IT IS FUCKING BONKERS. It's very different from the country and upbeat pop songs that we've gotten from her in the past, and it's clearly referencing all the ~drama~ that's been surrounding her for the past three years. The best part of the song has to be the breakdown, where she says, "The old Taylor can't come to the phone right now. Why? Oh, because she's dead." A snippet of the video will premiere on Good Morning America tomorrow morning! And I, for one, will be thinking of NOTHING ELSE until then.
This Test Will Reveal Which Taylor Swift Era You Actually Are

Just A Reminder That Taylor Swift Always Brings The Drama To The MTV VMAs

It's quite something.
 
Some people think she and Katy will perform together, others think Taylor will perform alone, and some think even if Katy and Taylor don't perform together, they'll end their feud.
 
Things got pretty messy and complicated from there on in. She repeatedly accused him of breaking up with her over the phone, and when Joe began a new relationship with Camilla Belle shortly after the split, Taylor and Joe then spent two years writing songs about each other. This climaxed with Taylor releasing "Better Than Revenge," allegedly about Camilla, which contained the lyric: "She's an actress/ She's better known/ For the things that she does/ On the mattress." Damn.
 
In an incident that'll one day be put in history books, Taylor had just taken to the stage to accept her award for Best Female Video, for "You Belong With Me," when Kanye West appeared, took the microphone from her and announced to the world that Beyoncé should have won instead. Kanye was booed off stage and Taylor ran out of time to finish her acceptance speech.
 
Not only did the performance open with a grainy black and white clip of the incident, but the lyrics also referenced Kanye: "32 and still growing up / Who you are is not what you did / You’re still an innocent."
 
And we were not disappointed.
 
It was later kinda debunked – people suggested Taylor was actually saying: "Sorry about my arm" to Selena Gomez.
 
She said: "I also want to thank the person who inspired this song, who knows exactly who he is, because now I have one of these."
 
That's right, in 2015, the drama kicked off before we'd even got to the ceremony. It all started when Taylor's video, "Bad Blood" was nominated for Video of the Year, while Nicki Minaj's video for "Anaconda" was overlooked. Nicki tweeted saying that had she been a "different kind of artist" who celebrated "women with very slim bodies," she would also have been nominated. Many people assumed that the tweet was a direct dig at "Bad Blood."
 
After Taylor's social media purge earlier this week, the tweet is no longer visible, but in it, she said: "@NICKIMINAJ I've done nothing but love & support you. It's unlike you to pit women against each other. Maybe one of the men took your slot.." Nicki responded telling Taylor that the tweet wasn't aimed at her, but that she "should speak on this." Taylor didn't address the point that Nicki was making about systematic racism in the music industry, but did invite her up on stage with her if she won.
 
The video was accused of romanticising African Colonialism, and drew such criticism that the director ended up making a statement addressing the claims.
 
She went on to praise Kanye's career, and said she'd been a lifelong fan: "I have been a fan of his since I can remember because Kanye defines what it is to be a creative force in music, fashion, and well, life."
 
If you weren't already aware of the details of Famous-gate, the TL;DR version goes like this: Kanye West released a song in which he said he and Taylor "might still have sex" because he "made that bitch famous." Taylor got mad, sad the song was misogynistic and then gave the above speech at the Grammys. Kanye claimed that Taylor had known about the lyric, no one believed him, and then Kim Kardashian leaked a audio from a portion of a phonecall between Taylor and Kanye in which she seemed to give permission for him to use the lyric.Who knows, maybe the 2018 VMAs will be where she and Kanye make up again?
 
Proof, again that the 2009 VMAs were history-making.
It's been quite the week for Taylor Swift. Not only did she reveal the title, artwork and release date of her new album, but she's also dropped the first single. And, all week, rumours have been circulating that Taylor is going to make a surprise appearance at the MTV VMAs this weekend, where Katy Perry is hosting. The rumours were bolstered by reports that Taylor was spotted boarding her jet to LA, where the awards are held. Whether or not she'll make an appearance remains to be seen, but I am here to point out that so many important Taylor Swift Career Moments have occurred at the VMAs. So, if she was going to make a comeback at any event, this would probably be it. All the way back in 2008, an 18 year old Taylor Swift attended her first ever MTV VMA ceremony. However, never one to do things by halves, she also chose the moment to go public with her new boyfriend, Joe Jonas. Here they are inside the ceremony. This relationship would, however, lead to Taylor's first ever ~Showbiz Feud~. Just a month after their appearance at the awards show, Taylor announced on The Ellen Show that she and Joe had parted ways. The following year, this iconic moment happened, and her long-running feud with Kanye West began. Weeks later, Kanye publicly apologised and everyone assumed the feud was over. How WRONG WE WERE. Because during the 2010 VMAs, Taylor performed a song addressing the incident from the year before. Skipping forward to 2013, Taylor was fresh from her breakup with Harry Styles. And the entire world was waiting to see what would unfold when the pair would come face to face for the first time since their split at the VMAs. First, this clip of Taylor appearing to say: "Shut the fuck up" as One Direction accepted an award for Best Summer Song went viral. But then, when Taylor won the award for Best Female Video, she appeared to make a blatant dig at Harry during her acceptance speech. Cut to Harry looking extremely awkward in the audience. Two years later, the 2015 VMA nominations caused a lot of drama between Taylor and Nicki Minaj. Taylor definitely took Nicki's tweet that way, because out of nowhere, she responded accusing Nicki of "pitting women against each other." Which led to Nicki retweeting this. Two days later, however, Taylor apologised. She took to Twitter to say: "I thought I was being called out. I missed the point, I misunderstood, then misspoke. I'm sorry, Nicki. @NICKIMINAJ." And Nicki accepted and appreciated the apology. Then, during the ceremony, as Nicki was midway through her performance Taylor Swift appeared out of nowhere And they finished the song together. Before sharing a hug. Oh, and midway through the 2015 ceremony Taylor dropped the video for "Wildest Dreams." Which became her first video to experience a massive backlash. But then, just as the dramatic night was ending, Taylor finally quashed her long-running feud with Kanye West by presenting him with the Video Vanguard Award. And she even made a joke about their 2009 encounter during the speech. There was lots of hugging! Everything was lovely! And afterwards she hung out with Kim! Then, a couple of days later, Kanye sent her flowers, she combined their names in a hashtag and it was clear they'd buried the hatchet once and for all. However, less than a year later, Famous-gate began and everything went to shit. But, think about it for a second. If it wasn't for the MTV VMAs, Kanye and Taylor never would have had a feud in the first place. That means we never would have lived through Famous-gate, or Taylor's long hiatus and we probably wouldn't have an album which so far appears to be a diss-record. So, will she bring the drama this year?
People Are Not Happy Because They Think Taylor Swift Is Ripping Off Beyoncé's "Lemonade"

Basically a recipe for disaster.
Last night Taylor Swift released the first single, "Look What You Made Me Do," from her album Reputation. The full video doesn't drop until the Video Music Awards on Sunday, but Swift posted a teaser to the video. Although you can only see a hint of the full clip, at least four different stills show her new ~Bad Taylor~ vibes. Swift is dressed in a black leotard surrounded by dancers, as well as biting on diamonds with bright red lips. While the album cover reminded people of visuals from Kanye West, people also said Swift seemed to be borrowing from the queen of the revenge album: Beyoncé. The dancers wearing leotards and black fishnets, lined up in a row under chandeliers in a mansion, drew instant comparisons to Beyoncé's iconic 2016 album Lemonade, specifically lead single "Formation." They compared and contrasted the images. And said she was using the same Southern Gothic visuals. Swift is even wearing a black leotard — a Beyoncé staple! Think of "Single Ladies!" She's also wearing fishnets, just like Ms. Knowles did during the 2016 Super Bowl halftime performance of "Formation." Many on Twitter complained it seems Swift is offering a watered-down version of Beyoncé's Grammy-winning album. People are now trolling Swift with some "white girl" clichés. They also found a lot of subpar lemon drink brands out there to compare her to... Or "sugar-free drink mixes." Or other basic white-girl drinks. Others are also noting that Swift seems to have put her black dancers to her left, and her white dancers to her right. They wonder, does Swift never learn? In conclusion, this is some people on Twitter rn:
Do You Know All The Lyrics To "Look What You Made Me Do"?
As you know, Taylor Swift's new single just dropped. It's called "Look What You Made Me Do" and it's a legit BOP. Since you've been listening to it on repeat, let's see how well you know the lyrics.
Dear America, I'm So Sorry But We All Must Support Taylor Swift

*Not sure that makes sense..but you get the point.

Note: Some of you don't understand that I'm in the middle of my "Mariah era." I'm a huge fan and grew up with "One Sweet Day." It's a gorgeous song with a gorgeous message. This isn't a dig at "Despacito," it's more that I love Mariah Carey and I want this for her legacy. It's a fan thing. Thank you and good night.
 


For the next seven days, we are ALL Taylor Swift fans. Mariah is a legend

Update: I made some slight changes to this post because some of it was coming across the wrong way. I don't won't anyone to misinterpret the post and I certainly don't want to project the wrong message.
Listen up, fellow Americans. This is a RED ALERT. There was a post on this yesterday, but there could never be enough posts on something so near and dear to our great nation. A few weeks ago, I reported that Mariah Carey was in jeopardy of losing her Billboard No. 1 record because of a certain "Despacito." And now, we're on death's doorstep. So, I'm making another damn BuzzFeed post on it because I FUCKING CARE. Repeat after me: Tonight at midnight we are all Taylor Swift fans. Why? WELL LISTEN UP, Mariah Carey has held the record for the longest running No. 1 single in the US for 20 years with "One Sweet Day." In 1997 it was No. 1 for 16 consecutive weeks. Now, "Despacito" is VERY close to breaking its record. It has been No. 1 for 15 weeks. I'm shivering. It's bleak, I know. But after weeks and weeks of "Despacito" being No. 1 we finally have hope. I never, EVER, thought I'd say this but America, Taylor Swift is our only hope. You see, the only thing that could knock a monster like "Despacito" from the top spot is Taylor Swift. Taylor can sell A LOT of singles and get a lot of radio play and that's exactly what we need. It's the final straw... ...our last resort... ...the whole kitten caboodle*! Regardless of your previous fan obligations, it's important that we all come together at this time to defend what is right and just about our great nation. That just and great thing is to protect "One Sweet Day" as our longest running No. 1. So call your mom. Reconnect with your neighbors. Hell, make a fake iTunes account for your dead grandma and have her buy the new Taylor single. It isn't voter fraud if it really matters. As they said in Field of Dreams, "If we buy it. The No. 1 will come." For the next seven days, we are ALL Taylor Swift fans. Mariah is a legend

People Are Hoping Taylor Swift's New Single Stops "Despacito" From Beating Mariah Carey's Hot 100 Record

A feat! Queen of Music! Legendary!
OK, here's the thing: Mariah Carey has held the record for the longest-running No. 1 single on the Billboard Hot 100 for more than TWENTY YEARS. That's right, back in 1996, Mariah Carey and Boyz II Men released "One Sweet Day," a touching ballad about love and loss, and it dominated the chart for an astounding 16 weeks. Fast forward to 2017 and it looks like the record set by Carey and Boyz II Men is in jeopardy as "Despacito" has now notched an impressive 15 weeks on the chart. The reggaeton-pop song by Luis Fonsi which features Daddy Yankee and Justin Bieber, needs one more week to tie with "One Sweet Day," and two more weeks to break the long-standing achievement set by Carey and Boyz II Men. Naturally, some Mariah fans are not into this... The lambs — what Mariah Carey fans are called collectively — are not here for it at all. And some have even tried to make peace with the fact that Carey's classic song could be dethroned. But some lambs have surmised that there could be one last hope to stop "Despacito" from dethroning "One Sweet Day" and that savior could possibly be Taylor Swift. As you may have heard, Swift recently announced that her new album, Reputation, would be coming out on Nov. 10. Swift will also be releasing a brand-new single tomorrow, as well. It's the hope of Mariah fans, along with other factions of #StanTwitter, that Swift's single will gain enough traction to stop "Despacito" from breaking Carey's record. Of course, people had jokes about it. Some stans are rallying around Swift's new music as a last attempt to save Mimi's chart legacy. Some say they will offer their coins (reluctantly, it seems) to assist Swift's potential domination. Prayer circles have formed. And some Carey fans seem pretty confident that Swift can swoop in and steal that coveted No. 1 spot from "Despacito." Could Swift be the key to ensuring "Despacito" finally falls? Only time will tell. One thing's for sure, though: The battle to see who sits atop the Hot 100 next week is going to be fierce.
People Have A Lot Things To Say About Taylor Swift's New Album Art
ICYMI, Taylor Swift just broke the internet with the news that she'll have a single out tomorrow and her new album, Reputation, is out on November 10. Here's the artwork: Of course, people already have A LOT to say about the image. Some people think it's completely brilliant: While others aren't really loving it so much: There's also been a bunch of tweets pointing out that many artists before Taylor have had a similar concept: But, mostly, a lot of people just have some lighthearted and hilarious commentary about the *inspiration* behind the whole thing: Love it or hate it, get used to it — it's pretty much the only thing you'll see on the internet all day.
Taylor Swift Just Eclipsed The Eclipse And People Are Freaking Out

Since Taylor has quite literally eclipsed the eclipse, people are writing perfect tweets about it and I am totally HERE FOR IT. Here are some of the best ones:
People Think Taylor Swift's Going To Take On Fake News With Her New Album

The first single is set to drop Aug. 24.
 
Some of the "T"s in her name are evocative of the New York Times logo. And those sideways "Taylor Swifts" look very New York Post.
Taylor Swift just announced her new album, Reputation. It's her first album in three years, her sixth ever — and it comes out Nov. 10, 2017. She also released an image that many are assuming is the album cover for Reputation. It features Swift staring straight into the camera, with newsprint bearing her name all around her. In the wake of the announcement and the release of the image, many took to social media to hypothesize that Swift is tying herself to the national conversation around "fake news." A lot of people had the same joke. Some people also theorized that Swift, who has not stated publicly who she voted for, might be a Donald Trump supporter. The pop star was largely silent about politics during the 2016 election, except for a now-deleted Instagram post urging people to "go out and VOTE." Some blamed Swift's silence during the election for the way things turned out. While others just straight-up compared Swift to Trump. That Nov. 10 release date also gave people some chills. Really, there is just so much to unpack here.
23 Taylor Swift Deleted Tweets That Prove She's Actually Pretty Funny
That time she told Demi Lovato she could smell like a rotting corpse. That time she was deep inside the womb of a cat. The time she battled addiction. That time she made a good point about packaging. That time she taunted Brad Paisley with his own song (he has a song called "Little Moments"). That time she broke the curtains. That time she broke the car. That time she got stuck in traffic. That time she was reading a hotel shampoo bottle. That time she had food all over her face. That time she made a good point about hair ties. That time she tried to pay in shells. That time she broke her remote control. That time she made a b'day wish. That time she discovered nature's pepper spray. That time she exposed the month of October. That time she was basically Lady Gaga. That time she googled frogs. That time she basically told her cat to smile. That time she wasn't building a castle. That time she was jet-lagged. That time she was concerned for viral video stars. And that time she was both 80 and 5 at the same time.
Uh, Taylor Swift Fans Are Incredible Detectives And I Am Shook

It looks like some kind of snake/dragon thing? Who knows????? Imagine being THIS EXTRA, what a goddamn queen.
 
Honestly, we've been thinking that this would be a significant date for a while, as it lines up with her history of late August single releases. But here's confirmation!
 
Also, her official page has one fewer viewable video than what's listed. These hidden videos HAVE to be new music videos, right?!
 
That award ceremony was where Taylor and her ex Calvin Harris really connected for the first time. And it's highly likely we'll get at least one Tayvin song on TS6. 👀
 
Wow, just like that SNAKE in the video which was in SHADOW.
 
However, this kind of stuff pops up all the time and is almost certainly fake, or at least not worth getting to excited over yet. The website timeless.com has also launched, with a title saying "coming soon", but this is also not at all verified. It was registered in 2005, according to a commenter on ONTD.
 
Tweet me if you think I missed anything!
I think it's fair to say that Taylor Swift fans are... passionate. When her social media pages went dark over the weekend, fans went wild coming up with theories about her new album. One of them was that it would have something to do with the solar eclipse. And lo and behold, just as the eclipse was about to get underway in the US, Taylor tweeted and Instagrammed this mysterious video. Some fans think that she'll drop at least two more videos to make up the full body of the snake/dragon/creature. Also, at one point her website changed from black, to white, to black again. Almost like... AN ECLIPSE. Taylor fans have been collecting even more evidence, despite the fact all we have is a 10 second video of... something. Fans quickly found a "2" and a "5" hidden in the snake's skin, leading them to believe that new music will be dropped this Friday, August 25th. Then Tumblr users wildestgiraffe and shiftyswiift turned their focus to Taylor's Vevo YouTube account. It lists 77 videos, but only 73 are visible. And while some casual observers seem to think the creature in the video is a snake, a lot of people are thinking that it could actually be a dragon. As Twitter user @marleyharper pointed out, it's like the dragon on this dress that Taylor wore to the Brit awards in 2015. For those following the snake theory: Did you know that during an eclipse, there is a light phenomenon called "shadow snakes"? Aaaand Taylor was born in the Chinese year of the Snake. There are also theories floating around that her first single will be called "Timeless". This stems from a song named "Timeless" being "registered" under her name on a music publishing site. Anyway, I'll just be sitting here all day overanalysing literally everything I find on the internet!
Taylor Swift Just Broke Her Social Media Silence And People Are Shaking

I'm not saying that these two things are connected but THEY MIGHT BE CONNECTED?
 
(I MEAN, IT'S 99.3% LIKELY THAT IT IS, RIGHT???)
HELLO, LAST WEEK TAYLOR SWIFT DELETED EVERYTHING OFF ALL OF HER SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTS AND I KNOW YOU KNOW THIS SO LET'S MOVE ON. People of course immediately began theorising that Taylor was about to return to social media in A Big Way, namely by releasing the album we've waited THREE WHOLE YEARS FOR. Of course, the first thing I did when this happened was set up a tweet alert for @taylorswift13 because I'm EXTRA!!! AND SHE JUST TWEETED FOR THE FIRST TIME AND IT JUST LOOKS LIKE IT'S A BLURRY VIDEO OF A SNAKE TAIL??? Let's all remember that, just over a year ago, Taylor's Instagram was spammed with the snake emoji after drama surrounding her, Calvin Harris, Kim Kardashian, Kanye West, Katy Perry, and seemingly everyone on the entire celebrity planet. Guys, I cannot control my emotions here. I'm too excited. I'm going to explode. The Swifties™ are quaking in their 2008-era cowboy boots. Here's the video again, so you can analyse whether this is ~connected~ to the snake emoji fiasco: Either way, people are READY for dark-era Taylor. OK BYE GONNA GO THEORISE OVER THIS FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.
Taylor Swift Just Announced Her New Album And I AM NOT OKAY

I am not calm.
🚨 Hello and welcome. Today at 12:39 p.m. ET, the world stood completely still. Taylor Alison Swift, finally after three long years, announced her BRAND-NEW ALBUM, Reputation. 🚨 Taylor took to social media to reveal that the first single will be out tomorrow night, with the album arriving Nov. 10. And while we had to agonizingly wait all week for the impending announcement as she released cryptic snake videos, it is finally here. 2017 can officially start. Life has begun anew. Naturally, when she revealed the new music, fans (aka me) completely lost their damn minds. Some were brought to a very fragile emotional state. Some were proud as hell of her new era's direction. But mostly, everyone was peak living-their-best-damn-lives because our queen and savior is back with new music — and girlfriend is back with a damn vengeance.

Hello and welcome to the TS6 era. In case you've been living under a rock, our queen and savior Taylor Swift has been causing social media hysteria for the past five days. Let's recap, shall we? Friday, she had a complete and total social media blackout. Yesterday, she surprise-dropped a 10-second muted video of some sort of reptile creature. And today, around 11 a.m. ET once again, she released another cryptic slithering video. No one knows what the hell is going on, but we all had a lot damn thoughts about it. Here are a few tweets that'll have you saying "yes, same, me" etc. In conclusion, this is me for the foreseeable future:

Get ready, folks: A new Taylor Swift era is officially upon us. After wiping her social media accounts last Friday... ...and then slithering back into our timelines and feeds with videos of a coiled snake... ...Taylor finally confirmed our suspicions on Wednesday: A new single and a new album are on their way. Let's break it down. 🚨 First and most importantly, we get new music TOMORROW NIGHT! 🚨 And by tomorrow night, she means at 12:01 a.m. EST on Friday, according to her rep. As for the title, some fans think it'll be called "Timeless"... ...and there's quite a bit of evidence to back it up. Now back to the facts! The full album — called Reputation — won't drop until Nov. 10, but there's always a chance we'll get more singles before then. And, perhaps most shockingly, here's what the *album* art will look like: Will Reputation be dark? Will it be vengeful? Will it be a whole new sound from Taylor? Only ~time~ will tell!
Taylor Swift Is Revealing Her New, Darker Image And People Are Into It

Basically, it all comes down to a bunch of drama between Taylor and Calvin Harris, Taylor and Katy Perry, Taylor and Kanye West, and Taylor and Kim Kardashian. But if you want a full breakdown of snake-gate, please see this post, because I don't have the energy to go through this a second time.
SO. If you've missed the screaming for the last 48 hours, Taylor Swift has made her return to the world in a big way since completely wiping all her social media accounts last week. It all kicked off on Monday, when she posted this mysterious video of what looked like a snake tail, but nobody was sure, and everybody was confused AF. Swifties the world over immediately donned their detective hats, zooming in on videos to prove various points and debating what the creature could ~actually~ be, because goddammit, sometimes it's fun to be extra. But, guys, she just dropped the third mystery video and we now have one solid piece of the puzzle to cling onto and desperately theorise over: IT'S A SNAKE. This is currently what Tay's Instagram account (and Facebook cover photo) looks like. And I think we can safely say that this means Taylor is reclaiming the negative snake imagery she's been bombarded with for the last year-and-a-bit. Ever since it became apparent that Taylor was posting snakey videos all over social media, her fans have been totally living for it, praising her for ~reclaiming the snake~. She's basically taken all the insults and hate that have been thrown at her for the last year, and turned it completely around on her haters. This isn't the first time she's done that: After years of being called a "serial dater" by the media, Taylor released "Blank Space", a song written from the perspective of a love-crazed woman who dates men just to torture them for fun. But since she seemed to fall off the face of the Earth after all the drama last year, and fans have been waiting not-so-patiently for her reappearance ever since, people have been loving the new snake-y image even more. YOUR 👏🏻 FAVE 👏🏻 COULD 👏🏻 NEVER 👏🏻 Basically, Swifties can't wait for Taylor to go full Medusa. And now they have even more evidence to help with their investigative pursuits. IT IS OFFICIALLY THE YEAR OF THE SNAKELOR. DON'T TRY TO RESIST.
Taylor Swift Fans Think This Greeting Card Contains New Lyrics From Her Album
You probably know that in the past week, Taylor Swift has wiped her social media and then tweeted cryptic videos of a snake or dragon. Since her fans are literal detectives, there have been multiple theories about the new album. This one says that American Greetings cards is involved in #TS6 (her sixth album). For one, American Greetings and Taylor have worked together for years now to make her signature greeting cards. Secondly, according to a fan, Taylor's Facebook page "liked" "American Greetings" after her social media blackout. Then, American Greetings posted this: NOTICE IT HAS 13 WORDS!!! "It feels like we crossed paths at exactly the right time and place." It does sound like a Taylor Swift lyric.. ANNDD...when you search it in Google, it's not a quote or lyric from someone. Swifties obviously think this is linked to TS6. Also, let's just look at what time American Greetings posted it. 11 a.m. — aka the same time Taylor posted her first snake/dragon teaser: And on what date? The 18th! AKA THREE YEARS EXACTLY AFTER "SHAKE IT OFF" was announced as the FIRST 1989 SINGLE. American Greetings, I'm onto you. We're all onto you.
Info On Taylor Swift's Next Album May Have Been Written In Code On Her Website This Whole Time

So, maybe the single's called "That's What You Don't See," as like a "Shake It Off" Part II?? Maybe this website is just a fan-made site?? Who knows??
On Friday, Taylor Swift wiped all of her social media. Which could only mean one thing: Obviously, the social media blackout is making people look for clues — ESPECIALLLLLY considering Taylor is the queen of clues and cryptology. Well, Reddit user row101 may have just uncovered a code on her website. Row101 says that the code on Taylor's site reads, "uibut xibu uifz epou tff." And when you subtract one letter from each, this is what you get: OMG. The Twitter account "Taylor Swift News" also posted this screenshot: So, this could be a) the name of a new single, b) the name of a new album, c) a reference to the "Shake It Off" lyrics, or d) a hoax perpetuated by a bunch of very creative fans. Some fans can see this code playing a part in TS6. This fan has a theory that TS6 will incorporate Monday's eclipse and the code: Right now, her website is completely down, so it's hard to verify... ...However, when you go on "thatswhatyoudontsee.com," this is what you see:

Someone Just Rickrolled The Shit Out Of Taylor Swift Fans And It's Low-Key Hilarious

^Live footage from my own Instagram story. I was *convinced*.
 
Fuckin' Rick Astley, man.
 
I'M HONESTLY TRIGGERED RIGHT NOW.
Ever since Taylor Swift revealed that her new single is dropping tonight, fans have been on high alert. So when a kind of legit-looking site with a countdown clock started making the rounds, people (myself included) started freaking out that the single was dropping early: As the clock counted down to zero, the anxiety was building. The hype was real. I refreshed the page and... suddenly had a flashback to 2007 because some evil genius had just RICKROLLED US ALL. Remember Rickrolling? It was a prank from a simpler time, when friends would send you video links and they would lead you to the 1987 Rick Astley song "Never Gonna Give You Up" instead of whatever you actually wanted to listen to: People had a lot of different reactions to the epic pranking. Some were annoyed: Some were convinced that Taylor herself was behind the whole thing: But, mostly, people thought it was a hilarious prank by some genius with a lot of time on their hands: MORAL OF THE STORY: TRUST NO ONE.
These Possible Hidden Meanings In Taylor Swift's Album Announcement Are Wild

Following a week of clues that involved her purging her social media accounts and then releasing a series of short videos that combined to reveal an angry snake, Taylor has now revealed that the album is called Reputation and will be released on 10 November.
 
As a result, many fans have gone into overdrive, spotting and analysing several potential hidden meanings in the album's name, release date, and cover art alone. Let's get to it.
 
It could be coincidence, but then consider the fact that three years is the longest ever duration between Taylor Swift albums. It's likely she would've wanted to mark this in some ~complex~ way.
 
So, perhaps this could mean that she will get political on the album?!
 
"Blank Space" was written as a rebuttal to the media, who Taylor claimed presented her as a "serial dater".
Yesterday, Taylor Swift finally unveiled the name of her new album, its cover art, and the release date. She also revealed that the lead single will drop later today. Now, nothing Taylor Swift does is coincidental. This is a woman who, by her own admission, is obsessed with details. What's more, her albums always come with secret hidden messages in the liner notes. First up, there's more to the release date than first meets the eye. We all know that Taylor is obsessed with the number 13. And the album's release date is 11/10/2017. If you add each single digit together, guess what you get. And if you subtract the release date from the announcement date, the result is 13 there too. But by far the most insane bit of arithmetic comes when you calculate the number of days between 1989's release date and Reputation's. Taylor may have come up with the concept for the artwork three years ago. During her 1989 world tour, she always gave a speech before her performance of "Clean". The speeches varied in wording, but the premise remained the same: Be strong during hard times. And just LOOK at one of the lines she delivered during the speech in Sydney. The font choice is interesting to say the least. It bears more than a passing resemblance to the font Kanye West used for his Saint Pablo tour merchandise, leading to a lot of speculation that she's shading Kanye and Kim Kardashian. In fact, there is a font in existence called "I Feel Like Pablo" that looks almost identical to the font of Reputation. Some people think Taylor's use of the font as well as the snake – the word that became synonymous with her in the wake of her feud with Kimye – means that the whole album could contain diss tracks for not just Kimye but also Calvin Harris and Katy Perry. HOWEVER, other people have pointed out that the font also looks very like the one the New York Times uses. Now, Donald Trump has slated the New York Times repeatedly since his presidency began. And one of the enduring criticisms of Taylor over the past year was that, unlike many other celebrity feminists, she failed to express any political opinion in the run-up to the election or after the result. Either that, or she's alluding to his mantra of "fake news" and applying it to herself – suggesting that the portrayal of her in the media is inaccurate. As a result, people think the album will be a takedown of the media. People have suggested that the tight choker Taylor's wearing in the image is a visual representation of her being "strangled by the hate". And that her ripped clothes represent her being "torn apart". People also think that the fact only half her face is obscured by headlines is indicative of no one really knowing "the truth" about her. They've also drawn attention to the way in which Taylor is exposing her whole face on the artwork for the first time since her debut release. Taking it as a sign of defiance. Add to this the fact that Reputation will be released exactly three years after "Blank Space" – another takedown of the media – came out. And even if it's not a takedown, people think Taylor is on the verge of "reclaiming the reputation defined for her by the media". However, Perez Hilton then threw a curveball by tweeting this. Which is very interesting if we interpret the snake not as a symbol of her hitting back at her haters but as an animal that periodically sheds it skin, emerging stronger, larger, and healthier. Some might say they're...reborn. 😎 Could Taylor's social media purge last week have been a way of her deleting the past, shedding her skin for a New Taylor to emerge and build a brand new reputation? It could make sense given that the final track on 1989 was "Clean", – a song about letting go of the past and moving on. Will Taylor pick up where she left off? Who knows, but we will be finding out very soon.

This Is Why Taylor Swift Releases Her Albums When She Does

What does this mean? Is the pop star trying to tell us who she voted for? Is this her take on the "fake news" media, as some people on Twitter have speculated?
 
To be considered for a Grammy nomination, an artist must release their song, record, or album during the "product eligibility period," which usually runs from Oct. 1 through Sept. 30 of the following year. So, for example: "Shake It Off" arrived on Aug. 18, 2014, and earned Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best Pop Solo Performance Grammy nominations in 2015. Its album 1989 was released on Oct. 27, 2014, and yielded three Grammy wins — including Album of the Year — in 2016.So Swift's Reputation album won't qualify for the next Grammy Awards, but she might try to rack up some album nominations for 2019. As for that single she's dropping tomorrow night? That will qualify for the 2018 Grammys.
 
Take it from her pal and fellow artist, Ed Sheeran, who guessed that she might release her next album around the holidays."Taylor [Swift] isn't going to be releasing until probably the end of this year—Christmas is the smartest time to release because that's when everyone buys records," he told BBC earlier this year.Remember: 1989's first week on shelves was the largest sales week for an album since 2002 (with 1.287 million units sold); by the end of the year, it logged more than 3.6 million album and album-equivalent sales, according to Nielsen Music. That's a lot of stocking stuffers.
 
Unless you're Beyoncé, any album released between mid-November and New Years Day likely won't make any year-end lists. Music journalists have lives too, y'know.



As it turns out, that's one of the BEST times to release an album. Here are some possible reasons why the singer has such a soft spot for ~the fall~.

By now, you've probably heard the news: Taylor Swift will release her next album, Reputation, on Nov. 10, 2017. She's also dropping its first single tomorrow night. Of course, Swifties everywhere collectively lost their minds, but many people are also scrutinizing the album's release date, which falls around the one-year anniversary of the election of Donald Trump. But it's unlikely Reputation's release date has anything to do with current events. In fact, Swift has released ALL of her albums — from her debut, Taylor Swift, to 1989 — in either late October or early November. As it turns out, that's one of the BEST times to release an album. Here are some possible reasons why the singer has such a soft spot for ~the fall~. 1. She's all about those Grammys. 2. Swift knows people are more inclined to buy albums during the holidays. 3. Many outlets begin publishing their "Best of" and year-end recap lists in December. So an October or November release gets out ahead of those — while also keeping the set fresh in mind. The extra exposure never hurts. In a nutshell, Taylor Swift albums are released when they are — at least in part — as a savvy, strategic business move, helping with the longevity of a music release.
Taylor Swift's Snake Drama As Explained By Someone Who Literally Just Learned About It Today

*Actual footage of me arriving at Buzzfeed my first day.*
 
He then went on to tell us how the sky is blue and water is wet.
 
An actual screenshot from my laptop like 20 seconds ago.
 
And yet I literally had no idea about any of this.
 
Well, I will diddly darned.
 
Is this from a Sorkin screenplay bc omg.
 
You see, it says "TS6IsComing" because this is Taylor Swift's 6th album.
Hello, I'm an 89-year-old woman trapped in the body of a 26-year-old woman also known as Allie. While I'm a huge fan of all things pop culture, I'm not too ~hip to the jive~ on celebs and their various feuds. However, as of this week, I've noticed a lot of people talking about Taylor Swift? And snakes? And somehow Katy Perry and Kim Kardashian West are involved? So I spent my day doing a little reading and got all caught up. Let me break this down for those of you who also go to bed before 9:00pm. This is Taylor Swift. Taylor is a very popular musical artist who used to be a country singer, but is now a pop superstar with a new album about to drop. Taylor had some drama back in 2009 when Kanye "Who decided to sit me by the stairs" West interrupted her MTV Video Music Awards speech to proclaim Beyoncé the greatest of all time. Tay-Tay and Kanye had a few years of silence on the subject, before the two made up and all seemed peaceful in pop-land. In the meantime, Taylor busied herself with another feud, this time with Katy Perry. According to my ~research~ they were definitely buds at one point. But now they've got Bad Blood, all because GET THIS three of Taylor's back-up dancers left in the middle of her 2013 tour to go join Katy's tour. And the two have been pretty vocally feuding ever since. SO THEN, last year Kanye referenced Swift in his tune Famous with the lyric: "I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex/ I made that bitch famous." T-Swizzle stated she did NOT approve this line, while Kanye claimed he DID receive her blessing before recording the song. And this all came to a slithering stop when Kayne's main squeeze, THE Kim K, shared a snapchat video of Kanye asking for Taylor's permission, and her appearing to enthusiastically give it. And thus, with a video and a tweet, Kim started the birth of the snake movement with fans FLOODING Taylor's Social Media with snake emojis. Like...there were a lot of snakes guys. Indiana Jones would've been shook FR. So that's pretty much where we are now, with many fans believing Tay has reclaimed the snake for her new album's imagery because of these cryptic AF promos. And Kim K is getting a taste of her own ~snake oil~ with Swifty's fans returning the favor. Fans also believe that she may kiss and make up with Katy at this weekend's MTV Video Music Awards. So yeah, now I know and I can once again participate in water cooler conversations with the other youths.
Taylor Swift Might Be Shading Kanye West And Kim Kardashian With Her New Album Cover

You might recall commenters spamming her posts with the snake emoji following Kim Kardashian exposing her via Snapchat on "National Snake Day."
 
Could she be going after Kim, Kanye West, or Katy Perry? *Pops popcorn*
 
This could be a coincidence — but really, when it comes to Taylor Swift, is ANYTHING coincidental? Say what you will about her, but she's a PR mastermind and thinks out every move she makes. My guess is this font choice was intentional — there's a bunch of other font options she could have picked (like something more tabloid-y), but this is the one she chose.
 
Mert Alas is a pretty famous celebrity photographer — he recently shot Angelina Jolie for her big Vanity Fair cover story. He's ALSO pretty good friends with Kanye West and Kim Kardashian West, which makes choosing him pretty slick on Taylor's part.While he and Taylor *have* worked together before (he shot her Vogue cover last year), she could have handpicked any photographer in the WORLD for her album cover. The fact she chose the one photographer in the world who is closely associated with Kim and Kanye feels pretty significant.
 
Let's just say Taylor looks very different than she has in the past on this album cover. Yes, she seems to get a new haircut every album cycle. And her style has evolved over time! But her choices this time around feel very...deliberate.The slicked-back, wet hair look is one Kim has famously rocked before (I'm not saying it's Kim's, or that Kim was the one to first make it popular — just that it's one closely associated with her). Taylor's sweatshirt and choker also are very different fashion choices for the pop star. I could *TOTALLY* see Kim rocking this look, and it almost looks like an ad for Kanye's Yeezy line. FWIW, I checked to see if the sweatshirt is ACTUALLY Yeezy and wasn't able to confirm...but wouldn't that be WILD if it was?
Unless you're living under a rock, you know that today's the day: Squad enthusiast Taylor Swift has announced that new music is coming. We get a lead single this FRIDAY, and then her latest album, Reputation, drops on Nov. 10. Taylor also shared the album cover with us. Pretty cool, right? But upon further inspection (and because this is Taylor Swift, after all), there's more to the cover than meets the eye. Let's take a deeper look, shall we? First of all, some context. We know a major theme of Taylor's new music will be resetting her narrative — and reclaiming the snake emoji that has been used against her. She's been uploading cryptic snake videos to social media, and with a title like Reputation, it's clear Taylor is not just here to reclaim an emoji (I can't believe that's a phrase I just typed) — she's here to clap back at the narrative used against her. First of all, let's look at the font used on the album cover. At first, it seems like an obvious choice — the "Reputation" looks like a newspaper masthead, which fits the media-themed album cover. But there's more. It *also* seems the font is very, very similar to — although perhaps not the *EXACT* same as — the one Kanye West used for his infamous merchandise during his Life of Pablo era. Hmmmmm... Taylor's choice of photographer is also definitely interesting. Famed photographers Mert & Marcus (Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott) are credited with shooting Reputation's cover. And that's kind of a big deal, considering who Mert Alas is friends with. The last piece of evidence might be a *bit* of a reach, so be sure you stretch with me before I dive in. I'm pretty sure Taylor's aesthetic/look on the album cover is meant to evoke Kim's sense of style and Kanye's Yeezy fashion sense. (FWIW, I'm not alone in this analysis.) So that's what we've got: a font, a photographer, and an aesthetic. Is Taylor coming for blood this era? We'll know soon enough...
Taylor Swift Is Seemingly Reclaiming The Snake, But Will It Work?

Swift's camp claimed credit for the song after the two split (the song was rumored to also have been the source of the breakup). This caused the pop producer to go on a Twitter rant against her — invoking the name of Swift rival Katy Perry, and accusing Swift of trying to "tear" him down. People who sided with Harris started spamming Swift's Instagram comments with the snake emoji. (Harris has since revealed regret for his tweets.)
 
Earlier in the year, Swift had condemned the lyrics, calling them misogynistic; after hinting at "Famous" during her speech at the Grammys, West claimed she'd approved the lyrics. Kardashian seemed to be claiming via her Snapchat post that Swift had heard the lyrics in full and approved of them.
 
Again, people began spamming Swift's social media accounts and posts about Swift with the snake. The green coil has continued to pop up around Swift, including when she ran the risk of stealing Perry's thunder earlier this summer.
 
Of course, Taylor Swift isn't the beginning and of the 🐍 — and she's not the first to have had it used against her in a big public arena. NBA Kings coach George Karl has a history of being called a snake in the grass, and according to Google data, usage of the snake emoji was at an all-time high during the summer of 2015 — when that really ramped up for him.
 
Is the snake a symbol of her or her mistakes? Will she turn the snake on haters/media/men that she says don't understand her? Is it a sign that she's addressing the snake in the room and may put one of her biggest feuds behind her during the VMAs?
 
Power doesn't always come from being the relatable one.
Taylor Swift is no stranger to the snake emoji (🐍). In fact, since July 2016, it's partly defined her. It was around then that a dispute arose between the singer and her ex-boyfriend, Calvin Harris, over songwriter credit for Harris's hit "This Is What You Came For," featuring Rihanna. Then, a few days later, Kim Kardashian took to her Snapchat, posting video of a conversation between Swift and Kardashian's husband, Kanye West, that seemed to show Swift approving of West referencing her in his now-infamous song "Famous." Swift refuted the implication of Kardashian's post that she had heard and approved of his "that bitch" lyric and attempted to ~exclude herself from the narrative~. But it didn't quite work out like that. Her name became so connected to the snake emoji that her own fanbase even tried to reclaim the symbol on National Snake Day 2017. For much of 2017, Swift has been lying fairly low. Earlier this month, a jury sided with Swift and her claim that a DJ groped her without her consent in 2013; she took the stand during the trial. There were also the social media shoutouts to her friends, a rumored incident with a suitcase (that has now been retracted), and a pre-Super Bowl concert. But now she seems to be back — with a largely wiped social media presence that she is slowly refilling with images of what appear to be SNAKES. The snake has left fans reeling, with theory...after theory...after theory —
 about what it means for her sixth studio album, her feud with Perry, and, of course, her public image in general. It's all very overwhelming. No one really knows anything until the moment Taylor Swift and her team DECIDE they want us to know something. But that doesn't mean there's not plenty to talk about. For the past year, the snake emoji has been used a lot in association with Swift. Google Trends data shows a 46% increase in use of the snake emoji overall in July 2016. But the snake emoji is a somewhat helpful tracker for Taylor Swift movements — much like the lemon emoji 🍋 for Beyonce: Despite their different connotations, these little images have become shorthand when talking about the artists. This phenomenon is reminiscent of a recent quote from Swift's court testimony this month. "I have a new and uncanny ability to elicit new types [of] criticism," she said. With her 2014 album 1989, Swift addressed the public's perception of her with songs and music videos like "Shake It Off" and "Blank Space." So it would make a lot of sense if the (supposed) snakes appearing on her social media accounts were a direct reference to the prevailing symbol attached to her over the past year. Perhaps, like her fans on National Snake Day, Swift may be trying to reclaim, adopt, co-opt, embrace, or appropriate the snake. That leaves a couple of major questions. One is: How? As in, what methods will she use? What will the music sound like, and what will the content be? Another question is: Can she pull it off? The tide turned hard against Taylor Swift last year, there is no denying that. Some stans stayed true to her, some jumped ship. The tenor of conversation around the singer changed palpably, and the image of the snake helped to shape that. There are different benchmarks for "pulling it off," of course. There's the question of how much music she sells; how many awards she could win; how critics and fans will receive her new sounds. And Swift has never not been a powerhouse when it comes to selling music. Then there's public image, which is a whole other beast. Swift doesn't necessarily have to be well-liked to be successful. Music history is full of figures who eventually shrugged off likability, and instead banked other self-image branding. Like — ironically — Kanye West himself. Swift's cryptic video posts don't give us much to go on. But they do seem to indicate that she's very aware of where she stands with the public. And they also seem to indicate that she's ready to use that — in whatever form that takes. No matter what, it looks like Swift is gearing up for something new. Get ready. CORRECTION UPDATE
Did This Twitter Account Just Accidentally Reveal The Name Of Taylor Swift's New Song?

WHEW.
 
Now, we don't know for sure if it's connected to Taylor — it could be fan made, or it could be totally unrelated to new music from the singer. But it seems AWFULLY suspicious.
 
FWIW, an entry doesn't necessarily mean anything — it could be fake! But it's still to be presented as evidence.
 
The tweet has since been deleted...probably because Taylor doesn't want to reveal the official title just yet.
As you probably know, straight icon Taylor Swift is about to drop new music. We've written about how she purged her social media accounts, how she's been posting cryptic videos of serpents, how her fans are giving us serious Nancy Drew vibes, and even how this greeting card might have new lyrics from her album. But sit down and shut up because we've got even more tea about Taylor's new music. Sip sip! First of all, we're seeing a LOT of reports the new song — or potentially a whole album — is coming Friday (August 25). Variety is reporting it, Us Weekly is reporting it, basically the only one who isn't reporting it is my grandma. Hell, even Taylor herself has pretty much confirmed it. Fans have pointed out that if you look in the scales of the serpent in the two cryptic videos she's uploaded these past two days, you can sort of make out some numbers — 8, 2, and 5, or 8/25 — as in this Friday. So great: We've got an (alleged) release date. But what is the song CALLED?! That, my friends, is a tougher nut to crack. One thing we DO know is that the concept of TIME seems to be critical to Taylor's new music. You can read more about that theory here. So that's why this mysterious website, timeless.com, has nothing but a "Coming Soon" banner on its homepage. Fans began circling around this page right around the time she started uploading snake videos to her social media pages. Swifties fueled the rumors by pointing out music website Genius allegedly confirmed the name of the song as well. But the most crucial evidence might be from Vevo Australia's Twitter feed. In a since-deleted tweet, the account stated, "No words #Timeless" and included a link to Taylor's first snake video! THERE'S OUR CLUE! Of course, we (probably) won't have to theorize about potential new music much longer. We'll probably be bopping to new music by Friday (HOPEFULLY WITH A SURPRISE VMAs APPEARANCE WITH KATY PERRY THIS WEEKEND), and then we'll know just how TIMELESS her new song really is. Until then...keep digging up evidence, Swifties!
People Are Saying Katy Perry Totally Copied Taylor Swift's "Bad Blood" Video
So, Katy Perry just revealed on Twitter that she's releasing the music video for her song "Swish Swish" this week and shared a little teaser... And, well, I'm just going to cut to the chase — it seems pretty fucking similar to Taylor Swift's "Bad Blood" video. I mean...here's Katy's: And here's that promo from Taylor's back in 2015: Like, Katy even used the word CATASTROPHE, which was Taylor's "Bad Blood" character. Anyways, people started dragging Katy because of the similarities: And questioning Katy's "inspiration" for her new video... But some people still think it's all just an elaborate ruse and Katy and Taylor are planning something together:
Taylor Swift Fans Have Gone Into Overdrive With This "Eclipse" Theory

We're all pretty much in agreement that it means her new, long-overdue album will be dropping soon.
 
There were a lot of tiny hints: She wore star temporary tattoos to Drake's birthday party, the promo material for her Super Bowl show featured stars, a guitar she used at the show had stars on it, she decorated Lorde's birthday card with stars, and she wore a few outfits featuring stars.
 
Taylor's lucky number is 13, and she incorporates it into a lot of things.
 
(Tbh, she has been using this theme since 2015 but WHATEVER.)
 
But also, I am very easily convinced by nonsense, and it's surprising that I've lived for 25 years and haven't yet been recruited into a cult.
 
AND I AM LIVING.
I'm sure you didn't miss this, but over the weekend everyone's fave (even if you won't admit it) Taylor Swift deleted everything off her social media accounts. Fans (including myself), have gone into overdrive, coming up with theories and finding tiny shreds of evidence about what kind of music we're in store for. And one of the main theories we've all been talking about? Space. Even as far back as six months ago, fans were theorising that stars would be a part of her new album's theme. Also, this Insta post from Kesha last year sparked rumours and theories that the Grammy-winning artist she collab-ed with was Taylor. Her caption includes 13 emojis and has three different types of stars. When Taylor began her social media "blackout", a lot of people jumped on this truly INCREDIBLE theory that her new album would be called Eclipse. Like, literally EVERY colour on her Tumblr theme is somehow related to space. People also looked to the Instagram of Scott Borchetta, the founder of Taylor's record label, Big Machine Label Group. The time on the clock in this photo he posted last month lines up with the time that the eclipse will be most visible. It was announced this week that a random teenage billionaire is putting a Taylor Swift CD on a NASA ship heading into SPACE next year. Last week Kenny Chesney announced that his new album would feature a recording of a duet he did with Taylor titled... "Big Star". TBH, I personally do not buy the whole ~Eclipse~ thing because of the Twilight connotations. But I am 100% wholeheartedly into the stars and space theory. Basically I don't know what's happening, but this is the whole Taylor fandom right now:
What People Said About Taylor Swift 10 Years Ago Is Making Me Laugh
All of the following are real tweets from the early days of Twitter aka 2007 and 2008. It was a different time.

Basically everyone thinks it's a snake. "SNAKE! SNAKE!" They screamed at their computer screens.

These speculations made me question everything I thought I knew about scales/snakes/things with no arms and legs. So I decided to ask an expert.

I reached out to Dr. Sara Ruane, an assistant professor at Rutgers, who is an Herpetologist and has been studying the subject since she was five years old. First I asked her about the ~creature~ in the videos. This is what she had to say:


  {
    "id": 11679380
  }

Both of them seem like they may be computer generated animations of something sort of like a squamate (the taxonomic group that includes lizards and snakes). I think they are cgi based on how they move, which isn't especially realistic to real snakes.

Ah ha! So, um, yeah, the thing is probably CGI. I guess that's not THAT shocking, but Dr. Ruane went on, saying something that did shock me. Maybe it's not a snake at all...but...a lizard!!!!

"The first one I saw (the darker looking clip) really reminds me more of a lizard tail than any snake, as the scales lay in a way that isn't how snake scales lay. It's more in line with lizards that have long, spiny tails"

This "guess" is the snake I mentioned above, it shows a picture of an Atheris (bush viper). This is NOT not known as a Javan tubercle snake. The Javan tubercle snake is a snake called Xenodermus javanicus...which is known more commonly as a dragon snake and does have weird scales, but not anything like the Swifty posting, and not anything like Atheris which is the photo shown on that twitter post. So that guess sort of hits the right photo of similar looking snakes but not the right name for it.

Ok so, unless you're literally Brendan Fraser in Blast From The Past, then by now you know that Taylor Swift has been uploading some glitchy cryptic videos of a scaly creature slithering about. This is one: This is another: Basically everyone thinks it's a snake. "SNAKE! SNAKE!" They screamed at their computer screens. I mean, it makes sense. It seems like it could be a snake...after all it's slithering! But I wondered to myself, what kind of snake??? WHAT KIND?!?!??! Some people took guesses as to what it was because everyone on the internet is a detective (including myself, clearly). This person said it's a Javan Tubercle Snake. And another said it was a Viper. These speculations made me question everything I thought I knew about scales/snakes/things with no arms and legs. So I decided to ask an expert. I reached out to Dr. Sara Ruane, an assistant professor at Rutgers, who is an Herpetologist and has been studying the subject since she was five years old. First I asked her about the ~creature~ in the videos. This is what she had to say: Ah ha! So, um, yeah, the thing is probably CGI. I guess that's not THAT shocking, but Dr. Ruane went on, saying something that did shock me. Maybe it's not a snake at all...but...a lizard!!!! Ah ha again! Dr. Ruane continued, "There are many genera Takydromas, Sceloporus, Uromastyx, and Cordylus to name a few." She continued to say that "the other clip has some similarities with a snake genus called Atheris (African bush vipers), which have these scales that are not totally flat on the body, similar to the clip. Since these videos are so grainy and distorted and with both forward and reversing of the same video clip, it's hard to say exactly what is going on here." AGREE!! I then asked her what her thoughts were on the guesses by the folks on Twitter. Dr. Ruane had this to say: So basicallyyyyyyy, 1) It might not be a snake 2) Maybe it's a lizard! 3) It's prob CGI anyway. Either way, I'll be waiting for the single. Investigation OVER.
Here's All The Times Katy Perry Threw Shade At Taylor Swift In Her "Swish Swish" Video

"Countdown to CATASTROPHE!"
You know Katy Perry. A couple months ago, Katy dropped "Swish Swish," a song that everyone and their mother is convinced is a Taylor Swift diss track. Fast-forward to today: Katy dropped the first teaser for her new video, and people are already pointing out how much it has in common with "Bad Blood." Even beyond copying it, there is some really shady stuff in there— further making us believe the song is a TS diss track. Let's take a closer look. Let's start with the tweet itself. Catastrophe... sound FAMILIAR?!? That's because Catastrophe was Taylor's name in her "Bad Blood" video. Then there's the premise of the video: two teams competing with a lot of celebrity cameos. Wait, did I just describe "Bad Blood"? Even the way the cameos are introduced gives us "Bad Blood" vibes. Then there's the basketball teams in the video: We have the Sheep vs. the Tigers. Katy is playing for the Tigers against her rivals in "SHEEP'S CLOTHING." That reminds me of a ~certain~ tweet. As for the Sheeps...we have Terry Crews wearing an ~interesting~ choice of wig in Taylor Swift blonde. And then we have the Announcers, who in their only line say, "Where do they find these people?" Which sounds awfully similar to something Katy would say in response to Taylor's squad in her "Bad Blood" video. There you have it! More shade to fuel this "feud." And here's the entire teaser!
Profundizando en la teoría de que Taylor Swift y Katy Perry enterrarán el hacha en los VMA

Este artículo ha sido traducido del inglés.
Aviso legal: La siguiente teoría es pura especulación. Reconozco sin ningún reparo que NO tengo pruebas. Pero soy gay y sé bastante de dramas, así que tengo ojo para estas cosas. Esto es así: estoy convencido de que Taylor Swift y Katy Perry (que arrastran una enemistad más vieja que los bosques) enterrarán el hacha de guerra en los VMA de este año. Este es mi razonamiento, basado en una labor detectivesca por internet/conjeturas/las ganas que tengo de que pase. Para empezar, Katy presenta los VMA este año. Su era 'Witness' no ha cumplido exactamente las expectativas, pero está a punto de irse de gira. La ceremonia, prevista para el 27 de agosto, le da la oportunidad de empezar de cero antes de volver a dar conciertos y antes de la vuelta de 'American Idol' el año que viene. ¡Además está previsto que actúe en los premios de este año! Yo diría que va a cantar 'Swish, Swish' porque aún la está promocionando; ¡el vídeo ni ha salido todavía! Quizá *TAMBIÉN* recordéis que se dice que 'Swish, Swish' es una pulla/respuesta a 'Bad Blood' (una un poco floja, la verdad) dirigida a Taylor Swift. Pero Katy ha cambiado de actitud públicamente en cuanto a su enemistad con Taylor. Dice que está preparada para enterrar el hacha, y en el directo de 'Swish, Swish' de su megalivestream de este año, cambió la letra de la canción para que no pareciera tanto una pulla dirigida a Taylor. MIENTRAS TANTO, ha habido bastante silencio por parte de Taylor. Hasta hoy. Ha eliminado todas las publicaciones de sus redes sociales, dejando literalmente un 'Blank Space' –Espacio en blanco– en su Instagram, su Twitter, su Tumblr y su web. La mayoría de la gente está interpretando esto como que va a sacar algo nuevo, lo cual tiene sentido... ¡su etapa 1989 empezó hace tres años! ¡Ya va siendo hora! TAMBIÉN parece que ahora NO sigue a nadie en redes sociales... pero en realidad puede que eso no sea así. Cuando le das al "0" de gente a la que sigue en Twitter en tu teléfono, te lleva a una lista de gente a la que parece que sigue. Puede que sea un fallo, ¡o puede que sea una función secreta! En cualquier caso, la primera persona que aparece no es otra que Doña KATY PERRY. Así que esa es mi teoría. Un follow en Twitter, una canción pulla que en la promoción ya no es una pulla, y unos premios de música donde SIEMPRE pasa de todo. Que sí, ya lo sé... está cogido un poco por los pelos. Pero ¡¿y si Katy interpreta 'Swish, Swish' y aparece Taylor por arte de magia?! Cantan juntas, se dan un beso, hacen las paces y todo arreglado en el fandom de Twitter. Es casi DEMASIADO perfecto. Puede que no me esté basando en mucho, pero tendría muchísimo sentido. Los VMA son EL evento al que van los artistas a anunciar cosas importantes. Taylor enterró el hacha con Nicki Minaj hace pocos años... así que sabe cómo funciona esto. Katy parece receptiva a acabar con la enemistad. Taylor tiene (seguramente) nuevo material que promocionar. Y estas dos mujeres son dos de las personas más inteligentes y astutas del mundo del espectáculo. PUNTO. Les vendría bien a las dos que esto pasara. ¿Qué pensáis? ¿Me he perdido algo? Dejad pruebas abajo en los comentarios. Si no, descubriremos la verdad el 27 de agosto.
A Deep Dive Into The Theory That Taylor Swift And Katy Perry Will End Their Feud At The VMAs
OK so full disclaimer: The following theory is purely conjecture. I will freely admit I do NOT have the receipts. But I'm a messy gay who's fluent in drama, so I've got an eye for this sort of thing. Here's the deal: I'm convinced Taylor Swift and Katy Perry (who are in a long, drawn out Wonderbread feud) will bury the hatchet at this year's VMAs. Here's my thought process, based on wishful thinking/internet sleuthing/conjecture. First of all, Katy will be hosting this year's VMAs. Her Witness era hasn't exactly lived up to expectations, but she's about to go on tour. The event — which is scheduled for August 27 — offers her a chance to hit reset before she starts doing shows and the American Idol reboot next year. She's also scheduled to be performing at this year's show! My guess would be that she'll be singing "Swish, Swish" since she's still promoting the song — the music video hasn't even come out yet! You *ALSO* might recall that "Swish, Swish" is allegedly a "diss" track/response to "Bad Blood" (kind of a lukewarm one TBH) aimed at Taylor Swift. But Katy has publicly changed her tune about her feud with Taylor. She says she's ready to bury the hatchet, and at the live performance of "Swish, Swish" during her mega-livestream earlier this year, she actually changed the lyrics of the song to seem like less of a diss track aimed at Taylor. MEANWHILE, all has been fairly quiet on Taylor Swift's front — until today. She purged all posts on her social media accounts, literally leaving a "Blank Space" on her Instagram, Twitter, Tumblr, and website. Most people are taking this to mean that new music is on the way, which makes sense...her 1989 era kicked off three full years ago! We are overdue for new music! It ALSO appears like she does NOT follow anyone on social media anymore...but that might not actually be the case. When you click the "0" of who she follows on Twitter on your phone, it actually goes through to a list of people that it looks like she follows. It might be a glitch, or it might be a secret feature! Either way, the very first person who shows up is none other than one Miss KATY PERRY. So that's what I've got. A Twitter follow, a diss track that's no longer a diss track to promote, and a music awards show where messy shit ALWAYS happens. I know guys, I know...it's a bit of a stretch. But what if Katy performs "Swish, Swish" and Taylor magically shows up?! They sing together, kiss, make up, and all is right in stan Twitter? It's almost TOO perfect. I might not be working with a lot, but it really would make a lot of sense. The VMAs are THE event where artists come to make a big PR statement. Taylor buried the hatchet with Nicki Minaj a few short years ago...so she knows how this works. Katy seems receptive to ending the feud. Taylor (probably) has new music to promote. And these two women are two of the smartest, savviest people in entertainment, PERIOD. It would be mutually beneficial to make this happen. So what do you think? Did I miss anything? Leave receipts in the comments section below. Otherwise, we'll figure out the truth on August 27.
It Looks Like Kim Kardashian Has Blocked The Snake Emoji On Instagram

And then this year on National Snake Day, Swift's stans — Swifties — seemed to reclaim the emoji for the pop star.
 
If you go into the "Comments" section of Instagram's Settings, you can set a manual filter to keywords that commenters won't be able to use on your account.An Instagram spokesperson confirmed, "We give people the choice to make their own lists of banned words or emojis that won’t appear in their comments."
ICYMI, new Taylor Swift music is IMMINENT. We're getting a new album in November and a new song this Friday. Swift has been teasing something big this past week with a series of three cryptic videos of a snake that she's posted on her social media channels — apparently a clever way of reclaiming the 🐍 emoji used against her. After all, you might recall how Kim Kardashian "exposed" the pop star via Snapchat on "National Snake Day" last year — which led to commenters flooding Swift's social media with the snake emoji. So it perhaps wasn't *THAT* surprising that Swifties have been flooding Kim K's Twitter replies with the snake emoji in the wake of all this new music news. Here are some of the replies to the above tweet: But if you head to Kim's Instagram, something interesting happens: the snake emoji is nowhere to be found. Could it be that the snake emoji is BLOCKED on Kim's feed? There was only one way to find out. I (Sam) tried replying with a single serpent to Kim's most recent picture (a very pretty picture of the sky). When I was signed in to my own account, I could see the snake emoji. But when you look at the comments section when you're NOT signed into my account, my snake emoji is nowhere to be found. It looks like the only person who can see the 🐍 on Kim K's feed is the account that commented it in the first place. Instagram actually allows any user to block certain phrases in their comments — including emojis. This applies to all users, not just verified or high-profile accounts. In the meantime, props for Kim for probably staying on top of the ball for this round of the feud. UPDATE

Taylor Swift regresó aceptando su lado oscuro y ahora la gente la ama mucho más

El misterio intrigó a todos sus fans por unos días...
Tras borrar todo rastro de ella en sus redes sociales... Taylor Swift regresó con varios teasers que mostraban una serpiente. Sin embargo, todo terminó la mañana del 23 de agosto, cuando Taylor anunció su regreso con un nuevo disco, titulado: Reputation. La gente enloqueció de emoción. Pero la mayoría quedó sorprendida con la forma en la que Taylor tomó el odio en su contra y lo uso para su beneficio. Desde el escándalo de "Famous" con Kanye West, la gente ha comparado y utilizado serpientes para describir a Taylor. Ahora, literalmente, ella convirtió a las serpientes en parte de su imagen. En pocas palabras... Taylor aceptó su lado oscuro... Y la gente la ama más que nunca. Muchos esperan que Nicki y Katy Perry tengan una reacción poco favorable ante el regreso de Taylor. Mientras que otros creen que algunas estrellas pop deberían tomar nota de las estrategias de Tay Tay. ¿Será que su regreso marcará el inicio de una nueva era? Los Swifters así lo creen. Reputation de Taylor Swift saldrá a la venta el 10 de noviembre.
25 Small Things Celebs Did In August 2007 That Prove How Times Have Changed

Keeping Up With the Kardashians would premiere in October, and remains on the air a decade later.
 
Their daughter Harlow was born in January 2008, with their son Sparrow arriving the following year.
 
Later that year, Kanye's long pursuit of Kim began after he saw a photo of her with Paris Hilton, and asked a friend: "Have you seen that girl Kim Kar-dijon?"
 
A year later, Miley revealed that she and Joe Jonas had been dating for two years and she was devastated by their breakup.
 
A decade later, they're still going strong.
 
A decade later, they're expecting their first baby.
 
The third season opened with this iconic episode in which Lauren accused Heidi and Spencer of being responsible for spreading the speculation. Years later, in 2015, Spencer would confirm that it was indeed him who leaked the rumour.
 
Lauren also picked up Choice Female Reality Star.
 
High School Musical 2 premiered on 17 August 2007, with Zac Efron and Vanessa Hudgens sweeping the board at the Teen Choice Awards 10 days later, winning four gongs between them, including ~Choice Chemistry~.
 
In fact, the following year they tied the knot and announced her pregnancy two weeks later.
 
In fact, in 2007 Desperate Housewives was reported to be the most popular show in its demographic worldwide, with an audience of 120 million.
 
These days she wins literally every award ever.
 
Fun fact: The summer of 2007 in the UK was the wettest on record, and "Umbrella" remained at number one in the charts for 10 consecutive weeks – the longest run at number one for any single of that decade.
On 8 August 2007, it was announced that an as-yet-untitled new "non-scripted family sitcom" starring a little-known family called the Kardashian/Jenners was coming to E! The news came just one week after Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie announced that their show, The Simple Life, was coming to an end after four years. However, until KUWTK made her a bonafide star, Kim was spending August 2007 attending celebrity gifting parties in order to pick up the latest designer handbags. She was also dressing in red satin while posing outside steak restaurants. Paris Hilton, meanwhile, was being paid to pose in clothing shops dressed head to toe in gold sequins. And hysteria followed her everywhere she went. Paris's BFF turned arch-nemesis, Nicole Richie, had just announced that she and boyfriend Benji Madden were expecting their first baby. The Kardashian sisters did make their first red carpet appearance together in August 2007, though. But Kim was just a glint in future husband Kanye West's eye. In 2007 he was still engaged to Alexis Phifer and lowkey dressing like a kids' TV presenter. In August 2007, Miley Cyrus looked like this. And backstage at the 2007 Teen Choice Awards she hung out with some baby-faced Jonas Brothers. 💗 These two had just started dating. And a 13-year-old Justin Bieber was busking during his summer holidays. Heidi Montag and Spencer Pratt had just got engaged. Just a week after Heidi flashed her engagement ring to the paparazzi, The Hills entered its third season. Rumours of a Lauren Conrad sex tape had been swirling all summer, and the premiere drew in a record 5 million viewers as a result. And a week after Season 3 made its debut, Lauren Conrad and Audrina Patridge attended the Teen Choice Awards, where The Hills won Best Reality Show. They then went partying with Brody Jenner because 2007. Victoria Beckham was rocking her trademark blonde ~Pob~ hairstyle, while Brooklyn, Romeo, and Cruz were still THIS TINY. 😭 Back in August 2007, these two were everyone's favourite couple. Showbiz's Most Alternative Couple™️, Ashlee Simpson and Pete Wentz, were also still going strong. And these women were still drawing in huge audiences. Back in August 2007, Taylor Swift was still rocking cowboy boots and making guest appearances on American Idol. She was also invited to read out the nominees for the 2007 Country Music Association Awards, where she picked up a gong for New Female Vocalist of the Year. Meanwhile, her future boyfriend (and then ex-boyfriend,) Calvin Harris was spending the summer playing festivals. And, finally, Rihanna was parading around town with an umbrella-shaped walking stick after injuring her foot because "Umbrella" had become the iconic song of the summer.
All Of Taylor Swift's Social Media Accounts Are Gone And People Are Freaking Out
So, today, on this holy three-year anniversary of Taylor Swift's "Shake It Off," something CRAZY is happening — Swift appears to be turning all of her social media platforms into BLANK SPACES. This is her Twitter right now: And here's her Instagram: This is literally what her Tumblr looks like right now: And this is her Facebook: OH, AND THIS IS LITERALLY A SCREENSHOT OF HER OFFICIAL WEBSITE: NEEDLESS TO SAY PEOPLE ARE FREAKING THE FUCK OUT: THIS. IS. NOT. A. DRILL. SOMETHING IS HAPPENING. PLEASE JOIN ME IN FREAKING THE FUCK OUT.
