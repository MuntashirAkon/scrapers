 Today you might want to try something completely new, Gemini. If you've never done this before, why not try expressing yourself through dance? Even if you're convinced you have two left feet, you might be surprised. Whatever your style, there's a type of dance you can do, whether it's as simple as the twist or as flamboyant as flamenco. You'll feel great, and it's good exercise.
 Make an effort to connect with someone you miss today, Gemini. Even if it feels painful at first, you'll feel a lot better once you do. Pick up the phone, write a note, or send an email. Let the person know you miss and care about him or her. Expressing yourself is often far better than stuffing your feelings. The person may be missing you just as much.
 Annoying situations that arise today could have you feeling stressed, Gemini. A sudden desire to escape might enter your mind. Take care not to work out your frustrations by overindulging in food or drink. This could only make the situation worse. Focus on the tasks at hand and get them done. Follow that with a long walk to clear your head and a movie to get your mind off it all.
 Do you need a change of pace, Gemini? If things are beginning to feel boring and you're apathetic, chances are that you do. All you have to do is figure out what to shift. If you're home most of the time, change the furniture around. It can make the house seem new. Consider putting up new pictures or bringing in fresh flowers. Switch your schedule around. This will energize you.
 You may put other people's needs before yours, Gemini. There's an important balance between being selfish and being selfless. Don't sacrifice yourself to be a servant to others. It's important that you not think only of yourself without considering how your actions will affect others. You may swing toward the former today. This will only lead to resentment and deplete your emotional and physical resources.
 You might have to make a choice between telling the truth and a lie. Sometimes this can be a difficult choice, especially if you're afraid you'll hurt someone's feelings. However, a lie can take far more energy than the truth. Consider what you'd want the other person to do in your place. Stick to your ethics, even of it's tough.
 Watch out for the green
 You may feel like someone's trying to pin you down before you start, Gemini. Perhaps these obstacles are self
 Your mind gives you a great deal of security, Gemini, which allows you to explore other worlds. You have your satellite outpost operating smoothly, and you can now take trips into the frontier knowing that you have a secure facility to fall back on. Find new ways to bring love into your life.
 This should be a fortunate day, Gemini, including love, career, money, and health. Plans for a trip might finally materialize, and a long
 You may be trying to cling to something that doesn't want to sit still, Gemini. It's like trying to grab a wet fish. The more tightly you squeeze it, the likelier it is to slip out of your grasp. The trick is to be more strategic and less frantic. You also might consider letting the fish go. It isn't yours anyway.
 A delay in completing an important project could have you feeling irritated, frustrated, and inadequate, Gemini, even though you've done your best. The problem is probably beyond your control. There isn't much you can do about this but wait. There are probably a lot of other important tasks waiting. Take care of them and get your mind off the other. It'll get done eventually.
 A short trip might be necessary today, Gemini. This could be disheartening, as it takes you away from your current love interest, but perhaps it's just as well. A phone call on this emotionally charged day might advance your relationship more than a forced evening together. Acknowledge that you're looking forward to seeing your friend again and then get on with the job!
 A romantic evening at home with your partner could bring the two of you closer, Gemini. Your emotions are intense right now, so you need to use your intuition to judge exactly how much of your feelings you should reveal. An intellectual passion could also come your way. You might discover a new field of interest and you'll want to bury yourself at home studying it for hours.
 Have you been thinking about adopting a pet? Even if you haven't, a lovely little dog or cat could come into your life now and show signs of wanting to stay with you, Gemini. Don't let mundane considerations get in your way. An animal could bring a lot of joy into your life now. Your health should continue to thrive, though your energy might come and go in spurts.
 A missed communication 
 Is the stock market taking a nosedive again, Gemini? Is this causing you to worry about your investments? Relax! The situation is likely temporary, and your stocks and bonds will probably regain their former value, if not surpass it. However, this isn't a good day to make new investments or even to open a bank account. Wait a few days.
 Some technological gadgets that you make copious use of may go out of whack today, Gemini. This could prove frustrating for you, but don't vent your frustrations on them. That wouldn't help! Stay calm and call in a professional to fix the problem. Think of the expense as a contribution to your own mental health.
 You feel indecisive when it comes to a romantic situation, Gemini. You might ask yourself questions about how to proceed. Don't get overwhelmed by all the possibilities. Take things one step at a time. The more you read into each small gesture, the crazier you will drive yourself. Don't run around in circles. Confront the issues.
 You have exactly the right amount of discipline and sense of duty to accomplish quite a bit today, Gemini. Your thinking should be clear. Your sense of time and restriction works in your favor to help you figure out any puzzles that present themselves. You have a strong will that helps you complete just about every task you undertake.
 You may be considering taking a trip or planning a party with some friends, Gemini. You may find out today that it's up to you to do all the organizing. This won't bother you too much because you know you'll do it right. Why don't you think about really trying to outdo yourself and plan something special that your friends will never forget?
 You have a generous spirit, Gemini. And today you're feeling particularly altruistic. Finally, you have a chance to help your fellow man in a very real, direct way. Forget about big goals and lofty visions. Don't try to set out to eradicate world hunger. You can go down to a local shelter and help cook a meal for a few dozen people. The personal contact will do you good.
 Today you'll have a banker's precision, Gemini. You will recheck everything from your expenses to your investments to your children's pocket money, not to mention how much you've paid back on your loans. Keep at it! This is the time to do it. Despite what others think, it's important.
 Take pride in your nurturing instincts, Gemini. Rescue an injured bird or join a conservation group. Do something to help save the whales. Take a more active role in the preservation of the planet. Become a concerned citizen who regularly speaks out for what you believe in. Don't let other people's political agendas get in the way of your true purpose.
 You'd do well to discipline your actions today, Gemini, and keep a level head. Unexpected events may rise to challenge established authority. Don't jump to any sweeping conclusions. Make sure you gather the facts before you act. Don't simply recoil and shrink into a cave. If you don't take action, you'll be acted upon.
 Get the rest you need, Gemini. Prevent sickness and maintain full control of your mind and body by making sure you get the proper amount of sleep. Your actions today should be methodical. Don't try to experiment with something you know nothing about. Make sure you understand the situation completely before you jump in with both feet.
 Your mental activity is more pronounced than usual, Gemini. It may be difficult to stop the barrage of thoughts streaming through your head. You may be able to accomplish a lot, but you might drive yourself crazy with the internal chatter that doesn't give you the opportunity to mentally sit still. Your thinking will be much clearer if you take time to slow down and meditate.
 You may look at your orderly closet, well
 Try not to be a stick in the mud today, Gemini. Other people aren't going to want to take the time to drag you along. Take the initiative. If you want to have fun, create it. The biggest part of this equation is your attitude. Other people can sense your jealous nature, so don't think you're fooling anyone. Let others live their lives. You need to concentrate on your own.
 There may be power struggles brewing beneath the surface that become evident in your interactions, Gemini. Your first reaction may be to get upset and make your viewpoint even more rigid. It's important that you be more laid back. Accept that other people have different perspectives on the situation. Work with instead of against them. Walk away if others are unreasonable.
 Don't skimp when it comes to taking care of your physical health, Gemini. In an effort to save money, you may not bother getting dental checkups, or you could opt for the least expensive doctor in the book. Nothing is more important than your health. Treat your body with the honor and respect it deserves. You may have no trouble doing for others what you know you should be doing for yourself.
 Be gentle and reserved in your approach, Gemini. There's a great deal of tenderness in the air that you should tune into and enjoy. Do things to improve your home. Make amends with the people you live with and clear the air so that relations will be calm in the future. You have a great deal of yourself invested in making your home a sanctuary, so respect and nourish it.
 The fast actions of the day may confuse you, Gemini. Don't be surprised if your head is in a whirl over recent events involving love and romance. You may feel as if things are happening too quickly for you to really understand them. Try not to be so analytical. You may find that you're chasing a lost cause while the train is pulling out of the station. Hop on board and leave the other issue behind.
 It's very possible that the best solution today is to simply give up control, Gemini. When it comes to matters of the heart, other people may be in a whirl of turmoil. Trying to figure out their state of mind will be impossible so don't even try. You may just want to let things ride and see where you end up tomorrow before making any major moves.
 You may feel a bit short on inspiration today, Gemini. Don't be discouraged! Start whatever project is in question, even if your thoughts are elsewhere. During the course of the "bad" work you may churn out at first, your muse gently alights on your shoulder. It sometimes takes a little discipline to lead to delicious rewards!
 Try not to weigh everything down. Don't pick things apart to the point that all that's left are the tiny details of the situation, Gemini. Deal with it as a whole. Mental and emotional issues are apt to be of greater concern to you. You shouldn't try to dissect them. That will only create more issues than you started with.
 You can look forward to a busy day, Gemini. Don't schedule anything extra! Your home, family, or mate is likely to demand a great deal of you. In fact, your energy may be stretched to the breaking point, so be careful to keep some strength in reserve. If you give yourself to them completely, your nerves will be shot!
 Social events or group activities could put you in touch with many people, Gemini, both close friends and casual acquaintances. A new person may come into your life who makes a difference. Issues may come up that you feel strongly about. You aren't likely to refrain from expressing your opinions. This is fine if you're tactful. Others will appreciate your honesty.
 Sticks and stones may break your bones, but names will never hurt you, Gemini. The problem with today's energy is that there just may be some sticks and stones tossed in your direction. Be on the lookout for such airborne adversity. Powerful forces are operating with emotional aggression. War can break out if you aren't careful. Try to maintain the peace. You may need to seek shelter.
 This is no time to be a stick in the mud, Gemini. Don't be the weak link in the chain. The energy of the day is "get up and go." So either lead, follow, or get out of the way. There are no excuses for backing down. When opportunity knocks, you need to be ready with your bags packed. Your emotions could lead you down new and unexpected paths.
 Your self
 Technology is highlighted for you today, Gemini. It could be that you install a new phone or computer system, which will make life just a bit easier. Or perhaps you decide to take a course to learn to master a technical area that has been difficult for you to grasp. Whatever you do or learn today is bound to make you happier and more productive.
 Come out of serious mode for a day and let yourself laugh, Gemini. Hold a game night at your home and invite some good friends over to play cards and nibble on snacks until all hours. This is a day to have fun, so let loose and freely express yourself in the best way you see fit. Realize how much power you have in your jovial nature. Spread it generously.
 There's little comfort in your emotions today, Gemini. You may want to stick to business. Concentrate on getting things done in your regular routine. Create a plan and stick to it. This isn't a day to deviate from the norm, nor is it a time in which you will find much sympathy from others. Stick close to home and take care of your personal business. Time is precious. Don't waste it.
 Act on your instincts and you won't go wrong, Gemini. You may need to give up control and put logical thinking aside. Let the wind take you where it will. Explore your feelings and how others influence them. It will be just about impossible to solidify any plans today. You're better off exploring options and comparing notes with others. Don't pigeonhole yourself into one way of thinking.
 Your philanthropic side may want to come out and do good works today, Gemini. Your default mode is to care for others. This is fine, but make sure it doesn't deplete your vital life force. The key is to offer advice and then walk away from the situation. You aren't responsible for other people's actions. Offer information, but leave the final decision up to the person you're trying to help.
 Mix your reality with a bit of fantasy today, Gemini. Kick back for a while and rest. Try to spend time meditating and clearing your head of daily worries. Calming, relaxing activities are the best way to spend today. Take walks with friends and go deep into conversation about outlandish subjects. Give yourself time and space to dream.
 You may have some issues with food, Gemini. Maybe your sense of self
 Your focus will center on your emotions today, Gemini, although being centered in itself will be quite a challenge. You may feel like a yo
 Your solid grounding may become a bit unstable today, Gemini, but don't worry about it. Be a little more flexible and release your tight grip on the situation. Infuse laughter and playfulness into the picture. The exchange of ideas is critical. Get out of the house and into a social arena where you can enjoy lighthearted conversations.
 You might experience a great deal of emotional confusion, Gemini. There's a debate brewing inside you, and you're having a hard time deciding whether to be practical or more fanciful. Looking to others for help may only add to the problem, so take other people's advice with a grain of salt. If nothing seems clear, wait out the storm and proceed when you have a better handle on the weather.
 A good tip to remember is to be careful about what you say about other people, Gemini. If you're speaking about someone who isn't present, act like he or she is. What's your motivation for saying the things you say? Is it necessary to speak in such a way? A negative comment about someone is going to resonate through the cosmos. People could lose trust in you.
 Today is your day to shine, Gemini, so give it your all. Be sure that you get the credit you deserve for all you do. Try not to fall into self
 Today you might hear about opportunities to increase your income, Gemini, either in your current employment, a new job, or perhaps by a project of your own. You may channel a great deal of energy and inspiration toward this end. Others may want to pitch in and help you. You're likely to feel energetic and optimistic. This can work in attracting still more new opportunities.
 There is a conflicting push/pull aspect to today that may leave you feeling unsure about how to proceed. On the one hand, you may feel like you want to plan things out and get your emotions stabilized so you can function at full capacity. On the other hand, something may be pulling you into the clouds. This is your heart talking. Listen. Find a compromise between these two energies.
 More than usual, you're probably craving solitude today, Gemini. Although you may have committed to attending a party or get
 You've been doing very well, Gemini, but today you might feel more focused than ever. The path ahead seems clear and well defined. You're anticipating the future with motivation. You might be considering a long trip abroad or perhaps going back to school for an advanced degree. This is a good day to research and finalize your plans.
 Success on all levels is filling your life and making you feel absolutely wonderful, Gemini. The downside of this is that you might be a little too conscientious. Are you putting in a lot of extra hours? Be discriminating about this and don't work harder than necessary. You could get stressed to the point of taxing your strength too much, and that won't help you. Pace yourself.
 Spiritual matters could be very much on your mind, Gemini. You may want to delve into metaphysical studies and meditation, but work or family responsibilities could interfere with making those desires a reality. Don't let this get you down. Instead, stay focused on the mundane chores and finish them. Then you can move on to the really fascinating matters.
 Legal papers might need attention today, Gemini. This could concern a positive development in financial matters. Though you might not be too clear on the language, you will still be glad to do it since it could represent a highly desirable turn of events for you. New self
 A love partner may seem too quiet, Gemini. Perhaps you haven't heard from your friend for a day or so. If you let it, this could start your doubts and insecurities, causing you to wonder if this person still cares or if they're gone forever. Try to remain objective. Does your friend have some worries right now? That may be why they're out of touch. Worry will only make you feel worse.
 An unexpected and perhaps unwelcome call or email from a co
 Everyone has impulsively bought something without really thinking about it first. As far as you're concerned, Gemini, it happens a little more often than it should. Have you looked at your closet full of the clothes you never wear? Why do you keep them? Is it reassuring? Don't get caught up in fashion crazes. Try to be more careful with your money.
 Don't concern yourself with getting more. Concentrate on what you already have, Gemini. Work with whatever resonates within you. You instinctively know what does and doesn't work. Don't waste your time on meaningless issues. Focus on priorities. The more balanced and stable your emotions can be today, the more prosperity will come into your life.
 If an emotional issue is bringing you down, Gemini, find healthy ways to relieve the situation. Overeating won't solve the problem. This will only mask your difficulties and make them harder to deal with later. It's time to pull out of the rut and infuse the situation with freshness. You have a great deal of love to share with the world.
 Other people may steal the spotlight from you today, Gemini, but don't let it get you down. The key is to learn from the ones who take charge. Have fun and don't worry about the details. A definite dynamism is helping you transform certain areas of your life that need to change. Get out of the rut you're in.
 This is your day, Gemini, so don't let anyone take it away from you. The key will be to get a head start on whatever goals you wish to accomplish. Don't waste time thinking about exactly how you're going to accomplish them. Just get started. The first step is the most important. You're grounded right now, helping you get a better handle on what it is you need to do.
 Stand back and let someone else take the reins today, Gemini. Trust in others. There are many helpful hands out there to guide you. The most important thing is to let go and have confidence that others will direct you. They will if you let them. Your brain may buzz to the point that you feel you've lost control. Relax your mind and calm your nerves.
 Gemini, you will have the opportunity to set the record straight with some of your relatives. Sometimes some of them take advantage of your kindness, and you serve without even a thought for yourself. The day will may be stressful and you may be irritable. Try to use the day to your advantage and get your life back in order.
 Some people have a tendency to be shy. They almost apologize for being alive. For them, it's essential to keep a low profile. You probably think that you're like this, but you're mistaken, Gemini. You need a bit of reassurance. There are a lot of interesting things inside you that need to come out. Believe in yourself.
 You have a dynamic personality, Gemini. With today's celestial energy, you should try to avoid expending your energy on pointless conversations. Try to be a little more pragmatic. Consider any possible compromises very carefully. If you stand strong, you will reach your objectives much more quickly.
 You may find it difficult to keep things neat and organized today, Gemini. It seems like you're tying to organize a room full of feathers buffeted by gusts of wind. Buy a paperweight. Meanwhile, you might want to give up organizing the feathers and deal with it another time. You may feel too lazy to fight the wind.
 You're feeling rather sensitive today, Gemini. You may want to rescue every injured animal from the side of the road. Combine this nurturing, loving instinct with a warrior drive that will take charge and lead the fight. This powerful energy duo is very action oriented. Send your loving, internal instincts out into the world to do good.
 Something about silence doesn't seem right to you today, Gemini. Keep talking. Eventually someone will say something meaningful. Latch on to lucrative ideas and keep your ears open for new opportunities. The stranger you pass on the street while going for coffee could be your new best friend. Strike up a conversation with the person standing next to you in line.
 Your flexible nature may get you in trouble today, Gemini. Personalities may clash when no one is willing to lead. Be aggressive without being manipulative. Keep it light. Don't try to pin anyone down. Your nature is open and expansive. Give other people the freedom they want. Unexpected events may dramatically change the course of the day, so don't be upset if things don't go as planned.
 Pay close attention to your friends today, Gemini. One of them may be going through a tough time and need a little extra support and attention. If you can, gather several buddies together and organize an impromptu lunch or dinner or any other activity that allows you to laugh, bond, and share. Your friendships are a treasure to be cherished and nurtured.
 Today is a day of reckoning in some ways, Gemini. Attention to detail is important, but make sure it doesn't become your only focus. Situations are likely to crop up in which you've analyzed and considered every single detail but failed to see the big picture. This is a wonderful day to remedy such situations. Take care of anything that needs a broader perspective.
 Your flexibility will be tested today, Gemini. You may end up twisting and flexing your body to fit the contours of the day. You will find that if you join forces with the powerful movers, you will get quite a bit done and be successful. Don't be intimidated by the intensity of other people's emotions. You will find strength in your calm, grounded self.
 Keep your cool if something goes wrong today, Gemini. Don't be so impatient about fixing a problem that you end up doing something rash. You may do more damage than you would if you just let things sit for a couple days. Mull over the situation, talk it out with others, and approach the issue at another time with a different frame of mind.
 Smile at the world today, Gemini. Be thankful for the things you have and the people around you. Amplify the cozy, warm feeling inside and spread this love to others. This is a very expansive time for you in which you can get quite a bit accomplished if you set your mind to it. Radiate your true nature through every cell in your body and watch as the opportunities come your way.
 You might have to toughen your skin today, Gemini. Don't automatically write someone off because of an action that you think is offensive. Allow others to have their opinions and respect their right to express them openly. Keep an open mind and don't judge. Maintain a diplomatic attitude and keep your critical thoughts to yourself. Don't think less of others in order to feel better about yourself.
 Your head may buzz with activity today, Gemini. Suddenly it seems like the spotlight has been turned on. You're on stage and your brainpower is being tested. Are you up to the challenge? Ready or not, it's here. Remember the importance of individuality. Don't be another cookie
 Remind your loved ones how much they mean to you today, Gemini. Words are especially powerful. Don't use them lightly. Be thoughtful about how you treat others. Do your best to maintain peace. It isn't a good idea to hold grudges or carry hatred for anyone. Good manners and a neat appearance are key elements to the day.
 Every time you bring up a sensitive, important, or deep subject, does someone squash it? You may feel like you aren't relating well to other people today, Gemini. You may want to dive deeper into issues while others prefer to skim the surface. There are many ways to see the same things and deal with the same problems. Find people who see things your way rather than fight those who don't.
 Today you can expect to be more enterprising in your human relationships, Gemini. You may find new friends or enjoy quality time with old ones. It's likely that your love life will intensify. The next few weeks provide excellent resources for improving your emotional well
 If you're prepared and well organized, Gemini, today should go smoothly and pleasantly. Feel free to indulge in fanciful daydreams and things of a whimsical nature. You've earned the right to break from the normal routine. If you've been slacking off your tasks, however, you will now need to spend some time catching up and planning ahead.
 It's certainly clear that you have faith in your actions, Gemini! You feel no fear or doubt as you progress toward your goals at a fast clip, cruising along on calm seas under clear skies. This new atmosphere is likely the product of your renewed commitment. Reward yourself for your accomplishments, but you should wait a few days before launching an all
 Try not to get too worked up over other people's actions that don't concern you, Gemini. Recent events may have triggered responses from others that now have a serious effect on you. Take some time to really think about what part you wish to play in this drama. Is it in your best interests to get involved? It's undoubtedly time to distance yourself from the situation.
 How do you preserve your family history, Gemini? Do you keep mementos in a box, display heirlooms, or make scrapbooks? You most likely realize the value of family history, but you might not preserve it as well as you should. Take steps to record and save precious items and memories from parents, grandparents, siblings, and others. Don't forget your own history, too. One day you will be glad you did.
 You may not know which way to turn, Gemini. You may be emotionally weighed down by sentimental feelings and memories that bind you to the past. You may also feel restricted by authority figures who've been around the block more times than you, and therefore feel they have the right to tell you how to run your life. Try not to let your thoughts get tied up in either of these scenarios.
 The day ahead will suit you, but you mustn't expect miracles. Now is a time of healing. In the weeks ahead you will restore harmony to your energies and regain your fitness with improved diet and lifestyle. Your emotional life gets an overhaul as well, as you find the courage to confront certain unsettling issues.
 You may feel the urge to get up and go today, Gemini. Follow this instinct and get to work. You're anxious to get the ball rolling on certain projects. The key for you now is to make sure that the ones that are already started get done before you tackle the others. Don't let people stand in the way of your progress. Grab hold of the reins if you need to.
 Recent hesitation on your part may have suddenly put you in a bind, Gemini. It may feel like you've reached gridlock and your choices are limited. You can no longer get a solid handle on things. Instead of trying to make a move now, you may have to wait until the dust settles and you can see clearly again. Let the situation release before you add any more friction.
 If you have ties to any therapeutic profession, Gemini, you may make a strange discovery related to the health field today. You won't find this discovery in any book or methodology that you normally follow. Emotions aren't so blind as rational society would have us believe! Sometimes they lead us down the road toward knowledge. That's the case today.
 It may be difficult to stay grounded today with all the information flying around and all the emotion roiling in your heart. Try not to take things too seriously, Gemini. This is the key to maintaining a level head today. Approach the day with passion and take care of any investigative work that needs doing. There are important facts coming from unexpected sources.
 Social events or group activities could put you in touch with a lot of people, Gemini, both close friends and casual acquaintances. A new person may come into your life who makes a difference for you. Issues may come up that you feel strongly about, and you aren't likely to hesitate about expressing your opinions. This is fine, as you will be tactful and others will appreciate your sincerity.
 Tasks of any kind are likely to seem like the labors of Hercules today, Gemini. Overwork and strain could have you feeling a little under the weather. It might be a good idea to take some time alone to rest. If you can't, at least try to take things easy. Also, some unexpected changes in your community might have tongues wagging. Be sure to check out the facts before jumping to conclusions.
 After the emotional havoc you went through over the last few weeks, the period beginning today will be quite soothing. You can take advantage of these smoother, calmer waters to rediscover emotional harmony and improve the balance of your energy flow. Moreover, Gemini, if your physical health isn't quite adequate, the weeks ahead should give you a chance to rest and recuperate.
 Gemini, you can expect the day to be a bit bumpy. If you were an Olympic athlete, today you'd be standing at the starting line, wondering if you had trained enough for a topnotch performance. Have you had enough practice? Will you make the grade? Issues related to your material resources will certainly be on the agenda.
 If you were in charge of a company's human resources department, Gemini, today you would begin to completely overhaul the recruitment procedure. You would focus more on the human element rather than any diplomas and awards people wave around as evidence of their abilities. Confidence in people combined with trust in your instincts could prove profitable in more ways than you imagine.
 Today you might feel a little under the weather due to physical and emotional stress over the past few days. Take it easy today if you can. This isn't the day to be too busy or start new projects. Miscommunication could cause an upset or two, Gemini, so try to maintain your cool. Don't make mountains out of molehills. Nothing will come up that can't be handled.
 Authorities who have been your guides up to now may confront you. The hour is here to set aside your fears and lead yourself along your path. This is undoubtedly a very positive state of affairs. It means that you're maturing, Gemini. Besides, there's nothing to stop you from asking for help from time to time, should you need it.
 You may feel more of an urge than ever to search for your family roots. Your search could be so deep and intense that you may even go beyond genealogy and study archeology as a way to learn how to bring some cohesion to the odd bits and pieces of family remnants that you uncover.
 Excessive food and drink could have you feeling rather sluggish and indifferent to everything. This can get in the way of your usual kindness and affection, but it shouldn't. Get some rest, take a stomach remedy, and get back to your old self! You might also be tempted to overspend at some point. Think about it first!
 You may be called upon to host a gathering in your own home, Gemini. At first this could throw you into a panic because you don't think your house is clean enough. Don't worry. It's probably impeccable. You're the only one who will notice any dust, so don't sweat it.
 Try not to get too caught up in any potential conflicts brewing around you, Gemini. Your job lies in calming things down and bringing a more practical perspective to the situation. If you get tangled in the action phase of endeavors without first thinking about what it is that you're doing, you may confuse things more. Step back from the fire instead of throwing yourself into it headfirst.
 You may feel nostalgic as you look through photo albums, rearrange furniture, and remember past times, Gemini. Your mind will touch on emotional events that you may not have fully dealt with at the time they happened. Old feelings that you thought were gone could well up and bring tears to your eyes. Honestly face these feelings now instead of stuffing them back down for another decade.
 You may have been working on projects that make you feel good over the past few weeks, Gemini, particularly projects that relate to attaining more independence in your career. In the process, you've probably developed some new skills and now feel confident enough to use them. Today's one last burst of determination and inner power could complete the process and reach the goals you want.
 Expect a lot of activity in your home today, Gemini. A group, perhaps a large one, hosted by you or a family member could meet there and provoke stimulating conversations. You could get caught up in the energy, putting you in touch with a new awareness of your feelings. Tonight, expect vivid dreams of travel, strange places, or flying.
 A delay in receiving a communication from a distant place could prove frustrating today, Gemini. You may be looking forward to a vacation, but responsibilities that suddenly crop up could postpone the trip. This probably won't be necessary, but some adjustments need to be made before you can both do what you want and fulfill your responsibilities, too.
 If every day were like today, life would be heaven, Gemini! This is potentially a wonderful time for you. You may find the answers to problems that have been bothering you for a few weeks. Keep your eyes and ears open in all conversations. You could come across the piece you've been waiting for.
 You're a helpful person, Gemini, yet in your relationships, you often seem to confuse helping with parenting. You tend to do a lot of self
 You could write fiction or journalism well today. There's a good possibility that you have given some thought to a literary line of work. Why do you hesitate? It's never too late. Find the time to write a story. If you have a negative attitude about the things you do, how will you get anything done?
 You will have to rely on your analytical skills and steely self
 This day may not be one of your favorites, Gemini. You may be all too aware of the constraints of your chief occupation. You're likely to hanker for appropriate rewards for your labors. This is a good day to define new personal and professional goals. They will sustain you through your chores. In the meantime, how about asking for that raise?
 Whether or not you should make a specific expenditure could cause some tension between you and a partner, Gemini. You may think that it isn't feasible now, while your friend is determined to go for it. This isn't the day to try to reach an agreement in this matter. Neither of you is likely to give in. Wait a couple days until you're both a bit less tense.
 Your energy might turn toward beautifying your home, Gemini. Perhaps you've decided to repaint or go in a completely new direction in your decorating taste. Posters or other souvenirs of foreign lands might also be especially appealing now. Expect someone to drop by and bring some interesting news that might get your mind going a thousand miles an hour.
 The current planetary aspects are heightening your natural compassion for other people. Your relationships will be at the front of your mind today, Gemini. You feel good about yourself and other people can tell! People are attracted to you and wish to partake of your healing serenity. Listen without judgment as people pour out their hearts. That is a very precious skill.
 This isn't the time to make any more of a commitment to your relationship, Gemini. You aren't satisfied with your attitude toward things lately. Don't forget that your partner's characteristics may have something to do with it! You have two months to take care of things. Take advantage of this reevaluation period. It doesn't happen that often.
 It's likely that you will succeed at whatever you set out to accomplish today, Gemini. If you've been held back by worries over the integrity of a relationship or the long
 You're looking good and feeling great, Gemini. Now if only your home environment reflected who you are. As you look around, you may realize that it isn't as elegant as it could be. Today you can begin to change it. Begin with the basics 
 Too many invitations to social events may come today, Gemini. This might be one evening when you want to relax at home, but you won't want to say no to anyone. Analyze each invitation. Consider the location, host, other guests 
 Something you read today could have a dramatic effect on your life, Gemini. Pay particular attention to dream psychology. You may find an explanation for a recurring dream. The accuracy of the description could stop you in your tracks and make you anxious to read more. You're right to be intrigued, Gemini. You're bound to learn more about yourself as you study this particular area.
 You may be asked to slow down today, Gemini. Whether this comes in the form of a speeding ticket or a scrape on the knee when you trip, you must listen to this message. The key for you now isn't to get too emotional as a result of this slowdown. Know that it's for your own good. Don't complain about it 
 Today is your lucky day, Gemini. You may get a windfall of some sort, maybe a check in the mail or a raise or promotion at work. This is just what you've been hoping for to elevate your lifestyle. Don't go nuts. Invest the money wisely and it will keep you rolling in dough. Spend it all at once and you won't have much to show for it in a few years.
 You may feel wanderlust and crave something new and different in your life. You just can't help but be a bit bored by the dullness of the routine. If adventure is what you want, why not plan an exotic trip? Even if you don't have the money now, you can still start doing some research. Just knowing that you're going to go someday will help raise your spirits, Gemini.
 You might have trouble with your plumbing today, Gemini, particularly if you have a big kitchen. This is too complex a problem to handle yourself. Pay the money to have a professional take care of the problem. It will save you work and frustration. In the meantime, have a pizza delivered while you're waiting to get your kitchen back!
 Your intuition is operating at a high level, Gemini, but you may not be able to make sense of the psychic impressions you're receiving. The emotions, images, and symbols you pick up from others and the astral plane could be vague and easily misinterpreted. They could be important, though. Write them down and look at them in a day or so. You should be able to make sense of them then.
 You might not be able to concentrate on your work today, Gemini. Your head may be in the clouds and your eye for detail could fail you somewhat. Needless to say, this isn't a good day to tackle new, difficult, or complicated tasks. Concentrate on routines that you can do without thinking. That way you will get through the day without making yourself crazy.
 Your strength lies in your inner resources, Gemini. Today you will find that these resources have opened up within you. You will find that your emotions are calm and under control in the face of chaos. This time of new beginnings is extremely important. It would behoove you to probe your depths and fix any internal quirks that might give you trouble in the future.
 Listen carefully when you receive instructions today, Gemini. Your mind may not be as sharp as usual. If you aren't careful, you could get on the wrong track and end up having to start all over again. Don't be too shy or ashamed to ask questions. It's always better to ask a question than make an unnecessary error. Proceed slowly and methodically and you will get through the day!
 It's frustrating when work gets in the way of romance and social activities. This is what you feel today, Gemini. Your thoughts are on your evening and weekend activities, but your obligations are on your desk. Don't despair. Simply make a commitment to do what's expected of you. Enjoy yourself this evening, secure in the knowledge that you've fulfilled your obligations.
 This may not be the most energetic day, Gemini. You've been working hard lately and your body needs time to refuel. Spend some quiet time at home. Curl up with some tea and a good book and let your mind travel where it may. Even though your body slows, your mind is more active than ever. This would be a fruitful time to strategize creative changes you'd like to make at home or work.
 A scandal concerning a celebrity you admire could be in the news today, Gemini. This might throw you for a loop. You might even suffer some disillusionment. Withhold judgment for the time being. Much of what you hear may be traced to gossip or misinformation. Shocking though it may be, you will want to hear the celebrity's side of it. Only then can you form an objective opinion.
 An unexpected but welcome financial windfall could lead to some long
 Discussions with friends or colleagues about possible future business enterprises could find you taking notes, Gemini. Your natural meticulousness should serve you well. It will be important to have accurate records to discuss later. Any new project begun now is likely to succeed, especially if writing, speaking, or another form of entertainment is involved. Don't worry about possible failure.
 It's certainly clear that you have faith in your actions, Gemini! You feel no fear or doubt as you progress toward your goals, cruising along on calm seas under clear skies. This new atmosphere is likely the product of your renewed commitment. Reward yourself for your accomplishments, by all means, but you should wait a few days before launching a full
 The outlook for today is excellent, Gemini. The current alignment of the planets and the somewhat oppressive atmosphere of the past few days inspire you to change your surroundings and visit new places. Why not plan a little trip? All signs indicate that now is the best time for such an adventure. If you delay, you will feel stuck in the same old routine again.
 Some of your job responsibilities are too much for one person and they might weigh you down today, Gemini. The pile of work seems to get steadily bigger no matter what you do. Delegate if you can. Put the least urgent tasks aside and work your way steadily the rest. Your employer may or may not expect too much of you, but you're entitled to your sanity no matter what.
 It's OK to cry today, Gemini. Releasing is critical to receiving. If you have no sense of fear and restriction, it may be hard for you to experience joy and expansion. Incorporate the good with the bad and let these two powers settle harmoniously within your being. Make the preparations that will let you soar to great heights. Make sure you're ready to accept the challenges that come with growth.
 Reconnect with your self
 It might take an extra few minutes to get out of bed today, Gemini, but it will be worth it when you do. You will find that the more honest you've been with people, the more payoffs you will receive. Being dependable and trustworthy are key issues to focus on. Act strong and proud with regard to who you are and the rewards will come. Bring a certain amount of tenderness to all your actions.
 Although you may pride yourself on your patience, Gemini, this quality could be hard to come by today. It's possible that you've bent as far as you can and reached the breaking point. The final straw is about to be placed on the camel's back. Let loose the explosion of emotion called for by events. There's no use trying to maintain a saintly demeanor today.
 There will be a lighthearted, almost silly energy in the air today, Gemini. The Universe is encouraging you to give up your iron grip on that list of responsibilities and have some fun. Picture all the pressure you put on yourself as a ball and chain that you need to unshackle. There's no reason to take yourself so seriously all the time!
 Has someone given you a chore to do and then taken off without giving you any instructions? It's no wonder you feel confused and frustrated! If there is no manual, and if no one else knows what's up, don't feel bad about letting it go until you're given proper coaching. It's more prudent to wait than do it wrong and have to do it again. Better safe than sorry.
 An unexpected financial windfall could come your way today, Gemini. You may stand there with an open envelope in your hand, unable to speak. Whether it's an unanticipated bonus, gift, or surprising stock dividend, invest the money wisely. You've spent a lot of money recently, and it would be good for you to begin to replenish the bank account.
 If you have to deal with some disappointment today, try not to let it get you down, Gemini. You may receive a letter or phone call that brings less than favorable news. Perhaps someone you were hoping to see won't be able to make it, or a friend has to turn down an invitation to a party you're having. Try not to let this spoil your mood. These things happen. Keep yourself busy.
 Your creativity is at an all
 You aren't one to put much stock in the meanings of dreams, but you may have had a dream recently that was so accurate in its prediction as to be almost scary. Certainly it was uncanny. Write down everything you remember about it and then discuss the images with a friend. Don't worry, Gemini, your friend won't laugh at you. It's more than likely you will receive some telling insights.
 Books that you may have received as gifts could have you thinking deeply about spiritual or philosophical matters today, Gemini. Your mind is quicker than usual, so you can probably grasp some rather complex ideas. Your practical side could bring up doubts as to the applicability of what you're learning, but don't worry about that. This should become clear to you eventually.
 You may be thinking about political or social matters today, Gemini, specifically, the deterioration of the planet. You may be worried about your future and that of your children. You might try to bring up the subject at a social gathering. Someone you meet there is bound to teach you something about the issue. If you need to get further involved raising people's awareness of this issue, do it!
 A discussion could take place in your home between you, friends, and household members, Gemini. A love partner may also be present. The conversation will concern controversial issues that the people feel very strongly about, so expect to hear intense debate between opposing views. Your guests will take more of an intellectual than argumentative stance, so you can relax and learn. Have fun!
 Your skills with computers and other forms of technology should be growing rapidly. This will greatly increase your efficiency with these tools and your marketability, should you be thinking of changing careers or simply be looking for a new position. This would be a good day to get your resume up to date so you can act when you learn of a job that seems right for you.
 Today you might decide to sequester yourself at home, catch your breath, get your thoughts together, and recall the events of the past several days. You will also plan for the future, Gemini, as you feel especially optimistic and energetic enough to pursue whatever goals you have. At some point you're likely to share this with a close friend and seek his or her support and opinion.
 Think of yourself as a great pioneer crossing the frontier for the first time, Gemini. Acknowledge yourself as the important person that you are. Believe in yourself and your rights and opinions. Indecision could hinder your actions. Don't let it. Take an active stance at all times. Be brave in the face of hardships that you might confront today. You will be greatly rewarded when you do.
 Emotional conflict is likely to ensue today if you aren't careful, Gemini. People may step on your toes if you give them the opportunity. Make sure you aren't vulnerable to attack. Someone may be ready to confront you, so you must be ready to defend yourself. The best way to combat whatever force tries to shoot you down is to have confidence in yourself even if you don't have everything perfectly planned.
 Don't feel like you have to rationalize everything, Gemini. Accept the fact that there are some things in life that occur without a specific logical explanation. More than likely these are the most interesting events and experiences that add the most spice to your routine existence. Embrace the unknown and encourage more spontaneity and playfulness in your world.
 Information about possible careers and investments might come to your attention today, Gemini. You may give a lot of thought to these matters, especially since your thinking is changing along with the times. This is a good day to explore new avenues your life could take over the next six months, and make final decisions, if appropriate. Give this some thought before you act on your plans.
 You may get frustrated today when people don't seem to act rationally. To you, Gemini, the issues may be perfectly cut and dried. Keep in mind that not everyone sees the world the way you do. There's an element of strong emotion that's likely to play into the picture, an element that you probably failed to take into account. Make note of this as you go through your day.
 You're likely to be very aware of things going on around you today, and you may internalize the opinions of others, Gemini. Be careful about opening yourself up so much that you get hurt by someone's offhand, unflattering comment. You will find the most comfort in tangible and stable things. Enjoy the material pleasures in life.
 If you've been thinking about going back to school for a degree of some kind, Gemini, this is the time to start the process. Success and good fortune through your own initiative and through increasing your skills are definitely indicated now. A journey you've wanted to take for some time may finally be possible, as could achievements in the fields of writing and speaking. Go for it!
 Today may be filled with conflict when your legs carry you one way while your heart tugs you in a completely different direction, Gemini. Don't get caught in an uncomfortable situation like this. If you move around on automatic pilot all the time, you may end up missing out on the things your heart truly longs for.
 Even though you feel most comfortable when things are organized and meticulous, Gemini, you're going to need to be flexible. Allow room for surprise and adventure. Bask in the adventurous spirit that must be adopted when you walk out the door with no idea where you will end up. People and situations that come around today are likely to be foreign but friendly.
 An opportunity to do some extra work outside the scope of your regular job could present itself to you. Take it, Gemini. Not only could you earn some extra money but you might also open new doors that expand your professional horizons. The only danger is that you might work too hard and tire yourself out. It's OK for a while, but don't make a habit of it. You need to conserve your strength.
 You may have to consciously let go of some of your plans, Gemini, and simply leave things up to chance. The element of the unexpected can help you out quite a bit, so work with it instead of trying to keep it at bay. The natural flow of events should lead you toward a place of greater freedom. Use your imagination instead of relying completely on mental processes like logic.
 If you haven't gotten the love you want lately, Gemini, perhaps it's because you haven't asked for it. If you're involved with someone and feel unfulfilled, consider having a heart
 Things may be coming to a dramatic climax for you, Gemini. It may seem like everything is working against you. Take note that this is an excellent time to find balance and gain a much greater perspective on the issues in your life. If you're trying to figure out where your heart and brain are hiding, you should look on the opposite side of the world. They're over there discussing things together.
 Reading could take up a lot of your time today, Gemini. Books on psychology or the occult sciences might seem interesting, particularly as your intuition is operating on a higher level than usual. You might not want to talk about what's coming up for you, but that's OK. You will need to make sense of it first before you can share it with clarity.
 You might be feeling somewhat under the weather, Gemini. You're probably stressed and in need of rest. Work concerns could also be confusing. You might have a lot of tasks to do and not be certain where to start. Maybe you shouldn't start today at all. Perhaps you need to take the day off to rest and then tackle it tomorrow when you're feeling like yourself again. Think about it!
 A relationship with a close partner may get a bit confused, Gemini. You could react quickly to a situation without really thinking before speaking. There may be some confusion in your mind about whether to stay silent or take a more aggressive route and blurt out everything you feel. It's important that you find an equal balance of both.
 There's an emotional intensity inside you today that's squirming to find a way out, Gemini. Sudden outbursts are likely, so take care to hold your temper in check. Surround yourself with good friends who can support your erratic feelings. Don't be clingy. Seek friends who are thoughtful listeners, not permanent crutches. They may be feeling the same strong tension and don't need an extra burden.
 An increase in your financial status could lead to changes in your household. You might choose to redecorate or purchase new furniture or move to a better place. A household member might move out. Although it seems illogical, Gemini, the changes in your surroundings reflect the transformations taking place within you. Don't let fear or inertia hold you back. Go with the flow.
 An unexpected visit from a gloomy or depressed person might have you feeling a little disconcerted, Gemini. Don't try to be too cheerful. It's more important to be a good listener. You might also be a bit on edge today and jump at sudden noises. Take care not to read too much into it. This oversensitivity is only temporary and should pass within a few days.
 If you wake up this morning and feel glued to the bed, perhaps that's where you should spend the day, Gemini. You've been working hard and long these past few weeks. It only makes sense that your body would rebel eventually. This is a day for rest and relaxation. The office will survive without you. Call in sick and then turn off the phone. You're likely to sleep better than you have in a long time.
 You're gifted in ways you don't even know about, Gemini. Today you may uncover that gift unexpectedly. Perhaps you doodle a silly drawing in the margin of a note to a friend. Studying it reveals an idea that would be good for a children's book illustration. Perhaps there are other things you could do with your life. Research other possibilities online.
 Discussions with close friends could lead to ideas for creative projects of some kind, Gemini. Although the projects themselves may center on writing, music, drama, graphics, or teaching, today's brainstorming is likely to center more on business and marketing than artistic matters. Nonetheless, you could walk away feeling inspired and motivated. Write down your ideas.
 The healing of some childhood traumas could be triggered today, Gemini, perhaps through contact with someone who knew you then. Don't be surprised if you shed a few tears. This is a normal release. You could also suddenly laugh like crazy. Once this is all done, take your friend out for the evening and kick up your heels. That will help you lighten up and enable you to sleep.
 A long phone conversation could take place between you and a romantic partner, Gemini. You could discuss philosophy, current events, the weather, and your opinions. The only thing you probably won't touch on is the status of your relationship, which could be frustrating for you. Nonetheless, you will learn a lot about your feelings that will enable you to understand each other better.
 A letter, call, or visit from a lover or close friend is likely to bring interesting news your way. Your creative energies are at their peak, Gemini, so why not try writing, music, drawing, or painting? You will have to squeeze this creativity in between many errands, because the planets indicate you will take many short trips today.
 A member of your household who's recovering from an illness could express appreciation for all your help, Gemini. This might come as a surprise because serving your friends is second nature to you. Rest assured that whatever you've been doing has made a big difference to this person. Relax in the knowledge that you're loved, wanted, and appreciated. That can keep you going in the future.
 A fabulous career break could come your way today, Gemini. It could be a raise, promotion, or even a new job in a new field. It could also involve a completely different location. The work you will be doing may be unlike anything you've ever done before, and that's a challenge. Don't worry! Change is necessary if you're to reach your maximum potential. Go with the flow.
 Your intuition and imagination are operating at their peak today, Gemini. Don't be surprised if you get the urge to write or paint. Even if you don't have all the necessary equipment, get started anyway. Scribbles in a notebook can easily be copied onto more formal material later on. What's important today is that you get started. You're likely to produce something wonderful!
 You may be a bit on edge emotionally today, Gemini. You're likely to feel less self
 Too many communications may prove distracting today, Gemini. The phone could be ringing off the hook and your email inbox overflowing. Everyone around you seems to be talking at once. If you don't bring some order to this chaos, it could give you a headache! Let voicemail get the phone, get away from the computer, and take something light to the park to read. You need some peace and quiet.
 Your gracious, tender nature is likely to be extremely appreciated today, Gemini. You may feel as if your head is so far up in the clouds that you can't get anything done. The truth of the matter is that the work you need to do is actually found up in those clouds. Trust that you've taken care of the foundation. The thing you need to do now is relax and let your fantasies lead the way.
 You have a unique opportunity to review plans and foundations that you've recently put into place, Gemini. As carpenters say, "Measure twice and cut once." This is a key time to review your plans and make sure your structure is secure. If there's any doubt about what you've completed so far, consult someone whose expertise you trust. It may be worth it to start over using a new plan.
 Expect some changes in your household today, Gemini. You could finally be making some repairs or remodeling or redecorating. It's also possible that someone could move in or out. A visitor could also come to your door with interesting information that could change your life in some way. Whatever happens, don't expect a peaceful evening at home. There's likely to be a lot of activity!
 A new and previously unacknowledged talent for working in social, humanitarian, or spiritual fields could come to light today, Gemini. This could have you thinking seriously about changing jobs or pursuing an entirely new career. The opportunities are there if you look. If you're serious about this change, it's best to pursue it now. If you wait too long, the process might prove more difficult.
 Chances to pursue opportunities to bring whatever creative work you do best to the public could come up today, Gemini. This might involve performances, exhibitions, trade shows, or festivals 
 When it comes to love and romance, things are definitely in your favor, Gemini. The thing to be aware of today is that there might be some manipulation on the part of someone close to you. Take care that someone else's need for freedom isn't negatively affecting your relationship. Communication is key in order to maintain a healthy romance at any level.
 Being of service to others is important, Gemini, but make sure that you're taking care of yourself, too. Turn up the heat and let yourself expand into other worlds today. There may be an extra amount of dramatic flair that goes along with the events of the day, so participate in the absurd. This may be exactly the break from reality that you were hoping to find.
 You may find that your instincts are right, Gemini, particularly where other people are concerned. You and a friend could come up with the same words at the same time, which might be a little disconcerting for both of you. Still, this increased intuition is likely to help your understanding of those close to you more than you ever expected. Make the most of it, and remember what you learn.
 The good news is this 
 You might feel more energetic than you have in a long time, Gemini. The day's planetary aspects offer a powerful energy that will increase your mental acuity and physical strength, and this can really help you tackle and finish any tasks that have been piling up. If you manage to accomplish so much that you have time to spare, help others lighten their load. Tend to your own first, however.
 Are you satisfied with your current career, Gemini? If not, start by making a plan. There are specific steps that you can follow to take the greatest advantage of the available opportunities. Consider visiting career
 This is an excellent day to express your natural creativity, Gemini. The arts will likely be very important to you. You may find that nothing brings you more pleasure on days like this. Consider putting this to good use by painting, sculpting, doing crafts, or whatever you like. You will find that engaging in creative activities with a focus on giving may be the perfect thing for you.
 If you feel cautious today, Gemini, don't be alarmed. This can be a good thing, Gemini, as you can be too trusting at times or forget to take care when going into something new. Use a little caution in everything you do to keep safe. This is true with relationships, too. Give a little more thought and time to things to help you choose more wisely.
 You might have to make a choice between telling the truth and lying today, Gemini. In some circumstances, this can be difficult, especially if you're afraid you will hurt someone's feelings. Keep in mind that a lie can take more energy than the truth. Consider what you would want the other person to do in your place. Stick to your morals and ethics even if it's tough.
 Watch out for the green
 A project could be successfully completed today, Gemini. Discussions may already be taking place about the next one, but you aren't inclined to think about that, at least not right away. You will want to bask in your accomplishment and relax for a while. No one can blame you for that, so don't worry if you don't go to brainstorming sessions. Wait until it progresses beyond talk.
 Romance blossoms for you today, Gemini, and commitment or marriage may be just over the horizon. You and your beloved may have recently reached a new understanding that has bonded you more tightly. Don't feel silly if you spend the day together walking around in a romantic haze. That's perfectly acceptable 
 Today is a great day for you, Gemini. Everything is flowing your way as more pieces of the puzzle fall into place. Your fluctuating emotions are grounded and calm, letting you stand back and evaluate your true inner state. Have you been giving yourself the attention you deserve? This is your day. Get things done. You can accomplish quite a bit using this astral energy, so hop to it.
 Today a deep concern for others' feelings could have you lending a sympathetic ear to those in need of some understanding. It's more important to listen than talk, Gemini, even though your practicality might want to express itself. Your affairs should go smoothly, bringing you and those around you a lot of satisfaction. Don't be surprised if you shed a few tears of joy at some point.
 Changes in your home could cause temporary frustration that creates some tension with family members. Perhaps you're moving, cleaning, or refurnishing, and everyone is getting in everyone else's way. The best way to handle this situation is to try to get the job done as quickly as possible. Once it's done, Gemini, tempers will subside and all will be fine.
 Some rather depressing information could come to you today from far away, Gemini. This is less likely to be about your immediate situation or circle of friends than it is about something social or political in nature. It's probably the subject of a lot of talk around you. You might need to run some errands in your community, but for some reason you can't. Relax. Tomorrow should be fine.
 A romantic evening at home with your partner could bring you two closer together, Gemini. Your emotions are intense right now, however, so you need to use your intuition to judge exactly how much of your feelings you should reveal. An intellectual passion could also come your way. You might discover a new field of interest, and you will want to study it at home for hours.
 The bizarre nature of the day may leave you feeling a bit bewildered, Gemini. Don't sweat it. Focus on your romantic nature and incredibly nurturing heart. Use your instinctive healing abilities to care for a close friend in need. Today is an especially good day to connect with others and openly share your feelings. Confide in people you trust. Consider calling your mom.
 A phone call may come from someone you know is prone to gossip, Gemini. This person may have a lot to say, but be sure you take it with a grain of salt, if not the whole shaker. Your skepticism could prove invaluable in this respect. If what this person says is important, check out the facts before passing it on or taking any action. Chances are it's exaggerated or completely false.
 You may feel a bit protective today, Gemini, and with good reason. Others are likely to be aggressive when it comes to moving in on your territory. Be strong. Assure yourself as well as those in your charge that everything will be fine. Take reasonable precautions, but don't completely close yourself off to the outside world. That knock at the gate could just as easily provide much
 Aggressive people may interfere with your plans today, Gemini, so don't get too upset if things don't work out the way you want them to. Let this be an exercise in learning how to think and act on your feet. Remember that you can play this game as well as others. Deliver an unexpected surprise right back and see how they deal with it. Perhaps you can learn something.
 Today you may contemplate changes in your home. They could be physical, like redecorating, refurnishing, or remodeling. Or someone could move in or out. Whatever the change, it's likely to be fortunate. If you're thinking of such a change, you can proceed confidently. You should be feeling especially inspired now, so be creative and manifest whatever has been on your mind for some time.
 Friends or a group with which you're affiliated could want you to help them formulate a workable plan for advancement. You're in just the right frame of mind for this, Gemini, and therefore willing to roll up your sleeves and pitch in. You might be the center of attention at some point, perhaps sharing your skills with associates. Don't forget your own goals. They could be advanced today, too.
 You and your friends may have been planning a party for some time. Now you realize it's entirely up to you to actually make things happen, Gemini. It seems that if you're going to get anywhere, you need to take charge and delegate responsibility. You like to be in this position. Your great creative mind could give you a load of ideas for a party that no one will forget.
 You may feel like you need to work for a cause or political party, Gemini. The period you're in right now is bringing you closer to social issues or humanitarian causes and pushing you to think about what you can do for people less fortunate. You can help develop a new strategy as far as human relations are concerned. Don't hesitate to listen to your heart and be a little more generous in life.
 What meticulousness, Gemini! You may feel a sudden, urgent need to take a close look at your financial situation, wardrobe, cupboards, or car. List the things you need to do in order to fix them over the next few days. You're going to spend your day taking inventory in your life. Why not? It's important to get a really good look at the reality of things occasionally.
 Discussions in a group you're affiliated with could get heated as disagreements escalate. A goal you've been working toward might finally near fulfillment, Gemini, and tempers are short. You may avoid arguments, but the situation could still make you uncomfortable. You might decide to leave early and go for a workout or walk. This is a good idea. You will want to work off the frustration.
 Your focus today is likely to be on learning. Something you've wanted to study for a long time may finally be within your grasp. Perhaps money makes this possible, or you've finally settled on a workable course of action. Travel might be involved. If you've been thinking about going back to school, get everything started today. If you do, you will probably attain what you want. Go for it.
 A trip of some kind might have to be postponed, as computers and other technology involved in your arrangements might be temporarily out of operation. This can prove frustrating, Gemini, but it's beyond your control. The best thing to do is make new arrangements and move on. For the most part, everything is going very well for you, so don't give in to panic. Hang in there.
 A quick survey of the financial news might reveal that your investments, particularly those involving property, might be worth far more than you thought, Gemini. This might make you wonder if you should sit back and let it all mount up or actively put it to work for you. Consult a professional before taking any immediate action. You will want to be sure you're doing the right thing.
 Have you been thinking about attending a seminar of some kind, Gemini, perhaps business related? You and a partner might go together. This is a good time to do this, as your thinking is particularly clear and retentive and you find it easier than usual to concentrate. Discussions with your partner afterward could be the icing on the cake. Tomorrow you will feel like you can take the world by storm.
 You should be especially efficient in whatever work you need to get done today, Gemini. Your natural eye for detail is especially sharp. You're also feeling industrious, energetic, and efficient, so don't be surprised if others give you some admiring compliments. When the work is all done, you might reward yourself by making some definite plans for a vacation you've been dreaming about for a while.
 Changes you're making at home might necessitate your planning extra time, Gemini. Perhaps you're waiting for a guest whose plane got delayed, or your shopping trip takes much longer because you can't find what you're looking for. Whatever it is, don't panic. Just try to stay rational and think about other options or alternatives.
 The desire to improve your home's appearance might suddenly come over you today, Gemini. Whether you're planning some redecorating, landscaping, refurnishing, or simply a thorough cleaning, you will probably take the bull by the horns and concentrate on nothing else. The results will speak for themselves. Get family members to help you. You won't want to be too tired to enjoy what you've done.
 Now that you've earned your place in the world after all your hard work, Gemini, you might take some time to pursue your own interests. This could involve writing or publishing, going back to school to get an advanced degree, or taking a trip around the world. You have the time and energy to think about all your different options, so don't feel you have to rush.
 The approach of a very special visitor might cause you to thoroughly clean your house, Gemini. Afterward, you could look for new and interesting ways to dress it up with some new plants, throw pillows, or other decorative touches. This can be tiresome, but definitely worthwhile. When your friend arrives, he or she will feel at home. Work hard and then make yourself look great.
 This might be the perfect day to go out, Gemini, or stay in and turn off the phone. Friends and relatives could be stressed, and phone conversations could touch off some misunderstandings and cause unnecessary hurt feelings. If you must talk to people, keep the conversations light and brief. You won't want to mar a nearly perfect day.
 Job
 Some problems might arise with equipment that you use at home or with the structure of the house, Gemini. Appliances might go on the blink or the plumbing or electricity could require repairs. This could be a drag. It might involve staying home to wait for help. Still it must be done. Find a good book and settle onto the couch. You won't have to worry about this tomorrow.
 You can look forward to a busy day, Gemini. Don't schedule any additional tasks. Your home, family, or mate is likely to demand a great deal of you. In fact, Gemini, your energy is likely to be stretched to the breaking point, so be careful to keep some strength in reserve for yourself. If you give yourself completely, you're likely to strain your nerves.
 Prosperity isn't just around the corner 
 Today you may take a look around your home and see what needs improvement, Gemini. A pending visit from a friend or relative may provide the incentive to get things in shape. A fresh coat of paint and some new window treatments and rugs will make a big difference. If you don't have time for that, fill the house with flowering plants as an effective camouflage.
 You might try to learn a new computer program today, Gemini. You could find it a little confusing at first, but as you continue to learn, you will find that it makes things easier for you. You should master it more quickly than you thought. This may sound minor, but it will improve your productivity from now on, leaving you time to explore other possibilities or attend to important matters.
 A co
 Take a break from your daily routine and get off the treadmill today, Gemini. The world will turn without you for one day, so tune out for a while. Remember that whatever path you take is the right one. Regret is a useless emotion. Don't even bother with it. Enjoy the present day and all the small joys it has to offer. Communicate your dreams and bring things into balance.
 Some deeply buried feelings about your mother and family could come up from the past today and need release. Don't be afraid to show your pain and anger. If you're embarrassed to do it around others, Gemini, stay home and deal with it. This is a positive development. By the end of the day you might feel as if a large weight has been lifted from your shoulders.
 Your practical skills should be operating efficiently, Gemini. A creative or intellectual discipline that fascinates you might require some intense concentration today. You could spend much of the day in the library. You will want to take meticulous notes, but don't worry about it if you don't quite catch everything. Your memory should be sharp right now.
 Today you might work on a lot of writing, Gemini. It might be your own or editing the work of others. You could find what you're doing exciting and stimulating. Phone calls to interesting people could also take place. The only caution is don't tire yourself out. You could be on such an intellectual high that mundane matters like meals slip your mind.
 If you've been thinking about writing, teaching, or pursuing a career based on the dissemination of information, Gemini, this is the day to look into it. Your mind should be especially quick and sharp now. You will seek every possible detail that could shed light on the pros and cons of making such a change. Your heightened pace can also benefit whatever work you're doing.
 This is a great day to start a partnership of any kind, as it will prove cooperative, rewarding, and stable. Any legal papers executed today should definitely work for you, Gemini. If you've been thinking about signing up for a class or workshop, this is the day to do it. You're more likely to get the results you want. Make plans for travel, too. You've got a lot to think about.
 You could be expecting an important letter, call, or email today, Gemini, and sit on the edge of your chair waiting for it. This might be from a friend or lover. It could be delayed, and this might get you flustered. Distract yourself and do something else while you wait. If you make good use of the hours, the time will fly by.
 Books and conversations with friends could take up most of your day, Gemini. The intellectual stimulation could have positive and negative effects on your health. Positive because it raises your enthusiasm and puts you in an enthusiastic state of mind, and negative because it might get you so excited that you forget to eat or rest. Enjoy all the excitement but don't forget to take a break.
 A prominent male author whose work you enjoy might publish a new book. You may consider doing some writing of your own, particularly if you have a story to tell. On a more mundane level, your day could require that you spend a lot of time in the car or on the phone when you'd rather be reading. Be sure to schedule time to relax in the evening.
 Too much reading might have you experiencing eyestrain and possibly headaches, Gemini. It might help to have your eyes checked, but it's probably just too much stress. You might have some trouble focusing on whatever work you do today, but this is only a temporary condition. You should be back to your normal self tomorrow. Stay home tonight, listen to music, and take it easy.
 Unexpected responsibilities could interfere with plans to take a trip of some sort. Someone might need your help, and you may well have to put your own activities on hold for a while. This could be frustrating, Gemini. It only delays whatever you're doing but doesn't stop it. Take care of whatever you need to do and then continue with your plans. You will feel better if you do.
 Discussions with those close to you could lead to the discovery of new concepts, perhaps from foreign cultures. You will want to learn more about them, Gemini, as will your friends. You might even decide to plan a trip to a place where you could expand your knowledge of this new interest. Any trip planned today should go smoothly and be quite rewarding. Don't hesitate.
 You may not be sure what to think today, Gemini. Mental confusion could be the day's theme for you, but don't let it get you down. Realize that it's just one of those days when none of the pieces fit right. The truth is that they do fit somewhere, just not now. Lay low and wait for this phase to pass. Things will pick up soon as the fog lifts and you can see clearly again.
 Close relationships should grow closer today, and new relationships become close ones. You're likely to feel extremely warm and loving toward most of the people you know, and they should reciprocate that feeling. Romantic relationships, especially, could grow more intimate and physical. You like the way you feel, Gemini, but want to express it outwardly through gifts or intimacy.
 The morning might find you sitting like a stick in the mud, Gemini. People might be getting down on you for not contributing, but tell them to be patient. You will be raring to go by nightfall. The catalyst may come from an outside source. Be on the lookout for a challenge. Someone might rattle your cage a bit too much, so be patient and don't take it personally.
 You're going through a time of great preparation right now, Gemini, You're building the foundation for a major life project. This period isn't to be taken lightly. The day's energy brings this importance into focus. Make sure you're building with bricks and not straw, and that the mortar you use is strong. Try not to get discouraged by negative emotions. The situation is probably better than it seems.
 Today is a great day to check off all the items on that list of yours, Gemini. Get it done. At the same time, realize that your emotions might be a bit clouded and that things that seem genuine may actually be just a mirage. Issues of a spiritual nature are of primary concern. You should make sure you're nurturing this side of your being. Think with your heart.
 Attend to your duties today, Gemini. There's a pronounced sense of time and a feeling that the days are slipping away. Make sure you fit love and romance into the equation somewhere. At first you may experience a bit of resistance in this department, but see that as an indication that this is an area of your life that you need to explore and ultimately feel more comfortable with.
 Don't go where you aren't invited and don't take things that aren't offered, Gemini. Rules and manners are the cornerstones to healthy friendships and strong bonds among new acquaintances on a day like today. You will find that a cheery attitude and pleasant smile go a long way. Before you know it, you will be invited everywhere and offered all the things you desire.
 Issues regarding love and romance should be going well for you now, Gemini. You will find that your natural tendency to ground and plan is working perfectly with your desire to find what you want in a mate. Things may be about to come to a dramatic climax in your emotional realm. A foggy, dreamy feeling may make it difficult for you to keep your feet on the ground.
 Intense emotions are apt to dominate the scene today, Gemini. Don't do anything halfway. It's time to give it your all or nothing. You have the power to cut to the heart of the issue. Don't hesitate. If you meet opposition, stay strong. There's a valuable lesson to be learned. If you're being true to yourself, you should have no trouble overcoming any obstacle that stands in your path.
 You are very interested in all kinds of professions that concern humans, Gemini 
 Today you may get the opportunity to feel proud of yourself. But don't let things get too out of hand. It isn't often that you allow yourself this little bit of narcissism. Everything you say will be pertinent, and people will let you know. For once, the stars are giving you the opportunity to cater to your own ego, so take advantage of it!
 What a great day for you! You seem to have the innate listening abilities of a therapist or counselor. Everyone comes to you with their problems or to cry on your shoulder. They know that you will listen without judgment. Have you ever thought about doing something like this for a living? Perhaps today will make you think about it.
 You will fit in perfectly with just about every situation you encounter today, Gemini. Things are going well for you, so take advantage of the energy. You will find that you can accomplish a lot with very little effort. Other people will respect that. If something needs to be done meticulously and efficiently, you're the one for the job.
 The hard work and detail
 You have strong humanitarian instincts, Gemini. You think of your fellow humans more than most. This, combined with your intuition and empathy, makes you well suited for the healing professions. If you've felt a bit disgruntled at work lately, it may be that you're in the wrong career. Consider training as a counselor or therapist. You would be good at it and help a lot of people.
 You're conscientious where your health is concerned. You're one of the rare few who exercise and eat nutritious meals. Today you might want to expand your repertoire of medical remedies. If you've been struggling to shake a cold or allergy, consider some alternative medicines. They're moving more into the mainstream. Chinese herbs and acupuncture could just be what the New Age doctor ordered!
 Initiate a deep, meaningful conversation with someone you've lost touch with, Gemini. It could be that a long and ugly point of contention is on the brink of resolution. All you need to do is make the first move. There's a great deal of heartfelt, loving energy in the air that will help you foster a sensitive, tender approach. Find a connection with someone that you didn't know was there.
 Today could be the day you've been waiting for, Gemini. Realize that you have the gentle, sincere nature necessary to sweet
 Gemini, you shouldn't even try to find a reasonable explanation for what goes on around you today. There isn't one. Be carried by the tides of emotions from the past that run through your body and soul. There's no use trying to control them 
 Whether you acknowledge it or not, there's a child inside you who needs tending, Gemini. You're proud of the person you've become 
 It's important to take a hard look at yourself and know where you're going, Gemini. A little self
 Get out of the mud, Gemini. Have fun and don't worry too much about the consequences. Put your to
 Today is a terrific day in which you should find that things work very smoothly. You have a hardheaded approach that will help you get down to business and get things done. Make sure you're on solid ground before you take the next step upward. You have the ability to reach the summit of many mountains, so don't waste any time. Put on your boots and start climbing.
 Your thoughts may be scattered and frantic early in the day, Gemini, but things should settle down by evening. Your emotions will be more stable and you will be much more disciplined about tasks that need completion. Make a plan for the next few days and be practical about what you can accomplish. Don't set yourself up for failure by biting off more than you can chew.
 Take care of yourself and your needs, Gemini. There's an advantage to making sure your emotions are cared for and stable before you try to heal others. Your feelings are powerful and erratic today. You might find that other people try to oppose your beliefs. Stand up for yourself and be strong. Don't wait until the last minute to tell someone exactly how you feel about the situation.
 There are a couple important issues that you may need to resolve, Gemini. Take an active role in the department of love and romance. Feel free to be aggressive about having your needs met. Make sure you're comfortable with the situation or else stand up and change it. For you, the day is all about taking action. Strive to create peace through honest assertiveness.
 You may find that things are much lighter than they were the past couple days, Gemini. This is a good time to let your physical body take a rest and let your mind and fantasy world take over. Take a hot bath and soak for a while. Relax your brain and detach from your duties and obligations. Tread lightly and don't worry so much about what you need to do tomorrow. Concentrate on today.
 Regardless of how much the storm seems to be raging out of control, you will be able to handle it, Gemini. Have confidence in your grounded nature. There's a reason why you take the time to address the details and carefully plan your moves. Today is one day when you will see the rewards of your diligent actions, especially in love, beauty, and your deepest emotions.
 Plans for a trip could go awry today because of circumstances beyond your control. A postponement might be necessary. This might prove very frustrating for you because you've been anxious to get going. Don't question the workings of the Universe, and don't make yourself crazy over it. Whatever setbacks you suffer today might in the long run prove to be blessings in disguise.
 You could be feeling especially sociable today. Maybe there's a party of some kind in your neighborhood. You could hear some good news, and there is probably some truth to it, but take everything you hear through the grapevine with a grain of salt. Not everything you hear is based on fact. If you can, go to someone in a position to know and find out from him or her.
 You might wake up feeling a little under the weather, perhaps too tired to go anywhere, and you'll want to stay in. Perhaps this is the best course of action for today. You may be tired and a bit stressed out, Gemini, and more vulnerable than usual to any bugs may be going around at this time. Drink lots of juices and get some rest. Tomorrow you will probably feel much better.
 If you're involved with theater, dance, or painting, the day ahead will be a bright one for you, Gemini. You feel a strong desire to bring people together in pursuit of some artistic endeavor. Listen to your longings. You're likely to be a sharp talent scout, or at the very least, a person who is able to enhance other people's talents.
 You will float today, Gemini. You won't talk, you will be sleepy, and your mood won't be the best. OK, perfect! Get back into your novel, take several siestas, and do as little as possible, because that's what you want to do. Don't worry, busy beaver, this period will pass. And you know what? You aren't alone here. It happens to everyone from time to time. Flow with it.
 This is a good day to look at the big picture and discuss your ideas with others, Gemini. As you walk down the street, make sure you pay attention to what's going on around you. If you continue to be preoccupied by one issue, you may never see some of the other important pieces of the greater whole even though they're obvious to everyone else.
 Maintain a positive attitude, Gemini, and things will naturally flow your way. Tell a few jokes and keep things light and energetic. You will find that you can multitask very well and you have the ability to make everyone smile. Don't shy away from things 
 Your self
 There may be too much fiery energy in the day to make you feel comfortable with the situation, Gemini. Instead of trying to resist this powerful force, it would be better if you embraced it. Use this day to draw out some of your inner flame and let it radiate toward the people you care about the most. This is a day to take action on your feelings instead of swallow them without a word.
 Unguarded words on the part of a younger person might lead to upset. If the words are directed at you, don't take them seriously. The person doesn't know any better. If the words are directed at someone else, don't be tempted to lash out at the person who said them. Correct him or her gently. Either way, keep it to yourself and then forget it. It isn't worth the stress.
 There is some likelihood that the mood at home is fraught with tension, Gemini. Did you dare to express some contrary intellectual opinion? In any case, it looks like your self
 Put your foot down today, Gemini. Don't let others push you around. It could be that you're used to letting people have their way in order to keep the peace. The problem with this is that your dreams and goals may get lost in the shuffle. Don't lose sight of your true destination. There's much more to life than you might see on the surface. Dig deeper.
 Get things taken care of in the morning so you can be carefree and laid back in the evening. It's important for you to square things away in your head so you can communicate important information to others later. Feel free to take an unconventional approach. It's important to march to the beat of your own drum and not anyone else's.
 When the day is done, you will look back on it as an unusual one, Gemini. Wild ideas sprouted in your head like mushrooms. You may have imagined leaving immediately for a trip around the world, or drawn up plans for a housekeeping invention, or visualized an entirely new opening in the online world. Don't dismiss these ideas as unrealistic. They are not.
 You aren't the only one who can solve your problems, Gemini. Trust that there are others who are capable of understanding. Those who want to help you are motivated only by love, with no ulterior motives. It's in your nature to be skeptical, but these people do exist. And guess what? You could meet one of them today!
 Sticks and stones may break your bones, but names will never hurt you, Gemini. The problem with the energy today is that there may be some sticks and stones tossed in your direction. Be on the lookout for such objects. There are powerful forces operating that are charged with emotional aggression. War may break out if you aren't careful. Try to maintain the peace.
 Your imagination might conjure stories or pictures that you want to memorialize through writing or painting, but a lack of self
 You're going to be a valuable asset to others today because of your rational mind and ability to think things through clearly. The stubborn forces around you aren't going to bend, but you have the unique ability to do so. Do your best to avoid fights, even though it will be tempting for you and others to want to let off some steam.
 Are you tired, Gemini? It's no wonder. You're so eager to be useful that you've run yourself ragged over the past few weeks. As you may have noticed, the world is so apathetic now that every movement requires enormous effort on your part. Why not settle down and rest today? That would be the wisest and most reasonable thing to do. You will still be needed tomorrow.
 The latest equipment might suddenly be available to you. It's likely to make life easier and more interesting. It could also open doors to make new friends and find new opportunities. Increased income is also a possibility. You could stumble on some surprising information, Gemini, and this could set your mind going in a new direction. Today promises a lot of stimulation.
 It seems that the new planetary lineup has just opened up some doors that had previously been shut. You revel in the confidence that people have in you. It isn't that your abilities have changed, just your attitude! People trust you because you exhibit more self
 You can never be anyone other than who you are, Gemini! That's the way it is and you can't change it. Other members of your family may have dreamed of getting free of a duty or a moral lesson, but these dreams don't apply to you. Your dreams of being someone else are like phantoms that have come back to haunt you. Simply brush them away!
 You may have had some emotional disappointments lately, but today will restore your faith in love. All you need to do is take action. Your amazing lucidity and realism keep you from hoping for the impossible. You'd rather go to work to attain your goals than dilly
 You may be feeling emotionally good, Gemini, but unfortunately the people around you don't seem to share this feeling. Your first instinct may be to sacrifice yourself in order to make the path easier for the next guy. Remember that other people need to learn how to do things on their own. If someone is in a bad mood, let them be in a bad mood. You may be better off spending the day alone.
 If you're feeling irritable and wrung out today, Gemini, it may be a result of putting far too much pressure on yourself. It might be wise to take a look at the expectations you have of yourself. Consider if you would you place the same demands on those closest to you. If the answer is no, it's time to revamp your life to suit the one you're closest to 
 Be tactful when speaking today, Gemini. With this day's energy, it's important that you take the time to think about how your words affect the person you're talking to. It can be easier than usual to say the wrong thing, especially if you're in the position of telling someone something you think might not go over too well. Avoid comments that suggest criticism of the person rather than the deed.
 Today you might feel inspired to help others less fortunate, Gemini. The opportunity to do some volunteer work could come your way, perhaps for a church, charity, or other humanitarian organization. Or you could throw yourself into an artistic discipline. Either way, you're likely to enjoy yourself immensely and meet some interesting people in the process. Fundraising could be involved in some way.
 Your intuition should be very high right now, Gemini, as is your power of manifestation. Today you need to try to curb your thoughts and only think beautiful things, because you might find that whatever you think about seems to manifest! Some powerful dreams and visions can open up new lines of intellectual exploration for you that can have a potent effect on your immediate future. Go to it.
 As a Gemini, you have an innate gift for healing and calming other people in crisis situations. If this isn't what you do for a living, you should think about doing something with this natural talent. The positions of the planets today may be telling you to think about this in more concrete terms. If you're interested in herbal therapy, for example, this could be the perfect time to learn more.
 Have fun with loved ones, Gemini. Put your worries aside. Don't think of the possible negative consequences of having a good time. Focus on the fun and excitement of the moment. You have the ability to create fantastically strong bonds between you and your romantic partner. Love is in your favor, so act with confidence. There is no reason to feel bad or insecure in any way. Hold your head high.
 Today you may be feeling a little surer of yourself than usual. You can be fairly shy and reserved. Today you should try and make people a little more aware of you, to take you seriously. It's time that people respected you more, especially the people around you. Try to think of yourself before you think of other people. You're worth it!
 Obviously, you have an important role to play, Gemini. The mood today may be somewhat frustrating, but the way you handle it will earn you rewards and recognition in your workplace or at school. Your strength, self
 For the past several days, Gemini, you've been fairly lucky in financial and material terms. But the day ahead will be an exception. If you're planning to make an investment, sign a contract, or purchase a major item, postpone it until another day. You may as well resign yourself to this fate and be grateful that you were spared the chance to make a mistake!
 This day isn't likely to be the highlight of your week, Gemini. You may be aware of constraints at work or home. You're quite likely to hanker for an appropriate reward for your labor. Any type of recognition would be nice at this point. This is a good day to define new personal and professional goals. They'll sustain you through your unending chores.
 You may have been feeling more emotional lately, Gemini. Today a fanciful energy could sweep you off your feet and into another realm entirely. Feel free to take off for at least a little while in order to gain a better perspective on the issues at hand. Strong, forceful powers are urging you to let someone else take the reins on a particular project.
 You have a creative and artistic nature that you might want to put to good use today, Gemini. You could have some good ideas for home improvements. Perhaps you need some bookcases to help you get organized, or maybe you want a complete redecoration. Whatever you do, Gemini, it's bound to look beautiful. When it comes to artistic endeavors, you definitely have the touch.
 Today, Gemini, you can expect to be somewhat more enterprising in your relationships. You may find new friends or enjoy spending quality time with some old ones. Perhaps you will look forward to an intensification of your love life. With today's planetary configuration, you will surely find excellent resources for improving your emotional well
 You're entering a period of doubt, especially about your love life. You like your relationships and feelings to be clear. You may think a lot about your relationships over the next few days. Are you sure you've chosen the right person? Are his or her feelings sincere? Could you live without this person? The next two months will bring you the answers. Don't forget, no one is perfect.
 Electrical or plumbing problems with your house might come up. Call a professional, Gemini. Don't try to fix it yourself, because you could make it worse. Friends might want to visit, but tell them to wait until another day. Discussions could quickly deteriorate into arguments today. This is a great day to work quietly alone on whatever interests you the most.
 Powerful issues arise in your life that make it difficult to find peace, Gemini. Perhaps your first tendency is to confide in your partner. More than likely, this person is contributing to the difficulties you're now having. Your best bet is to spend some time alone. If you're already alone, so much the better. Cherish this time instead of letting it make you mad.
 Your mind could be going in many directions, Gemini. Direct your energy toward small projects that require intellect. Your energy is likely to come in waves, so use it wisely when you have it, and feel free to take a break when you don't. Tell your boss that you will be much more productive if you have a 20
 Your words may fall sharply on someone's ears today, so be aware of the impact you can have, Gemini. However, this doesn't mean that you need to dilute your message with lies in order to avoid the true topic of conversation. Just be conscious of the fact that a strong emotional response is apt to result when you open up to the truth and tell it like it is.
 Today you could complete a creative project that you've been working on for a while, Gemini. You will be more than happy with the results and inspired to move on to bigger and better things. You will feel strong enough to take on just about any type of project. It's possible that you might get started on the next one right away. Don't wear yourself out!
 A phone conversation with someone who lives far away might have you feeling a bit sad, reflecting on how much you miss that person. This can lead to pondering about your life. You might question the direction you seem to be moving in, and consider other possible options. You're likely to be cautious when it comes to making final decisions, Gemini. You will consider every detail.
 Information that comes your way today could launch you into a search for truth, Gemini. Perhaps this is a new business
 Problems with machines could have your nerves on edge. This may be one day when everything seems to break. Some problems you might be able to fix yourself, Gemini, but at least one may involve something that has to be replaced. This might be the one you need the most right now. Think of it as a sign from the Universe that you should do something else. That's the only way to stay sane.
 Today you might feel a bit bloated and slow, Gemini, which could interfere with your daily routine. You could also feel unmotivated about work. You might not feel like exercising, but it's important that you do it anyway. Moving the body can clear your head and put you in the proper frame of mind to get on with your day. It can also help purge your tissues of all the excess toxins.
 Is your workplace upgrading its equipment? Are you in the process of increasing your technology skills? Today's planets show that success and advancement through technology are definitely in the offing for you, Gemini. If you've been thinking about purchasing a computer, do it today if you can. Whatever your goals, you can harness current innovations to help them along. Give it some thought!
 Legal matters may be on your mind today, Gemini. Maybe your insecurities are blowing a certain difficulty all out of proportion. You need to view the entire situation a little more objectively. If you can find someone in the know, ask him or her to fill you in on the facts. You will be relieved to know you've been making mountains out of molehills. For now, try to relax and lighten up a little.
 Demands made by friends, children, or the special person in your life might have you feeling like you're moving in a dozen different directions at once. You may feel unfocused and scattered. You usually enjoy serving others, Gemini, but today you need to concentrate a little more on yourself. Show others how to help themselves and then go and do something you want to do. You deserve it!
 Difficult challenges that have been lingering on the sidelines will probably become more prominent today, Gemini. There is a strong possibility that things will come to a head. The problem was easy to overlook at first, but now that it has taken on a life of its own, you may have to consult someone who is more of an expert on these types of situations than you are.
 There should be no doubt in your mind about which way to proceed, Gemini. Don't let self
 You've had a strong propensity for war lately, Gemini. Your drive toward getting things done has rallied and you're anxious to make progress. The problem is that you might have to hold back a bit today, since there is a great force at work encouraging to you to take a break from your current trajectory. Slow down and make a plan instead of just plowing blindly ahead toward the unknown.
 You might want to escape the frenzy of the day by going shopping, Gemini. Align yourself with partners and allies who share your views. Try to keep the disagreements to a minimum. There is enough tension and war raging in the world around you today that you don't need to add to the negative force by contributing disputes and ailments to the situation.
 Answers may not be crystal clear today, Gemini. They probably won't be laid out in a neat and organized manner. Get out in the open air and join friends for a long bike ride. Fly a kite or feel the wind blow through your hair on top of a mountain peak. The answer is flowing through the air around you. Stop looking down at the ground for the information you seek.
 Don't be surprised if the old
 A friend could introduce you to an exciting new person for whom you feel a very powerful physical attraction, Gemini. This meeting could prove exciting, but stay calm and remain objective. If your feelings are too obvious, he or she could well lose interest before anything has time to develop! Just be yourself, enjoy the company, and have fun. That's all you need do at this point.
 There is some likelihood that the mood at home is fraught with tension. Did you have some intellectual disagreement? In any case, it looks as though your self

Perhaps you've wanted to return to college and get an advanced degree, take a trip around the world, or try writing and publishing. Whatever it is, your schedule should be freer and more flexible than ever, so this is the time to go for it. Start planning today!
 A book or movie about a foreign country could capture your imagination and make that country seem especially appealing, Gemini. You might toy with the idea of taking a trip there soon. If you're serious, it might be a good idea to start making your plans. You're in a particularly practical frame of mind and have the enthusiasm to do it. Have fun browsing through travel brochures and maps.
 A lot of paperwork might need attention today, Gemini. You might throw a lot of your focus and energy into getting it all done. Stimulating conversations with colleagues could keep your mind occupied so you avoid boredom. You could take a walk at the end of the day, since you're apt to encounter so much new information that you will want to clear your head in order to absorb it all.
 Are things getting a little bit crazy, Gemini? Too many tasks and too many people vying for your attention could have your nerves stretched as taut as violin strings. Try to get outside for a while. Treat yourself to a nice lunch or do a little shopping. Take a good long nap. Whatever seems so urgent isn't worth sacrificing your peace of mind. Try to stay focused!
 You may feel like you desperately need something, Gemini, yet you're unsure as to what it is exactly. Someone close to you may be trying to fit the missing puzzle piece into place, but this may be next to impossible if it's unclear which piece is actually missing. This difficult situation may lead to frustration if you aren't careful. Feel free to admit that you feel powerless. Don't be ashamed to say so.
 You're likely now on the brink of completing a major move of some sort. Your first reaction may be to sit in solitary deliberation as you wrestle with the pros and cons of each piece of the situation. Try not to overload your head with too many details. Look at the overall picture. Perhaps you will find the answer you seek on a walk. During that time you can clear your head of unnecessary clutter.
 This is a fantastic time for you for love and romance, Gemini, even if there's a bit of coolness between you and the person you care about. It's possible that there needs to be an element of distance now for you to really appreciate the good thing you have. If you aren't involved with someone now, you should find that you're in a good position to make a move toward someone you feel strongly about.
 Be aware that love is likely to wear some sort of disguise today, Gemini. There's something fanciful about the way in which this new romance will manifest, so get ready. Don't think that love always has to be planned and calculated. There is a strong sense of spontaneity associated with the delicious love interest of the day. Don't dismiss those who don't seem practical or levelheaded enough for you.
 An unexpected package could arrive, possibly shipped from far away. The circumstances could be rather strange. Friends or relatives that you might not expect could suddenly show up, and you could spend a frantic hour or two organizing an impromptu party. This can be very gratifying, Gemini, but don't wear yourself out. Everyone should have a good time no matter what.
 Get on the fast track and use your powerful words and creative mind to make quick decisions that are mindful yet spontaneous. If you get in a pinch today, Gemini, don't worry about it. Simply relax, take a deep breath, and let your intuition guide you to the right path. Instead of wasting your energy thrashing helplessly in the water, call for help.
 Don't get so stuck in your ways today that you insist on having the one true answer without really considering the options. You must be aware of a lot before you commit yourself one way or another. The people around you are apt to get annoyed with your narrow
 Add spark to your life today, Gemini. It could be that things are getting stale and boring. If so, consider the possibility that you simply aren't challenging yourself enough. Remember that you're responsible for lighting your own fire. You have the perfect opportunity to get something started today, so go for it. Feel free to get other people to help.

Your income may soon skyrocket, and more opportunities to advance yourself professionally should start coming thick and fast. You may even receive some sort of public acknowledgment. This isn't the end of the line, however 
 You may discover an untapped talent today, Gemini. Perhaps there's a new machine in the office and you're the only one who can figure out how to use it. Maybe drafting a simple business proposal makes you realize how much you enjoy the writing process. This is a good day for any kind of creative endeavor, as well as for paperwork of all sorts. Get everything done so you can enjoy the evening.
 This is a good day to reflect on the past weeks and get some perspective, Gemini. You've probably been working too hard and neglecting other priorities in your life. Give yourself this day to relax and visit with friends and relatives. Spend the day chatting, laughing, and unwinding. Don't obsess about tasks that wait for you at the office. They aren't going anywhere.
 A lot of creative work may need to be finished by today, Gemini. If you're professionally involved with writing, a deadline may loom. It could be difficult to get it done because family members and guests could constantly go in and out and keep you from concentrating. The best course of action might be to go somewhere quiet, like a library, and do your work there. Think about it!
 The arrival of a surprise visitor could generate mixed feelings, Gemini. On the one hand, you're probably glad to resume contact with this person. On the other, because you weren't expecting any guests, it could create extra work for you

An opportunity could pave the way for new jobs you could do at home, in your own space, among your own belongings. This could add to your sense of security. The only downside could be if you don't make the effort, you might never leave the house. Join a health club!
 The time is right for all things financial, Gemini. If you've been thinking of signing a contract to accept a job or purchase a piece of property, go ahead. Strategize ways in which you can be even more financially successful in the future. You have a lot of skills, but you don't always apply them as carefully as you could. Correct this and you'll be unstoppable!
 A visitor to your house may have some juicy gossip for you, Gemini. Perhaps someone is getting married. You aren't the type to put too much stock in gossip, but your guest could be so convincing that you believe everything. Be skeptical! What you're hearing may not be outright lies, but it could be exaggerated. Wait until you see the people in question before accepting it as truth.
 An opportunity to increase your income by working in an artistic or innovative manner could come your way today, Gemini. Technologies like film or computer graphics may be involved.

If it seems workable, go for it!

Presently, great success and good fortune are indicated when you assert your considerable energy and focus on the subject matter. If you've been considering honing your communication skills, consider a writing course. Perhaps you want to organize a long
 There could be trouble brewing in the workplace, Gemini. Some of your colleagues neither like nor trust each other and find it impossible to work together. Adjustments are needed if everyone is going to work to the best of their abilities. If you're in a position to handle this, do it now. If you aren't, distance yourself from the situation. It's the only way to stay sane!
 Does your house look like a cyclone hit it? Your tidy nature should drive you to clean it up. In the course of wading through the mess, don't be surprised if you discover some objects you thought you'd lost forever. Once you finish, you'll probably find that the place looks beautiful, better than it did before it was messed up. Something good can indeed come out of chaos.
 You might not get the things done that you want to do today, Gemini, but don't sweat it. Go easy on yourself if you still have a few unchecked things on the list tonight. People may pop out of nowhere and demand your attention for much of the time. Listen, be present, and try not to think of the things that aren't getting done. Focus on those things that are getting done.
 Your home could be a busy place today as friends from far away come by for a long

Enjoy your day.
 Yes, you may have another cookie, Gemini. Enjoy it and don't feel guilty. Guilt is useless. Today, get rid of regret. Express your emotions but don't dwell on them. Your sensitivity is acute, so put up your psychic shield. You might pick up on others' intense energy, so be careful. Sympathize with others, but don't take on their garbage. They need to take out their own trash.
 Ask for help if you need it, Gemini. Your nature is to serve others, but in order to maintain that energy, make sure that you're taken care of as well. Offer extra hugs to the people you love. In work
 A financial windfall might open new doors for you, Gemini, and you could consider making some major changes in your life. You might think about moving to a nicer home. Romance is definitely on your mind. If you aren't already involved in a domestic situation, you might consider it seriously right now. Change can be frightening, but these changes are good. Don't hesitate.
 Stress could have you feeling uncommunicative today. You probably aren't going to want to talk to anyone, even your dearest friend, Gemini. This might prove difficult, as people around you are going to ask for advice and help. Keep your cool. This feeling will pass and you won't want anyone to think you're upset. Go to lunch alone, and tonight crash on the bed with a good book.
 Your health should be in top shape today, Gemini. You're likely to feel physically, emotionally, and spiritually strong and ready to tap into your inner power. Dreams may make it possible to release old traumas and move ahead. An increased understanding of the needs and desires of others enriches your relationships. Take heart from past success, continue as you are, and enjoy your day.
 Don't let others' bad moods get you down, Gemini. And don't feel it's your responsibility to cheer them up. Their moodiness is their business, not yours. You could be a little bit anxious today, and allowing yourself to be negatively influenced by others will do you no good at all. The general atmosphere will improve in a few days.
