 With some leisure time on your hands, you'll find an opportunity to start fresh in some area that has challenged you, Taurus. Find the courage to examine your attitudes toward adverse situations. Armed with your new knowledge, you might have a new insight that allows you to approach an old problem in a different way. You'll discover that you have more power than you thought.
 You might feel cheerful and generous today, Taurus. Helping others will probably suit you, and matters will move along smoothly. If there are outstanding projects from earlier, tackle them first. It's an opportune time to get caught up on challenges. Don't hesitate to lend a hand if you're approached or notice someone in need. This will benefit them as well as you.
 Whatever your situation, Taurus, today you could encounter someone exciting who stirs a powerful romantic attraction within you. This can be delightful, and there's no reason why you shouldn't enjoy the company, but be a little cautious before taking any action. Get to know this person better before you decide on any sort of involvement, casual or serious. All may not be as it seems.
 Don't delude yourself, Taurus. While it can be a real temptation to see what you want to see, there's danger in doing so. A pipe dream can only last so long. It's never permanent! Rather than playing this kind of trick on yourself, take off the blinders and face what's before you. Even if it hurts, it will likely be far less painful now than later.
 Relationships may be a bit difficult, Taurus, so don't force pleasantry if it doesn't come naturally. Your motto today should be, "If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all." Perhaps this leaves you tongue
 If you meet new people today, Taurus, be careful. Some can appear interesting because they're bold or dangerous. Perhaps they do things you'd never dream of doing. While this may be intriguing, it can lead to trouble and hurt you if you aren't careful. Stick to your usual standards and ethics. If danger excites you too much, it may be time to make some changes in your life.
 Taking time alone is essential for everyone, Taurus, but recognize when you're isolating yourself to the point where it's unhealthy. If you ask why you're taking this time and answer because you're avoiding something or someone, you need to reconsider. Things will only build and get worse under these conditions. You begin to work things out by facing whatever it is that's upsetting you.
 There's a chance that incredible luck will befall you, Taurus, but nothing will come without hard work on your part. Don't expect someone else to hand you the treasure chest. You have the map in your hand, so follow it. Once you start, you may realize that you're much closer than you think. It's up to you to make the journey. There's a great deal of help for you along the way.
 You may be confused by your heart, Taurus. It may be extremely frustrating when you can't keep a tight rein on your emotions. This internal conflict is a signal that there's a lesson to learn. Perhaps your heart knows something that your conscious mind hasn't yet realized.
 Everyone is likely to be making demands on you right now, which can have you in a dither. A career success could be offset by an upset with a partner over a miscommunication. This should be worked out, but it might take the wind out of your sails if you let it, Taurus. It would be a good idea to derail any upset before it runs you down. Invite your partner out to celebrate!
 Extend the day by getting up earlier than usual, Taurus. Even though it may be hard to leave the comfort of your bed, the rewards will be many. The celestial energy beckons you to get up and join the activities of the day. You'll be much more productive and accomplish a lot by the end of the day.
 Today it looks like you might not be able to attend a group activity that you've been anticipating, Taurus. Other pressing matters may demand your immediate attention. This could prove frustrating. However, if you work quickly and efficiently, you might be able to make it after all. Budget your time carefully and get to it!
 You may be a bit depressed today if you and your partner are going through a difficult time. Maybe there's something unspoken that brings tension and awkwardness into your life together. Try to find the root of the problem. It will only get worse if you don't talk about it. Don't get too emotional when you bring it up. Just ask if your partner is bothered by something.
 A surge of passion could dominate your day unless you find an outlet for it, Taurus. An intimate evening with a lover would be a good idea. Creative passion is also strong, and you could be hit with sudden inspiration, perhaps influenced by distant places. Don't be afraid to take time out from your mundane chores to pursue this inspiration. Creativity is as important as anything else.
 An unexpected invitation to a social event could put you in touch with unusual, fascinating people, Taurus. Some of them may be involved in professions that interest you. Some may become your friends and others might prove to be valuable business contacts. New opportunities could come your way as a result. Whatever invitations come your way, don't turn them down. You might miss something wonderful.
 Do you work with a lot of documents, Taurus? If so, you might find today that some of the papers you need are missing. They might seem to have vanished into a black hole. Look everywhere, of course, but chances are that someone has them and isn't aware of it. Don't be too shy to ask people about the papers. You could save yourself a lot of unnecessary effort this way.
 Are you picking up on some unsettling feelings from a friend who lives far away, Taurus? You may wonder if there's something wrong in this person's life. Perhaps you'd better give your friend a call. You'll probably find out that whatever is troubling him or her is minor and nothing that can't be dealt with. Anyway, it will be good to catch up!
 This isn't a good day to get together with your romantic partner, Taurus, or even talk on the phone at length. Keep your conversations brief and make arrangements to meet in a few days. Your friend could be in a very agitated state of mind and might take offense at an innocent remark from you. This could cause an unpleasant quarrel. Be patient!
 Love is in the air for you, Taurus. You will be rewarded handsomely because you have so many things to offer. Spread your love everywhere. Skip from place to place and person to person, receiving smiles of pleasure. Put your worries aside. There's every reason to be happy. Laughter keeps you young.
 Your flamboyant approach may not get as much attention today as you'd like, Taurus. Don't push yourself to achieve something that isn't working. By insisting that something should be done your way, you'll only create enemies and bottlenecks in whatever task you're trying to accomplish. A thoughtful, conscious, reserved approach is going to win today.
 Everyone knows that nothing can stop you when you're determined to get something done. As long as other people are on your side today, you will be amazed at all the things you can accomplish. But don't get too excited, Taurus, because it's time to take care of those thankless tasks that no one wants to deal with. You may need other people's help to get them done.
 Children are highlighted today, Taurus, either yours or someone else's. You could be in one of the healing professions. If you're a nurse or doctor, you may have the opportunity to make a big difference in the life of one of your patients. If you're a parent, see if you can spend extra time with your children. You will all benefit from some quality time together.
 If you don't feel that you make enough money, this is the time to do something about it, Taurus. Are you sure you're doing everything you can to earn as much as possible? Perhaps you've wanted to change jobs for quite some time but something is holding you back. What do you think? Try to figure it out.
 You may not feel in the mood to fight today, Taurus. If someone challenges you, talk your way out of it. You will probably be able to win any battle with your words. Try sensitive reasoning instead of open combat. Listen carefully to the concerns of the opposing side and make your move accordingly. This isn't a contest. It's a conversation among friends.
 Today may feel like everything's coming to a head for you, Taurus. Even the slightest action might face resistance. The more stubborn your attitude, the harder it will be to progress. Your job is to infuse playfulness into every situation. Remind people that we're all on this stage together. We need to make the most of it, not shove each other out of the spotlight.
 If you don't agree with what the group is doing today, Taurus, don't feel like you have to join in. Earn their respect in your own way, not by forcing yourself into a mold you don't fit into. Maintain your integrity and act with confidence. If you're confident about your actions, others will put their confidence in you. Don't compromise your beliefs.
 Once you start talking about a certain topic, Taurus, it might be hard to stop, especially if the topic is you or one of your activities. A question about one aspect of your life may come up and you could have a sudden desire to tell your whole life story. Other people are going to want to voice their opinions, too, so take a breath and give them a chance.
 The thing you dread the most could be the very thing you need the most in your life, Taurus. You're at a point right now when the lessons that come might be hard to swallow, but they're necessary. Don't try to resist what you know you must face. Approach things with courage instead of fear and you can conquer anything. Once you climb the mountain, the rest is downhill.
 Let the child within come out and play, Taurus. Return to and relish your most primal state. Some of life's most important lessons are the ones you learned when you were a child. Return to that state of mind and embrace the simplicity of life you experienced then. Life is only complicated because you make it so. Remember what it was like to live without care and live that way again.
 Someone or something may intimidate you and make you want to retreat, Taurus. But this person or situation is the very thing you need now in order to do what you have to do. Opportunities are there for you even though they may be disguised. Once you find them you will know. Have confidence that you're ready for the next step in your journey.
 You may have a feeling that if you don't have something positive to say, you shouldn't say anything. This idea could keep you tongue
 Dependability and stability are key aspects of today, Taurus. Take action that will prove to others that these parts of your nature are fully functional. Other people may be stubborn and not easily moved. You will have to fight to get your viewpoint across. You may need to get out the bulldozer. Maintain tenderness in all your relations with others.
 Love is coming your way, Taurus. You're likely to be more passionate than usual. Be careful that your enthusiasm for the object of your desire doesn't go overboard. It's possible that you have an unrealistic view of the situation. It also could be that someone is leading you on and making you think something that isn't completely true.
 You may be in a difficult position today, Taurus, as if you're being pulled in two directions with little say as to how things are supposed to end. The acting forces could be manipulative, so you should take special care that no one takes advantage of you. This may be easier said than done at a time like this.
 This is a passionate, creative day, Taurus. Your blood is hot and passion is on your mind. With luck, you have a significant other who can benefit! If not, you will have to find another way to burn off that energy. Invite a close friend for a jog. You're in the mood to socialize. If you can't have physical intimacy, be satisfied with emotional closeness.
 There's a great wind under your wings today, Taurus, and you may find the day's energy quite transforming. You now have the opportunity to make great strides in whatever you wish to accomplish.

 The day ahead will be trying for you, Taurus. You will have a fire raging inside. You may have a speech to deliver or a private performance to put on for your loved ones.

Communication is the key to expanding your world in many ways.
 You tend to keep to yourself, Taurus, but today you could be inspired to join a group activity. Perhaps some friends have invited you to come out for drinks.

 Things may get a bit confusing today, Taurus. Don't feel like you need to make sense of it all. In fact, that may be impossible. Whatever you do, make sure you're being yourself. Let your creative nature shine through. Other people are quite malleable, so you should take the lead in just about any situation. Make sure that you're considerate of other people's needs.
 Stop being an enabler to someone you care about, Taurus. You may let someone continue a dangerous addictive behavior simply because you want to avoid a confrontation.

 Suddenly things are coming to a head for you, Taurus. The drama is escalating and you aren't sure if you can remember all your lines. Take things one step at a time.

It's likely that you will run into conflict regarding an issue you feel strongly about. People may be stubborn, so prepare for a stalemate rather than any sort of resolution.

The energy of the day could leave you feeling ragged, but don't give up. Your persistence will pay off in the end.
 You're going to get it all today, Taurus. You may not feel especially powerful, and in fact there may be those who try to make you feel incompetent.

Today you're especially sensitive to others, so be prepared to hear a sad story. Otherwise, your day should go well.

They haven't, but it will make you feel better if you squeeze in a few hours for your friends each week. Remember what they say about all work and no play.
 You might feel creative, artistic, and full of ideas for new projects. However, Taurus, other responsibilities could keep you from starting on them. At the same time, your mind could be so focused on them that your other work takes longer than it should. Write down your ideas before they escape, then concentrate on the tasks at hand. Finish those and then you can pursue what you really want.
 Social events or group activities concerned primarily with spiritual, metaphysical, social, or humanitarian issues could take place in your community today, Taurus.

Stabilize your mind and create space to grow. Take some of the advice that you give to others and apply it to yourself.

And this becomes especially painful when you take a look at the happy children full of joy around you. You may think that it's time for you to do something about it. You may be right.
 The period you're in now is about getting ahead, Taurus. If you've been dissatisfied with some aspect of your career over the last few months, don't wait any longer to do something about it. Things aren't going to get better all by themselves. You need to remold your reality to fit your goals and aspirations. This would be a perfect day to ask for a raise if you feel you deserve one.
 This is a good day to spend some time alone, Taurus. You may have projects you want to finish, and you have the energy to get a lot done.

Get out on your own, then work on whatever you want. This way you will enjoy your day.
 Today an important goal might reach a point you've been aiming at for a long time. All those in your entourage have new respect for you. In fact, Taurus, relationships of all kinds are warm, open, and honest, and you will probably enjoy the company of others immensely now. Romance, in particular, goes well. Feel free to indulge in a little celebration.
 More than one problem with modern equipment could rear its head today, Taurus. Computers could malfunction, crash, or be maddeningly slow. You might also have a hard time reaching people you need to talk to. Don't be tempted to blow your top. That won't accomplish anything. Just call the technicians and get it handled. Tomorrow everything should be back to normal.
 Correspondence with someone who lives far away could appear to lead to something more than friendship, Taurus. This person seems to be in total accord with you about nearly everything, and warm feelings could flow between you. However, if you haven't met in person, you should, at least before you get your hopes up for a relationship. It may be just what you've wanted 
 It should be easier than usual to concentrate on the practical aspects of finances, Taurus. A keener mind combines with enhanced intuition to give you a special edge when it comes to making decisions on everything that concern money, so make the most of it while you can. Connect with the people you love tonight.
 You may need to take care of paperwork related to financial matters today, Taurus. You will pay bills, make deposits, or balance checkbooks.

In the evening, go to a movie and forget about money for a while.
 Generally you avoid politics in any group you belong to, Taurus, but today you might get caught up in the fray in order to support a friend. This goes against your grain. Be sure and assess the situation carefully before getting too involved. Friend or not, you aren't going to want to alienate anyone in the group. Think about it. Is it worth it?
 Are you involved in an ambitious, creative project of some kind, Taurus? You might have so much to do that you decide to take on a partner, if you haven't already.

You will need the comfort if nothing else.
 The day may be somewhat trying for you, Taurus. You may have a speech to deliver or a private performance to put on for your beloved. In any case, you will have to prove yourself, and you will spare no energy in the attempt. By the end of the day, you will be satisfied but completely drained. Plan to rest afterward. You will have earned it.
 You have the creative ability to make a real go of your music or writing. Why not put it to better use? Are you afraid to take the risk?

 Conversation and travel are highlighted today, Taurus. You may sit next to someone fascinating on a plane ride. You two have much in common, and the time will pass quickly as you enjoy discovering more about one another. You're likely to exchange phone numbers, if not kisses, by the end of the trip. There's no denying the chemistry. The question remains whether you will act on it or not.
 A friend from far away could contact you by phone, email, or even in person, Taurus. This person might bring great news that suddenly turns your life in a new direction. This could involve a new intellectual study or possibly a new circle of friends. At any rate, you will certainly enjoy catching up and hearing what your friend has to say.
 Some problems with the structure of your house may need attention, Taurus. Perhaps the plumbing or electrical wiring isn't operating at maximum efficiency.

 Be the star of your own movie and proud of the role you play, Taurus. You might find yourself taking on many different characters, depending on your mood of the hour.

You could lapse into some very pleasant daydreams about the possibilities, but don't get carried away. Try to remain practical.
 Various personal issues might be on your mind today, Taurus. You could want to work them all out without distractions, so you may decide to spend part of the day alone.

Work out the matters that seem most pressing and save the rest for later.
 Your social life might suddenly be busier than you expected, Taurus, perhaps because of the appearance of some interesting new people.

Stimulating conversations could set your mind going a mile a minute.
 Today you might have to do a lot of communicating with friends. Perhaps you need to make phone calls or catch up on correspondence. You may be on the verge of attaining a goal.

By the end of the day, all should be well again.
 Everything should be going great for your career, Taurus. It may all seem too good to be true, but rest assured that it's real.

It would probably be a good thing if you worked on incorporating other people's opinions into your own.
 Your romantic side is powerfully charged today, Taurus. The more you tune in to this side of your nature, the happier you will be.

 There's a warm and friendly feeling to the day that you will find agreeable to your boisterous personality, Taurus.

 Get your life in order today, Taurus. Take off the mask you've been wearing and look in the mirror. Make sure you like the person you see.

Store up your resources instead of squandering them all now.
 The more you let your ego and fantasies swell today, Taurus, the more friction you will encounter. Others aren't going to be fooled, nor are they going to want to deal with frivolity. You might consider letting someone else take the lead while you focus more on your internal energy. Don't be surprised if you cry for no apparent reason. It's important that the tears come out.
 You greet the day energized! Your confidence is at an all
 Your artistic side likes to mingle with people who are a shade off normal. You call them eccentric 
 The world probably isn't going to revolve around you today, Taurus, so get used to it. Even though this may not be the news you want to hear, it's probably the news you most need to hear. Use your incredible passion to nurture others. Think less about yourself and more about the people around you, especially your family. Stick close to home and take care of chores.
 Be careful about the way your words come across to others, Taurus. You might not realize how much other people's feelings are affected until it's too late. Consider backing off for a while and taking a break from your normal performance. Practice your lines at home.

 There are days when you should take everything with a grain of salt. Today you may realize how important it is to gain the appreciation and respect of a certain person.

 You have a lot to offer, Taurus. Everyone appreciates what you have to contribute. Yet you've been unable to give yourself credit for all that you've accomplished. It would be worthwhile to take some time to contemplate why this is so. You have a strong need to be loved, but you must first love yourself. Your family and friends will support you, but first you must support yourself.
 Your greatest quality is generosity, Taurus. Your nature isn't to give to others in order to get something back but for the pleasure of giving. This is how you get power and light.

 Let your fun
 Taurus, this may prove a challenging day for you. You're used to being the sovereign surrounded by courtiers currying your favor. There's something trying to draw attention away from you, reminding you that there are other people on this planet besides you. An unexpected messenger may crop up to remind you that not everything revolves around your existence.
 Ignite the fire in your heart, Taurus, and make it burn more brightly than before. Keep in mind that you may need to make compromises in order to be on the same page with your lover in the way you relate emotionally. Make sure everyone gets a chance to be on center stage. Don't hog the podium. Maintain a working balance by letting others have their turn in the spotlight.
 Maintain an air of detachment, Taurus. Feel free to delve into your fantasy world and let your emotions carry you to another realm. Today is one of those days when you might come up with a new invention that could become the next must
 A solid grounding is apt to be extremely important to you today, Taurus. Hearts may be broken or won, depending on how well you play your cards. Keep in mind that the slow and steady contender is most likely going to win this race. All the talk in the world will get you nowhere. Today is about quality and action. Shoddy efforts will yield shoddy results.
 A disagreement with a business or romantic partner could turn into an argument today. This won't do anything to increase the effectiveness of your relationship, Taurus. If the smallest hint of a difference of opinion comes up, try to settle it before it gets too heated. Try to be objective and see the other person's point of view. Don't let a minor dispute turn into a power struggle.
 A new neighbor could arrive who you feel especially drawn to, Taurus. You might have high hopes for a friendship with this person. He or she may seem especially congenial and share a lot of your interests, and this could seem almost too perfect. However, you're in just the mood to idealize new relationships, so don't get too excited until you get to know this person better.
 New people may come into your life today. If you get bad vibes from one of them, trust your instincts! Signs are that you will meet at least one new acquaintance who isn't trustworthy. This isn't a good day to enter into any kind of partnership, nor is it a good day to get married or even propose marriage. Put all plans for cementing partnerships on hold for a few days!
 Most people form their opinions on the basis of what they're told by a few people who supposedly know what they're talking about. Certain ideas become fashionable. Today, Taurus, you have no patience for these tendencies. In fact, you're tempted to use vulgar language just to shock the pseudo

A clear mind allows you to see the truth of what's really going on.
 This is an important day for you to give thanks for all that you have, Taurus. Give your loved ones extra hugs and let them know how much they mean to you.

 Connect with the person sitting next to you on the bus, Taurus, or the one behind you in line at the store. He or she may have a piece of wisdom to share that will change your life forever.

 Things should go well for you today, Taurus, especially in the love and romance department. Don't shy away from the obvious attraction that you have toward one special person.

There is magic in the attention that you give and receive.
 Family members could be upset over different frustrating events in their lives, and these moods could spill over to you. Today it would be best to leave them alone to work things out in their own way. They aren't likely to respond to sympathy. Take this opportunity to tend to some of your concerns that you may have postponed. This way, the silence in the house can work for you.
 Do you feel a little under the weather, Taurus? It's possible, considering all the emotional turmoil you've been through lately. It takes time to recover from those storms.

 You will probably want everyone to know how you feel today, Taurus. You won't be shy about expressing your emotions. Feel free to take the lead on matters, for you have the self
 You may feel a bit stodgy today, Taurus, but things are going to pick up tonight. There will be a great deal of air to fuel your fire, and you're ready to burn! You could be like a desert of dry sagebrush just ready to be set alight. The whole mountainside is about to go up in a beautiful blaze of glory. You're ready to shine like the brilliant star that you are.
 What an odd day, Taurus! You feel like you've been given a one
 What do you have to lose, Taurus? The planets are shaking you in the hopes of ridding you of your old objectives to make way for new growth. You feel doubt where once there was only certainty. When you consider the worst that can happen, it may help you to realize that what you're clinging to really isn't all that important. It's time to let go and begin anew.
 We need to have more people like you in places of power, Taurus. And don't feel like it's out of the question. Today's astrological weather is helping you find the confidence and physical strength you need to boost your leadership abilities. This is the time to take control of the situation. You can do it!
 Pride might get in your way today, Taurus. Perhaps you will be asked to do a task that you consider beneath you. Perhaps the people around you are feeling persnickety. Rise above the insults and make a special effort to do the best you can, defusing the situation before it gets out of hand. Tonight enjoy an evening at a concert or the theater.
 There is a great deal of emotion and drive to the day, just the way you like it, Taurus. Make sure you don't get stuck with the short end of the stick as the day comes to a close. An honest fight or debate is one thing, but a harsh manipulation of people is another. Make sure you're involved in the former and not the latter.
 Perhaps you notice some weariness today, Taurus. You have been much more active than usual for the past few weeks. You've been meeting new people, having new experiences, attending meetings, and perhaps even taking short trips. In the long run, will any of it further your goals? That's the question you have to answer today.
 A number of social invitations could come your way today, possibly connected with groups you're affiliated with.

A surprise encounter with a friend or your romantic partner could bring you closer together. This may be a significant day for you.
 Your scattered energy comes together today in a powerful laser beam of concentrated attention and effort. You will work until you drop, and no one and nothing had better get in your way! Keep up the good pace. You're going to feel more loved than usual, and this changes absolutely everything for you.
 A partner for life or a brief encounter, which will it be? This is today's question. Why not choose both? Can you imagine being your partner's lover while keeping your independence? Don't be influenced by old models that force you to choose between these two ideas. Don't forget that in our modern world, your choices aren't as limited as you might think!
 If the world collapsed today, you wouldn't bat an eyelash. You're perfectly content sailing along on cloud nine! The source of your bliss could be that new person in your life. Are you passionately, intensely, wonderfully in love? You can yield to the magic. Let it bring out the positive parts of your personality, but keep your wits about you all the same!
 Things have probably been going well lately in the love and romance department, Taurus. You find that communication has improved, and the witty banter is invigorating and educational. Today there may be a blip on the radar. You may have been so caught up in the good parts that you failed to take care of the details and do the actual work needed to make things run smoothly.
 It may be time to look at where you are in life, Taurus. Are you where you thought you'd be? If so, congratulations. This is a real accomplishment. If not, take heart. Many people discover that they aren't anywhere close. The key is to write down solid goals and the steps needed to reach them. It's your life after all. Mapping out your route is up to you.
 Today should present a very positive influence for you, Taurus. The energy at play will allow for such things as making excellent decisions. Things will go more quickly than usual. Cooperation from colleagues, physical energy, and a sharp mind will support you. What more could you ask? You may find that almost everything goes your way and laughter fills the hours. Give yourself a pat on the back, because you should be able to handle everything.
 Social events with artistically or spiritually inclined people could have you feeling especially inspired, Taurus, and looking forward to the future in whatever discipline interests you. You're also likely to be feeling especially romantic and sexy. You will want to schedule time alone with that special someone in your life. If you aren't currently involved, you could meet someone special today.
 Today you're likely to feel like the powerful creature you are, Taurus. Your physical energy is high, and you look and feel great. Your intellect is sharp, so if you indulge in any kind of learning process, you will benefit greatly. Your creative energy is also high, so it's a good day to work on artistic projects. In the evening, you will feel especially romantic, so plan an intimate encounter with a special someone!
 There's a lot of tension in the air today, Taurus. Perhaps you feel like no one is listening to you, and that people are draining your energy. You may act defensively and even occasionally become very angry. It's possible that no one has seen in you in such a state before. Don't be afraid to express your anger. Repressed anger is like poison for your body and soul.
 You shouldn't have any problem getting your way in most areas of life, Taurus. The time is ripe for you to take the lead. Unfortunately, there may be one important part of your life that isn't going exactly to plan, and this is love and romance. It's likely that you will run into a tremendously stubborn attitude that you can't seem to break through. It could be your own.
 This will be a great day for you, Taurus. Everything you touch will seem to turn to gold. The day's events will fall right into place. You will take pleasure in being calm and efficient. But what you may not realize is that this could happen every day. Take the time to see what's going right today in order to make it happen again tomorrow!
 Although your current mood is somewhat reserved and modest, you probably feel tempted to strut your stuff every once in a while. However, if you try to show off today, Taurus, you may not be very pleased with your reception. It's natural for you to want to impress people, but you must try to do it with genuine qualities and simplicity. That's true good taste!
 A longing for comfort and the small, simple pleasures in life is likely to cripple your initiative today, Taurus. Have you decided to withdraw from the career whirl for the time being? Or perhaps you're just discouraged by the lack of enthusiasm in your colleagues. In any case, this would be a good day to stay home and rest, Taurus.
 Some differences of opinion concerning your love life are likely to come up today, Taurus. For example, you may find your beloved taking more liberties than you allow yourself. Take your irritation as a sign that this particular relationship could use some freshening up. The day ahead may bring you just what you seek.
 You may have your mind set on some big plans that you've been working on for some time now, Taurus. The problem is that today there is some conflict with something or someone with a large ego who suddenly wants a piece of the pie. Either that or this person wants to burst your bubble. Don't give up hope on your dreams. Realize that this opposition is just part of the adventure.
 If you became an animal today, you'd be a puppy, Taurus, all frisky and affectionate. By all means, put your passion to good use! Surprise a special someone with a home
 You're likely to enjoy today's change of tone, Taurus. Don't you feel a need to take friendships beyond the superficial level? Perhaps you should reestablish contact with some former friends, too, although you may find that you have some bonds to repair. In any case, you can expect another month devoted to sweeping the cobwebs out of your emotional universe in order to let in sunlight and promise.
 Sometimes your relationships are like magnets, Taurus. When you want to get close, the other person tries to get away from you. When you take a step back, he or she runs back into your life. Human nature is complex. Right now you're probably taking a step back, although you haven't given up completely. This rest will give you time to think about which side of you is the most magnetic.
 You could feel extremely passionate today, Taurus. You might want to connect with a love partner but be prevented by circumstances. You might be attracted to racier novels or movies. Repressed anger could bubble up from your subconscious and seek an outlet. This is a great day to channel that anger into some artistic activity. Don't be surprised if you use a lot of red!
 Will you go out with me? Be careful if a person says yes when you ask that question today, Taurus. You could take the nature of this situation to the extreme. Saying yes doesn't mean you're suddenly in charge of his or her life. Nor are you responsible for anything that person does or how they feel. If you're still asking the question without getting any positive responses, don't worry. Keep trying.
 This is one of those days when you just can't wait for someone to stop talking so you can say something, Taurus. It's likely you won't even wait. Don't be surprised if friction results from such strongly held opposing views. People could blow things out of proportion, since everyone is convinced that they are right. The interesting thing about this situation is that it could result in a productive time.
 If you find that you aren't necessarily thinking like the rest of the group, don't panic, Taurus. In fact, this is probably a good thing. By going along with the crowd, you may be expected to act a certain way in some situations. Pretty soon you're living like a marionette strung up to a couple of sticks and manipulated by an unknown hand. Think for yourself.
 Has a certain project been a drag for you lately, Taurus? Don't be surprised if today you get your second wind. You're looking at your tasks in a practical manner, your interest in them is up, and you're able to accomplish them quickly and efficiently with minimal stress. Relationships should also be going well. Make the most of this while you can!
 A temporary lack of belief in your abilities might have you hesitating to start a project or take on a task that you'd normally snap up. This could involve something you've wanted to try or helping someone else. Your faith in yourself should never flag, but if it does, it's important to remember that hard work can be as important as talent 
 Glowing health and an enthusiastic attitude make almost anything a pleasure today, Taurus. Relations with friends and family are warm, congenial, and cooperative. Your day should go as smoothly as you could expect. There is something you want to do in the afternoon that you're looking forward to. In the evening, consider attending a class, lecture, or workshop. Your mind is especially sharp right now.
 You and someone close could disagree on an issue that both of you feel strongly about. Stubborn pride on both your parts could keep you from working things out. Let it go, Taurus. It isn't worth ruining your relationship. Someone you know might be headed for divorce or moving away, and the news could be a shock to you. This should be a day of surprises 
 You tend to be pretty self

 Remember that you can only remain in charge as long as the others around you support your personality and leadership abilities, Taurus.

Gain respect with kind words and a sensitive attitude rather than by enforcing harsh rules and regulations that restrict and aggravate.
 It may be hard to connect with others today, Taurus. People may be rather indecisive. On the other hand, people are apt to be more malleable. This could be a good time to take charge.

If you aren't honest about your needs, it will be impossible for anyone to know how to fulfill them.
 Connect with those who carry you upward and encourage your fantasies today instead of those who try to bring you down to reality, Taurus.

 It could be that you're trying to communicate with someone in a matter regarding love and romance and it simply isn't working.

Be practical yet sensitive in your approach.
 A creative project that you've been working on may be coming to a climactic peak now, Taurus. Discuss your progress with others and feel free to hold an informal critique in order to get honest feedback on your work. A piece of art should stir some sort of reaction inside another person.

If there is even the smallest doubt, give yourself some time to think. Acting on impulse isn't a good idea right now.
 With all the social events you've attended lately, Taurus, it's likely that you've met some people in the healing professions. These doctors, nurses, and technicians could be useful to you later.

 Too many people may be making demands on your time right now, Taurus. Some may have genuine concerns and need your assistance, but others have definite agendas that they really should deal with on their own.

 No pressure, Taurus, but as things are now, you might want to evaluate your career. Is it working out well? What are your latest achievements? What goals haven't been reached? If the answers aren't satisfactory, it's time to make some dramatic changes. If your work doesn't make your heart sing, it's time to find some that does. Life isn't a dress rehearsal. Get going!
 Have you made plans to have a romantic interest come to your home, Taurus? If so, don't rush to get ready. Your friend is probably going to be late.

Your friend will show up even if later than planned. Have fun!
 A current or potential love relationship could hit a snag as you have a clash of wills. If either of you is stubborn, this could turn into an unpleasant power struggle.

 Too many people could be vying for your attention today, Taurus. All of them want advice or help. This could be flattering, and you'll probably want to help them, but it can also be unsettling and make it hard to focus. Don't let this set your temper on edge and cause you to snap at your friends. Take each request one at a time, make no promises, and do your best.

 Romance continues to soar today, Taurus. You should feel especially sexy. You're likely to attract admiring glances from those around you, including strangers. If you're single, you might even attract an exciting new love partner. If you're already involved, your beloved could fall in love with you all over again. Schedule an intimate evening together and make the most of it!
 Daydreams and reveries could inspire new ideas for creative projects today. Visions, stories, or melodies might flood your mind, and it might be a good idea to write them down before they disappear. You're also likely to feel more attuned than usual to the thoughts and feelings of others. Don't be surprised if you intuitively give people what they want and need before they ask.
 You might find the mood of today a bit too somber for your liking, Taurus. Why is everyone so serious? Whether you figure out the answer or not, just know that it probably isn't something you did. Emotions that have been building up are likely to express themselves now, much like a volcano bursting under the pressure of tons of molten lava.
 You'll enjoy a day of high spirits and friendly interactions. The energy of the day is in your favor, although it may not seem like it. Your emotions may become cloudy and it might seem like people are working against you. Although this may be true to some extent, realize that much of this paranoia comes more from your emotional insecurity than another's plot against you.
 New beginnings and promising new opportunities may appear from a distant state or foreign country, Taurus. Your adventurous side is excited and enthusiastic, but the side of you that wants to stay settled could put up some resistance. Don't feel you have to jump into anything. Get all the facts and assess the situation objectively. Think seriously about it all. What do you most want?
 A household member might toy with the idea of moving out or going away for a while, Taurus. This could stress you out, but don't make yourself crazy. Don't try to talk him or her out of it. Listen sympathetically and let your relative get it out of their system. This person is probably feeling temporarily restricted by forces outside the home and isn't really likely to go anywhere.
 You might find yourself thinking about a possible vacation. You've worked hard during the last few months and feel you deserve a break. This year you're likely to want to do something different from the norm, perhaps travel to a foreign land associated with a great spiritual tradition. You should feel closer to your loved ones and optimistic about the future. Enjoy!
 You're focused and attentive to detail. Some longstanding projects benefit from this sudden spurt of energy and get completed in record time. Children figure prominently in your life right now, Taurus. Is there one child in particular who needs some extra attention from you? Your love and support mean a lot more than you realize.
