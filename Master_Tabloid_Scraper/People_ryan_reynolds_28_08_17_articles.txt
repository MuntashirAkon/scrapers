This star never misses an opportunity to make a joke on social media.
Ryan Reynolds wished his wife and actress Blake Lively a happy 30th birthday — but hilariously cropped her out of the picture.
“Happy Birthday to my amazing wife,” the Deadpool actor, 40, wrote alongside a photo of himself with more than half of Lively’s face cropped out.





 Happy Birthday to my amazing wife.
A post shared by Ryan Reynolds (@vancityreynolds) on Aug 25, 2017 at 8:20pm PDT


While the actor is known for his comical tweets and Instagram posts, Lively revealed in July that his social media stories (usually about their two daughters, 2-year-old James, and 11-month-old Inez) are entirely fabricated.
“He may as well work for the Enquirer,” the All I See Is You actress told Glamour. “When he says ‘my daughter,’ he’s never, ever talking about her. Everything is a completely made-up scenario.”
She continued, “He’ll run them by me sometimes just to make me laugh. But oh, I’m so in love with him when he writes that stuff. I mean, I’m in love with him most of the time, but especially with that.” 
Yes, Lively said she loves her husband “most of the time,” but that’s only to avoid scrutiny.
“I said, ‘Most of the time,’ because if I say, ‘I’m so in love with him all the time,’ then you get that eye-rolling, ‘Oh, her life is so great, she’s so perfect,'” she said. “So it’s, like, my defense mechanism.”


Get ready for the Oscars for the YouTube crowd!
The nominations for the seventh annual Streamy Awards were announced on Tuesday, and some of Hollywood’s biggest names garnered nominations while YouTube favorite and videographer Casey Neistat lead the pack with six nods.
Ryan Reynolds will compete against Dwyane “The Rock” Johnson in the Collaboration category. Reynolds is nominated for his “Logan Feat. Deadpool” video with Honest Trailers, while the former WWE star is nominated for “The YouTube Factory” alongside Lilly Singh, Markiplier, Grace Helbig, Roman Atwood, Gigi Gorgeous, Alex Wassabi, LaurDIY, King Bach, Flula, and Brittney Smith.
Rihanna earned a single nomination under Fashion for her Fenty x Puma collection.
This year’s show, which has eliminated gender distinction in its categories, will include new trophies for comedy and drama series.
First held in 2009, the Streamys recognize and honor excellence in online video. That means awards for directing, acting, producing and writing projects available on YouTube, Vine and more.
The 2017 Streamy Awards will be held Sept. 26 at the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, Calif., and will live stream on Twitter at 9:30 p.m. ET.

Ryan Reynolds led the Deadpool 2 crew in a moment of silence for the stuntwoman killed on set before they resumed filming on Wednesday.
The actor, 40, stood at the center of the crew members, who huddled up around him and bowed their heads after he said a few words.

Joi “SJ” Harris, known as the first African-American female road racer, died while performing a motorcycle stunt for the sequel in Vancouver, Canada on Monday.

“Today, we tragically lost a member of our crew while filming Deadpool,” Reynolds tweeted after the accident. “We’re heartbroken, shocked and devastated… but recognize nothing can come close to the grief and inexplicable pain her family and loved ones must feel in this moment. My heart pours out to them — along with each and every person she touched in this world.”
This was Harris’s first film as a stunt performer, and Deadline reported that she was not wearing a helmet during the scene because her character does not wear a helmet in the film.
Pacific Coast News
The Vancouver Sun reported that the accident occurred just after 8 a.m. Witnesses told the outlet that the stuntwoman lost control of her bike during a stunt, jumped a curb and crashed through a plate-glass window at Shaw Tower. She was reportedly treated by ambulance personnel but police said she died at the scene.
 
According to Metro News, the stunt driver narrowly missed hitting two pedestrians when she lost control of the bike.
Harris’s first passion was encouraging women to join the sport of road racing, and her manager and friend Porsche Taylor told PEOPLE, “She should be recognized and known as more than just the stunt driver who passed away.”
She added, “SJ is a remarkable person, and I want her legacy of being an inspiration to women who ride to continue for many more years to come.”



Ryan Reynolds is offering his condolences to the family of the stuntwoman who died Monday on the set of Deadpool 2.
“Today, we tragically lost a member of our crew while filming Deadpool,” the film’s star tweeted. “We’re heartbroken, shocked and devastated… but recognize nothing can come close to the grief and inexplicable pain her family and loved ones must feel in this moment. My heart pours out to them — along with each and every person she touched in this world.”

“I’m deeply saddened by the loss of one of our stunt performers today,” Deadpool 2 director David Leitch said in a statement to PEOPLE. “No words can express how I and the rest of the Deadpool 2 crew feel about this tragedy. Our thoughts are with her family, friends and loves ones in this difficult time.”
The female stunt driver, who has been identified as pro motorcycle racer Joi “SJ” Harris, died during a motorcycle stunt, PEOPLE confirmed. Officers responded to the scene of the accident earlier in the day, along with officers from WorkSafeBC.

Harris is thought to be the stunt double for Zazie Beetz. A woman donning the costume for the mutant Domino, whom Beetz plays in the film, was spotted on a black Ducati motorcycle in the area for a sequence days earlier.
This was Harris’s first film as a stunt performer, according to Deadline, which reported that she was not wearing a helmet during the scene because her character does not wear a helmet.
“We are deeply saddened by the accident that occurred on the set of Deadpool 2 this morning,” 20th Century Fox said in a statement. “Our hearts and prayers are with the family, friends and colleagues of our crew member during this difficult time.”
The Vancouver Sun reported that the accident occurred just after 8 a.m. on Monday.

An eyewitness told the outlet that the stunt driver completed several rehearsals of the stunt, which involved driving a motorcycle down two ramps across several stairs, earlier that morning.


“She came out, went down the two flights of stairs, and it looked like she kind of hit the throttle because she picked up speed,” Nathan Kramchynski told Metro News.


“She was going full throttle,” he added, noting that it appeared as if the driver “missed two pedestrians” during the failed stunt.

CTV News reported that the lights and sirens of the ambulance were not turned on as it pulled away with the stuntwoman onboard.

Reynolds, who’s reprising his role as Deadpool in the sequel, tweeted a photo with members of the Vancouver Police Department last week, jokingly thanking them for their support in filming Spider-Man.

Just last month, John Bernecker, a stuntman on The Walking Dead, died after sustaining “serious injuries” on the AMC drama’s Georgia set.
The stuntman and actor, who also worked on The Fate of the Furious and Logan, was placed on life support after suffering massive head injuries that left him brain dead.
Sources told Deadline that Bernecker and an actor were rehearsing a fight scene that was supposed to end with a routine fall from a balcony, but he lost his footing and fell 30 ft. to concrete floor.
Deadpool 2 is set to hit theaters in 2018, and The Walking Dead is currently set to return for season 8 in October.
