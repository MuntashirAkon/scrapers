With Katy Perry, MTV got a VMAs host, a performer, AND a piece of sporting equipment!
For her performance of Swish Swish, she took the basketball theme to the next level by riding a giant basketball while dressed like a basketball.
Oh, and Nicki Minaj performed from INSIDE a basketball.

As over the top (or is that above the rim?) as the performance was, it was still a thousand times better than the stale jokes they wrote for her during her hosting stint!
Ch-ch-check out the silly performance (above)!



Presto chang-o!
Katy Perry swapped outfits A LOT during the 2017 MTV VMAs – so much so, we had trouble keeping tabs!
Luckily, and after some digging, we tracked every sequin down!
Ch-ch-check out all the fashion madness that took the stage (below)! 
First up was her bomb.com red carpet look which you can see HERE!
Then, she opened up the show by donning a spacesuit with a nude leotard underneath:

Next was a silver dress that fit the songbird like a glove:

Katy had a Liza Minnelli moment in this gown:

A fake baby barfed on her in the next dress:

A island-style parrot frock:

A full sequin look where she eventually snatched her awful wig off:

Katy's take on Queen Daenerys Targaryen from Game of Thrones:

And finally, her finale performance look set to Swish Swish:

Which ensemble was your fave? SOUND OFF in the comments (below)!

Coming in for a landing!!!
Katy Perry has apparently spent the past few months in space — which might be why none of the jokes from her VMAs opening monologue landed!
After a NASA-approved intro video, the pop star literally descended onto the MTV awards show in an astronaut's suit (because of the Moonman — get it?!) and launched several topical jokes on the audience!
Katy Kat covered all the pop culture bases: Handmaid's Tale! Fidget Spinners! The fact that we're living in the apocalypse! Very 2017!
Hopefully, all that physical comedy the E.T. singer promised is coming later in the show…
What did U think of Katy's opening? Watch for yourself (above)!

Hell yeah, Pink!
The best way to accept the MTV VMAs' highest honor, the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award, is to remind everyone exactly why you deserve that it!
In an insanely complicated bit of choreo, Pink entered the Forum on a flying car, then drove to a riding mower, and joined some dancers all while singing a medley of Get The Party Started, Raise Your Glass, So What, Just Give Me A Reason, Perfect, and What About Us!
Video: Watch Drake Pay Tribute To Last Year's Recipient, Rihanna!
And all that was before Ellen DeGeneres came onstage to hilariously present her with the Moon Person!
Speaking of the Moon Person, Pink dedicated the moment to her daughter and the speech she had to give her about androgynous rock stars and showing people how to see different kinds of beauty. LOVES it!
Ch-ch-check out the wonderful, moving moment (above)!
