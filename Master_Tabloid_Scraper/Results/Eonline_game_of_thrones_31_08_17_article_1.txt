Winter has been here for a while and it's stressing us out.How many of you have sat for the entire 50 to 70-minute duration of a Game of Thrones episode, your eyes glued to the screen, ready to "SHHHHH!" anyone near you (siblings, parents, significant others, non-significant others, children, pets, the pizza delivery person you're already angry at for being late) who dare make a peep while the show is on?And this shorted, but spectacular season of Game of Thrones is especially stressful.So chill out for a bit and check out what your faves do for fun—with each other—when the cameras are off.Spoiler alert!

Jon Snow Is a Dragon: On a recent episode, Kit Harington's character shared a moment with Drogon, Daenerys Targaryen's enormous and terrifying dragon-child and loyal steed. Emilia Clark, who plays the Mother of Dragons, posted on her Instagram page behind the scenes images of the two, including a hilarious video of Kit pretending to be a dragon. Because of course!

Feud? What Feud? Things got rather tense between Arya and Sansa Stark in the penultimate episode this season. It must have been quite challenging to film such a scene, because in real life, Maisie Williams and Sophie Turner are besties.On the day of the finale, Turner posted on her Instagram page a photo of the two in costume doing some, er, interesting stage moves. Crotch grab, anyone?"In honor of the Thrones finale out tomorrow night, and of 6 mill followers on instaaaa... here's da reel roadmans of westeros," she wrote.

NOW KISS.

Game of Thrones' season seven finale airs Sunday at 9 p.m. on HBO.
