He continued, "United Way's Harvey Recovery Fund will provide much-needed help for the communities along the Gulf Coast where lives have been changed forever."Leonardo isn't the first celebrity to step up in a big way to help thousands of residents displaced by flooding and other damages. Earlier this week, Sandra Bullock flexed her star power and pledged $1 million to help victims. Kim Kardashian and her family donated $500,000 to the American Red Cross.

Kevin Hart also launched his own Hurricane Harvey Relief Challenge that encourages stars to give $25,000 to assist Texas residents."Just crossed the 1 million dollar mark," the actor shared on Instagram Wednesday afternoon. "This is an example of love & support. Thank you all for your generosity."To donate to the Red Cross' Hurricane Harvey relief fund, click here.Other organizations—including Coalition for the Homeless, Houston Food Bank, Houston SPCA, Salvation Army and Save the Children—are also accepting donations for relief efforts.
