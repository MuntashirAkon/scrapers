So, I can't really- I can't really talk about it," the singer said tearfully. "I don't know why it makes me so upset. It just really makes me just really upset. So I really hope people know...my grandma's sitting here and my mom's here and I go home to my seven dogs and if I didn't have that anymore, it'd just be really hard.""So I'm really happy to help any way that I can and I hope people understand they can put themselves in those people's shoes and just know what it feels like to have everything taken away from you," she said.
