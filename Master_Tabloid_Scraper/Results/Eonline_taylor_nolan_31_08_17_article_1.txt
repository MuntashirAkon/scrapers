In the scene, Brittany's dad asks Jax to put his hand in a bucket and pull out a bunch of frogs they caught earlier in the day. "I can't do it, man!" Jax says, while  Brittany sticks her hand right in without any hesitation. (You can take the girl outta Kentucky...)"They're not going to bite you, you're just being a little....baby," Brittany tells him, before Jax calls her out for wanting to use a slightly NSFW word instead of baby. Press play on the video above to see the frog fun do down. 

While Jax has been having fun on the farm, don't expect to see the couple relocate permanently anytime soon. "I don't know at this point in my life if I would," told E! News when we asked if he could ever see himself moving to Kentucky full-time. "I don't know if I'd move to where she's from. Maybe like a city?"
