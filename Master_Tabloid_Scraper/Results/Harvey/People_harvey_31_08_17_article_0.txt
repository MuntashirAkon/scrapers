A group of guys became a dog’s saving grace this week in Lumberton, Texas.On Monday, Bandit the dog found himself caught in the raging flood waters of Hurricane Harvey. He was moments from being washed far away from his home when a group of volunteer rescuers, made up mostly of local teenagers, stepped in.The video of the daring save was posted by one of the rescuers, Kavan Wise, on Facebook, where it has over 270,000 views.In the clip, you can see the group lowering someone into the fast moving water by a rope. This individual plucks Bandit out of the rapids, and then is pulled back to safety.Casey Fredrick, Bandit’s owner, posted on Twitter that she was “very thankful” to the teenagers that saved her dog.Fredrick also shared a video of Bandit safe and “singing” on a blanket after the rescue.Bandit singing the blues.
