As several celebs have shown over the past couple days, disasters bring out the best in people. Sadly, they also bring out the worst.
On Monday night, climate change denier Ann Coulter tweeted:

"I don't believe Hurricane Harvey is God's punishment for Houston electing a lesbian mayor. But that is more credible than 'climate change.'"
Yeah. Gross.

It seems obvious to us she's not so much trying to give credence to the insipid notion that natural disasters are caused by homosexuality but rather to say that climate change is an even crazier idea.
But putting such a disgusting homophobic notion on the same playing field as something that is real and measurable and endangering our planet is just too gross to deal with.
So we'll let Twitter handle it! See some of the best responses to one of the worst sentiments (below)!

I don't think Hurricane Harvey is God's punishment for us electing an idiot president. But that is more credible than Ann Coulter. https://t.co/vdQBFhs7jA

I know Ann Coulter is objectionable for a living but man is she a piece of shit.

One is based on science & statistics, the other bigotry & exclusion. I guess it's a question of where you find your intellectual foundation.
