Best Buy is in hot water over a store accidentally upselling… well, hot water!
The company issued an apology after a viral photo taken at a Houston location showed a case of water selling for over $40 amid Hurricane Harvey.

The photo of 24-packs of bottled water being sold at a cool $42.96 was shared to Twitter on Tuesday, causing users to accuse the retail giant of price gouging in the wake of severe flooding and devastation brought on by the storm:

But apparently, the not-so-best price was merely a mistake made by some of the company's employees.
Best Buy responded to the controversy, claiming the price was computed incorrectly because the electronics company doesn't usually sell water in bulk. A spokesperson told CNBC:

"This was a big mistake on the part of a few employees at one store on Friday. As a company we are focused on helping, not hurting affected people. We're sorry and it won't happen again. Not as an excuse but as an explanation, we don't typically sell cases of water. The mistake was made when employees priced a case of water using the single-bottle price for each bottle in the case."
Sure, blame it on the water…
You'd think they'd know how to handle disaster sites after all those Black Fridays!
