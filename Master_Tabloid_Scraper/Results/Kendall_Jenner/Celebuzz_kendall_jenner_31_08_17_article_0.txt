It looks like Kendall Jenner is totally over A$AP Rocky these days!

Once again fueling romance rumors, the 21-year-old model was spotted on yet another fancy dinner date with rumored beau Blake Griffin. This time, the pair were joined by Kendall’s BFF Hailey Baldwin and Blake’s fellow NBA star, Chandler Parsons.
Via TMZ:
Blake and Kendall left Craig’s in L.A. together and got into a waiting car. Chandler followed shortly after. Hailey was definitely with the group … but didn’t want to be part of the mass exodus.
Chandler and Hailey have been spotted together in the past (sunbathing together in June) but insist they’re not exclusively dating.
See a video of their double date night over at TMZ…
