Ahead of NYFW, it's said Kendall Jenner will be honored at the Daily Front Row's Fashion Media Awards in September with Fashion Icon of the Decade!!
That's a big deal considering just a decade ago, the starlet was only 11 years old!

While the supermodel tweeted out her gratitude about it when she got wind of it earlier this week (below), not everyone is as happy about Kenny's news!

People are PISSED!
They weren't hiding their emotions about it, taking to Twitter: 

Rihanna, Beyoncé, Zendaya, Tracee Ellis Ross, Grace Jones, or even Yara Shahidi and y'all give it to Kendall Jenner? https://t.co/bIGAM4f3vS
