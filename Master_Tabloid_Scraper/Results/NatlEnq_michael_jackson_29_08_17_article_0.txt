Michael Jackson died as strangely as he lived — as exposed in these shocking police photos of the room where the Gloved One spent his final moments! The disturbing pictures show that the King of Pop died in a room littered with drugs and syringes — as also described in the shocking tell-all, “83 Minutes: The Doctor, the Damage, and the Shocking Death of Michael Jackson,” by Matt Richards and Mark Langthorne. “Tables were strewn with medical paraphernalia such as vials of drugs, syringes and tubes,” the authors wrote of Michael’s bedroom in his Holmby Hills mansion, as seen here. “Plastic bags, scattered on tops of chairs and tabletops, contained latex gloves, creams and saline bags. On the bed rested a porcelain doll with curly golden hair, dressed in a beige romper-suit with images of animals adorning its chest.” The police pictures show that Michael — accused of child molestation in 1993 and 2003 — had displayed plates with photos of babies and young children on his dresser. Authorities also found a bloody shirt, at least 11 oxygen tanks and bottles of the powerful anesthetic Propofol, which Michael used to sleep — and helped lead to his death at age 50 in June 2009. As The National ENQUIRER has reported, the late superstar also hid a troubling house of horrors inside his infamous Neverland Ranch — including a disturbing collection of curios much like these that surrounded him in death!/n
