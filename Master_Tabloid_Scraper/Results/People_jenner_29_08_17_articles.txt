Sterling K. Brown doesn’t shy away from having “those conversations” with his kids.Sitting down with PEOPLE’s Editor-in-Chief Jess Cagle in the latest episode of The Jess Cagle Interview (streaming now on the People/Entertainment Weekly Network), the This Is Us star opened up about raising kids in the modern world.“I lived in St. Louis, Missouri, and now my kids are growing up in Los Angeles, so that’s culturally very different,” the 41-year-old father of two said.The former American Crime Story star, who plays Randall Pearson on NBC’s breakout drama, pointed out some key differences between his childhood in the “very conservative” Midwest and the life his kids have now.“I have gay people in my family who weren’t able to openly discuss homosexuality and I feel like that’s shifted, especially here on the coast,” he explained.FROM PEN: Chrissy Metz on ‘This Is Us’, Crying on Set, and Her Body PositivityThis more open environment, Brown said, contributes to “conversations with my son all the time.” One of the most powerful ones came after his son saw Caitlyn Jenner‘s legendary “Call Me Caitlyn” cover of Vanity Fair.“He asked me one time … he saw the cover of Vanity Fair and he goes, ‘Daddy, is that a man or a woman?’ I said, ‘Good question. That’s a woman who used to be a man.’ And he goes, ‘How’s that work?’ I was like, ‘I don’t have all of the information, but she felt like she was a woman, but she was in a man’s body, but now she gets to be a woman.’ And he goes, ‘Am I woman?’ I said, ‘I don’t think so. I think you’re a guy.’ ”The conversation then shifted to one “of homosexuality.”Brown continued: “He was like, ‘Well, can I marry you?’ I said, ‘That’s very sweet. I appreciate that, buddy. But I’m already married to mom and I’m not gay, so it wouldn’t work out between us.’ ”Added Brown of his relationship with his son, “We have those conversations. My mom didn’t have those conversations with me. It was a taboo thing that just wasn’t talked about.”Watch Sterling K. Brown’s full episode of The Jess Cagle Interview before season 2 of This Is Us premieres Sept. 26 on NBC.—With LIAM BERRY
 You may think you’ve seen every possible nook and cranny of every possible Kardashian or Jenner – after all, this is the family who brought you a butt on a pile of dirt, a cameltoe with a first name and infinite musings on whether one is having a “good boob day” or not. And you wouldn’t be alone if you thought you’d already seen about as much of Kylie as she’s got to share. Thanks to her varied swimsuit collection and general lack of self-consciousness, she’s displayed sideboob, underboob, underbutt and nearly every other combo of direction + body part that exists.But she’s never gone fully “super nude” before, so you can now go into your weekend having checked this particular milestone off your “KarJenner To-Do List.” The cosmetics mogul, 20, bared her breasts for V Magazine in a variety of sheer styles, plus a flowing blonde wig and a lot of fantastical, disco glitter makeup. And yes, she’s fully aware of the significance of this moment. “That was actually my first super nude shoot. I always post sexy pictures, but have never really gone nude,” she told the magazine.(No word on whether Kris was on set cheering, “You’re doing amazing, sweetie!” but you can watch a video from the shoot of Kylie getting her wind machine on while wearing avant-garde mouth jewelry here.)via GIPHYRELATED PHOTOS: The Celebrity Guide to Showing UnderboobThe shoot was styled by Anna Trevelyan, who shared some more low-key shots from the day – as well as another completely bare pic if you’re adding to your scrapbook. Nick Knight took the photos, and writer Trey Taylor coaxed such quotes out of the star as “I don’t know what it’s like to not be in the spotlight. That’s normal to me. There’s nothing you can do about it. There are so many great things about life, I’m just trying to focus on that.” Check out our Live stream today on Showstudio.com // @kyliejenner for @vmagazine photographed @nick_knight styled by me! @showstudio ❤️👑A post shared by Anna Trevelyan 💖 (@annatrevelyan) on Jul 4, 2017 at 2:55am PDTFor the non-blurred photos and full Kylie experience, visit V‘s website, and tell us: How are you feeling about all this excitement?
