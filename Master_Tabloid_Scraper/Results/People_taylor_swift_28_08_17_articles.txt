We’re nursing a serious case of déjà vu following the debut of Taylor Swift’s music video for “Look What You Made Me Do” at the MTV Video Music Awards.
While majority of viewers latched onto Swift’s many versions (or clones) of herself through the years, we can’t help but focus in on the many similarities “Look What You Made Me Do” shares with past music videos dreamt up by icons like Michael Jackson, Madonna, Beyoncé and more.
In case you need a reference or an excuse to rewatch the pop star’s new video for the 50th time today, here it is:

And now that you’re up to speed, let’s revisit a handful of other classic music videos that may or may not have inspired Swift’s latest.
Michael Jackson — ‘Thriller’

The uncanny resemblance: Approximately two seconds into “Look What You Made Me Do,” which introduced viewers to the “Taylor Swift’s Reputation” headstone, sparked nostalgia for Jackson’s “Thriller.”
Miley Cyrus — ‘Can’t Be Tamed’

The uncanny resemblance: Is Cyrus’ video for “Can’t Be Tamed” so synonymous with bird cages that we immediately thought of the former child star’s single while watching Swift’s video? Maybe, most definitely, yes.
Madonna — ‘What It Feels Like for a Girl’

The uncanny resemblance: Madonna has a need for speed in this 2006 music video for her single, “What It Feels Like for a Girl,” which also includes a heart-stopping car crash — much like Swift’s.
Beyoncé — ‘Formation’

The uncanny resemblance: While Swift’s “Look What You Made Me Do” doesn’t draw exact comparisons to Beyoncé’s visual Lemonade album, Twitter users were convinced a shot of Swift wearing a black leotard in the video’s teaser trailer was a direct take on Queen Bey’s smash hit.
Kylie Minogue — ‘All the Lovers’

The uncanny resemblance: In one of the most memorable moments of “Look What You Made Me Do,” a pyramid of “Old Taylors” can be seen reaching toward the new Taylor, reminiscent of Minogue’s 2010 video.
 


If you weren’t spending your Sunday night stress-watching dragons and frost-bitten zombies collide in Westeros, then you were likely tuned in to MTV to watch Katy Perry take her best shot at stand-up comedy or to see Pink give an inspirational speech … or to find out what, exactly, it was that we made Taylor Swift do, as she debuted her music video for her latest single. There was a lot to unpack from the “Look What You Made Me Do” clip, but the main takeaway isn’t that she’s gone full snake queen or reignited various rumored beefs, it’s that Taylor has apparently kept every single outfit she’s ever worn.
The grand finale of Swift’s extensive deep-dive into her past sees the star lining up a few of her most memorable past personas to comically bicker with one another and pick herself apart in front of a private jet graffitied with the word “Reputation.” The moment is a meta nod at the many roles the media has cast her in as well as an attempt at yet another reinvention into a pop star with a tougher, slightly more dangerous edge. And as it turns out, just like she never forgets a grudge, she also never gets rid of an outfit: every rewear came directly out of Taylor’s own archives.

Of course there’s zombie Taylor who opens the film announcing her own passing while wearing the same blue pleated J. Mendel dress from her “Out of the Woods” video, an outfit which also heralded the end of the 1989 period of her career.

…which is why it seems only fitting that zombie Tay would be the one to bury her 2014 Met Gala self, wearing a super feminine baby pink Oscar de la Renta gown with a giant bow on back (the one her cat tried to destroy), a look that also ushered us into the New York-centric era of her career.

But it’s not just the super glam moments Swift brings back, she also pokes fun at herself by reviving her nerdy character from “You Belong With Me,” recreating the homemade t-shirt she wears but this time inscribing it with the various names of her squad, including Selena, Gigi, and Lena.

And what Taylor style retrospective could be complete without the dress she wore during that fateful moment at the 2009 VMAs that would inexplicably come to define the trajectory of both her and Kanye’s careers.

She brought back the ringleader look from her Red tour, complete with top hat, likely a cheeky nod to those haters who have proclaimed her to be a master manipulator.
Youtube
She also recreated her Swan Lake moment from “Shake It Off” in a full-on ballerina outfit. The scene is also so self-referential that it features a few of the looks she introduced in this very video, like the character in a leopard print coat and high pony who gets a Grammy for her car crash and the Taylor who seems to have become the queen of CGI snakes.
And it turns out, these looks are only the tip of the #TBT Tay iceberg. As her legions of fans have extensively documented on every social media platform, when you take a closer frame by frame look at that pile of zombie Taylors at the end a whole slew of her past red carpet selves can easily be seen, including the spangly romper she wore during her 1989 world tour, that rainbow sequin houndstooth matching set she wore to the VMAs in 2015, her “Shake It Off “cheerleader uniform, and the patterned velvet dress she wore to the BMI Pop Awards after she had her peroxide blonde Vogue reinvention. Now, we’re just left wondering how can we get a look inside Taylor’s career-spanning wardrobe archive and where could she possibly store it all?
What do you think of Taylor’s new music video? Which of her past looks is your favorite? Sound off below!



While Taylor Swift can claim one of the most iconic MTV Video Music Awards moments ever, her history with the show spans red carpet slays, buzzworthy performances and, of course, cameos from her famous squad. Scroll down to immerse yourself in every major moment of Taylor Swift at the VMAs as you prepare yourself for the “Look What You Made Me Do” music video premiere at Sunday’s show.
Taylor made her first VMAs appearance in 2008, resplendent in fluffy curls and a sweet white dress. It was the perfect VMAs debut look for America’s newest country sweetheart.

The singer kicked off her VMAs career on a strong note, interviewing celebs on the red carpet. Oh, and did we mention that she was nominated for the artist to watch category alongside Katy Perry and Miley Cyrus?
Kevin Mazur/WireImage
In 2009, Taylor’s return to the VMAs was even more exciting: She rolled up in a literal carriage, because why not, and made us all instantly question why we wanted cars for our 16th birthdays.
Kevin Mazur/WireImage
Of course, 2009 was also the year that Kanye West famously stagecrashed Taylor Swift after she won the best female video award for “You Belong with Me.”

The singer handled the shocking moment with grace, and in 2013, Vanity Fair even revealed that she has a framed photo of the incident in her house.

Believe it or not, her night wasn’t over yet.

Swift performed “You Belong with Me” on a moving subway (which might be the most glamorous thing to ever happen on the subway).

Swift capped off one heckuva eventful night when Beyoncé brought her up to give her back her moment.

How do you follow up an awards show like that? In 2010, Taylor was back to perform “Innocent,” which was inspired by the previous year’s interruption. “I think a lot of people expected me to write a song about him. But for me it was important to write a song to him,” she told New York magazine of West.

The emotional performance included a clip from the stagecrash and a barefoot Swift.

Taylor went on a brief VMAs hiatus, returning to the awards show in 2012. With freshly chopped bangs and now-signature lipstick, the singer was beginning to usher in the Red era.

Of course, she took to the stage (in stripes!) to perform “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together.”

Take a moment to relive the glory that’s now a half-decade old.

The next year, Taylor walked the carpet in an ultra form-fitting navy gown and faux bob. (A sign of haircuts to come?)

In 2013, she also scooped up a best female video award for “I Knew You Were Trouble.”

Taylor didn’t slow down in 2014, walking the carpet in sky-high heels and a blue romper.

She was about to drop her fifth studio album, 1989, and performed a very sparkly rendition of “Shake It Off.”

Seriously. We will never be over the spangly two-piece and the tux-clad dancers.

However, nothing could ever prepare us for Taylor’s 2015 entrance. She was nominated for “Bad Blood,” so it only made sense that she brought her squad as her date(s).
Kevin Mazur/WireImage
Speaking of “Bad Blood,” yes, it won the video of the year honor.

She also took to the stage to perform a “The Night Is Still Young/ Bad Blood” mash-up with Nicki Minaj. (The performance squashed any rumors of beef between the two musicians, who got in a Twitter tiff ahead of the awards over a lack of diversity among nominees.)

The singer capped off her night by presenting Kanye West with the iconic Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award.

While Taylor opted out of the awards the next two years, she left fans absolutely shook when she premiered her “Look What You Made Me Do” video during the 2017 show. 

The audience was still reeling from the epic visual (so many iconic Taylors!) when the singer and Zayn won the best collaboration award for their song “I Don’t Wanna Live Forever.” In their absence, co-writer Jack Antonoff stepped up to the mic to accept the trophy.



The old Taylor Swift may be dead, but it seems her squad is very much still alive.
On Sunday, the 27-year-old singer dropped the music video for her new single, “Look What You Made Me Do.” And though the self-referential, Joseph Kahn-directed clip shows Swift dominating over and then destroying her followers at “Squad U” — a fictional factory where lines of identical women follow her rules — one clue in the video appears to give a clue that the pop star’s crew is still at it.
In the music video, Swift shows up as various versions of herself through the years — and in the last 30 seconds, the multiple Taylors say things to each other haters have accused her of throughout her career.

One of the Taylors is a surprised-face Swift, who — like the singer portrays in 2008’s “You Belong with Me” video —wears a hand-written T-shirt with the words “Junior Jewels” written on it.

But in this video, around the shirt are names of Swift’s squad members. So who’s included?

If the video is to believed, active members of the squad currently include Selena Gomez, Gigi Hadid, Ed Sheeran, Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds, Lena Dunham, Patrick Stewart, Abigail Anderson, Martha Hunt, Claire Kislinger and Haim sisters Este, Alana and Danielle.
Todrick Hall‘s name also makes the cut — though that’s not a surprise, seeing as he appears as a backup dancer in the video, wearing a cut-off shirt with the words “I ❤ TS” on it (a clear jab at those who made fun of Swift’s ex-boyfriend Tom Hiddleston for wearing a similar tank while they were dating).

One notable name not seen on the shirt is Karlie Kloss, and fans immediately went wild on social media wondering if there was a rift between the former BFFs.


oh my 😦 i think it's Karlie Kloss in #lookwhatyoumademedo with… Karlie had her own bedroom in TS' loft, right? gutted.  😦 #taylorswift

No but for real did karlie kloss and Taylor swift broke up or …?

So this one is Karlie Kloss, right? Ooh, Taylor Swift. You are savage. 👏#LookWhatYouMadeMeDo pic.twitter.com/QSPG6PQcy9
— Christina Writes (@christinawrites) August 28, 2017

Lorde and Ruby Rose are also not named on the shirt, but both the stars recently voiced their support for Swift.
After making comments that appeared as though she and Swift had a falling out, Lorde called the singer a “dear friend” on her Twitter account. “I want to say one more time that Taylor has been there for me in all my dark and light moments these past 5 years. All of them,” she added.
Swift dropped “Look What You Made Me Do” – the biting track off of her upcoming album, Reputation – on Thursday night, later debuting the first-look video preview on Friday’s Good Morning America. 
Though the song, which samples 1991 Right Said Fred hit “I’m Too Sexy,” is getting mixed reviews, it’s certainly a stunning departure for Swift. Rather than shaking off her haters, the singer appears to be taking some direct jabs at her enemies.
“I don’t like you,” she sings in the song’s verse, without naming anyone in particular.

It may not be a direct attack on anyone, though — despite rampant speculation.
Fans speculate that Swift is once again turning the tables on her haters by poking fun at the media’s perception of her as someone who always plays the victim — the same way her smash hit “Blank Space” (off of her Grammy-winning album 1989) mocked the portrayal of her as a man-eater.
“[From] 2013 to 2013, they thought I was dating too much because I dated two people in a year and a half, but whatever — we’ll leave it there,” she said during an interview with NME in 2014. “‘Oh, a serial dater. She only writes songs to get emotional revenge on guys. She’s a man hater. Don’t let her near your boyfriend.’ It was just kind of excessive and, you know, at first it was hurtful and then I kind of found a little comedy in it.”
“This character is so interesting though,” she added at the time. “If you go and read these gossip sites and they describe how I am, [it’s] so opposite my actual life.”
Swift’s sixth album, Reputation, will be released on Nov. 10.



Did you think she would just sit back quietly?
In the creepy music video for her new biting single “Look What You Made Me Do,” Taylor Swift turns the tables on her haters by mocking all the very specific hits her reputation has taken over her entire career.
1. She’s a lying snake that can’t be trusted.
In several scenes, Swift — dripping in snake jewels — is seen sitting on a throne with a legion of snakes slithering around her. The arm of her throne and columns inside the room have the words “ET TU BRUTE” etched onto them.

Last summer, Swift’s haters flooded her social media pages with the snake emoji after Kim Kardashian West characterized the singer as the reptile. “Wait it’s legit National Snake Day?!?!?They have holidays for everybody, I mean everything these days!” the Keeping Up with the Kardashians reality star tweeted shortly before leaking a phone call between her husband, Kanye West, and Swift that she claimed proved Swift approved of the rapper’s “Famous” lyrics.
The “Out of the Woods” singer later asserted that West, 40, never told her he was going to call her “that bitch” in the song. “You don’t get to control someone’s emotional response to being called ‘that bitch’ in front of the entire world,” she wrote. “He promised to play the song for me, but he never did.”
Swift and West have had a complicated relationship since he interrupted her VMAs acceptance speech in 2009.

2. She’s a controlling man-eater.
Perhaps the most enduring reputation Swift has had since kicking off her career is that she’s a boy-crazy revenge seeker.
In 2013, she became a punchline at the Golden Globes when hosts Tina Fey and Amy Poehler joked that Swift should “stay away from Michael J. Fox’s son” and use “some ‘me time’ to learn about herself.” Swift later told Vanity Fair Katie Couric was one of her “favorite people” because she taught her Madeleine Albright’s quote: “There’s a special place in hell for women who don’t help other women.”

The star faces this characterization head-on at several points in the music video. In one scene, she swings a baseball bat while rocking a sweatshirt with a tiger and the words “BLIND FOR LOVE” on it.
During her high-profile relationship with actor Tom Hiddleston, the stars were mercilessly mocked after he was photographed wearing an “I ❤ TS” tank top at her annual Fourth of July bash. Her all-male backup dancers in the music video are wearing shirts with the same phrase.
3. She collects friends who fall into very specific categories (think models).
Next up in the video is Swift in control at “Squad U,” where she is mass-producing and whipping thin, bot-like women into shape. The singer has often been criticized for being a fake feminist and seemingly only making friends with Victoria’s Secret models.

“To be honest, and this will probably get me in trouble … I don’t see anybody in any sort of squad that has a normal body,” fellow singer Demi Lovato previously told Glamour. “It’s kind of this false image of what people should look like. And what they should be like, and it’s not real. I think that having a song and a video about tearing Katy Perry down, that’s not women’s empowerment.”
4. She’s disingenuous. 
For a string of awards shows earlier in her career, Swift had a signature “shocked” face after picking up award after award, which earned her backlash from critics who said her response was fake.
“Swift had already won two awards when she took her third of the evening: the Artist of the Year honor,” wrote the Washington Post after the 2011 American Music Awards. “Really, it shouldn’t have been a huge surprise. But when Swift’s name was announced, you would have thought that someone had just told the singer the Earth is square, Thanksgiving has been postponed until March and the sky and the ground have now officially switched places.”

In the last 30 seconds of the music video, “dead Taylor” tells a younger version of herself to “Stop making that surprise face. It’s so annoying!” Adds the “Shake It Off” Taylor: “Yeah, you can’t possibly be that surprised all the time.”
The star — who notably stopped showing surprise or shock while winning awards in recent years — previously responded to the controversy by telling Nightline she wasn’t faking it.

“People make so much fun of me for that,” she said in 2012. “I just, I don’t know. It’s like, if you win an award, isn’t that crazy? How do you sit there and be like, ‘Oh, another Grammy. I guess I’m gonna get that now?”
5. She’s always the victim.
Between her feuds with Perry and West and a tricky breakup with ex-boyfriend Calvin Harris, Swift has earned a reputation of always playing the victim. In fact, it remained one of the biggest criticisms after she released her new single (“Taylor Swift Hasn’t Shed Her Old Skin. She’s Still Playing the Victim,” read one headline).
Naysayers claim the star fans the flames of her own fights and manipulates people in her life to create fodder for her hit songs.
“Hurtful to me at this point that her and her team would go so far out of their way to try and make ME look bad at this stage though,” tweeted Harris last summer after it was revealed Swift co-wrote their hit song, “This Is What You Came For.” (There is a grave stone with the name Nils Sjoberg — the pen name Swift used for the song — in one of the graveyard scenes).

“I figure if you’re happy in your new relationship you should focus on that instead of trying to tear your ex bf down for something to do,” he continued. “I know you’re off tour and you need someone new to try and bury like Katy ETC but I’m not that guy, sorry. I won’t allow it.”
In Swift’s music video, the Red-era Taylor tells an even younger version of herself to “stop acting like you’re all nice” while yet another says, “There she goes playing the victim again.”

Taylor Swift is going to a dark place with the music video for her new single “Look What You Made Me Do.”
The Grammy winner, 27, unveiled the video — which turns the tables on the criticism thrown her way throughout her career — at the MTV Video Music Awards on Sunday.
The video kicks off with a “dead” Swift (wearing the dress from her “Out of the Woods” music video) crawling out of a “Taylor Swift’s Reputation” grave juxtaposed with a shot of the star lying in a diamond-filled bathtub.
While some on social media claim the bathtub is a reference to Kim Kardashian West’s Paris robbery (she was tied up and put in the bathtub of her hotel bathroom), other fans say Swift has specifically referenced being painted by the media as a boy-crazy woman who goes home to lounge in her luxurious bathtub while wearing pearls.
The “dead Taylor” also shovels dirt onto a 2014 Met Ball-version of Swift.

In one of the shots of Swift lying in the bathtub, a $1 bill lies next to her shoulder, likely referencing her sexual assault lawsuit against David Mueller, whom a jury found guilty of assault and battery against the star. There’s also a grave stone with the name Nils Sjoberg in the graveyard scene, which is a reference to the pen name Swift used for “This Is What You Came For,” her song with ex-boyfriend Calvin Harris.
Other clips include Swift sitting on a throne commanding her legion of snakes, swinging in a golden cage and posing with a Grammy award after crashing her car into a pole as the paparazzi snap photos. Some fans on social media say Swift’s attire and hair in the car crash scenes mimic that of rival Katy Perry, who has never won a Grammy award.


In another scene inside a vault, the star rips off a cat mask while wearing a sweatshirt with a tiger and the words “BLIND FOR LOVE” on it. She is also sitting in the vault of “Stream Co.,” which likely is a reference to the period of time she removed her music from all streaming services and wrote a letter to Apple Music about artists being taken advantage of. (She recently released her entire catalogue back onto streaming services).
Her backup dancers in another scene who wait on her hand and foot are also all wearing cut-off shirts with the words “I ❤ TS” on them, a clear jab at those who made fun of her ex-boyfriend Tom Hiddleston for wearing a similar tank while they were dating.



Swift is also the ring leader at “Squad U,” where lines of identical women follow her rules. The scene is also reminiscent of West’s Yeezy fashion show.
The video evolves into Swift standing on a pile of Taylors from the past, including from her “You Belong with Me” video (except this version is wearing a T-shirt with the names of her “squad” — Selena Gomez, Martha Hunt, Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds, Lena Dunham and more — written on it).
Other versions of Swift include the one from her “Shake It Off” music video, from her Fearless era and from the 2015 Billboard Music Awards (where she and ex-boyfriend Calvin Harris kissed after she received an award).

The last 30 seconds of the music video shows all the various Taylors arguing with each other, saying things her haters have accused her of over the last several years.
“Stop making that surprise face. It’s so annoying!” dead Taylor tells “You Belong with Me” Taylor. Adds the “Shake It Off” Taylor: “Yeah, you can’t possibly be that surprised all the time.”
“What’s that, bitch?” adds another, while dead Taylor shoots back, “Don’t call me that.”

“Oh, stop acting like you’re all nice. You are so fake,” the Red-era Taylor tells the Fearless Taylor. And yet another says, “There she goes playing the victim again.”

The video ends with the 2009 VMAs-Taylor repeating what Swift said in an Instagram caption she posted when hitting back at Kardashian West, who leaked a phone call between Swift and her husband Kanye West last summer: “I would very much like to be excluded from this narrative.”
“Oh shut up!” the 14 other Taylors scream in unison.

On Saturday, director Joseph Kahn told a fan on Twitter he and Swift began working on the video at the start of the year before shooting it in May.


We started concepting and prepping it in January. Shot in May. Post production until tomorrow morning. You see it Sssssssunday. 🐍 https://t.co/XdAWI6Smc7

The song is co-written by the “Shake It Off” singer, 27, and her longtime pal Jack Antonoff, who also produced several tracks off her last album 1989.
According to a press release, the single is the first song off Swift’s upcoming album, Reputation, which will be released on Nov. 10.


Taylor Swift could be in attendance at Sunday’s 2017 MTV Video Music Awards.
A source close to the “Look What You Made Me Do” singer, 27, hints to PEOPLE that she may be hitting up the ceremony in Inglewood, California — where Swift and Zayn Malik are up for the best collaboration award for their song “I Don’t Wanna Live Forever (Fifty Shades Darker).”
“Taylor is very excited about her new album,” says the source. “This has been her life for the past months. She is very excited to share it with her fans. She is also ready to come out of hiding.”
If she does end up attending, the VMAs would be Swift’s first awards show appearance since the CMA Awards in November, where she presented Garth Brooks with the entertainer of the year award.

Following the release of “Look What You Made Me Do” and its accompanying lyric video, rumors circulated that the country-turned-pop songstress would be taking the stage at Sunday’s awards show. But VMAs executive producer Jesse Ignjatovic set the record straight.
“She has been on the show many times and [has] performed with a new album coming, but not this time,” Ignjatovic told PEOPLE. “I definitely wish she was coming on and performing.”
Reputation, out Nov. 10, is available for pre-order now.
