Taylor Swift isn’t starring in Kimye’s bad dreams. In fact, the power couple isn’t losing any sleep over her record-breaking new single, an insider tells PEOPLE.
Ever since the pop star released “Look What You Made Me Do” on Friday, fans have pointed out possible references to her fight with Kim Kardashian and Kanye West — and the (literally) biting music video, which premiered during Sunday night’s MTV Video Music Awards, only fueled the fire.
Still, “Kim and Kanye don’t care about Taylor’s new music,” the source says. “They find it pathetic that she still tries to keep an old feud going. They are not going to give her or her new music any attention. They have more important things to focus on, like their family.”

To recap their complicated VMAS history: West interrupted Swift’s 2009 acceptance speech. They made up, and she introduced him at the 2015 ceremony. But after she took issue with his 2016 song “Famous” (“I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex / Why, I made that bitch famous”), Kardashian shared Snapchat “receipts” of Swift approving the first half of the lyric — but not the second. Swift defended herself, saying West never told her he was going to call her “that bitch” in the song.
“You don’t get to control someone’s emotional response to being called ‘that bitch’ in front of the entire world,” she wrote in an Instagram post at the time. “He promised to play the song for me, but he never did.” Swift asked to be “excused from this narrative” and the whole debacle became a storyline on E’s Keeping Up with the Kardashians.

West also explicitly included an image of Swift (among other celebs such as Chris Brown, Donald Trump and Amber Rose) lying naked in bed in the “Famous” music video.
As Swift sings, “another day, another drama.”


The Taylor Swift clones have taken Adele’s Vevo crown.
Less than 24 hours after releasing her new music video for “Look What You Made Me Do” during the MTV Video Music Awards on Sunday, Swift beat Adele’s record for most single-day views on Vevo.
Adele took the honor from Swift in October 2015, when her emotional video for “Hello” notched 27.7 million views, beating Swift’s previous record of 20.1 million views with “Bad Blood.”

Swift’s clip, directed by Joseph Kahn, finds the singer making several not-so-subtle references to her public feuds and features a group of Swift clones from different eras of her career dissing each other. Calling to mind Michael Jackson’s “Thriller,” the visual opens with a zombie Swift digging herself out of a grave.

Kahn pointed out Swift’s new accomplishment on Twitter Monday, writing to her fans, “YOU MOFOS BROKE THE VEVO RECORD. WITH 6 HOURS TO GO. Wut.”

EW has reached out to Vevo for more information on the record.
It’s just the latest feat Swift has achieved with the song, which broke streaming records on Spotify and YouTube on its first day of release, the Associated Press reported.
“Look What You Made Me Do” is Swift’s first solo track in three years and the debut single from her forthcoming sixth album, Reputation, due Nov. 10.

Will the real Taylor Swift please stand up?
The Grammy winner, 27, caused a social media storm on Sunday after releasing her music video for “Look What You Made Me Do.” In the final 30 seconds of the video, 14 Taylors standing in front of a private plane bicker with each other using common lines of criticism the superstar has faced throughout her career.
Youtube
But an extra Taylor standing in the back on the wing of the plane is hidden in the shadows — and fans believe that Taylor is the real Taylor.
Swift has “liked” several Tumblr posts about this theory, perhaps giving a nod to the rumor.

This version of Taylor makes her first appearance in the last 45 seconds of the music video. Wearing a head-to-toe printed outfit and a matching headband, she can be seen spray-painting the word “Reputation” onto the private plane.

As the younger versions of herself — including Taylors from the Fearless and Red eras, as well as the “You Belong with Me” music video, 2014 Met Ball and more — fight with each other, the possibly “real” version of Taylor stands silently in the back with her hand defiantly on her hip.

There are several other easter eggs for Swifties in the Joseph Kahn-directed video, which appears to clap back at both her haters and frenemies like Kim Kardashian West and Kanye West.
In one of the shots of Swift lying in the bathtub, a $1 bill lies next to her shoulder, likely referencing her sexual assault lawsuit against David Mueller, whom a jury found guilty of assault and battery against the star. There’s also a grave stone with the name Nils Sjoberg in the graveyard scene, which is a reference to the pen name Swift used for “This Is What You Came For,” her song with ex-boyfriend Calvin Harris.
In another scene, Swift — whose nails are painted a green shade similar to Spotify‘s logo color — robs the vault of “Stream Co.,” which likely is a reference to the period of time she removed her music from all streaming services and wrote a letter to Apple Music about artists being taken advantage of. (She recently released her entire catalogue back onto streaming services.)

Her backup dancers in another scene who wait on her hand and foot are also all wearing cut-off shirts with the words “I ❤ TS” on them, a clear jab at those who made fun of her ex-boyfriend Tom Hiddleston for wearing a similar tank while they were dating.
The last 30 seconds of the music video shows all the various Taylors arguing with each other, saying things her haters have accused her of over the last several years.
“Stop making that surprise face. It’s so annoying!” dead Taylor tells “You Belong with Me” Taylor. Adds the “Shake It Off” Taylor: “Yeah, you can’t possibly be that surprised all the time.”

“What’s that, bitch?” adds another, while dead Taylor shoots back, “Don’t call me that.”
“Oh, stop acting like you’re all nice. You are so fake,” the Red-era Taylor tells the Fearless Taylor. And yet another says, “There she goes playing the victim again.”
The video ends with the 2009 VMAs-Taylor repeating what Swift said in an Instagram caption she posted when hitting back at Kardashian West, who leaked a phone call between Swift and West last summer: “I would very much like to be excluded from this narrative.”

“Oh shut up!” the 14 other Taylors scream in unison.
The song is co-written by the “Shake It Off” singer, 27, and her longtime pal Jack Antonoff, who also produced several tracks off her last album 1989.
According to a press release, the single is the first song off Swift’s upcoming album, Reputation, which will be released on Nov. 10.



We’re nursing a serious case of déjà vu following the debut of Taylor Swift’s music video for “Look What You Made Me Do” at the MTV Video Music Awards.
While majority of viewers latched onto Swift’s many versions (or clones) of herself through the years, we can’t help but focus in on the many similarities “Look What You Made Me Do” shares with past music videos dreamt up by icons like Michael Jackson, Madonna, Beyoncé and more.
In case you need a reference or an excuse to rewatch the pop star’s new video for the 50th time today, here it is:

And now that you’re up to speed, let’s revisit a handful of other classic music videos that may or may not have inspired Swift’s latest.
Michael Jackson — ‘Thriller’

The uncanny resemblance: Approximately two seconds into “Look What You Made Me Do,” which introduced viewers to the “Taylor Swift’s Reputation” headstone, sparked nostalgia for Jackson’s “Thriller.”
Miley Cyrus — ‘Can’t Be Tamed’

The uncanny resemblance: Is Cyrus’ video for “Can’t Be Tamed” so synonymous with bird cages that we immediately thought of the former child star’s single while watching Swift’s video? Maybe, most definitely, yes.
Madonna — ‘What It Feels Like for a Girl’

The uncanny resemblance: Madonna has a need for speed in this 2006 music video for her single, “What It Feels Like for a Girl,” which also includes a heart-stopping car crash — much like Swift’s.
Beyoncé — ‘Formation’

The uncanny resemblance: While Swift’s “Look What You Made Me Do” doesn’t draw exact comparisons to Beyoncé’s visual Lemonade album, Twitter users were convinced a shot of Swift wearing a black leotard in the video’s teaser trailer was a direct take on Queen Bey’s smash hit.
Kylie Minogue — ‘All the Lovers’

The uncanny resemblance: In one of the most memorable moments of “Look What You Made Me Do,” a pyramid of “Old Taylors” can be seen reaching toward the new Taylor, reminiscent of Minogue’s 2010 video.
 


If you weren’t spending your Sunday night stress-watching dragons and frost-bitten zombies collide in Westeros, then you were likely tuned in to MTV to watch Katy Perry take her best shot at stand-up comedy or to see Pink give an inspirational speech … or to find out what, exactly, it was that we made Taylor Swift do, as she debuted her music video for her latest single. There was a lot to unpack from the “Look What You Made Me Do” clip, but the main takeaway isn’t that she’s gone full snake queen or reignited various rumored beefs, it’s that Taylor has apparently kept every single outfit she’s ever worn.
The grand finale of Swift’s extensive deep-dive into her past sees the star lining up a few of her most memorable past personas to comically bicker with one another and pick herself apart in front of a private jet graffitied with the word “Reputation.” The moment is a meta nod at the many roles the media has cast her in as well as an attempt at yet another reinvention into a pop star with a tougher, slightly more dangerous edge. And as it turns out, just like she never forgets a grudge, she also never gets rid of an outfit: every rewear came directly out of Taylor’s own archives.

Of course there’s zombie Taylor who opens the film announcing her own passing while wearing the same blue pleated J. Mendel dress from her “Out of the Woods” video, an outfit which also heralded the end of the 1989 period of her career.

…which is why it seems only fitting that zombie Tay would be the one to bury her 2014 Met Gala self, wearing a super feminine baby pink Oscar de la Renta gown with a giant bow on back (the one her cat tried to destroy), a look that also ushered us into the New York-centric era of her career.

The singer bursts into tears over her glittery acoustic guitar wearing the spangled black dress from her “Fearless” world tour, back in the days when she was still just a country girl who wore her hair in long curls and her song was a slamming screen door.

But it’s not just the super glam moments Swift brings back, she also pokes fun at herself by reviving her nerdy character from “You Belong With Me,” recreating the homemade t-shirt she wears but this time inscribing it with the various names of her squad, including Selena, Gigi, and Lena.

And what Taylor style retrospective could be complete without the dress she wore during that fateful moment at the 2009 VMAs that would inexplicably come to define the trajectory of both her and Kanye’s careers.

She brought back the ringleader look from her Red tour, complete with top hat, likely a cheeky nod to those haters who have proclaimed her to be a master manipulator.
Youtube
She also recreated her Swan Lake moment from “Shake It Off” in a full-on ballerina outfit. The scene is also so self-referential that it features a few of the looks she introduced in this very video, like the character in a leopard print coat and high pony who gets a Grammy for her car crash and the Taylor who seems to have become the queen of CGI snakes.
And it turns out, these looks are only the tip of the #TBT Tay iceberg. As her legions of fans have extensively documented on every social media platform, when you take a closer frame by frame look at that pile of zombie Taylors at the end a whole slew of her past red carpet selves can easily be seen, including the spangly romper she wore during her 1989 world tour, that rainbow sequin houndstooth matching set she wore to the VMAs in 2015, her “Shake It Off “cheerleader uniform, and the patterned velvet dress she wore to the BMI Pop Awards after she had her peroxide blonde Vogue reinvention. Now, we’re just left wondering how can we get a look inside Taylor’s career-spanning wardrobe archive and where could she possibly store it all?
What do you think of Taylor’s new music video? Which of her past looks is your favorite? Sound off below!



While Taylor Swift can claim one of the most iconic MTV Video Music Awards moments ever, her history with the show spans red carpet slays, buzzworthy performances and, of course, cameos from her famous squad. Scroll down to immerse yourself in every major moment of Taylor Swift at the VMAs as you prepare yourself for the “Look What You Made Me Do” music video premiere at Sunday’s show.
Taylor made her first VMAs appearance in 2008, resplendent in fluffy curls and a sweet white dress. It was the perfect VMAs debut look for America’s newest country sweetheart.

The singer kicked off her VMAs career on a strong note, interviewing celebs on the red carpet. Oh, and did we mention that she was nominated for the artist to watch category alongside Katy Perry and Miley Cyrus?
Kevin Mazur/WireImage
In 2009, Taylor’s return to the VMAs was even more exciting: She rolled up in a literal carriage, because why not, and made us all instantly question why we wanted cars for our 16th birthdays.
Kevin Mazur/WireImage
Of course, 2009 was also the year that Kanye West famously stagecrashed Taylor Swift after she won the best female video award for “You Belong with Me.”

The singer handled the shocking moment with grace, and in 2013, Vanity Fair even revealed that she has a framed photo of the incident in her house.

Swift performed “You Belong with Me” on a moving subway (which might be the most glamorous thing to ever happen on the subway).

Swift capped off one heckuva eventful night when Beyoncé brought her up to give her back her moment.

How do you follow up an awards show like that? In 2010, Taylor was back to perform “Innocent,” which was inspired by the previous year’s interruption. “I think a lot of people expected me to write a song about him. But for me it was important to write a song to him,” she told New York magazine of West.

The emotional performance included a clip from the stagecrash and a barefoot Swift.

Taylor went on a brief VMAs hiatus, returning to the awards show in 2012. With freshly chopped bangs and now-signature lipstick, the singer was beginning to usher in the Red era.

Of course, she took to the stage (in stripes!) to perform “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together.”

Take a moment to relive the glory that’s now a half-decade old.

The next year, Taylor walked the carpet in an ultra form-fitting navy gown and faux bob. (A sign of haircuts to come?)

In 2013, she also scooped up a best female video award for “I Knew You Were Trouble.”

Taylor didn’t slow down in 2014, walking the carpet in sky-high heels and a blue romper.

She was about to drop her fifth studio album, 1989, and performed a very sparkly rendition of “Shake It Off.”

Seriously. We will never be over the spangly two-piece and the tux-clad dancers.

However, nothing could ever prepare us for Taylor’s 2015 entrance. She was nominated for “Bad Blood,” so it only made sense that she brought her squad as her date(s).
Kevin Mazur/WireImage
Speaking of “Bad Blood,” yes, it won the video of the year honor.

She also took to the stage to perform a “The Night Is Still Young/ Bad Blood” mash-up with Nicki Minaj. (The performance squashed any rumors of beef between the two musicians, who got in a Twitter tiff ahead of the awards over a lack of diversity among nominees.)

The singer capped off her night by presenting Kanye West with the iconic Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award.

While Taylor opted out of the awards the next two years, she left fans absolutely shook when she premiered her “Look What You Made Me Do” video during the 2017 show. 

The audience was still reeling from the epic visual (so many iconic Taylors!) when the singer and Zayn won the best collaboration award for their song “I Don’t Wanna Live Forever.” In their absence, co-writer Jack Antonoff stepped up to the mic to accept the trophy.



The old Taylor Swift may be dead, but it seems her squad is very much still alive.
On Sunday, the 27-year-old singer dropped the music video for her new single, “Look What You Made Me Do.” And though the self-referential, Joseph Kahn-directed clip shows Swift dominating over and then destroying her followers at “Squad U” — a fictional factory where lines of identical women follow her rules — one clue in the video appears to give a clue that the pop star’s crew is still at it.
In the music video, Swift shows up as various versions of herself through the years — and in the last 30 seconds, the multiple Taylors say things to each other haters have accused her of throughout her career.

One of the Taylors is a surprised-face Swift, who — like the singer portrays in 2008’s “You Belong with Me” video —wears a hand-written T-shirt with the words “Junior Jewels” written on it.

But in this video, around the shirt are names of Swift’s squad members. So who’s included?

If the video is to believed, active members of the squad currently include Selena Gomez, Gigi Hadid, Ed Sheeran, Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds, Lena Dunham, Patrick Stewart, Abigail Anderson, Martha Hunt, Claire Kislinger and Haim sisters Este, Alana and Danielle.
Todrick Hall‘s name also makes the cut — though that’s not a surprise, seeing as he appears as a backup dancer in the video, wearing a cut-off shirt with the words “I ❤ TS” on it (a clear jab at those who made fun of Swift’s ex-boyfriend Tom Hiddleston for wearing a similar tank while they were dating).

One notable name not seen on the shirt is Karlie Kloss, and fans immediately went wild on social media wondering if there was a rift between the former BFFs.


oh my 😦 i think it's Karlie Kloss in #lookwhatyoumademedo with… Karlie had her own bedroom in TS' loft, right? gutted.  😦 #taylorswift

— Christina Writes (@christinawrites) August 28, 2017

Lorde and Ruby Rose are also not named on the shirt, but both the stars recently voiced their support for Swift.
After making comments that appeared as though she and Swift had a falling out, Lorde called the singer a “dear friend” on her Twitter account. “I want to say one more time that Taylor has been there for me in all my dark and light moments these past 5 years. All of them,” she added.
Swift dropped “Look What You Made Me Do” – the biting track off of her upcoming album, Reputation – on Thursday night, later debuting the first-look video preview on Friday’s Good Morning America. 
Though the song, which samples 1991 Right Said Fred hit “I’m Too Sexy,” is getting mixed reviews, it’s certainly a stunning departure for Swift. Rather than shaking off her haters, the singer appears to be taking some direct jabs at her enemies.
“I don’t like you,” she sings in the song’s verse, without naming anyone in particular.

It may not be a direct attack on anyone, though — despite rampant speculation.
Fans speculate that Swift is once again turning the tables on her haters by poking fun at the media’s perception of her as someone who always plays the victim — the same way her smash hit “Blank Space” (off of her Grammy-winning album 1989) mocked the portrayal of her as a man-eater.
“[From] 2013 to 2013, they thought I was dating too much because I dated two people in a year and a half, but whatever — we’ll leave it there,” she said during an interview with NME in 2014. “‘Oh, a serial dater. She only writes songs to get emotional revenge on guys. She’s a man hater. Don’t let her near your boyfriend.’ It was just kind of excessive and, you know, at first it was hurtful and then I kind of found a little comedy in it.”
“This character is so interesting though,” she added at the time. “If you go and read these gossip sites and they describe how I am, [it’s] so opposite my actual life.”
Swift’s sixth album, Reputation, will be released on Nov. 10.
