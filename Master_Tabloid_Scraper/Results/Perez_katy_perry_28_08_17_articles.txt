If Calvin Harris and Katy Perry had Feels about Taylor Swift's new music video, they showed it by displaying no emotion at all!
As we previously reported, Tay Tay made a splash at Sunday's MTV VMAs by premiering the music video for Look What You Made Me Do. Now, since LWYMMD is a diss track about Swift's many nemeses, it only makes sense that neither Perry nor Harris are fans of the new banger.

How do we know they're not fans?? Well, the Chained To The Rhythm artist was conspicuously absent from the stage amid Taylor's big debut. Many assume the video dropped right after a commercial break so that host Perry wouldn't have to present the vid.
However, this might just be a coincidence, as sources previously dished that Miz Swift's new song and album are NOT about Katy. Rather, it focuses on her beef with Kanye West and Kim Kardashian West. Hmmm.
Still, the music video took a big shot at the blonde pop starlet's ex. ICYMI, one of the gravestones featured in the visual has the name Nils SjÃ¶berg written on it. This was the pen name Taylor used when contributing to Calvin's This Is What You Came For. Following their split, Taylor took credit for co-writing the track and Calvin went OFF on Twitter about it.
So, no wonder the Scottish DJ (seemingly) refused to clap (below) following the Look What You Made Me Do showing.

We see you, Calvin!!
Does anyone else feel like their feud is only JUST getting started?? Eekâ€¦

It's no secret that Adam Levine isn't a fan of the MTV VMAs.
But, just in case we all forgot about how the Maroon 5 frontman feels, he made sure to remind us of his disdain by taking to Twitter and putting the award show on blast.

On Sunday evening, the Sugar singer wrote: 

It's always exciting to see how utterly horrible the VMAs will be. They really delivered so far this year. #HOLYFUCK

Oh snap! The Voice judge's feud with the VMAs dates back to 2011 when the hitmaker told the award show to "fuck" itself.
Adam's wife, Behati Prinsloo, also got shady about the industry event as she added:

Wow @vmas thanks for talking over then cutting to commercial half way through #juliamichaels performance. #votejuliamichaels

Whoever wrote Katy Perry's script for the #VMAs , I just want to let you know it's next level cringe worthy ðŸ˜³ #makeitstop

Hey, Behati's just saying what we were all thinking!!
As for Adam's remarks, we wouldn't say the VMAs were "utterly horrible." We mean, did you catch Kendrick Lamar's opening number???
