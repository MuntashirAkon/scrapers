Looks like Ashley Tisdale is a Swiftie once again!
As we previously reported, the High School Musical alum seemingly took shots at Taylor Swift's latest diss track, Look What You Made Me Do. Uh oh!

In a series of since deleted tweets, the 32-year-old wrote: 

"Music is supposed to bring us together. It's supposed to unite us. When we have artists targeting each other for the sake of controversy‚Ä¶ The art suffers. When will try to stop bringing each other down and start lifting us up when we live in a world that's doing exactly that?"
So shady!
While Miz Tisdale attempted to down play the drama by claiming the posts were not "about one person," the controversy clearly hasn't subsided for the former Disney darling as she made quite the online gesture on Monday. Following the release of the Look What You Made Me Do visual, the industry vet posted:




MONDAY‚Ä¶.. I'm coming for you üëäüèºüí•A post shared by Ashley Tisdale (@ashleytisdale) on Aug 28, 2017 at 8:55am PDT


We see you, Ashley!! In case you didn't realize, the clip (above) is from Tay's latest vid.
We're sure Taylor appreciates the support ‚Äî albeit delayed.

In case you're not familiar with Joel Osteen, he's a very, VERY wealthy pastor based in Houston, Texas.
His empire of best-selling books, a Sirius XM radio show, and televised sermons have given him an estimated net worth north of $50 million.

When southeast Texas was hit by unprecedented flooding from Hurricane Harvey, Osteen tweeted:

Victoria & I are praying for everyone affected by Hurricane Harvey. Please join us as we pray for the safety of our Texas friends & family.

And that's all he did.
People were quick to note on Twitter that he has not donated any money (that anyone can tell anyway), but more importantly he didn't open the doors of his 16,800-seating megachurch in Lakewood to refugees, despite it being spared from flooding and easily accessible.
See some of the most scathing tweets (below): 

Nice of @JoelOsteen to open his 16,000 seat mega church in Houston to floor victims. Lol jk he's not doing that.

Where's Joel Osteen? His church in Houston holds 16,800, and he has plenty of money. Open the doors and help people! Well, guess not eh!

Oh, he's apparently also blocking people who ask him about it, so clearly he got the message. He's just not available.
