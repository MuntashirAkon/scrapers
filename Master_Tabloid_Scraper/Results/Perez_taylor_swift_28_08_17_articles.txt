If Calvin Harris and Katy Perry had Feels about Taylor Swift's new music video, they showed it by displaying no emotion at all!
As we previously reported, Tay Tay made a splash at Sunday's MTV VMAs by premiering the music video for Look What You Made Me Do. Now, since LWYMMD is a diss track about Swift's many nemeses, it only makes sense that neither Perry nor Harris are fans of the new banger.

How do we know they're not fans?? Well, the Chained To The Rhythm artist was conspicuously absent from the stage amid Taylor's big debut. Many assume the video dropped right after a commercial break so that host Perry wouldn't have to present the vid.
However, this might just be a coincidence, as sources previously dished that Miz Swift's new song and album are NOT about Katy. Rather, it focuses on her beef with Kanye West and Kim Kardashian West. Hmmm.
Still, the music video took a big shot at the blonde pop starlet's ex. ICYMI, one of the gravestones featured in the visual has the name Nils Sjöberg written on it. This was the pen name Taylor used when contributing to Calvin's This Is What You Came For. Following their split, Taylor took credit for co-writing the track and Calvin went OFF on Twitter about it.
So, no wonder the Scottish DJ (seemingly) refused to clap (below) following the Look What You Made Me Do showing.

We see you, Calvin!!
Does anyone else feel like their feud is only JUST getting started?? Eek…

At least one beef was taken off the grill at this year's VMAs!
Months after their very public feud, Drake Bell and Josh Peck reunited at the MTV awards show on Sunday — and it was all hugs, brother!
The former Drake & Josh costars took to Instagram to post the same photo of themselves embracing at The Forum in L.A. (above), both captioning it, "Hug me…" Awww!

Earlier in the summer, it looked like the bitter end of the actors' friendship after Bell got VERY upset he wasn't invited to Peck's wedding and made his feelings known on Twitter.
The 31-year-old later admitted he was "just being cranky," and revealed he had made up with his on-screen step-bro in private.
Now, fans got the public reconciliation they deserve! So, how about that Drake & Josh revival, boys?
