We're sorry, the old Taylor Swift can't come to the phone right now. Why? Oh…
Because, according to a wild conspiracy theory, she's really a clone of Zeena Schreck — former high priestess of the Church of Satan!
This gem of a theory surfaced at the height of T.Swift's 1989-era, with woke internet users picking up on the popstar's uncanny resemblance to the renowned Satanist.
Now that we're in the age of ~dark Taylor~ with the songstress fully embracing her serpenty ways, we thought it was the perfect time to revisit this urban legend.
Both blondes are known for their signature devil-red lips, their affinity for the snake, and having fathers in high positions of power — Zeena is the daughter of Church of Satan founder Anton LaVey, while Tay is the daughter of a Merrill Lynch executive.
SpOOky!
Of course, this isn't the only celebrity conspiracy theory. Read up on more of the craziest ideas to hit Hollywood (below)!
