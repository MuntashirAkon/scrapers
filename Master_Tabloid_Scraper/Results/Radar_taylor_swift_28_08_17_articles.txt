Taylor Swift unleashed a ‘creepy smirk’ in her new UPS commercial.
Entitled #TaylorSwiftDelivery the 30 seconds advert was released before her ‘Look What You Made Me Do’ premiere.
Fans see Swift, 27, looking mysterious wearing blue jeans and a shoulder-less top writing a letter before wrapping a package.

The 10-time Grammy winner could be seen folding up a large cardboard box, apparently containing a copy of her sixth studio album, Reputation, due for release on November 10.
Swift is seen suddenly glaring at the camera showing-off her new harder edge persona.
The United Postal Service is the official delivery partner of Reputation and her name and image is on the side of their delivery trucks.
Her fans can enter a sweepstakes where the grand prize winner and three friends will be flown to one of her concerts, put up in a hotel, and receive memorabilia and a ‘glam squad.’

The controversial blonde will premiere the music video for her first single, ‘Look What You Made Me Do’, during this Sunday’s MTV Video Music Awards.
And many insiders are predicting that she will turn-up in person at The Forum in Inglewood to introduce the clip following her six-month hiatus from public life.
The ‘Blank Space’ singer was buoyed recently with her court victory in her ‘groping case’ with David Mueller.
Her new song is reportedly about Kanye West who has since vowed to get revenge on his female nemesis.

Revenge is a dish best served cold by Kim Kardashian’s husband.
After Taylor Swift dropped her latest diss track, “Look What You Made Me Do,” RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned that Kardashian wants Kanye West to retaliate.
Kardashian was less than thrilled with Swift’s new single, asking her friends “What are her lyrics even about? Is the whole song about Kanye?” a well-connected source told Radar.

She thinks the whole thing is “pathetic,” and wants West to retaliate against Swift.
“I don’t like your little games/ Don’t like your tilted stage/ The role you made me play/ Of the fool, no, I don’t like you/ I don’t like your perfect crime,” Swift sings in her controversial new tune from her not-yet-released album Reputation.
“Kim wants Kanye to be the one to respond if they do anything. She plans to be above it all and let him be the one to do or say anything,” the source spilled to Radar, noting that the lyrics were a dig at West, who had a tilted stage during his Saint Pablo tour.

West and Swift’s bad blood boiled over in 2016 over his “Famous” lyrics “I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex/ Why? I made that b**ch famous.”
“Kim was so glad that she recorded that phone call between Kanye and Taylor because she thinks Taylor is a total liar and a fake,” the source told Radar. “She knew she had to have to truth to get out there. And now she’s going to let Kanye do the dirty work.”

Taylor Swift not only seemed to diss Kim Kardashian and Kanye West on her new comeback single, “Look What You Made Me Do,” but snagged a member of the reality queen’s inner circle!
The pop star, 27, called on celebrity photographer Mert Alas to shoot the cover of her album. But Alas not only regularly works with Kardashian, the two are good friends, RadarOnline.com can report.

Alas has known Kardashian, 36, for years, and back in April she presented him with the “Creative Of The Year Award” at the 2017 Fashion Los Angeles Award for his photography work.
They’ve also worked together on several projects.

As Radar reported, Kardashian was livid when she learned she could possibly become Swift’s latest target on the singer’s new album.
“It’s about to get ugly, and Kim is ready to shut Taylor down!” a source told Radar.
Swift released her first single from her upcoming album Reputation on Thursday night. Her sixth album will be released on November 10.

Taylor Swift just bashed all the haters in her life with her newest single, “Look What You Made Me Do” and fans are freaking out!
After teasing her much-anticipated album, Reputation, the singer exposed some brutal lyrics in her new song.
While Swift has been involved in various feuds with A-listers such as Katy Perry, 32, and ex boyfriend Calvin Harris, it is Kanye West and Kim Kardashian fans believe she’s really after.
“I don’t like your little games/ Don’t like your tilted stage/ The role you made me play/ Of the fool, no, I don’t like you/ I don’t like your perfect crime,” she sings in the controversial new tune.

West, 40, infamously uses a tilted stage in his concert performances.
As RadarOnline.com exclusively reported, Kardashian and West vowed to bash Swift if she decided to insult them in her secret album.
“Kanye is going to let Taylor have it if she goes after Kim on this new album,” a source close to star told Radar. “Kim is just tired of playing this game with Taylor. She has clearly had it out for the both of them, and Kim is so ready to fight fire with fire if this album includes any shade.”
Swift has bad blood for West ever since he interrupted her MTV acceptance speak in 2009, but her feud with Kardashian, 36, began in 2016 when the pop star claimed she didn’t give West permission to say “I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex, because I made that b***h famous” in his song “Famous.”

After Kardashian leaked footage of Swift appearing to approve the lyrics, things especially turned sour.
“Wait it’s legit National Snake Day?!?!?!? They have holidays for everybody, I mean everything these days!” Kardashian tweeted after the incident.
As Radar readers know, Swift, 27, recently deleted all of the content from her social media accounts and teased her album by posting Instagram videos of a dark snake creeping between in the darkness.

Taylor Swift’s first single off her highly-anticipated album Reputation is about to drop, and RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned that Kim Kardashian and hubby Kanye West are ready to wage war against the mudslinging singer.
“Kanye is going to let Taylor have it if she goes after Kim on this new album,” a source close to the KUWTK beauty, 36, said.
“Kim is just tired of playing this game with Taylor. She has clearly had it out for the both of them, and Kim is so ready to fight fire with fire if this album includes any shade.”

“It’s about to get ugly, and Kim is ready to shut Taylor down!”
The feud between Kardashian, West, 40, and Swift, 27, began last year, when the pop star claimed she didn’t give the rapper permission to say “I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex, because I made that b***h famous” in his song “Famous.”
But then Kardashian posted footage of Swift approving of the lyrics — and later seemed to shade her by referring to National Snake Day.

Wait it's legit National Snake Day?!?!?They have holidays for everybody, I mean everything these days! 🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍
— Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) July 17, 2016

Following the incident, Swift — who, up to that point had been incredibly active on social media — disappeared from the spotlight.
Until now!
After deleting all of the content from her social media accounts, which currently have over 100 million followers, Swift posted several GIFs to promote her new album. And it appeared to be aimed at Kardashian!
