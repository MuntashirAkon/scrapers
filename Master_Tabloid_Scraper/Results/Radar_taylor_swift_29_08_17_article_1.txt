“The video played right after commercial and after it end they did not go back to the host, which was the original plan.”
The reason?
“Katy wanted nothing to do with Taylor!” said the insider.
As Radar reported, it had appeared Perry, 32, was walking back her infamous dislike of 27-year-old Swift.

“I forgive her and I’m sorry for anything I ever did, and I hope the same from her,” Perry recently said on the Thrive Global podcast.
“I think it’s actually like, I think it’s time. There are bigger fish to fry, and there are real problems in the world. You know what I’m saying? And I love her, and I want the best for her.”
