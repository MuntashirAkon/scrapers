Swimmers gonna swim.  Michael Phelps just announced his wife, Nicole, is pregnant with baby #2 -- a little over a year after she gave birth to their first kid.  "Number 2 on the way, " the Olympic legend said ...  "So excited! Wonder if it's a boy or a girl. " Michael and Nicole got married in a secret ceremony back in June, right after their 1st son Boomer was born.  Now, they're adding to their brood ... and once again, doing it faster than Ryan Lochte.  Congrats! /n
