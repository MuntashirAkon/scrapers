Scott Disick wants you to live like a Lord.

The Keeping Up with the Kardashians star is renting out his Hidden Hills home — which he bought for $5.96 million in 2015 and flipped — for a whopping $90,000 a month.
Sitting at 8,110 square feet, the seven-bedroom, seven-bathroom house features a sun-soaked chef’s kitchen, expansive great room, a wine cellar, a game room, a hotel-inspired master suite with a large sitting area, two walk-in closets and a spacious bathroom fit for a king.
Via TMZ:
We’re told Scott’s aware Kardashian fans might want a peek inside the crib so anyone wanting to see the place will go through a strict vetting process.
We’re told Scott’s hoping to score a long-term lease with the option to buy … and the home’s not cheap.
