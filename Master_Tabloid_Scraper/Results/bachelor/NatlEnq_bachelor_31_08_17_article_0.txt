Corinne Olympios gave her fellow "Bachelor in Paradise" cast member DeMario Jackson a big hug when they supposedly ran into each other at a Los Angeles nightclub — after insiders told The National ENQUIRER that their alleged rape scandal was a ploy to bring in ratings! Corinne claimed that she was still a "victim" after ABC declared that video cleared DeMario of charges that he took advantage of her sexually while she was drunk. But now they've kissed and made up — just as sources predicted when talking to The ENQUIRER! “Reality TV contestants go into these shows with their wide eyes open, and nearly every company has them sign an indemnity clause to protect producers,” noted one reality-show veteran. “That way if someone regrets a hookup or gets a disease, nobody can hold the show responsible!” Another insider added that “no contestant complained about what went down. Staffers made all the noise.” Heavyweight lawyer Marty Singer, who represents the “Bachelor” contestant at the center of the supposed scandal, Corinne Olympios, confirms the show stirred the controversy. “It needs to be made crystal-clear that production of ‘Bachelor in Paradise’ was shut down because of multiple complaints received from “BIP” producers and crew members on the set," Singer said early in the controversy. “It was not shut down due to any complaint filed by Corinne against anyone.”/n
