George Clooney wants to add new neighbor Kit Harington to his A-list tribe — but the “Game of Thrones” hottie isn’t interested in joining Clooney’s clique! Sources told The National ENQUIRER that since Kit — known for his role as Jon Snow — bought a Tudor-style home only miles from George’s English country estate, George has been begging the TV star to hang out — but to no avail! “George has been pestering Kit with invites to his mansions in Berkshire [England] and Lake Como [Italy] — but he’s in for disappointment,” a tipster snitched to ATB. “Kit doesn’t want to be his new pal.” The insider disclosed that although Kit, 30, takes his career seriously, he has vowed never to become part of Hollywood’s “scene,” preferring to spend his downtime with girlfriend — and former “GoT” onscreen love — Rose Leslie, also 30. “Kit’s mind is pretty made up. He doesn’t want to be George’s buddy, but George keeps begging him to come away on a motorbike tour. It’s getting annoying!” said another squealer. “[Kit’s home is] too far to take a boat, thank goodness — or else George would probably row by!”/n
