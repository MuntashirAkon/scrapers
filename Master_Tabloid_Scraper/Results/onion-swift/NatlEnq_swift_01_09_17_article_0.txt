Katy Perry and Calvin Harris were caught out together after the MTV VMA Awards Show on Sun., August 27 — but The National ENQUIRER reported on June 5 that the pop star was after Taylor Swift's ex! Katy has said publicly that she "truly wants to come together" and end her long-running feud with her fellow pop diva. But insiders weren't surprised when Katy showed up after the VMA Awards at the Dream Hotel where Calvin (here with Taylor in 2015) was performing a DJ set! “Katy knew she would strike when the time was right, and there’s no time better than this,” said a source — adding that Katy’s been seething since she was ripped in Taylor’s song “Bad Blood,” and had even been rumored to have dated Taylor’s ex John Mayer as a matter of revenge more than romance. The ENQUIRER had the scoop on Katy's collaboration with Calvin that was released on June 26 — and, said the insider: “Calvin’s used the conversations to pour his heart out to Katy, telling her how furious he was that he was made to look like a bad guy in the breakup with Taylor — and Katy’s been happy to lend a sympathetic shoulder!”/n
