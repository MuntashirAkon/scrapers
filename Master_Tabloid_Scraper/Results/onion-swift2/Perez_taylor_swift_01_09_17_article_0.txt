An insider bashed the rumors, dishing:
"Taylor and Karlie are still very much good friends."
In fact, the 27-year-old singer looks up to the supermodel and Kode with Klossy summer camp founder: 
"Taylor respects Karlie so much for doing her own thing and being smart. Taylor has so much admiration for her, especially for educating girls with coding."
Aww!!
It doesn't explain why Karlie's name was noticeably absent from LWYMMD, but we're sure fans will be happy to know the 25-year-old wasn't the backstabber Taylor subtly referenced in the music video!
Thoughts???
