Oh, how the tables have turned!
We all know Kim Kardashian West and Taylor Swift probably won't be hamming it up next to each other at an awards show anytime soon (like above), but there was a time back in 2009 when the KUWTK star proclaimed herself T.Swift's "biggest fan"!
Shocking, right?

During a red carpet interview eight years ago, way before the Famous feud, Kimmie told a reporter all about her love for the pop singer and how she was "watching" her on Twitter! Who knew she'd use this very tool to #expose Taylor years later!
Watch the fascinating interview in the clip (below)!
