The MTV Awards were a big hit Sunday night with celebs who eyeballed it at The Forum ... to a person they had high praise. We got Jared Leto, Mel B, Heidi Klum, Post Malone, Joe Jonas,Â Shawn Mendes, Nina Dobrev and Jessie J at the Republic Records and Cadillac party at TAO after the ceremony. They gushed over the show. BTW ... some of them were mum on Taylor Swift's music video. It's kinda like ... do you really want to cross Kim and Kanye?/n
