Kanye West looked a tad pensive as he left his offices Friday, after the announcement that Taylor Swift's new album will be released on the 10-year-anniversary of his mom's death.   As you know, Taylor furor in the song,  "Look What You Made Me Do " is aimed at Kanye and Kim. Kanye's sporting a t with the words,  "my bloody Valentine " emblazoned on the front.  Unclear what that means. As we reported, Kayne and Kim will not go to the VMA's Sunday, where Taylor is going to make an appearance./n
