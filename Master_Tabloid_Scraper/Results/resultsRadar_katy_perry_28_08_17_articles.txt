Taylor Swift just bashed all the haters in her life with her newest single, “Look What You Made Me Do” and fans are freaking out!
After teasing her much-anticipated album, Reputation, the singer exposed some brutal lyrics in her new song.
While Swift has been involved in various feuds with A-listers such as Katy Perry, 32, and ex boyfriend Calvin Harris, it is Kanye West and Kim Kardashian fans believe she’s really after.
“I don’t like your little games/ Don’t like your tilted stage/ The role you made me play/ Of the fool, no, I don’t like you/ I don’t like your perfect crime,” she sings in the controversial new tune.

West, 40, infamously uses a tilted stage in his concert performances.
As RadarOnline.com exclusively reported, Kardashian and West vowed to bash Swift if she decided to insult them in her secret album.
“Kanye is going to let Taylor have it if she goes after Kim on this new album,” a source close to star told Radar. “Kim is just tired of playing this game with Taylor. She has clearly had it out for the both of them, and Kim is so ready to fight fire with fire if this album includes any shade.”
Swift has bad blood for West ever since he interrupted her MTV acceptance speak in 2009, but her feud with Kardashian, 36, began in 2016 when the pop star claimed she didn’t give West permission to say “I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex, because I made that b***h famous” in his song “Famous.”

After Kardashian leaked footage of Swift appearing to approve the lyrics, things especially turned sour.
“Wait it’s legit National Snake Day?!?!?!? They have holidays for everybody, I mean everything these days!” Kardashian tweeted after the incident.
As Radar readers know, Swift, 27, recently deleted all of the content from her social media accounts and teased her album by posting Instagram videos of a dark snake creeping between in the darkness.

RadarOnline.com can reveal that Katy Perry‘s love-fest with ex Orlando Bloom is back on, but those close to the pop singer warn she should protect her heart!
Just one day after their romantic redo at a Los Angeles concert on Aug. 12, Bloom was caught on camera romping with a bikini-clad blonde on the beach in Malibu.
“Katy wouldn’t like that,” a friend blasted. “To go from her one night to another woman the very next day would hurt deeply and possibly send her over the edge!”
PHOTOS: Katy Perry & Orlando Bloom Escape Cheating Scandal Drama On Trip To Cannes
The 32-year-old “Roar” singer — who dated musician John Mayer after divorcing Brit comic Russell Brand — made headlines when she recently admitted suffering from “very low thoughts.”
Perry confessed: “I have my own addictions that I struggle with, whether that’s love or substance or things like that, and it’s up and down…even attention, I get so much attention and that can become an addiction.”
After her revelation, Perry, who dated Bloom, 40, for ten months before they split nearly ten months ago, seemed to spiral out of control.

On June 13, she was helped off the stage in the middle of singing “I Kissed a Girl” after complaining she didn’t feel well.
Two months later, she was spotted snuggling with the Pirates of the Caribbean hunk at the Ed Sheeran concert.
“Orlando said he’d come back to save Katy from her free fall and get her life back on track,” a pal told Radar.
“But no one really believes they’ll live happily ever after.”

Katy Perry has been told to play it cool when she makes her debut as a judge on American Idol.
The “Firework” singer is reportedly being paid $25 million by ABC for the gig, but that huge fee has reportedly come with some conditions attached.
A source revealed to RadarOnline.com: “They want a more modulated and thoughtful Katy. It’s not like they’re asking her to change her hairstyle or revise her style team, but they are asking her not to upstage the contestants the way some past judges, especially Mariah Carey, had the tendency to do.

“They want the show to be disciplined and taken as seriously as the Oscars instead of taking on the circus atmosphere that has made The Voice such a big hit.”
One idea being floated is that the audience would see Perry, 32, judging the show in just her sweat pants or dressing gown.
This would show her in a more down-to-earth style as opposed to her often over the top “glam queen” image.
Perry – who has been linked to Orlando Bloom once again – is delighted to be back.

After landing the judging spot on AI she said: “I am honored and thrilled to be the first judge bringing back the American Idol tradition of making dreams come true for incredible talents with authentic personalities and real stories.
“I’m always listening to new music, and love discovering diamonds in the rough — from mentoring young artists on my label, or highlighting new artists on my tours, I want to bring it back to the music.”

Taylor Swift and Katy Perry have waged war against each other for years, but could the MTV Video Music Awards finally put an end to their bitter feud?
“In the past they have teamed up Madonna and Britney and other big stunts [at the show],” an insider told RadarOnline.com. “This year they don’t have anything huge and are begging to bring peace to Taylor and Katy.”
“Katy is the host of the awards and she is cool with having Taylor join her onstage,” continued the insider, adding, however, “Taylor isn’t so keen.”
Perry, 32, recently indicated she’d be willing to let bygones be bygones with 27-year-old Swift.

“I forgive her and I’m sorry for anything I ever did, and I hope the same from her,” Perry said on the Thrive Global podcast. “I think it’s actually like, I think it’s time. There are bigger fish to fry, and there are real problems in the world. You know what I’m saying? And I love her, and I want the best for her.”
Now, if the show’s organizers can somehow convince Swift to call a temporary ceasefire, there’s already a plan in place on how to proceed.
“They won’t perform together but would take the stage and pretend together,” said the insider. “It would be like 1998 when Mariah and Whitney appeared together in the same dress.”
A Swift and Perry joint act would be a much-needed bump in excitement for the show.

“The music business is a mess,” said the insider. “Pink is getting the Michael Jackson awards, but no one is excited about that.”
“We need to create a moment that goes viral; something that blows up the Internet,” insisted the insider.
And if Swift digs in her heels and refuses the idea, MTV has another big idea.
Revealed the insider: “Producers are also begging Beyonce to make her first post twins appearance.”
