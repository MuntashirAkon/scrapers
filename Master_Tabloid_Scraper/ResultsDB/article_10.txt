The panel – which already consists of executive producer Melissa Rivers, 47, stylist to the stars Brad Goreski, 38, former E! news host Giuliana Rancic, 41 and funny lady newcomer Margaret Cho, 47 – will be returning to the air on Jan. 11, which is one day after the Golden Globe Awards.
“This is the first time ever that Fashion Police will have five panelists at the same time,” the insider told Radar.
When asked whether or not Leakes is being considered for a full-time panel position, the insider said, “Everyone is hoping for that, yes.”
“They want to see how well she does in terms of numbers and ratings before offering her a full-time contract,” said the source.

“But if they see a dramatic increase in numbers for this upcoming episode, then she will most likely be given the gig full-time.”
As Radar previously reported, since Joan Rivers’ sudden death at the age of 81 in 2014, the show has had countless changes to the cast, including losing veteran judges Kelly Osbourne, 31, and George Kotsiopoulos, 47.
In Dec. 2014, Rivers’ longtime friend, Kathy Griffin, 55, joined as a host, only to quit shortly thereafter amid tensions with Rancic.
