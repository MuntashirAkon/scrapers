Things may be done between Kendall Jenner and A$AP Rocky after she was seen out with Blake Griffin not once, but twice in the same week.

The 21-year-old model was spotted getting cozy with the basketball star in the Hamptons on Friday and Saturday, before they were photographed having dinner over on the west coast in Los Angeles.
Via TMZ:
Kendall and Blake grabbed dinner at Craig’s Sunday night in WeHo. It appears they jumped in separate whips but were seen together inside the joint. Just last week, they left Avenue Nightclub in Hollywood and jumped in the same limo.
No word on whether Kendall kicked A$AP Rocky to the curb and rebounded with the NBA superstar. Same goes for Blake … who last September welcomed his second child with Brynn Cameron.
