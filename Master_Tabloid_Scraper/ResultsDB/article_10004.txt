Tom Cruise Tried, Failed 'Mission Impossible' Building Stunt at Least Twice/nTom Cruise's injuries on the set of  "Mission Impossible 6 " might be more severe than previously thought ... 'cause he tried and failed his building stunt jump at least twice. TMZ has obtained a second video showing Tom Sunday attempting to clear a building with one giant hop during filming for  "MI:6 " ... and like the first clip, he fails here too -- this time perhaps more miserably. The hit against the side of the building sounds crushing -- and considering he tried this at least twice -- it raises questions as to how seriously he's hurt ... and whether this might affect the rest of production.  We've placed a call in to Tom's reps and Paramount Pictures ... so far no word back. /n
