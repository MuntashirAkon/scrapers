Mike Ditka: Crown Mitch Trubisky the Starter, Better 1st Game Than Tom Brady/nIf Mitch Trubisky isn't the Chicago Bears starting QB in Week 1,  "You've got problems " -- so says Bears legend Mike Ditka.  To say Da Coach was impressed with the rookie's preseason debut Thursday night is a gross understatement ... Ditka believes it's TRUB OR CONSEQUENCES!   "What I saw out of Trubiksy for a rookie in his first game I thought was outstanding. "  Trub -- the #2 pick in the draft -- went 18-25 for 166 yards and a TD after replacing starting QB Mike Glennon who went 2-8 for 20 yards and an interception.  Ditka thinks the decision is obvious ... and says Mitch made a better first impression than guys like Tom Brady and Fran Tarkenton.   "It's clear cut he should be your starter.
