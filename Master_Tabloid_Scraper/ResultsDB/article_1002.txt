Sanya Richards-Ross Says She Got Abortion Before Beijing Olympics /nU.S. Olympic sprinter Sanya Richards-Ross has revealed she had an abortion the day before flying to Beijing for the 2008 Olympic Games.  Sanya dropped the bombshell in her new book, 'Chasing Grace' -- saying she and her husband, Aaron Ross (a former NYG cornerback), made the decision together during a phone call.   "Everything I ever wanted seemed to be within reach, " SRR wrote ...  "The culmination of a lifetime of work was right before me. "  "In that moment, it seemed like no choice at all. The debate of when life begins swirled through my head, and the veil of a child out of wedlock at the prime of my career seemed unbearable. What would my sponsors, my family, my church, and my fans think of me? " Sanya competed in the 400m race that year -- and won the bronze medal. However, she won gold as part of the 4x400 relay team./n
