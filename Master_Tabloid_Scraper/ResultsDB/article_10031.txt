According to TMZ, Drake was found in his Hollywood home by a friend who came over for a visit.
The friend called paramedics at about 1:30 pm on Thursday afternoon, but Drake was  pronounced dead at the scene. A cause of death has not yet been revealed.
Drake's work on L.A. Law was groundbreaking at the time — his character, Benny, was developmentally disabled, and storylines around the character focused on his job, getting an apartment and a girlfriend, and fighting for his rights.
This work led to wide praise from critics, and garnered Drake experience as a recurring regular from 1987 through 1994, as well as three Emmy nominations — including two wins — from 1988 through 1990.
The actor's work was far from being only limited to L.A. Law, however. He appeared at Elmer in Rowan Atkinson's 1997 hit comedy Bean, and was the villainous Durant in 1990's Darkman and its sequels.

Horror fans will also know Drake from playing the titular homicidal physician in 1992's classic slasher flick Dr. Giggles.
In the 2000s, Drake earned himself quite a bit of work as a voice actor for animated shows, while also guest starring on Six Feet Under, Crossing Jordan, 7th Heaven, and Boston Legal, among other shows.
In his later years, Drake apparently concentrated on teaching acting, and worked less and less on set.
Our thoughts are with Drake's family, friends, and loved ones during this difficult time.
