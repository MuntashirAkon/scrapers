American Idol will be coming to end after its 15th season.

But that will be the end!

Sources state that this season will be: 

"[A] season-long celebratory event."
Color us excited! We can only imagine the long list of past Idol winners and contestants who will be brought back into the spotlight.
Paging former Congressman hopeful Clay Aiken?! If Simon Cowell doesn't make a surprise appearance we'll be shocked — and DEVASTATED!!
Though we aren't 100% surprised that the hit show has come to a close. The reality show may've returned to normalcy these past few seasons — but it seems it never regained the juggernaut status it once had.
Reportedly, this season only averaged a 2.7 rating among adults 18-49 and 10.7 million viewers during Wednesday episodes. Not quite the 30 million views they once had!
It's been a good run, Idol. We'll cherish this time we've got left with you!
