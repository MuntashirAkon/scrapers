Fallon has had two hand injuries over the past year. First, he fell in his New York apartment in June and his wedding ring caught on the edge of the table nearly ripping his finger off. Then, he fell again with a bottle of Jägermeister in October upon receiving The Harvard Lampoon’s Elmer Award for excellence in humor.
“We are always worried about his safety and health,” continued the NBC exec. “There’s been conversations about that. The stories are exaggerated about all of it. I don’t know to what extent. I haven’t been part of it. I don’t have those conversations with Jimmy Fallon.”
