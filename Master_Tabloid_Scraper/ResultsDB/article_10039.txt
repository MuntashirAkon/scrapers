Everyone’s favorite longhaired Brit Kit Harington celebrated the New Year in Brazil and while there, he took in all the history and beauty South America has to offer. He hit the beach and enjoyed some cocktails with his pals while showing off his Elmer’s Glue-hued torso. He also reportedly visited some museums, trekked in a rainforest, and even did some dancing!
A video was posted of the Game of Thrones heartthrob attempting the samba, a popular Brazilian dance. Check it out.

The clip may be brief but it’s clear he knows what he’s doing. Although he plays a pretty glum, hardened warrior on the hit HBO show, Harington appears lighthearted while on vacation. The young actor has reason to celebrate, having just turned 29 in late Dec.
Now…we better see him in Westeros again!
