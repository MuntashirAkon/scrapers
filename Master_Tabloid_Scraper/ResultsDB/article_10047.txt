Did the zom-rom-com charm critics?

 2009’s The Haunting in Connecticut emerged as a surprisingly better-than-expected haunted house movie, garnering strong critical notices and solid box office.
So it makes sense that the film would spawn a sequel, The Haunting in Connecticut 2: Ghosts of Georgia. What doesn’t make quite as much sense is that this movie has zero on-screen ties to the first film, making the title both headache-inducing and an obvious attempt to cash in on the clout of the 2009 film.
The convoluted title is the least of the film’s problems, according to critics. Is Georgia worth your hard-earned cash this weekend? Read on to find out…

Set in 1993, Georgia centers on the Wyrick family: Mother Lisa (Abigail Spencer), her sister Joyce (Battlestar Galactica’s Katee Sackhoff) and young daughter Heidi (Emily Alyn Lind).

They have just moved into – naturally – an historic country home haunted by former travelers on the Underground Railroad. Lots of scary [email protected] ensues, as does a very uneven time at the movies. We’ll let the critics explain:
Mark Olsen, The Los Angeles Times
“The Haunting in Connecticut 2: Ghosts of Georgia might win for most unwieldy title of the year, but there’s little else to distinguish this movie… from the recent crop of supernatural horror thrillers supposedly based on true stories. The storytelling, from a script by David Coggeshall, is at times nearly incoherent and relies too often on random scares.”
Joe Lydon, Variety
“The Haunting in Connecticut 2: Ghosts of Georgia has nothing whatsoever to do with the 2009 supernatural thriller… And that turns out to be a very good thing… First-time feature helmer Tom Elkins (who served as editor on the original “Haunting in Connecticut” and co-edited this pic) and scripter David Coggeshall do a fine job of grounding the story’s fantastical elements in something strongly resembling mundane reality.”
Evan Dickson, Bloody-Disgusting.com
“For a film that reportedly cost $9 Million, Georgia looks astoundingly cheap – which doesn’t at all help the flat and uninteresting material. Its heart might be in the right place, but it runs out of gas miles and miles before it can get there. It’s a boring, ramshackle slog buoyed slightly by its likable lead performers.”

William Goss, Film.com
“Despite some occasionally handsome widescreen framing, much of this is well-worn hokum, full of cracked picture frames, invasive insects, dreams within dreams, jump cuts, flickering lights (a phenomenon to which even the moon itself is susceptible) and the reliable false bottom of the second act, wherein our protagonists think they’ve solved the problem, only to make things much worse for themselves.”
Frank Scheck, The Hollywood Reporter
“Its ridiculously awkward, franchise-motivated attempt of a title notwithstanding, The Haunting in Connecticut 2: Ghosts of Georgia actually offers some decent scares before descending into typical horror film bombast.”
