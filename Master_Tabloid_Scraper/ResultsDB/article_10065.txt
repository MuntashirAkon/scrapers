Empire Carpet Commercial Guy Elmer Lynn Hauldren -- Dead at 89/nEmpire Carpet spokesman Elmer Lynn Hauldren -- the most famous carpet spokesperson of all time -- has died at age 89. You may remember Elmer from decades Empire commercials ... you know, the ones that feature that super-catchy jingle ... 800-588-2300 ... EMPIRE (today!). Elmer -- a decorated WW2 vet -- became the company spokesperson back in the '70s ... and appeared in a ton of ads. In recent years, the company switched to an animated version of Elmer -- but the spots still feature Elmer's voice. R.I.P./n
