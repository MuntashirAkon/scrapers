Inside Dolly Parton's Odd Marriage To Carl Dean/n
Dolly Parton will celebrate 51 years of marriage to Carl Dean this spring, but some question if the couple’s relationship has lasted so long because they aren’t exactly the typical husband and wife.
The pair met outside the Wishy Washy Laundromat the very first day Parton, 71, arrived in Nashville.

“I was surprised and delighted that while he talked to me, he looked at my face (a rare thing for me),” she said of their whirlwind meeting. “He seemed to be genuinely interested in finding out who I was and what I was about.”
They got hitched on May 30, 1966.
Despite their longevity as a couple, as Radar reported, there have been whispers about Parton and her childhood gal pal, Judy Ogle.
According to the book Doctors to the Stars, the country singer will never confess to having an attraction Ogle or any other women.
