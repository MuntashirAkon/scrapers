Kim Kardashian Hater Arrested For Destroying Star's Selfie Books At Store/n
A Connecticut man hates the Kardashian klan so much, Kim in particular, he’s willing to kill — her books.
Carl Puia, 74, was arrested on Monday after destroying a number of Kim Kardashian’s Selfish books for sale at a Glastonbury Barnes & Noble, in what authorities called a “massacre.”
But he didn’t just flee the crime scene! Puia made sure to leave a note behind, in which he detailed his motive behind the incident, namely his hatred for Kim and “people like her,” WVIT reports.

According to the New York Post, security camera footage from the October 2016 incident captured Puia pouring a red liquid over copies of Selfish, six of which were ruined and “could not be revived,” Glastonbury Police revealed in a statement.

The 74-year-old turned himself in to police on Monday. He was charged with criminal mischief and released on a $2,500 bond.
