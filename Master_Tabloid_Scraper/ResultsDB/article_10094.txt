Catelynn Lowell And Tyler Baltierra Reunite With Adopted Daughter Carly After Two Years! So Cute!/n

This is so adorable!!
Teen Mom stars Catelynn Lowell Baltierra and husband Tyler Baltierra have reunited again with their daughter Carly for the first time in two years!
Of course, they gave up Carly for adoption in the first season of Teen Mom, and while it was an open adoption that gave them the chance to see their daughter every so often, they haven't seen her for two whole years — right up until this weekend!!
