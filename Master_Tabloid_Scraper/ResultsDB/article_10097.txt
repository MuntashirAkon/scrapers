Justin Bieber may have apologized to fans for canceling his Purpose World Tour, but he won’t do it for the crew members who were left without jobs.

When approached by the paparazzi Tuesday night about the hundreds of people who were suddenly out of work due to the tour’s cancellation, the 23-year-old became aggressively defensive. While leaving BOA Steakhouse with pal Patrick Schwarzenegger, he scolded photographers for asking the question before brushing off the notion that he was responsible for all the unemployed folks of his now-defunct tour.
“They’re not my staff,” he said. “Somebody who works on the tour is not my staff.”
He also explained that his personal staffers will not go without a paycheck, saying, “People that I employ? No way.”
According to TMZ, the recent cancellation of Bieber’s tour — which only had 14 stops left on its two-year run — was partly fueled by the singer’s “spiritual awakening” as a member of the Hillsong Church. A source told the outlet, “The church didn’t tell Justin to cancel the tour. He made his decision based on spiritual soul-searching and his own view of the path in life he should be taking.”
