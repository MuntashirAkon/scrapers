Things between Ben Affleck and Lindsay Shookus are moving faster than we thought.

The couple, whose hush-hush relationship was made public earlier this month, were recently spotted spending some quality time together at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in New York City. Though Shockus — a producer on Saturday Night Live — is based in the Big Apple, she happily ditched her home and temporary shacked up with the two-time Oscar winner when he was in town.
The pair “have been trying to take it slow but it’s progressing quickly,” a source told People of the budding romance, which is rumored to have began in 2015 when Affleck was married to Jennifer Garner. “Their feelings are strong.”
