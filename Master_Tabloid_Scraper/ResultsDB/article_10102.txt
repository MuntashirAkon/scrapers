A person can change a lot in two years. Just ask Mama June Shannon.

The Here Comes Honey Boo Boo alum showed off her 300-pound weight loss at the premiere of WE tv’s Growing Up Hip Hop Atlanta Tuesday (May 23, 2017). Clad in a scarlet halter-top dress and black heels, the 37-year-old flaunted her size 4 figure as she sashayed down the red carpet.

Shannon’s new look was quite the departure from when she walked another WE tv carpet in November 2015. Then weighing almost 460 lbs., the mom-of-four since dropped the pounds by undergoing a gastric sleeve surgery, a breast augmentation and skin removal surgery.

According to Shannon, she spent close to $75,000 for her transformation.
“I already had all of this planned out even before the cameras,” she told Wendy Williams in April. “[The surgeries] were already scheduled. I wasn’t gonna change anything.”
