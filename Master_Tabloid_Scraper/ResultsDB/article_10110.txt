Carl's Jr is revamping with the new tagline, "Pioneers of the great American burger."No longer will foodies see celebs like Kate Upton, Audrina Patridge, Emily Ratajkowski, Heidi Klum, Padma Lakshmi, Hayden Panettiere, Nina Agdaland Charlotte McKinney wearing next-to nothing and chowing down in their ads.Instead, expect far less skin and way more close-ups on fresh ingredients. 

Watch the entire ad in the video above, and tell us in the comments, are you ready for Carl's Jr. to make the change?!
