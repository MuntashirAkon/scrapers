To see how Cooke, Radke and Taylor answered, watch the video now."Thanks for playing," Cohen told his guests. "You all get Mazel boxer briefs."In the same episode, Cohen also got to the bottom of why Taylor and co-star Scheana Shay were temporarily not on speaking terms. "We kind of went through a little tiff. I kind of was hungover, and when I'm drunk I kind of go and text everybody the next morning and I go on a tangent, and I did that. I kind of went off on her," he said. "But we're fine now. We made up."(E! and Bravo are both members of the NBCUniversal family.)
