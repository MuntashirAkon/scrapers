The royal couple shared the first photo of their adorable son, who is fast asleep in his carrier. His tiny head peaks out of his blanket, and you can see he's wearing a white hat and has what appears to be a stuffed bear tucked in with him.The new mom is au naturel but looks stunning after what was sure to be an exhausting few days. She is wearing a simple blue button-down shirt and a quilted black jacket. Prince Carl and his wife already look like doting parents, as they're both holding the carrier while posing for the picture. "The family has now left the hospital, and are at home at Drottningholm Palace," Sweden's Royal Palace said in a statement. "Both mother and child are in good health, and the family is looking forward to spending time together."More details about their son, including his name, have yet to be revealed, but the palace did say he weighed in at 7.9 pounds and measured around 19.3 inches long.
