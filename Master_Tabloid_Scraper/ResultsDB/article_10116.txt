Carl Perkins Undergoes Surgery/n
Doctors say rockabilly guitar hero Carl Perkins will soon be able to "go, cat, go" out of the hospital. The 65-year-old Rock and Roll Hall of Famer--best known for his monster hit "Blue Suede Shoes"--was in satisfactory condition Monday following surgery to clear an artery.         "I made it through the surgery because I had the best doctors in the world, and I would like to thank everyone who prayed for me," Perkins said, in a statement released by Baptist Memorial Hospital.        The performer underwent angioplasty to clear a carotid artery. Such arteries in the neck and head supply blood to the brain, and a blockage can lead to a stroke. Doctors had described the procedure as "difficult" because the blockage was so close to Perkins' brain.        Perkins has a history of overcoming serious health problems. He survived a near-fatal car wreck in 1957, successfully battled alcoholism and, in 1993, beat throat cancer.        Perkins, along with fellow Sun Records artists Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis and Johnny Cash, pretty much founded rock 'n' roll in the '50s. Although usually remembered as an Elvis tune, "Blue Suede Shoes" was written and recorded first by Perkins. In fact, Perkins' version has outdone the Elvis cover, selling more than two million copies since its release in 1956.        In 1986, the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences presented Perkins its Hall of Fame award for "Shoes." The following year, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.        While Perkins will always be remembered for "Shoes," his influence on rock and country music is immeasurable.         He wrote the Cash classic "Daddy Sang Bass" and later toured extensively with his former Sun mate. The Beatles idolized Perkins and, under his supervision, covered "Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby," "Matchbox" and "Honey Don't." Perkins later played guitar on Paul McCartney's Tug of War album in 1981. He also wrote hit songs for the Judds and Dolly Parton.        Several of Perkins' protégés--including George Harrison, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Willie Nelson and John Fogerty--teamed with the rock legend on his upcoming album, Go, Cat, Go.
