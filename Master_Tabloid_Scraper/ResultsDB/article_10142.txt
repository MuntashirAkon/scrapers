Minnie Driver -- Yeah, I Screwed Up Nat'l Anthem ... But I Was Still Pretty Good! /nMinnie Driver's lyrical screwup during the  "Star Spangled Banner " at the Dodgers game has clearly not affected her confidence ... telling us,  "I did very well. I got a word wrong. " (For the record, she got TWO words wrong, but close enough)  Minnie says she was  "very bummed " about the mistake ... and chalked the whole thing up to nerves.  Still, Driver says it could have been worse -- saying it was more important for her to stay in tune then to have gotten all of the lyrics right.   She may have a point  ... right Carl Lewis? /n
