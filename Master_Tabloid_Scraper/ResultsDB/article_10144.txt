Magic Johnson -- Dodgers Get Party Pass ... Even If They Sucked Last Night/nIt doesn't matter if they played like crap last night (and lost to the sorry ass Marlins), the Dodgers can GO CLUBBIN' all they want, as long as they stay in first place ... so says Magic Johnson. The Dodgers played like crap last night -- with Yasiel Puig (0-for-5) and Carl Crawford (1-for-4) looking especially bad ... no surprise considering they hit the Miami nightclubs HARD just hours before the game. But Dodgers co-owner Magic Johnson doesn't seem to mind an off night every now and then ... as long as the team keeps destroying the majority of their opponents.  "We just gotta come back and win tomorrow, " Johnson said ...  "They're grown men. They can hang out. They can party. I mean ... they're grown. "He added,  "We're having a great season ... so, one game is not gonna hurt us. "Johnson said there will absolutely be NO disciplinary action taken against the players -- who dropped more than $20k at LIV nightclub early Monday morning while partying with LeBron James. An official high up in the Dodgers organization tells TMZ ...  "They party all the time. It's no big deal. "FYI -- Johnson was known to do his fair share of partying back in the day ... and he played just fine. He's even got the rings to prove it./n
