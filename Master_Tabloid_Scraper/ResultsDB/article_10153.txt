Threats, Fights & Violence! Inside ‘Terrified’ Abby Lee Miller's Prison Hell/n
Dance Moms diva Abby Lee Miller’s hot temper is getting her into some hot water in FCI Victorville!
RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned from several current inmates that the 50-year-old reality star’s ego is causing some serious drama – and she hasn’t even completed her first month!
“Abby has done a great job at alienating herself. She is narcissistic and lazy and the women literally loathe her,” reveals an in-house snitch.

“She is always reminding everyone that she is a ‘millionaire’ and does not deserve to be in there. She loves to read about herself in the magazines and does not leave her cell because she says she has zero interest in associating with what she calls ‘jailbait!’”
Needless to say, Miller’s controversial behavior – which, as fans know, has caused explosive brawls with numerous Dance Moms cast mates – is not taken lightly behind bars!
“She has gotten violent threats and even almost had a ‘box dropped on her,’” says the source, referring to a term that basically means beaten up!
“Abby needs to stop being such a dive or she will get a beat down.”

But according to the source, the fallen star, who is serving a 366 day sentence for federal charges including fraud and wire fraud, has no one on the outside to share her troubles with.
“Her only calls are to her former hairdresser. She has no family. It is quite sad.”
