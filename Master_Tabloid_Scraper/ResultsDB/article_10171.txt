Sofia Carson Chics Out In Black On The MTV VMAs Red Carpet/n

This is how you do ruffles!
Sofia Carson kept it subtle in a black plunging Christian Dior gown with ruffled neckline at the MTV VMAs in LA Sunday. So chic!
The Disney darling also vamped it up with a sleek side parted updo and dramatically smokey eye. We feel like she's about to break into a spicy flamenco number!
Slay, baby!
