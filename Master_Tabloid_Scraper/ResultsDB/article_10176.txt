Kim Kardashian and Kanye West think Taylor Swift is playing the victim card again — and they’re totally over it.

Though the Kimye name have been plastered on every tabloid headline out there since the release of the “Look What You Made Do” music video, which takes aim at the couple and alludes to them as being a pair of backstabbers, sources close to the parents-of-two claim Taylor is actually the instigator in this situation and only reigniting the feud as a way to sell records.
Via TMZ:
Our Kim and Kanye sources say their well-publicized feud — triggered by Kanye’s song “Famous” in which he referenced Taylor with the lyric, “I made that b*tch famous” — is old and buried.
As for Kanye, our sources say there are certain feuds he deeply cares about … like the one in which he’s embroiled with Jay-Z and Tidal. As one well-connected source put it, “They’re like brothers who fight but feel bad about it and always end up coming together.” Taylor, on the other hand, isn’t even on his radar.
