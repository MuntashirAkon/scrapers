Nicki Minaj is in full attack mode in London on the Da Track’s debut single, “No Flag,” which also features Offset and 21 Savage. On the track, the rap queen takes aim at an unnamed female, sparking speculations that she’s out for Remy Ma’s blood again.

Via Revolt TV:
As is usually the case, Nicki Minaj’s guest verse set the internet on fire last night (August 24), thanks to lines like “Lil b-tch I heard these labels tryna make another me / Everything you getting, lil hoe, is ’cause of me” and “See me in the gym, now these bitches wanna go bench press / I ain’t fucking with you sis, we ain’t with the incest.”
