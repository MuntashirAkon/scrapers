In the pictures, the Fashion Police alum’s mother rubbed her daughter’s bare head in disbelief. In another, the Griffin smiled as she showed off her new bald look.
The hair change came after Griffin made headlines for posing in a photo featuring a mock of President Donald Trump’s severed head. Trump fired back and the funnywoman tearfully apologized for the act. “I don’t think I will have a career after this,” she said during a press conference in June. “I’m going to be honest. He broke me. He broke me. And then I was like, ‘No, this is not right.’ And I apologized because that was the right thing to do and I meant it.”
