Desiigner Thanks Tommy Lee for Paving the (Mile High) Way!!!/nDesiigner sends a big thank-you to Tommy Lee for opening the door to sex 35,000 feet in the air. We got the  "Panda " rapper at LAX Monday and he was gleeful about the video TMZ posted showing Tommy Lee and gf Brittany Furlan gettin' some in the head on an AA jet.  Desiigner seems to have high praise for American for being cool about it. As we reported, AA sources tell us there are various reasons why more than one person goes into a lavatory, and they don't pry. It seems Desiigner has already been inducted into the Mile High Club./n
