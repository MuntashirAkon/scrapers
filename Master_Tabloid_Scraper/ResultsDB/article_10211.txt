Kyrie Irving Honors Kobe Bryant with Sick Bruce Lee Kicks/nLeBron might be in his doghouse, but Kyrie Irving has nothing but love for Kobe Bryant -- who he considers a  "mentor " -- and just honored the guy with some dope Bruce Lee shoes.  The Cleveland Cavs (for now) star says the 2009 Nike Kobe 11  "Bruce Lee " sneakers are his favorite shoes of all time -- and now that he's become tight with the Mamba, why not honor him with a new version of the shoe?! Enter the NEW Bruce Lee Kyrie 3s ... which incorporates Kobe's signature Mamba logo as well as Lee's famous claw marks from  "Enter the Dragon. " Kyrie says he wanted to commemorate the  "relationship and mentorship that I've been able to develop with an incredible person. " Dope. /n
