Spike Lee Pushing Rally for Colin Kaepernick at NFL HQ /nSpike Lee is clearly fed up that Colin Kaepernick is unemployed -- and now he's going to bat for the QB.  The legendary director of movies like  "Do the Right Thing, "  "Jungle Fever " and  "Malcolm X " is promoting an event called,  "United We Stand. Rally for Colin Kaepernick. "  It's all going down on Wednesday, August 23 in front of NFL Headquarters in NY. Multiple organizations are on board -- including the Justice League NYC and the Empowerment Movement.  The Justice League is the same organization that made the  "I Can't Breathe " shirts that a bunch of athletes wore in the wake of the Eric Garner killing./n
