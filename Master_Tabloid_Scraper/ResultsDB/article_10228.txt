Chiefs Legend Neil Smith Rescues Pregnant Woman from Flood/nChiefs legend Neil Smith just became even more legendary in Kansas City ... rescuing a woman he says was  "about 9 months pregnant " trapped in a K.C.-area flood on Tuesday. It all went down in Lee Summit, Missouri ... where Smith drove by a woman whose minivan was stalled on a dangerously flooded road. The 6-time Pro Bowler quickly rushed to her aid -- using his 6'4'', near-300 pound frame to guide her out of the waist-high water.   "I was just in the right place at the right time, " Smith told FOX 4 News in K.C.  "She was very short, so I had to walk her out of there. " The flooding has reportedly led to at least 160 rescues and 1 death ... and the former superstar lineman may well have prevented another.  Salute!/n
