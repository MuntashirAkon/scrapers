After Lange was rushed to the hospital, it was discovered he had an abscess near his heart that, Lange said, “formed a reservoir [containing] a bunch of heroin and cocaine that formed a sludge.
Doctors performed surgery on the funnyman to treat the condition that could have killed him.
Now that he’s beat death yet again, Lange, 50, has some big plans for himself.
“I’m looking to spread my seed,” Howard Stern’s former sidekick joked, adding, “I’m like a defensive back for the Jets. I’m still taking antibiotics to get rid of the infection.”
