Chelsea Handler Told A ‘Complete And Blatant Lie’/n
Chelsea Handler’s feud with Jennifer Aniston is nothing new to her former co-star Heather McDonald, who is still feeling the burn from their bitter battle, and she drops the bombshell news that her nemesis told a “complete and blatant lie,” about the situation.
Handler, 42, and Aniston, 48, have ended their high profile friendship, diving their A-list group in half and sending shock waves through Hollywood, but McDonald knows firsthand how brutal her ex-boss can be.
“It was the most upsetting thing that has ever happened to me, career wise,” McDonald said this week on Reality Steve’s podcast, opening up about the fight that began when she said she lived in fear of her boss while filming the E! show.

Handler fired back on the Howard Stern show, claiming McDonald was selling stories about her to US Weekly.
McDonald ripped Handler on the podcast, saying her statement “was a complete and blatant lie,” and that there was “no proof to it. I don’t know why she said it. I don’t know if someone said it to her. I don’t know if she made it up that day. But it was a lie.”
She explained Handler’s “lie,” was “career debilitating. It was very very bad for me. In Hollywood people believed it.”
The backlash was intense she told Reality Steve. “Other than losing someone, a death, it was the most traumatic thing I’ve ever been through. I’ve never gotten hate before really. It was just bombarded hate.”
