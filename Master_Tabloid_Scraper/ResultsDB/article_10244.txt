— Artie Lange (@artiequitter) July 11, 2017
Comedian and longtime friend Norm Macdonald reached out to Lange after his frightening collapse and hospitalization and offered him money to go to rehab, joking that if he couldn’t do it for himself he should do it for model Kate Upton. Macdonald was the first person to introduce Lange to Howard Stern and he was on the show for eight years. He never returned to the Stern show after attempting suicide in 2009.Photo credit: Twitter/@@artiequitter3 of 8
@artiequitter Artie, you gotta stop. If you need money I'll give it to you. Go to Rehab. Get better. If not for yourself, for Kate Upton.
— Norm Macdonald (@normmacdonald) July 11, 2017
Lange refused the offer from Macdonald, claiming that he was “all good” despite being hospitalized after his body was ravaged from years of hard-core drug use.Photo credit: Twitter/@@artiequitter4 of 8

After his emergency surgery, Lange posted a picture wearing sunglasses and headphones and looking significantly better than he did over the weekend when he revealed drugs were destroying his body. “After Chicago gig I collapsed. I had emergency surgery. All the blow & H I've done for yrs blew hole in my nose & landed in my chest...”Photo credit: Twitter/@@artiequitter
