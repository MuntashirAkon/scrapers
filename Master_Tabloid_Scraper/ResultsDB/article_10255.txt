Unlike many celebrities out there, Lindsay Lohan supports President Donald Trump.

The Mean Girls star took to Twitter on Fourth of July to defend the Commander-in-Chief, writing, “THIS IS our president. Stop #bullying him & start trusting him. Thank you personally for supporting #THEUSA.”
The comment was a response to a Breitbart post shared by a Trump supporter with the caption, “For ALL YOU CRYBABIES At @CNN Whining About Trump Beating Up Your Logo Take A Look At What A REAL POTUS & Man Does.” The article itself quoted Trump as saying he would be “delighted” to help a critically ill child whom the European Court of Human Rights deemed was too sick to treat with experimental medicine.
“@realDonaldTrump @IvankaTrump @FLOTUS @DonaldJTrumpJr are kind people,” Lohan wrote, referring to First Lady Melania Trump as well as Ivanka and Donald Trump Jr. “As An American, why speak poorly of anyone?”

In 2004, Trump called Lohan “deeply troubled, and therefore great in bed” when he appeared on Howard Stern’s radio show.
Last year, a rep for the actress since told CNN of the inappropriate remark, “Right now, Lindsay is choosing to focus on the positive things happening in her life and has decided to disregard the comments made about her by presidential nominee Donald Trump. She is focusing on helping children around the world in need and that’s where her passion is.”
