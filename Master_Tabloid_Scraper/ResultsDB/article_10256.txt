Did Katy Perry actually taste of Miley Cyrus’ cherry chapstick?

According to Cyrus, she was the inspiration behind Perry’s 2008 smash hit, “I Kissed a Girl.” Explaining she has been friends with the “Bon Appétit” singer for almost 10 years, the former Disney Channel star claimed the sapphic single was written just for her.
“When she came out with ‘I Kissed a Girl,’ I was doing the Hannah Montana movie, and I heard her on the radio, they said, ‘Who’d you write that about?’ And she said me,” she told WKTU radio. If this were true, that would mean Perry — then a 20-something — was singing about making out with a 15-year-old.

However, Perry previously claimed Scarlett Johansson was her muse for the song, telling Steppin’ Out magazine in 2008, “I was with my boyfriend at the time, and I said to him, ‘I’m not going to lie: If Scarlett Johansson walked into the room and wanted to make out with me, I would make out with her. I hope you’re okay with that?'”
In another interview from the same year, the songstress said “girls like Angelina Jolie and Natalie Portman” were the inspiration, noting she would definitely “pucker up” if she ever met them.
Perry also told Howard Stern in an old sit-down she really had kissed a girl, but wouldn’t say who. “It is based on the truth,” she said of the track. “It was actually not one particular girl that inspired the song, but the girl I did kiss I met through a friend.”
Basically, Perry likes all girls.
