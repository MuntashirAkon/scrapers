The revelation came when Cohen innocently asked if they dated each other back when. The two shared one hell of a knowing glance before shyly admitting they were romantic in their younger years.
Broderick and Sedgwick apparently cut class and smoked cigarettes in the stairwell together.
“We kind of went back and forth a lot,” Sedgwick said. Then Broderick added, “We went back and forth for a few years.”

Of course, Sedgwick ended up with Kevin Bacon and Broderick married Sarah Jessica Parker, but these two clearly have a storied history. Broderick even admitted he remembers Sedgwick’s mother, who was sitting in the audience.
But did they know each other, you know, intimately back in high school?
“Never before I got married!” Sedgwick declared.
Take a peek at the adorable confession in the clip above.
