Yesterday (Nov. 17, 2016), Nick Gordon was found liable in the wrongful death case of the late Bobbi Kristina Brown.

Bobbi Kristina’s father, Bobby Brown spoke out just hours after the judge handed down the decision and made revealing he was pleased with the outcome. “I am pleased with the outcome of today’s court proceedings. I do know that Mr. Gordon will be unable to slander my daughter’s name in the future or obtain any benefits from the use of Krissy’s name,” Brown said in a statement released on Twitter and Instagram.
“Finally, I do need for the District Attorney’s Office to step up and begin the criminal prosecution of Mr. Gordon,” Brown continued. “The delay in that matter is of great concern to me and my family. We need for District Attorney Howard to act now.”
