Fashion brand Desigual has teamed up with body positive advocate and model Charli Howard for their new summer campaign, which features bright, colorful photos that have not been retouched.
“How many fashion campaigns can you say haven’t been retouched?” Howard, 26, shared on her Instagram, along with a photo from the campaign. “Me for Desigual.”
The brand’s Instagram page includes the campaign images along with quotes from Howard about why starring an an unretouched shoot was meaningful to her.
“Beauty is measured in so many sizes and shapes, not just size 0,” she told the brand. “Diversity is the key to changing that.”
