Model Charli Howard Reflects on Weight Gain: ‘I’m Happier Than I’ve Ever Been’/n

 
Charli Howard‘s modeling career hasn’t been smooth sailing — she’s dealt with agents who told her she was “too big” to make it and spent years at an unhealthily low weight. But now that she’s at her curviest, she couldn’t be happier.
The British model and body activist shared side-by-side photos from when she was underweight, and now.
“Look how far I’ve come!! I may be heavier than I was, but I’m happier than I’ve ever been, and I never, EVER want to go back to that miserable and lonely time,” Howard, 26, writes on Instagram.

“I’m proof that being thin does not make your life better. I know the idea of thinness can often feel like a gateway towards a more fabulous, exotic and fulfilled life (that’s how it’s sold in magazines and in the media), but the reality is very different. You’re just masking underlying insecurities or problems.”





 Look how far I've come!! 💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼 I may be heavier than I was, but I'm happier than I've ever been, and I never, EVER want to go back to that miserable and lonely time. 💔 I'm proof that being thin does not make your life better. I know the idea of thinness can often feel like a gateway towards a more fabulous, exotic and fulfilled life (that's how it's sold in magazines and in the media), but the reality is very different. You're just masking underlying insecurities or problems. Being thin does not miraculously make you: ✖️ Happy ✖️ Pretty ✖️ Popular (with girls or boys) … or solve any other problem. The only way you will achieve these things is IF and WHEN you choose to love yourself and who you're meant to be! 💕 Trust who you are and realise you're good enough. Always remember that there is so much more to life than looks and weight. It's a big world out there and you have so much more to offer it 🌏 (P.S Thank you @letayna for tagging me in this before & after photo! It really showed me how much better my life is now! 💖) #iamallwoman #curves

Howard posted another comparison photo in March, commenting on her health when she was at her thinnest.
“It’s taken me a longggg time, but I like how my shape is developing,” she writes. “I like how womanly I’m starting to look. I like how my boobs and thighs are getting bigger, which I never thought I’d say. I don’t want to look like that miserable girl on the left, whose gums were always bleeding, hair was falling out, periods didn’t come etc.”

And Howard’s body confidence is so strong, she decided to post a photo of her cellulite to help women who are embarrassed by it, as she used to be.
“I felt like my cellulite was shameful, or an oddity. It wasn’t until I got older and saw other women’s bodies that I realised HOW BLOODY NATURAL IT IS. It’s nothing to be ashamed of,” she says.





 They say do something each day that scares you, so re-posting this is mine for the day. Despite the fact I speed walk everywhere, squat, run and occasionally do @pure_barre, I'm still left with cellulite. I went to an all-girls' boarding school and really used to envy the girls in my class who seemingly had none, and whose bodies looked, to me, nothing less than perfect. Whenever I opened magazines, the models and celebrities I saw didn't have cellulite either – and if they did, they were shamed in the tabloids because of it, or knocked off their perch by nasty journalists who probably have it themselves. (Note: fuck you.) As a result, I felt like my cellulite was shameful, or an oddity. It wasn't until I got older and saw other women's bodies that I realised HOW BLOODY NATURAL IT IS. ✔️ It's nothing to be ashamed of. Your boyfriend isn't gonna care if you have it, and if he does, dump him for his mate. 💁🏻 Just kidding (or am I?). Don't get me wrong – my cellulite isn't my favourite part of my body, nor is it something I shout from the rooftops about. But I know it doesn't make me any less ugly, or is something I need to feel embarrassed about. ✖️ So don't let it make you feel that way, either! In the words of my old pal Kendrick Lamar, "Show me something natural like ass with some stretch marks" 🍑🍑🍑💪🏼💪🏾💪🏿💪🏻💪🏽 #iamallwoman @allwomanproject @heatherhazzan
