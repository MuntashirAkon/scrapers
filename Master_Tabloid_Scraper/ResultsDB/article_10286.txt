Terrence Howard is speaking out about domestic violence and past accusations made against him.The Empire star went on a Twitter rant about the topic early Saturday morning—two months after his ex-wife Michelle Ghent dropped an assault, emotional distress and defamation lawsuit she had filed against him in 2015."I've never been abusive to anyone in my entire life," he tweeted. "I have loved and paid the price for love. I am the same loving being since day 1! When I say that I've made mistakes, it is not regarding violence but judgement. Trusting the wrong people!""I firmly believe that every action has an equal and opposite reaction," he continued. "Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth. Kiss for a [kiss emoji]. This double standard that has permitted abusive women to feel that they can assault a man and not reap where they have sowed is wrong!"

"@terrencehoward You are so right!" one Twitter user said. "There are double standard! My best male friend was abused by his wife for years, physically, and verbally!""@LoverofmusicTwo As was I," Howard responded."Let's start teaching our children that they should END THE VIOLENCE!" he continued. "Nor should a woman ever hit a man!" 

"For years, every since these allegations have been brought against me I've been told to not address it," Howard tweeted Saturday. "I can't remain quiet. For the record. I have not changed nor is there a reason to change. I love and anyone that knows me, knows that I only love.""The cyber space abuse and bullying that has gone unanswered has come to an end!" he continued. "You come for me, I come for you. Eye for an eye!" "Having an altercation is very different than abuse..." he said. "And for the record I never punched her in the face get the facts straight."
