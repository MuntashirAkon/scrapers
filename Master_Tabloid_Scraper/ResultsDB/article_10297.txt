Disney Chief Bob Iger Says Director Ron Howard Will Make 'Star Wars' Han Solo Movie a Hit/nDisney Chairman Bob Iger has no doubt ... Ron Howard will bring the upcoming  "Stars Wars " Han Solo installment in for a smooth landing, and any bumps in the road will be quickly forgotten. We got Iger out Friday at E Baldi in Bev Hills when our photog asked some pretty good questions about Howard's chops in the genre. Iger laughs, saying the truth -- Ron can direct anything. As was reported, Howard is replacing directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller.   Iger won't say if the flick will be delayed, but he says there are 3 elements that will guarantee success.  /n
