The feud is over.

Kanye West and Kid Cudi, who previously lashed out at one another during a very public spat, are on good terms again. The two have seemingly put their differences aside following Cudi’s stint in rehab for depression and “suicidal urges.”
In fact, the rappers look to be working on something new together after they were spotted at a Los Angeles studio. Could this mean a collaboration is in the works?
Via Revolt TV:
The two are still going strong as they were just spotted, alongside Plain Pat (who nabbed multiple production credits on both TLOP and Cudi’s Passion, Pain, & Demon Slayin, at a studio in Los Angeles.
