Tim Howard Suspended Three Games by MLS for Yelling Profanity About Fan's Mother/nTim Howard clapped back at a heckling fan at a game last Sunday and went a little too far ... so it's going to cost him 3 games. The Colorado Rapids goalie lost his cool when a Sporting Kansas City fan started razzing him ... and replied by shouting something that sounds a lot like  "F*** your mother! " MLS issued a 3-game suspension on Friday for Howard's  "inappropriate fan interaction " ... which includes the foul language in the video and another altercation with a fan following the game. No word yet on exactly what happened then. The Rapids say Howard's actions are regrettable -- they'll be playing backup goalkeeper Zac MacMath in Tim's spot for the suspension./n
