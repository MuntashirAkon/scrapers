Sorry, Gwyneth! Chris Martin’s Romance With British Pop Star Heats Up/n
THINGS are getting steamy between Coldplay rocker Chris Martin and “Hotter Than Hell” singer Dua Lipa!
 After his recent split from “The Mummy” star Annabelle Wallis, 40-year-old Chris and Brit singer Lipa, 21, were spotted making out backstage at the recent Glastonbury Festival.
 ’Dua has been telling people she and Chris have texted a lot recently, but most of them assumed it was for work reasons.’ A source spilled.
 The two collaborated on a song earlier this year, prompting Dua to gush: 
 “It was a really magical experience! Such a ‘pinch me’ moment to sit next to him by the piano, so closely with a voice I’ve heard on the radio my whole life!”
 But now Dua appears to be pinching Gwyneth Paltrow’s ex!
 “This was one steamy duet,” our spy spilled!
