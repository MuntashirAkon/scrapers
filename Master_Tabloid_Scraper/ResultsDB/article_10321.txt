While the TV writer has been dating Goop founder Paltrow since 2014 – after the star’s amicable split from hubby Chris Martin – the discreet couple rarely shares photos with one another, as they like to keep their romance low-key and private, RadarOnline.com can reveal.

Falchuk, however, has never been shy about his love for Paltrow, 44, as he previously shared an Instagram of the Hollywood actress looking sexy as her glam squad prepped her for an outing in Southampton.
He wrote: “One from my ‘My Girl Getting Ready’ series. #legsfordays”
