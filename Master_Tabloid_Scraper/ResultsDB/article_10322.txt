“Dua has been telling people she and Chris have texted a lot recently, but most of them assumed it was for work reasons,” revealed the source. “That excuse is out of the window now.”
Martin, 40, and Lipa worked together on a song earlier this year, leading Lipa to dish, “It was a really magical experience. Such a ‘pinch me’ moment to sit next to him by the piano, to hear and perform so closely with a voice I’ve heard on the radio my whole life.”
But now she appears to be pinching him!
