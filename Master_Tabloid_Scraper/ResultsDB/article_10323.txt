Gwyneth Paltrow's New Neighbors Dislike Her Already!/n
Gwyneth Paltrow has divulged her plans to build a 14,000 square-foot mansion in the middle of peaceful Montecito, Calif. — and the star’s neighbors are not happy, RadarOnline.com has learned.
“She’s created an uproar with neighbors on all three sides,” Andrew Rice, a spokesman for nearby neighbor Michael MacElhenny, claimed.
According to Page Six, residents of the area claim the ritzy mansion would be too tall, too wide and too incompatible with nearby homes. They also claim it would block their 5-star views.

“Michael and the other neighbors have tried to work [with Paltrow ]and they’ve gotten nowhere,” said Rice.
As Radar previously reported, the Goop founder has been slammed for her larger than life mansions in the past, as a complaint was once filed against the actress for erecting a 9-foot gate over her L.A. home.
According to Rice, The Montecito Board of Architectural Review voted in favor of the plans just last week, as her architect claimed the house had been lowered 8 feet — per the neighbors’ requests. He also claimed, however, that the shrinkage was just one foot and the team had chosen to move forward with the project based on false information, Page Six reports.

As Radar previously reported, Paltrow has been flaunting her riches (and cougar body) all over Europe in the past few weeks.
Pleasing her soon-to-be neighbors is likely the last thing on her mind.
