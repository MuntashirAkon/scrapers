Mischa Barton Testifies In Revenge Porn Case/n
Actress Mischa Barton has testified against former boyfriend James Spaw in their ‘revenge porn’ trial.
Barton testified in the case where Spaw has allegedly tried to sell sex tapes of her.
In her testimony in Los Angeles on Friday she claimed that she was terrified of 6 ft 4 inch tall Spaw, who was not in court due to a family emergency in Cincinnati.
Barton told the court that he was ‘lurking’ in her neighborhood while texting her and calling her despite the fact that there is currently a temporary restraining order in place against him.

She also claimed that he recently showed up at her friend’s house where she was staying and asked to gain access to her car.
“He doesn’t seem to understand the TRO,” she told the judge.
“I definitely feel he’s been stalking me. I look over my shoulder all the time when I’m walking. He’s intimidating. He’s 6-foot-4. I would be terrified to see him.”

Barton’s temporary stay-away order was extended on Friday with a follow-up hearing being set for July 21, where the judge will make a permanent ruling.
The actress and her lawyer were happy with the latest decision.
Outside the court she said: “People should always have the right to protect themselves and especially women against people who stalk you, make you nervous, try to do things against you, try to release images without your consent. I consider this a victory.”
