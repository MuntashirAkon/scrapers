Now, thanks to The Omni Archive, all 200 issues of the published magazines are available for viewing and purchase on Amazon.

“Jerrick is solving for a problem in the digital space. There has been limited success creating an environment for vintage magazines to reassert themselves with relevance in today’s market,” said Jeremy Frommer, Jerrick’s CEO. “We believe giving life to old content in the new digital ethos and supporting the initiatives of MOSF in the science fiction community is meaningful.”
What’s more, Jerrick also recently released Omni: The New Frontier as a Vimeo On Demand subscription series. The original Frontier was a television show based on Omni Magazine.
