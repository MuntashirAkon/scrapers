Mariah Carey knows who Jennifer Lopez is now!!

Obviously they're not posing together, but the Vegas performers are still upstaging each other with their glitzy covers. As you can see, Mariah is totally topless, while Jenny is done up in crystals!
Their spreads are just as glamorous, which you can ch-ch-check out in the gallery (above)!
But it's also very important to note Ricky Martin and Backstreet Boys also star on the cover of PAPER (below):
