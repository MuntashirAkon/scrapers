Taylor Swift came out the victor in her groping trial.

A jury of six women and two men unanimously sided with the singer in her countersuit against former Colorado DJ David Mueller, who she claimed had reached under her skirt and grabbed her bare butt during a June 2013 meet-and-greet. Taylor was awarded $1, which was what she asked for in filing the suit on principle.
Via TMZ:
Taylor just issued this statement, “I want to thank Judge William J. Martinez and the jury for their careful consideration … [my attorneys] and anyone who feels silenced by a sexual assault, and especially anyone who offered their support through this four-year ordeal…
“Taylor went on, “I acknowledge the privilege that I benefit from in life, in society and in my ability to shoulder the enormous cost of defending myself in a trial like this. My hope is to help those whose voices should also be heard. Therefore, I will be making donations in the near future to multiple organizations that help sexual assault victims defend themselves.”
