Oh my!

Darren Criss certainly gave his followers quite the eyeful when he shared a naked photo from the set of The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story. Holding only a barely-there Speedo in front of his crotch, the 30-year-old made a cheeky face as he snapped a nude selfie from his trailer.
“So what’s more red? My sunburn, my speedo, or YOUR FACE??? #ACSVersace,” he captioned the NSFW shot.

As reported, Criss is playing serial killer Andrew Cunanan, who murdered fashion designer Gianni Versace, on the FX anthology series. The new installment will also star Penelope Cruz as Donatella Versace and Ricky Martin as Gianni’s partner, Antonio D’Amico.
If the upcoming season is anything like this photo, you bet your butt we’ll be tuning in!
