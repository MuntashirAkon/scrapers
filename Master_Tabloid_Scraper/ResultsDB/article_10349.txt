Chrissy Teigen’s mom, Vilailuck Teigen (aka @pepperthai2), steals the show in Chrissy’s latest campaign with Smirnoff vodka.

Chrissy and her mom shared a behind-the-scenes clip from their forthcoming commercial in which they have a heart-to-heart over strong martinis. Chrissy jokingly tells her mom in one of the takes, “Smirnoff vodka has won every f**king award ever for vodka.”
Despite the Cravings author’s hilarious ad-libs and her professional ability to tackle a giant burrito, it’s her mom’s performance that outshines the rest of the clip.

Guys. It’s official. I’m in a relationship with @SmirnoffUS! I could have gone for a fancy vodka, but I didn’t. I chose one that keeps it real instead. Smirnoff is actually a really great tasting vodka, and they aren’t afraid to be a little unfancy sometimes. Samesies. Take a peek behind the scenes with me and my mom @pepperthai2!!
