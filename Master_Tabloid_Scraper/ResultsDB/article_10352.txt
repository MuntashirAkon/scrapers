"Well here we are in Dublin, me and my friend Rob, he is 29-years-old and training is his job," Chris sang for the first verse of the new song. "Well here we are in Dublin and what an awesome crowd, I've been all over the world and I've never seen anybody so loud."Hours after the crowd erupted in applause, the lucky fan tried to wrap his head around what happened during the unforgettable night."A lad accidentally fell on me and was extremely apologetic. He and his friends insisted on lifting me and getting me a better view," Rob told BBC News. "Chris Martin invited me up on stage so that I was on stage with Coldplay."

He continued, "In a time where we're seeing the horrors of London, Manchester, and Paris, I hope this shows that if you get yourself out there, you never know what's going to happen. I would like to thank Chris for an amazing experience."Perhaps more surprises are right around the corner when it comes to Coldplay shows.The band behind huge hits including "Viva La Vida," "Yellow" and "Paradise" head to the United States this August for a few select stadium dates. Complete dates are online now.
