Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin Reunite to Celebrate Apple's Birthday at the Museum of Ice Cream/n
Paltrow also shared a gorgeous close-up photo of her look-alike daughter."Happy 13th birthday, you gorgeous human," the proud mama captioned the picture. "You light up every room, my heart, the world. You. Are. Everything. I love you, schnapps."

Looks like the Museum of Ice Cream was just the place to do that!
