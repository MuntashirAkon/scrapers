Charlottesville Victims Return To Scene Of Crime For Memorial/nMarcus Martin, one of 19 injured victims in Saturday's deadly Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, returned to the scene of the protest bandaged and in a wheelchair. Marcus was hurled in the air after a car driven by James Alex Fields plowed through a crowd of protesters, killing his friend, 32-year-old Heather Heyer. Cameras caught the moment of impact where Marcus was struck. He suffered a broken leg after pushing his fiancee, Marissa Blair﻿, out of the way. Blair, who is hugging him in the photo above, worked with Heyer. Martin's loved ones have set up a gofundme to help with expenses. Hundreds gathered in Charlottesville Sunday at the memorial to pay tribute to Heyer./n
