Gilbert Arenas: I Might Join BIG3 League, 'Hopefully Next Year' /nIce Cube is one step closer to adding  "Agent 0 " to his BIG3 league -- with Gilbert Arenas telling TMZ Sports he's seriously considering joining up. 35-year-old Arenas was promoting his Life Water company at 7 /11 in L.A. this week when he told us he's been in talks with Cube's 3-on-3 league about signing on for next season.  In fact, Arenas says he's hoping the two sides can work out a sponsorship deal where his beverage company can be the official drink of the league.  But even if that doesn't work out, Arenas says he'd still consider lacing up -- most likely because he has friends like Kenyon Martin who are having a blast getting back on the court.  As for Gilbert, he's been staying in basketball shape -- constantly posting workout videos from the gym ... and it's impressive stuff./n
