Damn! Did Britney Spears Just Wink At Taylor Swift With THIS Epic Throwback??/n

We are RATTLED by this story!
As we reported, right before announcing her new album Reputation dropping November 10, Taylor Swift posted a series of videos on social media of what appears to be a slithering snake.
Many believe she is referencing her #TaylorSwiftIsOverParty drama with Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, where people trolled her pages with snake emojis.

Fast forward to Thursday, Britney Spears seemingly decided to get in on the action by reminding everyone that she did the whole serpent thing first!
Days before Sunday's VMAs, the Oops!â€¦ I Did It Again singer posted a throwback pic on Twitter of her LEGENDARY 2001 MTV performance of I'm a Slave 4 U where she carried a live albino Burmese Python on stage!
Miz Spears coyly shared: 

Remember when I brought a jungle to the #VMAs?? This was my favorite performance!! ðŸ˜œðŸ˜œ #tbt
