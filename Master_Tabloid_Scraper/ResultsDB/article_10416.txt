Joseph Gordon-Levitt’s family just got a little bigger!

The Snowden star welcomed his second child with wife Tasha McCauley, according to People. Though the names and weight of the child was not disclosed, the actor’s rep confirmed the baby to be a boy.
Gordon-Levitt and McCauley, the co-founder of Silicon Valley-based company Fellow Robots, are already parents to a 1-year-old son.
“My son, he’s just a baby, you know? He hasn’t made the choice to be in the public eye, and that’s a choice that I would like him to be able to make when he’s older, when he can think about these kinds of things and make that decision for himself,” Gordon-Levitt, 36, said on Live! with Kelly and Michael just six weeks after welcoming his firstborn.
“And so, for now, I’m just a protective dad, and I want to protect his privacy,” he explained of his decision to not reveal his child’s name.
