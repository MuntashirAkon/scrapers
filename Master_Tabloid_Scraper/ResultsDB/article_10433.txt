Michael Hamilton’s Crispy Potato Wedges with Smoky Mayo
1 cup mayonnaise
1 tbsp. fresh lemon juice, plus zest for garnish
1 tsp. smoked paprika
½ tsp. ground cumin
½ tsp. cayenne pepper
1½ tsp. kosher salt, divided
4 russet potatoes (about 1¼ lb.)
1/3 cup canola oil
¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro
1. Whisk mayonnaise, lemon juice, paprika, cumin, cayenne pepper and ½ teaspoon salt together in a small bowl. Set aside.
2. Cut each potato into quarters lengthwise; cut each wedge diagonally into ½- to 1-inch-long pieces (3 to 5 pieces per wedge).
3. Heat oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium high, 4 to 5 minutes. Cook potatoes in batches until a knife can easily be inserted in middle of thickest piece, about 3 to 4 minutes per side, shaking skillet to make sure they don’t stick, and turning often to get all sides brown. Place potatoes on a platter lined with paper towels.
4. Transfer potatoes to a serving dish. Sprinkle with cilantro and remaining 1 teaspoon salt; drizzle with paprika mayo. Garnish with lemon zest.

Tip! “Leftovers make a great breakfast hash the next morning,” says Hamilton. Reheat potatoes in a skillet with olive oil and your favorite chopped veggies. Top with a fried egg and more paprika mayo.
