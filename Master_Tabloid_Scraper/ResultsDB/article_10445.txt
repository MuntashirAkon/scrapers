Michael Phelps Deserves a Gold Medal for His Shirtless Selfie With Son Boomer/n
Just in time for Father's Day, first-time dad Michael Phelps shared a sweet photo of his young son Boomer and made our hearts melt. The photo, which was actually shared from Boomer's own Instagram (what a tech savvy tot!), features the doting dad and his son with the caption, "Daddy day!!!"Cue the exploding hearts! The photo features the shirtless 31-year-old snuggling up to his 1-year-old son in his kitchen. The two make quite the precious pair!In addition to spying the abs of steel, you can almost see the top of Phelps' Olympic rings tattoo, famous for peeking out of his bathing suit. 

The 23-time Olympic gold medalist is getting in some serious dad time before he takes a big task on—and that's racing a great white shark. As part of Discovery Channel's fan-favorite Shark Week, one of summer TV's most highly anticipated events, Michael Phelps is set to take on his greatest competitor ever. The 23-time Olympic gold medalist will race the shark on Sunday, July 23, with Discovery Channel titling the special event, Phelps vs. Shark: Great Gold vs. Great White.
