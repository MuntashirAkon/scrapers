Michael Phelps vs. Shark has a Winner/nGold medal winning Olympian Michael Phelps took on a great white shark ... and now we know who truly reigns supreme in the water ... sort of. The moment of glory for #TeamShark!!! #PhelpsVsShark #SharkWeek pic.twitter.com /NWYp1CwiRa— Shark Week (@SharkWeek) July 24, 2017 THE SHARK WINS!!! Phelps kicked off Shark Week 2017 on Discovery Channel with a primetime special,  "Phelps vs. Shark: Great Gold vs. Great White " after weeks of anticipation for the man-against-beast event. The 100-meter open water  "race " took place in Cape Town, South Africa ... but many fans are unhappy about what actually qualified as a race. Most people thought Phelps didn't stand a chance considering his top swim speed is about 6 mph and great whites can reach speeds up to 25 mph ... but his team helped him even the playing field with a shark skin-like wetsuit and a monofin to emulate a shark's tail. Turns out ... it didn't matter. Phelps lost the SIMULATED race to a great white shark by 2 seconds. Results are in. pic.twitter.com /HcigiGC0hq— Darren Rovell (@darrenrovell) July 24, 2017   So ... Ryan Lochte was right?/n
