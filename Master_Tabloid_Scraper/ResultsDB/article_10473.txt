Angelina Jolie Apologizes To Perez Hilton Over Lawsuit Threats/n
After exposing her legal team’s threatening letters online yesterday, RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned that Perez Hilton received an apology from Angelina Jolie.
As reported on Monday, Hilton posted a screenshot of an email correspondence with the actress’ attorneys, Bert Fields and Priya Sapori, who demanded that content changes be made in an online article, titled Brad Pitt Is ‘Wrecked’ By Not Seeing His Kids Since Divorce News Broke, ‘Willing To Do Anything’ To Make Things Work, published on his site.
In his scathing response, shared on Facebook and Instagram, the 38-year-old blogger made it abundantly clear that he had no intention of making adjustments to the story.
