Wearing a white and red dress with a matching hat and umbrella, the young model and her father, who was dressed as Bert from the Walt Disney film in a colorfully striped blazer and matching hat, grabbed quite a bit of attention at the annual event.
Dannielynn, who recently modeled for GUESS kids, and Larry also attended the Derby in 2012, wearing a yellow and white dress with flowers in her hair. /n
