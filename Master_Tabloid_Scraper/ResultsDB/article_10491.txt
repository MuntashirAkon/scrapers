Mother and daughter held hands while they walked, and both had their hair tied back in casual ponytails.
At one point, a smiling Katie knelt down next to her little girl and seemed to be having a heart-to-heart with Suri.

As RadarOnline.com previously reported, yesterday Katie took Suri into a pet shop and when she didn’t buy her daughter a puppy, Suri dissolved into tears.
 Tom Cruise hasn’t seen Suri since before Katie filed for divorce June 28, but as his attorney Bert Fields told us, that should happen “soon.”
