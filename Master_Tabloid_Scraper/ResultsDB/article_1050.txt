Blac Chyna is keeping her distance from Rob Kardashian.

According to celebrity attorney Lisa Bloom, who recently represented Kathy Griffin in the comedienne’s snafu with President Donald Trump, she was hired by the mom-of-two to seek out a restraining order against the Keeping Up with the Kardashians alum.
“I represent Blac Chyna. I just gave Rob Kardashian notice that we’ll be in court Monday seeking restraining orders against him. More to come,” she tweeted Friday (July 7, 2017).

Earlier this year, the lawyer represented Mischa Barton when the actress went after an ex-boyfriend who was allegedly trying to sell their sex tape without her consent.
Given that Rob was also accused of sharing “revenge porn” when he leaked nudes of Chyna during his online tirade, many believe Chyna has the grounds to sue.
“Rob has made the work of a prosecutor or a victim’s attorney quite easy so far as to even post about the very motive behind his outrageous act of posting these private and nude photos of his ex,” Carrie Goldberg, an attorney and founder of Internet abuse and sexual consent firm C. A. Goldberg, PLLC, told People. “The allegation of infidelity does not give someone the right to seek revenge in such a devastating way.”
As previously reported, Chyna is “exploring all legal remedies and protections” against her former fiancé.
