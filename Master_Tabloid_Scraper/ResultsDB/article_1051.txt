Taylor Lautner and Billie Lourd have parted ways.

The Scream Queens couple split after just eight months of dating, People reports. A source tells the publication the breakup was amicable.
“They aren’t together anymore but they are still friendly,” the insider says. “She’s really focused on her work right now.”
Taylor, 25, and Billie, 24, first made their relationship public early December when co-star Keke Palmer shared a photo of them kissing and cuddling at a cast party for their Fox show. Later that month, Taylor stood by her girlfriend as she dealt with the sudden passing of her mother, Carrie Fisher, and maternal grandmother, Debbie Reynolds.
“This girl is one of the strongest, most fearless individuals I’ve ever met. Absolutely beautiful inside and out,” Taylor wrote on his Instagram at the time. “I’m lucky to know you @praisethelourd.”
