“Precious little girl, there are no words to describe the feeling of holding you in our arms for this first time and looking into your beautiful eyes. We love you so much. #bestdayever #ilovemyfamily”

 Never thought I'd post such a vulnerable pic as this, but nothing has ever felt more right and more natural than taking care of my little girl. Becoming a mother hasn't felt like some huge, transformational moment for me (besides giving birth haha). Instead, it feels like she's always been here somehow, like she has always been a part of me— almost like I don't know how yesterday existed without her. It's amazing how you can love someone so much, I now get the privilege of understanding a mother's endless love. 💗

The couple previously opened up to PEOPLE about their exciting (and scary!) pregnancy journey through a series of homemade videos.
“I’m hoping for a boy,” Tanner, 30, told PEOPLE before finding out the sex. “Not that I don’t want a girl, I actually want one of each. It’s just, I’m going to make her keep trying until we have a boy, so I’d like to get it out of the way sooner.”
“He thinks I’m going to have four children if the first three are girls, but I think he’s wrong on that,” added Jade, 30.

The duo, who tied the knot in a televised ceremony that aired on Valentine’s Day last year, revealed that they had been talking about starting a family from the get-go.

“Two days after my missed period, I took the test,” Jade previously told PEOPLE. “I just knew it. Tanner wanted to be there. He was like, ‘Don’t take it without me.’ One morning we woke up and I took the test and we watched it on the counter and it turned from not pregnant to pregnant. I knew it, but it was like, ‘Holy cow, it’s happening.’”

The couple announced their pregnancy in March with a series of adorable photos.
“We’re crazy grateful to finally announce a little secret we’ve been keeping,” Jade revealed via Twitter. “We’re absolutely head over heels in love already!”

During her baby shower in July, Jade expressed her gratitude to her family and friends who have been so supportive throughout this entire journey.
“I told myself I wasn’t going to cry,” an emotional Jade said while giving a toast. “It means so much to me. I wish [my husband Tanner] was here — he’s kind of halfway here.”
She continued, “This is really awesome. I really never thought I was going to get married someday, let alone have a child, so [it] is really special [that] you’re all here. Thank you so much!”

E! News was first to report the birth.
