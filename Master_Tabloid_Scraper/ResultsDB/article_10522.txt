Meanwhile, Bert stares right at them. Hey, guess who's feeling left out?"Oh no, not this song again!" he exclaims.

"No matter where we go, you and I we both know / We're there for each other, so happy together / You might even say we're two birds of a feather," Ernie sings."Ernie, you are not a bird and he is made of rubber!" an increasingly exasperated Bert tells him."Oh, it's a figure of speech, Bert," Ernie says."Duckie I'm so lucky / rubba dubba dubbie / Yellow little buddy, squeeze you and squeeze you / I know it doesn't phase ya /The song my duckie plays (ah) / All raise your hands up / Let's hear what Rubber Duckie says(ah) / El paaaaa-tito," Ernie continues.
