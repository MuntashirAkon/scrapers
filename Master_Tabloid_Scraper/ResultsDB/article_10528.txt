This was, indeed, a memorable gig. Van Halen rarely does TV performances, and this particular show was their first since David Lee Roth rejoined the group in 2007. It wasn't without incident, though—David rocked out a little too hard, perhaps, injuring his nose in the process!The group had to stop playing "Panama," the first song in their set, when the beak bustup happened. "Let me get this taped up," David said, making a quick exit from the stage. Eddie used the brief interlude for a guitar solo, and before long, his bandmate returned to the stage with his nose bandaged up.Hey, the show must go on! The group, which is releasing new album Tokyo Dome Live in Concert on Tuesday and embarking on a North American tour this summer, went on to play several other hits, including "Runnin' With the Devil," "Hot for Teacher" and "Dance the Night Away."
