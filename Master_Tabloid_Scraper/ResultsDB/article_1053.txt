Beyoncé and Jay-Z’s twins remain in the hospital because they were born premature.

A family source told TMZ the newborns — rumored to be a boy and a girl — remain “under the lights” meant for babies who were not carried to full-term. The lights reportedly help lower bilirubin in the blood to eliminate the jaundice, a condition common amongst premature babies.
As previously reported, Bey’s babies suffered a “minor issue” in their delivery last week.
Though the parents have yet to make a statement, Beyoncé’s father confirmed the arrival of the twins with a Twitter message reading: “They’re here! #beyonce #twins #jayz #happybirthday.”

Jay-Z was also spotted out of the hospital on Monday (June 19, 2017) following news of the birth.
The twins now join 5-year-old sister, Blue Ivy Carter.
