Valerie Bertinelli knows firsthand how much pressure Hollywood puts on women to look a certain way.But when the Hot in Cleveland star gained a few pounds after a broken foot left her unable to exercise, she found that she actually started to feel embarrassed about her weight.The 53-year-old former Jenny Craig spokeswoman talked about her experience on CBS' The Talk Wednesday, asking the co-hosts, "Why do I feel so much shame? Because the cameras are on me? Because the paparazzi can't wait to get a picture of me looking like I've gained a few pounds?"

"It's like, we have to take the shame out of it," she said.  Valerie admitted her fluctuating weight didn't sit well with her either. "It started to panic me," she said. "And then I thought, ‘Well, wait a minute. This is my body. I'm almost 54. I broke my foot, I haven't been able to move.'"She's now "back in the gym and ready to go," but she doesn't want to forget how badly she felt over a few extra pounds. "We all need to give each other a break, especially women," she said. "Let's leave each other alone."
