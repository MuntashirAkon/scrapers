A toxicology report released by the Los Angeles County Coroner indicates Carrie Fisher had cocaine in her system when she suffered a massive cardiac arrest shortly before her death.

According to the Associated Press, the full autopsy report claims traces of morphine, codeine, and oxycodone were also found in the Star Wars legend’s body. A urine analysis indicates Fisher had a little amount of MDMA and heroin in her system, though the dose and time the drugs were taken could not be determined.
Though the actress’ death certificate lists cardiac arrest as the cause of death, the coroner’s new report states the 60-year-old had passed away from sleep apnea and a combination of other factors.
As previously reported, Fisher stopped breathing aboard a transatlantic flight from London to Los Angeles on Dec. 23, 2016. She died four days later and was buried alongside her mother Debbie Reynolds, who passed away the day following Fisher’s death, in a pill-shaped urn at Forest Lawn Memorial Park on Jan. 6, 2017.
