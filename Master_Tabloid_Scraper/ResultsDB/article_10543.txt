'Sesame Street': No STD Worries for Bert & Ernie/n "Sesame Street " is threatening a company for suggesting Bert and Ernie may have contracted STDs. Mately, a company that makes at-home HIV /STD testing kits, used the BFFs in a new campaign aimed at sexual health awareness. Problem is, the 'Street' says nobody at Mately got an OK to use Bert and Ernie's likeness. A spokesperson for Sesame Workshop tells TMZ,  "The Mately ad is an unauthorized, unlicensed use of our characters. We will be contacting Mately and the appropriate parties with a cease and desist letter instructing them to take this down. " Mately got the message loud and clear -- it's removed all Bert and Ernie images from its site and says there was no intent to  "tarnish the Sesame Street brand. " Sex keeps getting the famous roommies in trouble. A few years ago  "Sesame Street " had to squash rumors about Bert and Ernie being gay. The 'Street' clarified ... they're puppets and don't have a sexual orientation. This post was brought to you by the letters C and D (cease and desist).﻿/n
