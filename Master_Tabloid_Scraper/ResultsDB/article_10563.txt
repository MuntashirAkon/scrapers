Jeffrey Jones, 69, played Dean of Discipline Edward R. Rooney in Ferris Bueller’s Day Off – and went on to much smaller roles after he was arrested for possession of child pornography and soliciting a 14-year-old boy to pose for pornographic photos in 2003.
He settled with the boy in 2004, and pleaded no contest in court. He was sentenced to five years probation and had to register as a sex offender.

Jones was arrested twice in 2010 for failing to update his sex offender status in Florida and California. He was ordered to complete 250 hours of community service – and was on probation for three more years as a result.
Paul “Pee-Wee Herman” Reubens was part of the same LAPD investigation in the early 2000s. Reubens, 63, was later arrested and charged with misdemeanor possession of child pornography as a result.
It’s unclear why Bieber and Jones were spending time together. /n
