Ariana Grande is in disbelief after a suicide bomber killed at least 22 people and wounded 59 at the end of her concert in Manchester, England on Monday (May 22, 2017).

Grande, who was not injured by the explosion, issued a message on social media shortly after the terror attack took place.
“broken. from the bottom of my heart,” wrote the 23-year-old singer. “i am so so sorry. i don’t have words.”

ISIS has claimed responsibility for the attack, but Reuters reports that experts say that there was no evidence of their direct involvement and that the details of the claim made by the group contrast with the British police account.
This is the deadliest attack on British soil since 52 people were killed in suicide bombings on London’s transport system in 2015. Prime minister Theresa May described the bombing as an “appalling act of terrorism” and has halted General Election campaigning until further notice. President Donald Trump extended his “deepest condolences” to the victims of the attack from Bethlehem, Israel, calling those behind the attack “evil losers.”
“We stand in absolute solidarity with the people of the United Kingdom. So many young, beautiful, innocent people living and enjoying their lives, murdered by evil losers in life. I won’t call them monsters because they would like that term,” said Trump. “They would think that’s a great thing. I will call them from now on – losers – because that’s what they are – they’re losers and we’ll have more of them. But that’s what they are – they’re losers. Just remember that.”
This is an excerpt from the official statement issued by Greater Manchester police [via Independent]:
“Families and many young people were out to enjoy a concert at the Manchester Arena and have lost their lives. Our thoughts are with those 22 victims that we now know have died, the 59 people who have been injured and their loved ones. We continue to do all we can to support them. They are being treated at eight hospitals across Greater Manchester.
This is a fast-moving investigation and we have significant resources deployed to both the investigation and the visible patrols that people will see across Greater Manchester as they wake up to the news of the events last night. This will include armed officers as people would expect. More than 400 officers have been involved in this operation during the night.
To remind you, we were called at 10:33pm to reports of an explosion at the Manchester Arena at the conclusion of an Ariana Grande concert. More than 240 calls came in and emergency services were very quickly on the scene. Emergency numbers have been established for anyone who is concerned for loved ones who may not have returned home 01618569400 or 01618569900.
We have been treating this as a terrorist incident and we believe that while the attack last night was conducted by one man the priority is to establish whether he was acting alone or as part of a network.
The attacker, I can confirm, died at the arena. We believe the attacker was carrying an improvised explosive device which he detonated causing this atrocity.
We would ask people not to speculate on his details or to share names. There is a complex and wide ranging investigation underway.
Our priority is to work with the national Counter Terrorist Policing Network and UK intelligence services to establish more details about the individual who carried out this attack.” [Read the full statement here.]
