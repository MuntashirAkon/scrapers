Linkin Park's Chester Bennington Gets Two Poignant New Tributes/n

It's been just two weeks since the death of Chester Bennington, but it feels much longer ‚Äî and sadly his loss is going to be felt for quite some time.
In a touching new mural, the Linkin Park singer can be seen smiling from the 101 freeway in Southern California. The painting, on the wall of Rock'n Pies Pizza Co. in Sherman Oaks, was created from a rare pic of the tortured artist in good spirits.

Painter Jonas Never told Variety:

"I stumbled across this publicity still of him, smiling, very recognizable, with all his tattoos visible. I thought it would be better than having him up there screaming."
You can see more pics of the amazing mural from the pizzeria's Instagram (below).
Speaking of not screaming, Coldplay also paid a softer, gentler tribute to the fallen singer on the first show of their North American tour Tuesday night. Chris Martin's went solo for a slow, sad piano cover of Crawling that's almost unrecognizable from the original.

So sweet of Chris!
