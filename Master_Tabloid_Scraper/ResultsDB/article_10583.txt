Mandy Moore Is Building A Home With BF Of Two Years — 'I'm Ready To Start Over, Start From Scratch'/n

Starting fresh!
Mandy Moore is in the middle of renovating a home with her boyfriend of two years, Taylor Goldsmith, and she couldn't be more thrilled!
To catch you up, the This Is Us star sold the home she shared with ex-husband Ryan Adams last October after living there for 14 years. So clearly, it's time for a change!

Speaking with People, the 33-year-old said the mid-century home near Los Angeles is "progressing" slowly but surely — and she's looking forward to the brand new beginning:

"I feel like the last year of my life has really been such a cleansing period and yeah, the house is totally symbolic of where I'm lucky enough to find myself at this point in my life, at 33. I'm ready to start over, start from scratch. I'm so enthusiastic about embracing that. I can't wait. It's the best feeling."
And even though Mandy and the Dawes musician already live together, she's pumped about the opportunity to have a space her and her beau can call their own:

"We do live together, but because we don't have our own space that's ours right now, we haven't really ventured into the blending of [our] things."
As for how Miz Moore is going to take into account her BF's needs and wants for their new pad, she explained: 

"He has a ton of books and records, so we made sure in the design of the house that we're doing a lot of built-ins and bookshelves. I think he's very sentimental about his stuff and I'm not, so I don't understand that as much, but I'm very compassionate about it and sympathetic … He really loves his piano and I'm like, ‘Babe, it's not going to fit with the whole color scheme of the house.' That's my biggest hurdle at this point, figuring out, do we replace the piano or do we just let this shiny, black upright piano go in the middle of the house? We're going to figure that out."
We have a feeling that if that's their biggest problem, they're going to be A-OK!
