Chris Pine is bald now and we have a lot of questions.

The actor appeared at CinemaCon with a new ‘do (or a lack thereof) on Wednesday night (Mar. 29, 2017) to promote his new movie Wonder Woman. While most abrupt Hollywood haircuts are a result of a new role, Pine’s bald-ish look was a product of boredom.
“Yes I did it myself, I used clippers,” Pine told USA Today before explaining the elaborate process. “I went through phases. So I had long hair and a beard. And first I did a facial hair thing. That was fun. I did the mustache. I did a little General Sherman. Then I did a full-shaved back (of the head). That was fun for a day.”
If you can believe it, the process continued from there.
“Then I got a fade. Then I started doing designs. And then I got real bored,” said Pine.

The good news is that Pine enjoys the end product so much that he’s considering keeping it.
“It’s a little intense,” Pine told USA Today. “But it’s easy And it’s cool, meaning cool like in a breeze. Someone thought I was Jason Statham.”
