Netflix’s Gilmore Girls revival left us with more open-ended questions — namely those final four words — than closure when it premiered last month. While Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life was meant to be a stand-alone series, the streaming platform’s latest tweet is making it seem like more episodes are to come.

Throwing it back to the science fair project April Nardini (Vanessa Marano) did to help her discover her biological father, a tweet from Netflix hinted that — spoiler alert!— the future child of Rory (Alexis Bledel) may also be on a quest to find her own dad. The tongue-in-cheek image featured Rory’s college love Logan Huntzberger (‎Matt Czuchry), her forgettable boyfriend Paul (Jack Carpenter), and a sign about the “guy in a Wookiee costume” that the aspiring writer slept with while on assignment.
Last month, showrunner Amy Sherman-Palladino said she was waiting to see just how the revival would be received before potentially planning new episodes.
“We really had a very specific journey in our minds and we fulfilled the journey,” she told The Hollywood Reporter. “So to us, this is the piece that we wanted to do. And the whole thought about, is there more, is there more, is there more — this has to go out into the universe now. We’ve got to put this to bed and then whatever happens, happens.”
