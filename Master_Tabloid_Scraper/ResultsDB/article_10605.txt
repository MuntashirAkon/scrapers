Brad Pitt Fired as the Depressing Weatherman on The Jim Jefferies Show: 'Now That Cloud Has Been Lifted'

Brad Pitt‘s days as a weatherman have come to a stormy end.
Late-night host Jim Jefferies announced on Wednesday that the actor will no longer serve as the show’s hilariously bleak weatherman.
“I know many of you are probably looking forward to our regular check-in with the Jim Jefferies Show weatherman,” he said. “Unfortunately, I didn’t feel like he was effectively leading the weather desk.”
As the crowd began to boo, Jefferies explained his reasoning for the sudden departure. “I fired him!”
“I fired him!” the host continued. “He was a crazy! He was a real nutjob! Now that cloud has been lifted.”
But Pitt, who was watching the announcement from home, had a bit of a problem with Jefferies’ choice of words.
“Lies!” he yelled at the television while still wearing his weatherman suit.

The actor made two appearances on the show, where he gave hilariously bleak weather forecasts.
“Carbon dioxide is slowing turning our planet into an uninhabitable wasteland, and half the population doesn’t believe it,” he previously said.
