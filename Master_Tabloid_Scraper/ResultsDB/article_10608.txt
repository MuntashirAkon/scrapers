Pee-Wee Herman was this close to voicing an iconic cartoon character.According to new footage obtained from an ‘80s special titled Disney Studio Showcase, producers originally wanted someone other than Charles Fleischer to voice Roger Rabbit. In fact, the first idea of Who Framed Roger Rabbit featured a young Paul Reubens (aka Pee-Wee Herman) voicing the "lovable" and "goofy" character.That's not the only shocking confession from creators. It turns out Jessica Rabbit's character was hardly in love with Roger Rabbit. "Jessica is a rabbit by marriage only," producer Marc Sturdivant explains in the clip. "She's actually an ambitious young starlet who married Roger to further her career and now that she's been given a part in a film that she's wanted, she's cast Roger aside."
