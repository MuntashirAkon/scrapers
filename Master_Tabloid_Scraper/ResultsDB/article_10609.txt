"I've already invited all of the Kardashian family to be in it," Reubens told us at the Scream Awards in L.A. "I hang out with them at Dancing With the Stars."

Really?"[I go] to support my friend David Arquette," he continued. "I hope to be dancing myself on Dancing With the Stars next season! That's why I'm there all the time, to get my face up     there. Trying to butter up the producers and everything. Jury's out, I     haven't heard yet."

Reubens dished that the upcoming untitled Pee-wee flick, being produced by Judd Apatow, will begin filming in three months at Universal Studios. Apatow got attached to the movie after catching a performance of the The Pee-wee Herman Show in L.A. before it moved to Broadway.
