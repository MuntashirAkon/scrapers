Stephen Colbert and Herman Cain Rally in South Carolina/n
And a gospel choir was also in tow to sing "This Little Light of Mine" before Colbert delivered his address at the "Rock Me Like a Herman Cain: South Cain-Olina Primary Rally.""Do not sit down!" Colbert said after receiving a lengthy round of applause. "There are no chairs. Partly for budgetary reasons, but mostly because I'll take a standing ovation any way I can get it."And after taking a few comical shots at some of the current GOP candidates like "The only difference between Mitt Romney and a statue of Mitt Romney is that the statue never changes in position," Colbert got down to business and introduced Cain. "A Her Man is not the same as a She Male," Colbert said, according to the Guardian. "I don't want to frighten any Santorum supporters. I have believed in the message of Herman Cain for several days now. I want you to vote for Herman Cain because Herman Cain is me...and he possesses the one thing I don't think I will ever have: a place on the South Carolina ballot."Following that colorful introduction, Cain took the stage…and proceeded to get a few jokes in himself (or at least attempted to). 

"Mr. Colbert cannot get on the ballot, and I can't get off of it," Cain said, before he went on to sing with Colbert and quote Pokemon.But both Colbert and Cain did take a serious turn during the rally, encouraging voters to go to the polls and vote, no matter who they cast their ballots for."I am going to ask you NOT to vote for Herman Cain because I don't want you to waste your vote. Your vote matters," Cain said. And just in case you're wondering if Colbert's stint was just for laughs, toward the end of the rally he said, "The pundits have asked, is this all some joke? If they are saying this is a joke, then they are saying the whole system of campaign financing is a joke. Give me some money!"We guess that settles that.
