Seth MacFarlane and Jimmy Fallon Play "Wheel of Impressions" With Liam Neeson, Pee-Wee Herman: Watch!/n
Jimmy was up next, and it was his turn to impersonate Jerry Seinfeld talking about Uber! "What's the deal with Uber?" he asked, mimicking the comic's New York accent. "You get into someone's car who is offering you gum and mints! We're doing everything we were told not to do as children. We're literally getting a stranger to lure us into their car with candy. Have we learned nothing, people?!"It didn't end thereâ€”Seth did an impression of Bobcat Goldthwait talking Starbucks, then Jimmy did Pee-wee Herman gabbing about mirrors. Seth joked he couldn't "work up enough phlegm" for his impression of Ray Romano, but he certainly tried.So whose impressions were better? Watch the Tonight Show clip above to see for yourself!(E! and NBC are both part of the NBCUniversal family.)
