Look who's joining Pee-wee Herman in the playhouse!Bromance expert Judd Apatow has teamed up with Paul Reubens to develop a new Pee-wee film for the big screen, Daily Variety reports."Let's face it, the world needs more Pee-wee Herman," Apatow told the trade. "I am so excited to be working with Paul Reubens—who is an extraordinary and groundbreaking actor and writer. It's so great to watch him return with such relevance."

The venerable filmmaker says that he got the idea after taking in  Reubens' sold-out live show in L.A. earlier this year. The Pee-wee  Herman Show is headed to Broadway in October.And Reubens is apparently just as honored to be working with Apatow."There is no one like Judd in our business—he loves comedy with  emotion and heart, and he sees what we do as art," said the resurgent  57-year-old actor. "I can't believe I'm getting this opportunity to be  working with him."Reubens is working on the script with writer-actor Paul Rust.  Apatow's going to produce, not direct and produce, but that  didn't seem to hurt Superbad, Pineapple Express or Get  Him to the Greek.Besides, Pee-wee is technically a for-all-ages character, so they're  going to want to avoid the automatic "R" that Apatow's films usually  get. Especially considering…you know.
