Pee-wee Herman Promotes His Pee-wee Broadway Show on The View/n
Pee-wee Herman swung by The View this morning to promote the new Broadway version of his show. If your children happen to be fans of the legendary star—or just creepy public figures in general—you should know that if they hope to see the production, they better meet the required age limit.            

Oh, Pee-wee, you can't enforce that. You of all people should know that if someone wants to sneak into a theater, they're going to sneak into a theater.
