MMA Star Dave Herman -- TASED DURING ARREST (Video)/nFormer UFC heavyweight fighter Dave Herman was hit with a taser during an arrest in Indiana this week ... and now Dave's wife has released the video she shot during the incident in which she calls out the police.   Cops say Herman had been speeding with no headlights or taillights -- and when they tried to pull him over, he led them on a 3 mile chase before finally stopping at a gas station. During the stop, cops say Herman  "approached Officers in an aggressive manner " -- so they fired the taser to take him into custody. But Herman's wife Madeleine -- who was in the car at the time with their young son -- tells TMZ Sports she's FURIOUS over the incident and claims her husband is the real victim. Madeleine says Dave was NOT trying to run from cops when they initially tried to pull him over -- they were merely looking for a well lit place to stop.  As for allegations Dave was being aggressive, Madeleine says that's also BS -- explaining,  "Dave, not wanting armed strangers walking up behind the vehicle, especially with our infant son in tow, stepped out of the vehicle and asked them if there was something he could help them with. " Madeleine says cops overreacted and violently took her husband to the ground. He's being charged with several criminal counts including resisting arrest and battery against an officer. Dave is still in custody -- but she's calling for the officers involved in the arrest to be charged with assault. We reached out to the DeKalb County Sheriff’s Department for comment -- so far, no word back. /n
