'Pee-wee's Big Holiday' -- SPLAT! Rough Day to Be a Stunt Guy (VIDEO)/nIf you're fired up for Pee-wee Herman's return, you're probably NOT his stunt double -- who spent an entire day getting hoisted into the air and dropped into a lake like a sack of wet cement.  "Pee-wee’s Big Holiday " was shooting at Big Bear Lake, CA recently -- and the scene called for Pee-wee to plunge into the chilly lake while holding an umbrella. Not exactly Paul Reubens' kinda thing, so enter the stunt man.    Sources on set say strong wind kept messing up the shot, so the poor guy had to make the roughly 40 foot drop in a soggy suit ... over, and over, and over again. Surprising Paul needs a stunt double -- he's usually so good in the water .../n
