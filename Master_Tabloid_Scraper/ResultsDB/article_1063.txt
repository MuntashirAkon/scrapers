The trio wore their masks along with capes. Fisher, 37, and Underwood, who married in 2010, celebrated seven years of marriage in July and marked the occasion with a romantic date and sweet love notes to each other.
“Celebrating 7 years with this amazing man. How am I so blessed to share this life with you, @mfisher1212 ? Here’s to so many more years and memories together,” Underwood captioned a selfie of her and her husband.
“Glad I took a chance on this babe 7 years ago. Turns out she’s the best wife, and mom to Izzy, I could ever dream of!! #happyanniversary,” Fisher wrote along with a photo of his wife.
They welcomed their son in 2015, announcing his birth on Facebook.
