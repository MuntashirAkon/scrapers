Nerds, Geeks and Jessica Alba/nComic-Con -- the only place smokin' hot babes like Jessica Alba talk to guys dressed in Napoleon Dynamite costumes. The annual four-day San Diego convention, specializing in the latest in comic books and fantasy /sci-fi /horror themed TV shows, movies and video games, took place over the weekend, and TMZ was there to catch every bizarre moment. Celebs like Alba (who had a pushy security guard), Rosario Dawson, Nic Cage, Robert Downey, Jr. and even Pee-wee Herman were caught mingling with characters like Storm Trooper Elvis, one-legged zombie hunter Cherry Darling, and the ever popular Princess Leia, in full Jaba the Hutt slave ensemble. All this and more in today's where-my-nerds-at edition of Star Catcher./n
