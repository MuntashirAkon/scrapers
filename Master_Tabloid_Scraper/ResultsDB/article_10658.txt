 Suicide Shocker: Linkin Park Singer Chester Bennington's Death Investigation Complete.../n
Linkin Park lead singer Chester Bennington committed suicide yesterday at age 41 inside of his Los Angeles home, and RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned that the investigation into his death is complete.
“It was reported to the coroner as a suicide by hanging, but until we do the autopsy we cannot release a final cause of death,” L.A. County Coroner revealed. “Right now the cause of death is still pending.”
“The autopsy will take four to five hours, and it has not been done yet. If there is reason to do toxicology after the autopsy is complete, it will take several weeks before the final cause is released.”

“If it is determined that toxicology is not needed, then the final cause will be released in about a week. However, the investigation into his death is now complete,” a spokesperson for the coroner told Radar.
As previously reported, Bennington was left devastated after his best friend, Soundgarden front man Chris Cornell, killed himself by hanging in May. In an eerie twist, Bennington died on what would have been Cornell’s 53rd birthday.
The singer – who admittedly had a long history of drug abuse and depression– hinted at suicide in his last interview.
“I came to a point in my life where I was like, ‘I can either just give up and f*****g die or I can f*****g fight for what I want. I chose to fight for what I wanted. I wanted to have good relationships. I wanted to love the people in my life. I wanted to enjoy my job,” he said. “I wanted to enjoy being a dad and having friends and just getting up in the morning. Because that was a struggle for me.”Linkin Park lead singer Chester Bennington committed suicide yesterday at age 41 inside of his Los Angeles home, and RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned that the investigation into his death is complete.
