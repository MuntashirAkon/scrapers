R. Kelly is embroiled in another sex scandal involving teenage girls.

In an investigative report by Jim Derogatis, the reporter who broke the 2000 story of a video that depicted the singer of engaging in sexual acts with an underage girl, the 50-year-old is accused of holding young women against their will in an abusive “cult.”
Based on allegations from three of Kelly’s former associates — Cheryl Mack, Kitti Jones, and Asante McGee — and accounts from the parents of six women are currently residing in Kelly’s rented properties in Chicago and Atlanta, the story claims the R&B star tries to control these alleged victims by “dictating what they eat, how they dress, when they bathe, when they sleep, and how they engage in sexual encounters that he records.”

These victims reportedly include a 25-year old woman who’s been part of Kelly’s entourage for seven years, a 19-year-old who has been seen with Kelly in public and photos on music gossip outlets, a 26-year-old songwriter from Atlanta who began her relationship with Kelly about eight years ago when she was 19 and an 18-year-old singer from Florida, who Mack describes as Kelly’s “favorite — his number one girl.” The parents of the latter reportedly contacted police and tell DeRogatis that when the alleged victim’s older sister tried to get her out in August 2015, Kelly and his associates physically assaulted her. As per a police report obtained in the story, this incident is described as a “simple battery” and an arrest has yet to be made.
