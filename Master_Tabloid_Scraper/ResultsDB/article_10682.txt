Swimsuit-Clad Kourtney Kardashian Continues to Pack on PDA with Younes Bendjima/n
Kourtney Kardashian can’t keep her hands off Younes Bendjima!

The mom-of-three was spotted packing on major PDA with her new beau again. Hitting the beach in Saint-Tropez, France, the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star looked positively smitten with the former boxer as they held hands and got cozy by the seaside.
Though they were first seen in coordinating black-and-white tops, the pair eventually stripped down to hit the waves. Kourtney, 48, hopped onto a jet-ski before diving into the blue waters with Younes, 23, for a PDA-packed dip.

The couple, who were also seen sharing a intimate hug while waiting for a boat on the docks, have been vacationing in the French Riviera since last week. Days ago, they were seen on a paddleboat while out with friends.
“He loves showing her around and knows all of the best places,” a source told E! News of Younes, who met Courtney last year during Paris Fashion Week. “He really wants her to have an amazing time and she is.”
