Jim Parsons is celebrating his 14th anniversary with boyfriend Todd Spiewak with a touching message on Instagram that's bound to earn him brownie points.The Big Bang Theory star wrote the lengthy caption alongside a sweet shot of the two performing karaoke while on a date years ago."I met this guy (the one with the mic) 14 years ago today and it was the best thing that ever happened to me, no contest."The Emmy Award-winning actor continued, "One of his greatest gifts to me is that he no longer takes me to sing karaoke. Also, I believe this was a selfie with an actual camera, as our phones couldn't do that back then hahaha!" How far we've comeâ€¦

Parsons also dished a bit about his first date, a blind date mind you, with Todd back in 2002 at a karaoke bar.As for the song he sang first? "I Found Someone."
