In the wake of the new details that have emerged following the death of Jim Carrey's girlfriend, Cathriona White, the comedian has made it clear that he wished intimate details of the tragedy could remain private.White was found dead in her home in September 2015 after an apparent suicide, and earlier this week the coroner released the contents of a suicide note the 28-year-old actress left for Carrey. In a statement obtained by E! News, Carrey reacts to the fact that the coroner would release such information."When I came to Hollywood to make it as a comedian, I soon learned that the details of my private life would be handed out to the media like free dinner vouchers. I never dreamed that the people I love most in the world would also be on the menu. What a shame.Regrettably,Jim Carrey"Â 

White was said to have died from an overdose from prescription medication. She was pronounced dead at the scene with pills beside her. Shortly after her passing, Carrey released the following statement, "I am shocked and saddened by the passing of my sweet Cathriona. She was a truly kind and delicate Irish flower, too sensitive for this soil, to whom loving and being loved was all that sparkled. My heart goes out to her family and friends and to everyone who loved and cared about her. We have all been hit with a lightning bolt."According to reports, Carrey and White first met in 2012, although they split after a few months of dating. The two reportedly rekindled their relationship in May 2015.
