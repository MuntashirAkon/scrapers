Rob Gronkowski & His Boys Rack Up $100k Tab During Shirtless Turn-Up/nHow much does it cost to party with Rob Gronkowski for a night? More than most people make in a year ... 'cause Gronk and Co. racked up a HUGE $100k tab at a casino nightclub over the weekend. TMZ Sports obtained the itemized receipt for Gronk and his 20-man party crew at Shrine at Foxwoods Resort Casino in Connecticut this weekend. We spoke with a PR rep for the Shrine bar who says the receipt is legit. It's pretty awesome.  In total, Gronk's gang tore through 160 BOTTLES OF CHAMPAGNE including: - 18 bottles of Ace of Spades Rose: $18,000 - 15 bottles of Dom Perignon Rose: $27,000 There's more ... including 16 bottles of Grey Goose for $10,400, 45 orders of Maker's Mark, 24 shots of Jim Beam Fire, 3 bottles of Don Julio 1942. These guys weren't messin' around.  It's unclear who footed the bill (most likely the casino) ... but it's not like Gronk can't afford it anyway -- dude's gonna make more than $4 mil next year. It's good to be Gronk./n
