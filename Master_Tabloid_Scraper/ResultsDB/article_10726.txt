NBA's Jim Jackson Says Serena Would Be A Billionaire If LaVar Was Her Dad /nSerena Williams' genetics cost her MAJOR dollars, according to former NBA star Jim Jackson ... 'cause JJ says if her dad was LaVar Ball, and not Richard, Serena would be a BILLIONAIRE. Jim's point? That if Serena and other stars like LeBron JamesÂ had parents who started their own companies like LaVar, they'd be even wealthier than they are today. FYI -- LeBron James and Serena Williams are very, very wealthy. Jackson told us this when we got him out in Beverly Hills ... and he's got a point ... especially if Lonzo becomes what Williams and James are ... WHICH IS ONE OF THE GREATEST EVER. No pressure ... right, kid?/n
