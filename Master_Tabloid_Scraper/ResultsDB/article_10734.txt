 'Duck Dynasty' Rehab Scandal! Willie Robertson's Young Son Checks Into Recovery House.../n
What would Duck Dynasty patriarch Willie Robertson think?
In his son John Luke‘s memoir, Young And Beardless, the young reality star admits he once left his native Louisiana for a recovery house filled with “ex-convicts and drug addicts” in faraway San Francisco, California.
However, the 21-year-old hadn’t initially intended to check into the seedy facility.
John Luke explains that a new friend named Shawn offered to let him stay in his home during a trip to California to meet famous preacher Francis Chan.

“I assumed that he meant, you know, a home that he lived in by himself,” he says. “It turned out to be a recovery house for ex-convicts and drug addicts.”
When he arrived at the Christian-based treatment center Bayview House, “I didn’t want to get out of the car at first,” the reality star confesses, adding that he soon felt as thought he “entered an episode of Breaking Bad.”
One of his housemates had been arrested for charges related to a “meth deal” that went wrong, others were “part of a gang” and “killers.”
Soon, John Luke began to feel empathy for his suffering roommates, and prayed for their safety.

“Shawn wants these guys to know God and experience that kind of high — that kind of acceptance,” he explains.
So far, John Luke has remained on the right side of the law. The Jesus-loving star married his high school sweetheart, Mary Kate, at just 19, and continues to star in his wild family’s A&E series.
