NICIS star Pauley Perrette‘s ex-husband, Francis Shivers, is in jail today after being found guilty of violating a restraining order the actress got against her former spouse.
RadarOnline.com has confirmed with a official at the LAX Airport courthouse that Shivers surrendered in department 83 this morning.
It’s just the latest development in his messy split from the actress, who married him in 2000. Shivers filed for divorce in 2004 and the divorce was finalized in 2006.

During the contentious divorce proceedings between Perrette and Shivers, the actress was granted a restraining order against the DJ.
After allegedly violating the restraining order, on February 25, 2013, and using forbidden electronic communication in connection to contact Perrette, Shivers was sentenced to 90 days in jail.

Because he was already on probation for a previous conviction, he was also slapped with an additional 180 days for the violation, but can serve the sentences concurrently.
Jail overcrowding in California will result in Shivers being locked up for no more than 36 days, and could even be out by the end of the week.
Shivers maintains he did nothing wrong.
