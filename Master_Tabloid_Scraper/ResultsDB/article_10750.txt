While Secretary of State Rex Tillerson hasn't yet revealed the name, Jared's dad Dan Tucker confirmed the news to KGO. Heidi explained her husband had gone missing after they had gotten separated during the attack, as they were enjoying drinks with a friend.
She continued, telling NBC News: 
"Next thing I knew there's screaming [and] yelling. I got pushed inside the souvenir kiosk and stayed there hiding while everybody kept running by screaming."
How horrifying. We can't even imagine!
Also killed in the van attack were Italy's Bruno Gulotta and Luca Rossa, according to the country's Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni.
Luca was on vacation with his girlfriend, who was injured in the attack, and Bruno was in the city with his partner and two children.
Belgian authorities announced Elke Vanbockrijck, a mother of two, died in the attack on Las Ramblas. And a Catalonian publication divulged a man who lived close to the city, Francisco López Rodríguez, was confirmed dead as well.
Heartbreaking!
Our thoughts and prayers are with all the victims and those affected.
