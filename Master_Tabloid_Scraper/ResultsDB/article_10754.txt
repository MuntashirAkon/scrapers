Tomi Lahren is one job loss away from a porn career. She has the perfect skill set, her mouth is always open for no good reason.

Hey @TomiLahren, you realize what law required insurance companies to keep 24-year-olds on their parents' plans, right? #whoops https://t.co/TIPEbpKCwv

Tomi Lahren's idiocy is a reminder of why I got an education. She's the alternate ending in my choose-your-own-adventure & it ain't pretty.
