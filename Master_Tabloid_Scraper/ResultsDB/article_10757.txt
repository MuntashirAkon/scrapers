According to the Hollywood Reporter, the film’s director says that the action thriller will be heavy on the sex scenes and will have a “hard R rating” as a result.
“When I read the book and I made the pitch to the studio about what the approach would be, this was a definite R,” Francis Lawrence said at a special Fox event in London on Friday (May 5). “Nobody’s chickened out or got cold feet, everybody’s gone for it from the beginning. It’s a hard R.”
