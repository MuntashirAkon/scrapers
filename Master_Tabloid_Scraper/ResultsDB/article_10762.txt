Frank Ocean said skipping the 2017 Grammy Awards will be his Colin Kaepernick moment.
Last month, Kanye West threatened to boycott the Grammys after the singer did not receive any nominations. However, it turns out it was Ocean’s decision not to participate since he deliberately missed the deadline to submit his two new albums, Blonde and Endless, for Grammy consideration.

Despite winning two Grammys in 2013, he explained that he wants to make a statement against the awards show, which he believe is “not representing” all artists equally.
“That institution certainly has nostalgic importance,” he told The New York Times in his first (real) interview in three years. “It just doesn’t seem to be representing very well for people who come from where I come from, and hold down what I hold down.”
