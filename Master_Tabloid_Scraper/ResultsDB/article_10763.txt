Margaret Cho has been residing at a sober-living house for five months since leaving rehab.

The comedienne made the confession during a performance at the Comedy Store in Los Angeles on Nov. 3. Speaking about her experiences post-rehab, the 47-year-old told the crowd, “I bring the real me and my truth to my work. It’s not perfect, it’s not manufactured, it’s real.”
According to The Hollywood Reporter, Cho also joked that she brought wine to her intervention thinking she was going to a friend’s party, only to get drunk before moving to a sober facility.

During the stand-up routine, the San Francisco native also touched upon heavy subjects such as race relations and rape. As a rape survivor, detailed how she was sexually assault by an uncle from the ages 5 to 12.
“If we can shine a light on what happens to us, we have a shot at making rape obsolete,” she reportedly told the crowd, defending her decision to talk about the assault during her set. “That’s my dream.”
Furthermore, Cho delivered a number of jokes about Donald Trump, poking fun at his controversial “grab them by the pussy” comment and calling the now president-elect “fucking dumb.”
“He can’t even blend his under-eye concealer,” she said. “You don’t even know how to use a makeup sponge?”
