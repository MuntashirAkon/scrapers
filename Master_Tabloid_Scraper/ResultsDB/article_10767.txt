“24K Magic” marks Mars’ first single in over four years. Though it’s been a while since Mars released new music, he hasn’t been completely M.I.A. The singer lent his vocals to the Mark Ronson song “Uptown Funk” in 2014 and even performed it at the Super Bowl Halftime Show with Beyoncé and Coldplay.
Bruno has yet to reveal when his highly anticipated album is set to drop, but we are ready for it! Launch the video at the top of the page to watch the entire music video.
