Khloé and Kim Kardashian West Jet Off on ‘Quick Trip’ to San Francisco with Kanye and Tristan Thompson/n

Kim Kardashian West and Khloé Kardashian are jet-setting to San Francisco — and they’re taking the boys along with them!
Kardashian West, 36, and her 33-year-old sister headed to the northern California city on Saturday with their respective loves, Kanye West and Tristan Thompson, and were sure to document the moments before the trip on Snapchat.
“Quick Trip to San Fran,” Kardashian West wrote on a video of the jet. She showed off the red carpet leading to the aircraft’s stairs.
The sisters both Snapped a video of the whole crew showing the happy couples alongside a few other friends. And the Snapping didn’t stop once they were on the jet.

In a black-and-white clip, West took over the camera as he captured his wife striking a pose.
“A pic or a video,” a confused Kardashian West asked. The 40-year-old rapper replied: “It’s a video.”
The sweet outing comes as things seem to be getting more and more serious between Kardashian and her 26-year-old boyfriend.

A source previously told PEOPLE that the love birds are house hunting together. However, they are not moving in together officially just yet, the source added, noting that Thompson (who has a home in Cleveland) is looking to rent a place in Los Angeles.

“They live at Khloé’s Calabasas house right now,” says the source, explaining that the Cleveland Cavaliers player is hoping to land a home closer to the downtown area.
“He thinks the drive from Calabasas to L.A. is too far every day,” says the source. “When they go out in L.A., they want a second house that’s closer.”

The stars appear to be the picture-perfect, happy couple, even working out together. Earlier this month, Kardashian and Thompson broke a sweat in her garage.
Kardashian, who finalized her divorce from ex-husband Lamar Odom in December, was first linked to Thompson in early September. In the months since, she’s spent much of her time with him in Cleveland, regularly flying out to support him at games and even flaunting his NBA championship ring on social media.
