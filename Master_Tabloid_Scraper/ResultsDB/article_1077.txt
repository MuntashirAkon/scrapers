Carrie Fisher's Daughter Billie Lourd Will Inherit Nearly $7 Million/nCarrie Fisher -- who starred in the globally iconic 'Star Wars' franchise as Princess Leia -- left an estate worth nearly $7 million to her daughter,Â Billie Lourd. In new docs filed by the executor of Carrie's estate, Billie stands to inherit $6.8 million in personal property left by Carrie. TMZ broke the story, Carrie died after suffering a massive heart attack aboard a flight from London to LAX. It's interesting ... although $6.8 million is nothing to sneeze at, considering the most recent 'Star Wars' installment featuring Carrie grossed more than $2 BILLION, you'd think her estate might be more flush with cash. It's possible there could be additional money in trusts not reflected in this probate case ... which Billie could also collect./n
