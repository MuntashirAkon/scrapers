Pope Francis is making House Speaker John Boehner cry all the tears.The 78-year-old pontiff recently began his first visit to the United States and on Thursday spoke to Congress. Before making his speech, he met with Boehner, who was seen getting emotional after the two shook hands. For the last 20 years, the 65-year-old Republican leader, who is Catholic, had invited the Pope to speak at the Capitol. Pope Francis is the first to accept the invitation. "Your holiness, welcome, really glad that you're here," Boehner said, as seen in a video posted by Politico.Pope Francis thanked him, speaking via a translator."I wanted to wear the old Catholic Consortium tie," Boehner said. "But my staff insisted I wear a green tie.""Green is the color of hope," the Pope replied, via his translator."We'll need a lot of hope today," Boehner said.

 The speaker of the House is known for several past emotional public moments, which have earned him the Urban Dictionary entry "Weeper of the House.""Prayed for the Pope most every day growing up," Boehner later tweeted. "This was a humbling moment."

The Pope later addressed Congress in English, speaking about climate change, immigration and poverty. He received a standing ovation. Boehner, who sat behind him and alongside Vice President Joe Biden, was seen getting teary-eyed throughout the speech and at one point wiped his eyes with a handkerchief.Watch a video below, courtesy of MSNBC. Boehner's emotional moment is at the 15:00 mark.
