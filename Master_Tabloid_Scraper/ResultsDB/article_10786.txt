Pope Francis really is a rock star!His holiness is releasing an album called Wake Up! on Nov. 27, Rolling Stone reported Friday. But the pontiff, who is currently making his rounds in New York City, won't actually be singing on the Vatican-approved L.P. Instead, excerpts of his speeches and readings in multiple languages will be paired with musical accompaniment from other artists.The album, a collaboration with Believe Digital, is already available for pre-order on iTunes with an instant download of "Wake Up! Go! Go Forward!"

Wake Up!'s producer and artistic director Don Giulio Neroni spoke with Rolling Stone about how the album came together."For many years, I've been the producer and the artistic director of albums by the Pope. I had the honor to work with John Paul II, Benedict XVI and now Pope Francis," he said. "As in the past, for this album too, I tried to be strongly faithful to the pastoral and personality of Pope Francis: the Pope of dialogue, open doors, hospitality. For this reason, the voice of Pope Francis in Wake Up! dialogues music. And contemporary music (rock, pop, Latin etc.) dialogues with the Christian tradition of sacred hymns."According to a Believe Media press release (as excerpted by CBS News), a portion of Wake Up!'s proceeds will be donated to "a support fund for refugees."
