Steve Francis Strikes Deal In Burglary Case ... Avoids Jail/nEx-NBA star Steve Francis has struck a deal with prosecutors in his burglary case, and he'll avoid jail if he stays out of trouble ... TMZ Sports has learned.  As we previously reported, Francis was hit with a felony burglary charge after allegedly breaking into a stranger's BMW and taking more than $1,700 of stuff in Florida back in June.  A rep for the State Attorney's Office tells us Francis was accepted into a pretrial intervention program on Monday, which means he'll avoid prosecution if he completes certain conditions.  We're told Francis will be under supervision for a year. During that time, he has to undergo drug and alcohol evaluations and complete any recommended treatment. He also has to do 50 hours of community service, pay a $7,300 fine and apologize to /stay away from the victim.  If he does all that and stays out of trouble, prosecutors will drop the charge next year. /n
