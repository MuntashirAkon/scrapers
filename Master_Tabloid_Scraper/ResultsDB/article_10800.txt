The Pope, Hats Off!!! /nThe Pope, exposed by a 3-year-old girl!!! The video is hilarious ... Estella WestrickÂ was in St. Peter's Square in the Vatican City when she was lucky enough to meet Pope Francis, and she clearly wanted a souvenir ... so she grabbed his hat. The Pope was super cool, and laughed it off./n
