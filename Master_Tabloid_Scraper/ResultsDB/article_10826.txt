Shameless! Steve Harvey Laughs Off Infamous Staff Email Scandal/n
Shameless comedian Steve Harvey is making fun of his infamous staff email scandal!
In a The Steve Harvey Show clip revealed by Perez Hilton, a smiling Harvey pokes fun at his scathing message after the public’s backlash over his diva attitude.
After taking a note from a suggestion box, Harvey reads: “Will you be doing more emails to the staff? This is actually from the staff, we just wanted to get a heads up.”
As Radar previously reported, the TV icon, 60, was slammed for sending a “welcome back” email to staffers that essentially told them to stay out of his way.

“Do not come to my dressing room unless invited,” wrote Harvey. “Do not approach me while I’m in the makeup chair unless I ask to speak with you directly.”
“I am seeking more free time for me throughout the day. Do not wait in any hallway to speak to me. I hate being ambushed. Please make an appointment. I promise you I will not entertain you in the hallway, and do not attempt to walk with me,” he continued.
Harvey’s rude memo was not received well by his staff, or by fans.
He later defended his actions, claiming staffers constantly “ambushed” him at work.

He did admit: “In hindsight, I probably should’ve handled it a little bit differently.”
But as is apparent in his latest show teaser, the host is anything but apologetic.
