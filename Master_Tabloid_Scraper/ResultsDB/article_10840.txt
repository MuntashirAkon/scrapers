Steve Harvey isn’t sorry.

The talk show host, whose leaked list of demands to his staff recently went viral, is defending his much talked-about memo. Though the letter received much heat online for its harsh tone, Harvey believes it’s perfectly fine to ask his staff to not bother him with impromptu meetings and conversations about the show.
“Look man, I’m in my makeup chair, they walk in the room. I’m having lunch, they walk in, they don’t knock,” he told Entertainment Tonight Thursday after the internal note was made public. “I’m in the hallway, I’m getting ambushed by people with friends that come to the show and having me sign this and do this. I just said, ‘Wait a minute.’”
He added, “And in hindsight, I probably should’ve handled it a little bit differently.”
In the memo addressed to his staff, Harvey requested that “no one” should enter his dressing room “unless invited.” He also declared that all employees must “schedule an appointment” should they want to speak to him.
“IF YOU OPEN MY DOOR, EXPECT TO BE REMOVED,” the 60-year-old wrote. “I want the ambushing to stop now. That includes TV staff.”

Amid the backlash, comedienne Chelsea Handler spoofed the note and released an amended one of her own to the staff of her Neflix talk show show, Chelsea. Using a red marker to include her own list of demands, she told staffers to only stop by her dressing room if “you have drugs” or “have an Aperol Spritz in your hand.”
“I am seeking more free time for me to drink throughout the day,” Handler noted. “Do not wait in the hallway to speak to me. I hate being ambushed. Please go f*ck yourself!”

Thanks a lot, @IAmSteveHarvey. Chelsea took your letter and ran with it. pic.twitter.com/O5G9qHwCAL
