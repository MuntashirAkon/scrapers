It was a great year for music in 2016, and if you don’t take our word for it, ask Taylor Swift for a peek at her bank account.

We’re big fans of music here at Celebuzz. Allow me to redirect you to our round-up of our favorite albums of the year for further proof, but it’s the end of the year and it’s likely that you’re very tired of reading or, well, doing anything really. You just want to relax, sip on some eggnog, realize that eggnog almost always tastes atrocious, swap the eggnog out for wine and dance around your house in festive holiday attire while listening to good music. That said, our staff has compiled this handy Spotify playlist of our favorite tracks from this year for you to blast throughout the holiday season at your get-togethers. Hell, even listen to it in 2017. Nostalgia for 2016 doesn’t qualify as “nostalgia” on January 1, anyway.
