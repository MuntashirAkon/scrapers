As 2016 comes to an end, everyone looks forward to Thanksgiving; a day spent with our family and friends, stuffing our faces with our favorite foods and reflecting on the things that we’re most grateful for this year.

Here at Celebuzz, the things we’re thankful for are just a little bit different than what you’re used to hearing at your Thanksgiving table. From a perfectly timed penis pic to a surprise album, there are an endless amount of celebrities and pop culture events that bring us joy, but we’ve managed to narrow them down to our top 13.
In no particular order, here are the 13 things the Celebuzz staff is most thankful for this year:
1. The Year in Music
“2016 saw great releases from most of pop’s A-List. Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Rihanna, and Britney Spears all released spectacular, ambitious albums, and some of them (Bey, Gaga) released the best albums of their careers so far. Additionally, there were dozens of other truly incredible albums by up-and-comers (Mitski, Angel Olsen) and veterans (David Bowie, Leonard Cohen, PJ Harvey) alike. In a year that sucked in a lot of ways, it was nice, at least, to have the music.” – Matt Russoniello, Managing Editor
2. Jon Hamm’s Penis
“I am never not going to click an article about Jon Hamm’s ham hock or read a Jon Hamm interview in which he discusses it in any capacity. It’s the gift that keeps on giving and I hope that it is featured in an AMC series of its own one day.” - Mia Lardiere,  Multimedia Content Producer

3. Celebrity Thirstiness
“According to the Urban dictionary, a thirst trap is defined as the following: ‘Any statement or picture used to intentionally create attention or thirst.’ Demi Lovato, Nick Jonas, Bella Thorne, Lea Michele and so, so many other young celebrities I thank you for wanting stardom SO bad that you’ll pretty much do anything to further that goal. In turn, that provides us with some very unique stories to report on each and every day, and I thank all of you thirsty ones from the bottom of my heart.” – Michael Prieve, Editor-in-Chief
4. Westworld
“HBO’s new mind-bending visit to the Wild West has become the most addictive piece of TV this fall. It’s the perfect follow-up to Negan’s cruelty on Sunday nights.” – Scott Baumgartner, Staff Editor
5. Drake
“Drake is just a delight. As a Canadian living in the United States, seeing Drake give shout-outs to our motherland — and especially my hometown of Toronto — just warms me up with national pride. He’s like the human version of a Tim Hortons double-double on a cold winter morning. Though us Canadians celebrated our Thanksgiving a month ago, I’m still thankful that Drake is reppin’ T.O. whenever he can.” – Gabi Chung, Senior Editor

6. Dream Kardashian
“I am always thankful for the entertainment the Kardashian/Jenner family constantly provides me, but the newest addition to the family brought a new level of drama I could have only dreamed of. When Rob Kardashian, the family’s resident recluse, came out of hiding and began shacking up with Kardashian/Jenner enemy no. 1, Blac Chyna, I didn’t think it could get any better. But then they got engaged AND THEN they got pregnant and suddenly Keeping Up with the Kardashians morphed into an episode of Maury. And then after the world literally almost came to an end on November 9th, 2016, here comes Dream Kardashian to save the day, providing much-needed laughter and shady memes during a time of such darkness.” – Jelani Addams Rosa, Staff Editor

7. Prince Harry’s New Love Interest
“Although it’s too soon to say for sure, I’m thankful that Prince Harry might have found his princess in actress Meghan Markle. I think we’re all ready for another Royal wedding.” – Natasha Reda, Writer
8. Tyga and the Jenners’ New Cars
“One day it’s a red Mustang, the next it’s a Mercedes-Benz Maybach. The next week, it’s a new Bentley. Tyga, Kylie, and Kendall Jenner are amassing a fleet of luxury cars because in the future fancy cars will be currency. Three BMWs will get you a loaf of bread.” – Scott Baumgartner

9. Chrissy Teigen
“Chrissy Teigen is a true social media gem. From her filter-free Twitter feed to her adorable family filled Instagram, Teigen is who I’d invite over for Thanksgiving. And it doesn’t hurt that she can cook her ass off.” – Jelani Addams-Rosa
10. Bill Murray
“Like a bag of Skittles that you find wedged in the crack between your car seats, Bill Murray delivers delight on the internet when you need it most and when you least expect it.” – Mia Lardiere
11. Lady Gaga
“Lady Gaga began the year with a trio of high-stakes performances: the national anthem at the Super Bowl, the David Bowie tribute at the Grammys, and her show-stopping rendition of “Till It Happens to You” at the Oscars. (She also won a Golden Globe!) She ends it with a fantastic new album (another No. 1 for her resume!), more memorable performances, an outspoken and empowering political agenda, and the knowledge that she’ll be headlining 2017’s Super Bowl halftime show. It was a great year to be a Little Monster: ups, downs, and everything in between.” – Matt Russoniello
12. Solange’s A Seat at the Table
“Solange’s album is a moving exploration into the depths of her identity that demonstrates, artfully, how vulnerability and strength can co-exist. She brought her musicality to a new a new level, which I hope will continue to grow throughout her career. Her lyrics have empowered those who are navigating the same space as she is during this time of great uncertainty in our country.” – Mia Lardiere

13. The Return of the Gilmore Girls
“Though I am not typically one to indulge too seriously in nostalgia, I will admit to a certain excitement about Netflix’s Gilmore Girls revival. Perhaps it is because the original run episodes remain, a decade later, highly unique and entertaining. Or maybe it’s simply because creator Amy Sherman-Palladino, who left the show after the sixth season, will finally get to execute her ultimate vision for the Gilmores. Or it’s both of those things. Yeah, that’s probably it.” – Matt Russoniello
