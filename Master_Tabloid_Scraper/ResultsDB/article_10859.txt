Kevin Hart Launches Hurricane Harvey Relief Challenge/n
Dwyane "Rock" Johnson, Beyoncé, Chris Rock, Jay-Z, Dave Chappelle, Jerry Seinfeld, Steve Harvey and Justin Timberlake are just a few of the names he calls on to keep the challenge going. The sum seems a small price to pay in an effort to help the people of Texas in this trying time. The New York Times has reported that five people have already been killed by the flooding with dozens more injured. Some areas of the state are looking at up to 50 inches of water, making evacuation difficult. "I am getting a link together now people," he writes in the caption. "Help me help Houston."

Celebrities aren't the only ones that can make a difference. You can donate to the American Red Cross now to help those affected by visiting www.redcross.org.
