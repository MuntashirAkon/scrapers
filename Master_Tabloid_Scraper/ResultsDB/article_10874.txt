Fight fans were blowing up social media during the bout ... trying to figure out how Steve had pulled a better ringside seat than mega-stars like LeBron James and Diddy.  Well, we might have the answer -- partially.  TMZ Sports broke the story ... Ari Emanuel, the head of talent agency WME-IMG, got 250 tickets to dole out to celebs for the super-fight -- and we're told Ari and co. had a tough time deciding who got the sweetest set-ups for May-Mac ... the politics of seating were a  "nightmare. " Turns out Steve's way high up on the food chain -- and we could tell he was having the time of his life in his primo seat. Especially cause he didn't have to announce the winner. /n
