Adriana Lima and Matt Harvey Celebrating with a Hot Friend (PHOTOS)/nMets superstar Matt Harvey was on the verge of a perfect game Friday night -- no other way to describe a night out with your smokeshow gf, Adriana Lima, and her also hot girlfriend! Matt and the Victoria's Secret hottie looked like they were painting the town ... doing dinner and the club scene in NYC. The pitcher turned 28 earlier in the week, but just got back from Spring Training -- so this could have been his bday celebration. If it was it looks like Adriana brought the perfect gift. C'mon ... reality or not, Matt's smile kinda says what he was thinking. In any event, looks like the start (or ending) of a great night for baseball's Dark Knight./n
