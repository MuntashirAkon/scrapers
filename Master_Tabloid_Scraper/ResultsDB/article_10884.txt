D. L. Hughley Says F*** Respecting Prez Trump, He Doesn't Respect Us/nD.L. Hughley says Steve Harvey is dead wrong about Snoop Dogg, and other entertainers, showing Donald Trump R-E-S-P-E-C-T ... because the prez doesn't know how to spell it. D.L. told us at LAX ... that old adage about how the public should treat a sitting president just doesn't apply anymore. His pal, Steve, warned Snoop his  "Lavender " music video is crossing a dangerous line. But in D.L.'s eyes ... Trump's only getting what he's giving./n
