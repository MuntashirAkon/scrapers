Michael Vick: Dog-Fighting Joke During Radio 'Prank' (AUDIO)/nMichael Vick was the target of a live radio prank -- where  "callers " heckled the NY Jets star about poodle-fighting and black-on-black QB crime ... and the whole thing was pretty damn funny.  A supposedly clueless Vick called into what he  "thought " was an NYC-based sports radio show -- when in reality, he was talking to Nephew Tommy from the Steve Harvey Morning Show. During the bit, Vick said he was game to talk to  "callers " -- who all turned out to be crazy characters who harassed him about everything from dog-fighting to his QB battle with Geno Smith. Vick kept his composure during the  "prank " -- and later vowed revenge on Tommy ... right after plugging the comedy show.  Unclear if Vick was in on the prank from the beginning, but it doesn't really matter -- it was still funny. Seems like a warm-up for some of the jokes Vick will get hit with during the comedy event in Louisiana -- as he already told TMZ Sports, NOTHING is off-limits./n
