Tiger Woods Admits 'Lifetime Regret' For Cheating & Sex Scandal In New Tell-All/n
It’s been eight long years since Tiger Woods infamously cheated on his wife Elin Nordegren with at least a dozen women, and subsequently checked into sex addiction rehab. But in his new tell-all, the golf great admits he still feels immense guilt for his bad behavior.
Ex Nordegren “and I were so much in love when we married in 2004. But I betrayed her,” he admits in his new book, The 1997 Masters: My Story, which explores his first major championship win and life after early success. “My dishonesty and selfishness caused her intense pain.”
Though the couple attempted to “repair the damage,” the disgraced father of two, 41, and his model wife, 37, split soon after the scandal exploded in November 2009.

“My regret will last a lifetime,” he confesses.
Years later, however, Woods claims he and Nordegren are “best friends.”
“Elin and I are devoted to our kids, and we have become best friends are we care for them” writes the dad of Sam, 9, and Charlie, 8. “It’s all about the kids for us.”

He also reflects on how his beloved father Earl, who died in 2006, would have reacted to his cheating and partying.
“He too would have been disappointed in my poor personal decisions,” he says.
Woods later moved on to Olympic skier Lindsey Vonn, but the couple split in 2015 after two years together. As RadarOnline.com exclusively reported, he is now dating stylist and socialite Kristin Smith.
