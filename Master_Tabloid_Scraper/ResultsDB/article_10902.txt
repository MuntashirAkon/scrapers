Get Used To Orange! Joe Giudice's New Prison Wardrobe Revealed/n
For the next 41 months Real Housewives of New Jersey star Joe Giudice is going to have a very limited wardrobe! RadarOnline.com has an in-depth look at what he’ll be wearing for the next few years behind bars.
According to the Fort Dix inmate handbook, the men are provided with four pairs of khaki pants with four matching shirts, one pair of boots or shoes and one orange jacket — which doubles as a winter coat.
The 43-year-old reality star can also expect to receive an orange knit hat, four t-shirts, four pairs of underwear and socks, and two towels, along with two washcloths.

While the inmates are provided with these bare necessities, inmates are responsible for looking good beyond their attire.
“You are required to maintain good personal hygiene and present a neat, clean appearance at all times. You may select the hairstyle of your personal choice; however, hair must be clean and well groomed. You may wear a mustache and/or beard. Beards must be neatly trimmed and kept clean at all times,” the handbook states.
Inmates often find a creative way to keep their wardrobes fully stocked, however, former Fort Dix Inmate Earl David told Radar.

“What you could do is, they got bins on every first floor and then people leave almost every day — maybe 10 people — they throw things in bins in the bathroom and from there you could just take clothing and wash them,” he said. “You get more stuff like that. You just go to the bins, look for your size, you wash it, and boom you’re good to go.”
As Radar previously reported, Giudice turned himself into Fort Dix on in March 2016 to serve his 41-month sentence for fraud. /n
