Steven Avery's Brother Exposes Shocking Details On Teresa Halbach Murder/n
As fans of the Making A Murderer documentary try to uncover new clues to exonerate Steven Avery, the convicted killer’s younger brother Earl shared that he also believes Steven to be innocent.
In a first-ever interview with Access Hollywood, Earl discussed his doubts over Steven’s guilt, revealing new details from the night of Teresa Halbach‘s 2005 murder that could turn things around in the recently reopened case.
“If somebody’s gonna slice somebody’s throat, you know, there’s gonna be blood – something,” Earl told AH‘s Stephanie Bauer. “And they say they cleaned up in the garage, but there’s all dust and everything all over everything. How do you clean up and then put the dust back?”

Earl also revealed a shocking new piece to the puzzle: he drove by the alleged murder scene the night of Halbach’s killing and didn’t find anything suspicious.
“We drove right through [where] that car was supposed to be,” he added. “It wasn’t there that night of the 31st. We were rabbit hunting.”
Though Earl informed authorities of his telling drive-by at the time, Steven’s brother said no one ever used it in the case.
