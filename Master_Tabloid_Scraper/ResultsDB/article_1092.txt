The Wanted -- Life Has Changed ... Bye Bye Limos and Screaming Groupies /nThis is gonna hurt a little for The Wanted and their fans -- visual proof the lads are definitely not living it up ... 2012 style anymore. First up, Max George ... who left LAX Monday with his smoking hot GF Carrie Baker -- an Oklahoma beauty queen. Max gave us his take on life in OK ... and then took off in a very, um ... low profile vehicle. You gotta see it. As for the rest of the group -- we got Siva Kaneswaran and Jay McGuiness too at LAX ... as they lined up to grab a yellow cab. No limo. Not even an Uber.The times ... they have changed.On a positive note: Max's chick is really hot. So ... he's still got that going for him./n
