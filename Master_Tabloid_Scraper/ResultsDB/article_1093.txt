Harrison Ford -- Han NOT Solo ... But Piloting Plane Again  (PHOTO)/nHarrison Ford hopped in an airplane cockpit NOT built for World War II, and ended up flying -- and, more importantly, landing -- safely in L.A. this weekend.  This was the first time Ford was spotted flying a small plane since he crashed on a golf course back in March. This weekend's plane had room for a co-pilot, and Harrison had one with him ... better safe than sorry.  He also made a surprise appearance at Comic-Con on Saturday ... showing he's physically healed from the crash. #FlyBoyForLife/n
