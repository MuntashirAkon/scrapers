Mindy Kaling is already halfway through her pregnancy.

The actress — who made her first public appearance since the pregnancy news broke at the Summer TCA Tour to The Mindy Project this week — is five months pregnant, according to Oprah Winfrey. the 38-year-old spilled the beans about how far along she is when she was promoting A Wrinkle in Time at Disney’s D23 expo earlier this month.
“That’s when she told me. My mouth dropped,” Oprah told People. ” ‘What did you just say?’ she said, ‘Oh, Oprah, I don’t think you know. I’m 5 months pregnant.’ And I said, ‘WHAAAAT?!’”

The former talk show host added her castmate was totally casual about the pregnancy, “That was it, and we just kept smiling. And then I said to [Reese Witherspoon], ‘Did you know?’ and she said, ‘I just found out, too.’ And then I said to [director Ava DuVernay], ‘Did you know?’ And she said, ‘I just found out.’”
Oprah added, “I’m excited for her.”
