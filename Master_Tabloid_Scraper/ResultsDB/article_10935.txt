MySpace Befriends "Earl"/n
        In real life, you probably don't want to be friends with a guy who once stole a car from a one-legged girl and faked his death in order to break up with someone. But virtual social networking is another story.                NBC and 20th Century Fox TV announced Thursday that they have partnered with MySpace.com for a contest that will turn three regular folks into bona fide friends of Earl, the charmingly apologetic redneck bad-boy played by Jason Lee on My Name Is Earl.                 Beginning Aug. 10, MySpace members can submit their photos via a My Name Is Earl profile page, with three pictures ultimately being chosen to appear during the credits of a second-season episode of NBC's top-rated sitcom under the heading "Friends of Earl."                 At the end of every episode this past season, production credits concluded with a section called "Amigos de Garcia," referring to the name of series creator Greg Garcia's production company and featuring Garcia's own buddies.                "Every friend's picture I put at the end of the show has, in one way or another, helped me to get to where I am today," Garcia said in a statement. "That's why I was excited about the idea of putting three My Name Is Earl fans in my logo, because without the fans, we're nothing."                More than 10.8 million fans a week checked in with their ol' pal Earl last season, per Nielsen Media Research, making the comedy not only way more than nothing but also NBC's only freshman series besides Deal or No Deal to get picked up for a second season.                The first Friends of Earl winner will get his or her moment of fame on the show's season premiere Sept. 21, with the next two winning pics set to run Sept. 28 and Oct. 5.                "This partnership offers Earl fans in the MySpace community a chance to interact with the show," John Miller, chief marketing officer of NBC Universal Television Group, said in a statement. "This promotion will generate excitement and discussion online and of course, for fans of My Name Is Earl, it's a chance to actually be a part of the show and its unique 'Amigos de Garcia' trademark."                The News Corp.-owned MySpace.com, already a refuge for millions of people's oddball pictures, philosophical musings and artistic output, also recently became a home to free episodes of 24 as part of Fox's expansion into online programming.          My Name Is Earl's MySpace profile page will also offer Early merchandise like cell phone wallpaper, as well as sneak previews of the upcoming first-season DVD set and a fan forum. And, of course, MySpace users can add Earl to the list of friends on their homepages, as well.                 NBC will start airing 20-second promos for the Friends of Earl contest during My Name Is Earl repeats this month.
