Hot cheerleader alert!Inside sources confirm to me exclusively that Jenna Elfman (of Dharma and Greg and über-tall fame) is shooting a guest spot on My Name Is Earl this very minute over on the NBC comedy's set in Encino. She's playing a cheer-academy coach in the first episode being shot for the upcoming fourth season.So what does the new glamazon in town mean for our boy Earl's love life? Read on to find out!

According to sources, Jenna is only contracted to appear in one episode, so we  can assume Earl will only be tangling with the first Mrs. Earl Hickey (Jaime Pressly) and the second (Alyssa Milano) for now.I'm also told that Jenna's character will have a flashback to her younger cheerleader days, when she was "crazy hot," and the whole episode revolves around a cheer squad and their pom-pom shaking. So, fellas, set your DVR's and try not to drool, OK? It's bad for your karma.Post your thoughts on this casting news below...
