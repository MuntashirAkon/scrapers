Harrison Ford at Comic-Con -- Trust Me Guys ... I Can Still Fly the Millennium Falcon (PHOTO)/nIf there are 2 things Harrison Ford knows how to do ... it's landing planes, and making entrances -- he did one of those to enormous applause at Comic-Con. Harrison got back together with his 'Star Wars' cohorts Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamil Friday evening in San Diego, and it was just like old times ... except they're all much older.Â  This was 72-year-old Harrison's first public appearance since the crash landing in March ... and he looks to be in great shape. By the way -- freakin' nameplates on the table? If you don't know ... don't go./n
