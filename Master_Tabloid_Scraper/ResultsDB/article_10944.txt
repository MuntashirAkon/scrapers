I love my TV icons. Which is why it makes me a wee bit giddy that two TV staples of yesterseason are coming to two fan favorites this TV season.According to inside sources, Marlo Thomas will be heading to Ugly Betty this season, guest starring as an advertising bigwig who has a thang for younger men. And you'll never guess which younger man catches her eye—or, okay, actually, it's probably completely obvious—one Mr. Daniel Meade, aka Eric Mabius. Nice to see dear Danny boy on the other side of a May-December relationship for once, doncha think? Meanwhile, in the land of Earl, you may remember that May's season finale ended with Mr. Hickey headed for some hard time behind bars. Well, according to insiders close to the show, Craig T. Nelson—you know, Coach!—is joining the cast of My Name Is Earl to play the warden at Camden County Jail, where Earl is spending time. But he’s no Henry Pope of Prison Break—he’s more into videogames than mind games. We'll also meet his wife, who just happens to be the governor.Can we just start the new season already? Please? Which reminds me, stand by for scoop and premiere dates for the new season later this week...—Additional reporting by Korbi Ghosh
