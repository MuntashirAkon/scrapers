Paris -- Poster Girl for Mentally Challenged?!/nNow that Paris has first-hand experience on how it feels to be in jail while suffering from a  "severe " psychological illness, activists are challenging the infamous inmate to be a poster girl for all of the mentally ill in jail. That's crazy hot! Earl Ofari Hutchinson, President of L.A.'s Urban Policy Roundtable, wrote a letter to Paris asking her to  "use her star power to champion the rights of mentally challenged inmates, " emphasizing that it would  "send a positive message that the rich and famous also care about the plight of the poor and underserved in the L.A. County Jail. " The organization tried to deliver the letter to Paris, but guards wouldn't accept it. That didn't discourage Hutchinson, who said they are trying to set up a meeting with Kathy Hilton to request Paris' help./n
