 Maci Bookout’s Money Hell: ‘Teen Mom’s Father Arrested For Writing Bad Checks In.../n
Other than the occasional social media cameo, Maci Bookout‘s parents have largely remained out of the spotlight since their daughter rose to fame on 16 & Pregnant and later, Teen Mom OG.
And now, RadarOnline.com has learned there may be a reason the 25-year-old mother of three has kept her family off-camera. The reality star’s father, Billy Eugene Bookout, was arrested for writing worthless checks on 2012, Radar can exclusively reveal.
According to Tennessee’s Hamilton County Court documents, the 45-year-old was accused of passing a bad $668.74 check to a car company for auto parts.

The Hamilton County Sheriff’s Department issued a warrant for his arrest, and Billy turned himself in on February 29, 2012, three years after Maci made her MTV debut.
Radar has obtained the father of two’s mug shot.

Thankfully for the Bookouts, the case was dismissed in April of that year after Billy paid $949.74 in fees.
As Radar previously reported, Maci has had money troubles of her own. She was slapped with a federal lien for nearly $80,000 in unpaid taxes from 2011.

The star finally paid up last summer.
In her memoir Bulletproof, Maci said she got the “sh*t end of the deal” by finding fame and not fortune in reality TV.
“The fact is, my real life isn’t that much different from what it would have been without MTV,” she wrote. “I still live in Chattanooga and go to Wal-Mart and buy bread and milk.” /n
