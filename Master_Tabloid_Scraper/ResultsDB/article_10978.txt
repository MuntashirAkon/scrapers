Bindi Irwin's Shame: Ongoing Family Feud With Grandfather & Cousin/n
Bindi Irwin may have won this past season of Dancing with the Stars, but RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned that not all of her family members may be celebrating with her.
Radar can report that Irwin, 17, is on the outs with both her grandfather and one of her cousins.
The feud with Bindi’s grandfather erupted after her Crocodile Hunter father Steve was killed by a stingray.

Bindi’s mother Terri, 51, began to fight with Steve’s father Bob Irwin, 76, over how to run the family business, the Australian Zoo.
In 2008, Bob quit his job amid speculation that Terri had blacklisted him from the zoo — and now, Radar can report that Bindi has been estranged from Bob for a while.
“Bindi and her younger brother Robert haven’t spoken to their grandfather in years,” the source said.

But Bob isn’t the only individual Bindi cut ties with — she also is jaded about her cousin William Wilgus.
Wilgus was arrested for misdemeanor assault in 2008 and sentenced to road crew work in Eugene, Oregon, completing a seven-day court sentence later in 2009.
The 32-year-old cousin also got busted in 2001 for a fish and game license violation.

“It’s a black cloud hanging over Bindi and her family,” the source said. “Bindi broke down in tears when she won the show competition and paid homage to the memory of her dad, but she was hiding a lot of shame within her family.” /n
