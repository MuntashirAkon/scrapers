 'Teen Mom' Shocker! Leah Messer's Family Expecting Another Baby, Little Sister Victoria.../n
Another one?!
Teen Mom 2 star Leah Messer, the mother of 5-year-old twins Ali and Aleeah and 2-year-old Adalynn, is expecting a new baby in her family, RadarOnline.com can exclusively reveal.
But fortunately for the troubled 23-year-old, who also helps care for boyfriend T.R. Dues‘ two young sons, it’s her sister who will be making the big delivery.
Messer’s little sister Victoria Jones, 21, announced her pregnancy on Facebook late last week.

“Looks like I’m gonna be a Mommy!” she posted. “I’ve waited so long for this, I’m glad I get to share this with my husband.”

Jones, who married husband Brian in April, also posted a photo of her positive pregnancy test and revealed her unborn child’s name options.
“Adrianna Jean Jones or Joshua Eugene Jones,” she gushed.

But mom-of-three Messer thought her sis, who said she just found out she was pregnant the day prior, was jumping the gun.
“Stop it you have plenty of time to name this kid,” the reality star wrote.
“HUSH,” the girls’ mother, Dawn Spears, responded.

Jones makes frequent cameos on Teen Mom 2, especially in recent episodes as Messer receives treatment in an out-of-state rehab.
In real time, the MTV queen completed treatment for what she claims was an anxiety and depression issue (but what sources tell Radar was a prescription painkiller problem), and is now living with her daughters and boyfriend Dues, 32, in a new Charleston, West Virginia, home. /n
