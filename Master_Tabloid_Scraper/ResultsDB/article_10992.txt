 Sound Familiar Rihanna & Chris Brown? Law & Order: SVU To Tackle Tale of Pop Starlet.../n
Stop if you’ve heard this one before: A stunning pop star (who answers to a single name) takes beating after beating from her also-famous boyfriend (whose initials are C.B.), but remains loyal to him in spite of the violence.
Yes, Law & Order: Special Victims Unit is living up to its “ripped-from-the-headlines” reputation again, as next week’s episode, titled My Funny Valentine, has Detective Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay) handling the case of Joi (Starshell Menzies), who remains committed to Caleb Bryant (Eugene Jones).

“What he did to you is despicable,” Benson tells Joi, before informing her cop colleagues that “Caleb has a hold on her” and “going against him feels impossible.”

Of course, there’s too many coincidences to ignore the underlying Rihanna / Chris Brown theme this episode has written all over it — lavish red carpets, bulldog defense attorneys, brutal evidence photos — though in Dick Wolf‘s world, the character modeled after Brown appears to meet a grislier fate than his real-life counterpart, who is back together with the Barbadian beauty after four turmoil-drenched years.

Other real-life stories that have inspired the muses of Law & Order writers include: the Michael Jackson molestation allegations; the accusations against French politician Dominique Strauss-Kahn; and expanded reality TV families.
Rocker Dave Navarro and talk show host Wendy Williams make specials cameos in the episode, which airs Wednesday at 9/8c. /n
