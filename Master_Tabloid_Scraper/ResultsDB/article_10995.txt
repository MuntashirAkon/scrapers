Donald Trump Drags Youngest Son Barron Into Russia Collusion Drama By Making THIS Distasteful Joke!/n

Donald Trump is unlikely to win Father of the Year in 2017.
Why?? Well, mainly, because the president just dragged his 11-year-old son, Barron, into the Russia collusion drama. On Tuesday, the Commander-In-Chief took to Twitter to praise his son-in-law Jared Kushner following the businessman turned political adviser's closed door meeting with Senate staffers tasked with investigating Russia's possible involvement with the 2016 election.

The Trumpster made light of the situation by teasing that his youngest would be the next victim in the supposed "witch hunt." The Celebrity Apprentice alum wrote: 

Jared Kushner did very well yesterday in proving he did not collude with the Russians. Witch Hunt. Next up, 11 year old Barron Trump!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 25, 2017
(In case you forgot, Kushner — along with Donald Trump Jr. and Paul Manafort — was summoned to give a testimony before the US Senate Judiciary Committee over a meeting with a Russian lawyer who promised dirt on Hillary Clinton.)
Unsurprisingly, many people felt uncomfortable with Trump politicizing his youngster, something the politician has previously attacked the "fake" media for. It didn't take long before followers started hitting back at the controversial president's quip.

Did you seriously use your 11-year-old son, Barron Trump, as a political shield?
You are the biggest f'ing coward.#TuesdayThoughts pic.twitter.com/wswdoBTsM7

Exploiting his 11 year old son Barron Trump for politics is reprehensible. How dare he.

Keep in mind that Trump dragged his son into the corruption conversation. Nobody else did that. "Barron Trump"

& bizarrely, in your own attempts to be funny, you've dragged your 11-year-old son into the mix as a crutch for your woeful sense of humour.

This, after you criticised others in the media for 'hurting Barron's feelings'. Now you're using him for shits and giggles. You're unstable.

Are you trying to get people to attack your youngest son so that you can shriek about it later?

Sad when you have to tell a man to leave his 11-y-o son out of politics. pic.twitter.com/j7K6xR8YLh

The President of the United States🇺🇸 using his 11 year old son Barron Trump for a selfish political rant is SHAMEFUL!😱How LOW will you go!?🤯

Two things:
1) Grammatically, it should be "11-year-old" Barron Trump.
2) Leave your 11-year-old son out of this!

Trump exploits his own son Barron Trump to defend Russia collusion. No line @POTUS won't cross. Sick! #morningjoe https://t.co/ITNxmNKteT
