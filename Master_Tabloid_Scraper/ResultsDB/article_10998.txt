America's Got Talent Champ Arrested For Allegedly Attacking Girlfriend With A Golf Club — But He Claims It Was Self-Defense!/n

An American's Got Talent champion was arrested earlier this week after allegedly attacking his girlfriend with a golf club.
Law enforcement sources tell TMZ that Landau Eugene Murphy Jr., who won Season 6 of the talent competition, was arrested Monday night in Whitman, West Virginia for misdemeanor domestic battery and domestic assault.
The dispute reportedly began when Murphy told his girlfriend he was leaving her, which prompted an explosive argument about who would take care of their 6-month-old baby.

That's when things got violent — Murphy allegedly started slapping her and then struck her under her left eye with a golf club. The fight then went outside, where he allegedly slammed her head on the sidewalk.
Murphy's baby mama was treated at a hospital and the singer was later arrested, then released the same night on a $3,500 bond.
However, the AGT champ says a completely different version of events actually went down. His manager claims the fight started when Murphy came home and found his home trashed, allegedly by the girlfriend.
The manager alleges the girlfriend destroyed the house with a golf club, then attacked the performer with the club and a knife. Murphy says he was only defending himself from the attack, and has apologized for the incident.
Wow. Hopefully, we'll find out where the truth lies following a police investigation.
