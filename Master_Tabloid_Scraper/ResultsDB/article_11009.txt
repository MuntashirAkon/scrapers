Snoop Dogg Sues Pabst: You Owe Me/n
It’s Snoop Dogg vs. Pabst: The rapper sued the brewing company yesterday, claiming the beer-maker owes him a portion of its proceeds from the company’s sale last year.

The breach-of-contract lawsuit seeks 10% of the net sales price paid to Pabst for its Colt 45 malt beer line, which was included in last year’s sale to beer entrepreneur Eugene Kashper and an investment firm.
