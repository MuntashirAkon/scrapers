WATCH: Brittany Murphy Gets Intense in Final Role for ‘Something Wicked’/n
Brittany Murphy’s last role is finally hitting the silver screen.
The actress, who died in 2009 from pneumonia, anemia and multiple drug intoxication, had completed one last role before her death.  Now, four years later, it’s a chilling sensation to watch her come to life again in Something Wicked.

Murphy will have the hair on the back of your neck standing straight up as she delivers an intense performance in the trailer for her last film, which was just released today.
The film is described as a “hauntingly seductive thriller about obsession and young love gone wrong.”  It will hit theaters April 4th in Eugene, Ore., at the Regal Valley River Center 15–the location where the psychological thrilled was filmed in 2009.  It will continue rolling out in Regal Cinemas across Portland and Seattle throughout the month.
The film’s Facebook account released a statement saying, “The better we do in theaters, the more cities will be added so we need your help getting the word out.  Full press release to be posted shortly.  Stay wicked!”
Something Wicked also stars One Tree Hill’s Shantel VanSanten and Pretty Little Liars’ Julian Morris.
