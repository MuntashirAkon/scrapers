In a statement to E! News, Murphy said the woman was his girlfriend and claimed she attacked him with a golf club and knife after they got into a "heated argument." He alleged the woman invited friends and family over to their house and "trashed" it, inciting the argument. "In defending myself, she obtained some bruises and swelling on her face," he said in the statement. "I did not strike her." According to the complaint, Murphy and the woman have a 6-month-old child, who was in the house at the time of the incident. "I was raised to respect women, and if not provoked and feeling I was in danger, I would never have defended myself in this manner," he added in the statement. "I am very sorry for the way domestic incident was handled. I apologize to my fans everywhere and to the people of Logan County and West Virginia for this incident. It should never have happened."

Murphy Jr. rose to fame six years ago as a 36-year-old car washer who went on to win the sixth season of America's Got Talent. (E! and NBC are both part of the NBCUniversal family.)
