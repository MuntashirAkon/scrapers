Baltimore Ravens Star Anquan Boldin -- My Agent Screwed Me Out of $229,000/nBaltimore Ravens star Anquan Boldin claims his agent -- the man he trusted with his career -- swindled him out of $220,000 ... and now, it looks like he'll never get his money back.Boldin filed a lawsuit against Darrell Eugene Wills in Florida bankruptcy court, claiming Darrell asked to borrow $170,000 to start a sports management agency in 2004 ... and never paid him back.Anquan claims he supplied the loan on the condition that Darrell repay him with interest -- and reduce his agency fee -- but the venture failed ... and Darrell filed for bankruptcy.Â Boldin sued Wills soon after to get his money back -- but a bankruptcy judge ruled that Darrell was such a financial wreck, he didn't have to repay his debts ... meaning Boldin is SOL.Calls to both parties were not returned./n
