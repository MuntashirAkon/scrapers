Izzo is suing for invasion of privacy and for the unauthorized use of his likeness and image.As for today's ruling, LaVergne said the judge decided the DVD could be released because Izzo's face is blurred out during the altercation and they were unable to prove the clip caused Izzo harm.The fight continues on March 5, when they're due back in court.
