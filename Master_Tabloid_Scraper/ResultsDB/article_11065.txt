Destined To Fail! Amber & Johnny Had 'Cracks In The Relationship' From The Start/n
Johnny Depp and Amber Heard had been married just under 16 months when Heard filed for divorce.
According to one source close to Heard, the actress took some convincing before becoming Mrs. Depp. “It took Amber a long time to say yes,” the source claimed. “Johnny had asked her many times, and she kept saying no.”
She finally agreed over the 2014 holiday season, but the insider claimed, “She was never fully in it from the beginning.” And soon, sources said, it became obvious to those around the couple.

“Cracks in the relationship became apparent early on,” another source close to the couple told Radar.
“It just didn’t seem like Amber’s heart was in it for the right reasons. When she met him, it seemed like she had an agenda,” the source claimed.
According to the insider, people in Depp’s inner circle were concerned she was using him “to further her own career and social standing.”

“Amber never wanted to spend time with him. She chose to hang out with her hipper and younger friends and would leave him alone for days on end. Of course this would bother him.”
As Radar reported, the couple were last photographed together on April 19, more than a month before Heard filed on May 22.
Depp did not accompany Heard to the Met gala in New York earlier this month. Instead, she appeared on the arm of hunky Ralph Lauren PR guru Kimball Hastings, 37.
