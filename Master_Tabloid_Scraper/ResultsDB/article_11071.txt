 Can't Keep 'Em Apart! Emma Stone Together Again With Boyfriend Andrew Garfield​ -- First.../n
Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone announced weeks ago that they were taking time apart after being together for three years. But it seems as though these love birds just can’t keep away from each other!
Us Weekly reports that the couple was spotted emerging from Ralph’s Supermarket in Malibu yesterday. Stone and Garfield had a basket full of groceries, and no doubt, plans to spend quality time together over the holiday weekend since Garfield has recently returned from Taiwan where he was shooting a film. This news comes just days after a source reported seeing the couple sharing a meal together in Malibu.
