Kanye Skips Kardashian Family Thanksgiving Dinner/n
On Thanksgiving, Kim Kardashian tweeted that she was “so thankful to have spent the day with my whole family.” But it seems a very important part of the family was missing: her husband!
Kanye West spent the holiday in France instead. According to Page Six, the rapper was spotted dining at Ralph Lauren’s restaurant in Paris with two male friends Thursday.
As RadarOnline.com has reported, tensions are running high between the couple who sources say have lost that loving feeling. “Kim and Kanye are arguing more than ever. Kim feels like their relationship is more of a business relationship than a real marriage.”

Kim attended a holiday feast at her sister Khloe Kardashian‘s house. “Thank you for starting a new tradition Khlo! Thanksgiving at Koko’s,” Kim tweeted.

Oddly enough though, none of the Kardashian klan tweeted photos of themselves at the dinner. The only photos of the dinner party posted were of food and the table setting.





 My very first dinner party at my house and I couldn't be more thrilled!!!! I couldn't have done it without the incredibly talented @jeffleatham!! You are a flower legend to say the least. #HappyThanksgiving So beyond blessed
