 Outrage! Imprisoned Fraudster Bernie Madoff’s Wife Ruth Spends Thousands On Designer.../n
Nearly six years after Ponzi scheme swindler Bernie Madoff ripped his thousands of victims including Kevin Bacon out of $65 billion dollars, his wife, Ruth Alpern Madoff, is living the good life in a $1.5 million Old Greenwich, Connecticut, mansion, The National ENQUIRER can reveal.
While her husband serves a 150-year prison sentence, the 73-year-old has been spotted around town buying designer clothing, high-end cosmetics and expensive wine.
“Instead of moving modestly and paying some sort of restitution, Ruth doesn’t seem to be feeling any financial pain whatsoever!” a local socialite told The ENQUIRER.

The couple’s other son, Mark, committed suicide at 46 in December 2010.
Ruth has denied knowing her husband’s financial business was a total scam.
“I trusted him — ‘Why would it ever occur to me that it wasn’t legal?” she said. “The business was — his reputation was almost legendary. Why would I ever think that there was something sinister going on?”
