 Is Nick Cannon’s New Girl A Copycat? Jasmine Sanders Posts Modeling Pic That Looks Just.../n
They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery!
Nick Cannon’s reported new love interest, 23-year-old model Jasmine Sanders, posted a beautiful beach photo in July that looks strikingly similar to his estranged wife Mariah Carey’s latest album cover.

In a nude one-piece swimsuit with crochet details, the Ralph Lauren stunner, who calls herself “Golden Barbie,” stands in front of a vivid sunset on the sand- just like Carey, 44, on her Me. I Am Mariah…The Elusive Chanteuse cover, which was revealed in May.

Cannon, who confirmed rumors that he has been living separately from his wife of six years on August 21, reportedly cozied up to Sanders at an event in Malibu in July.

And according to Star magazine, the America’s Got Talent host, 33, is so taken with the beauty, he has been paying the rent on her Los Angeles apartment.
As RadarOnline.com previously reported, the pair parted ways over Cannon’s flirting and Mariah’s jealousy.
“Mariah thinks that when Nick travels that he cheats on her,” a source said last week. “Mariah is super jealous.”
The former lovebirds are parents to 3-year-old twins Moroccan and Monroe.
