The source says: 

"They started seeing each other while they were filming Spider-Man… They've been super careful to keep it private and out of the public eye but they've gone on vacations with each other and try and spend as much time as possible with one another."
Well, their chemistry in the flick was DYNAMITE!
Apparently, the two have similar personalities when it comes to their work ethic, and their sense of humor.

"They're both really ambitious and they challenge each other — but, most importantly, they make each other crack up. They seem to have a really similar sense of humor and love joking around together. They have great banter back and forth."
If you're keeping score, Tom and Z aren't the only two who began dating while starring in the Spider-Man franchise. Sparks flew (and eventually died out) for both Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst, and Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone.
Peter Parker and MJ are for real, y'all!
