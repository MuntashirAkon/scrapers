Well, it’s official: Kourtney Kardashian’s son sleeps in a better bed than us.

The reality star recently opened up the doors to her multi-million dollar home, giving subscribers to her app an inside look at her eldest son Mason Disick’s bedroom. Like little sister Penelope’s room, the 7-year-old’s personal quarters is completely decked out with the coolest furniture and designs.
“As kids get older, it’s fun for their rooms to change as their interests do. Right now, Mason is really into Star Wars, so he and I created a room filled with glow-in-the-dark elements and lots of star motifs,” Kardashian wrote. “[Interior designer] Martyn Lawrence Bullard showed me this amazing constellation wallpaper from Ralph Lauren, which Mason and I loved. We covered the ceiling in it, as well as the space under each of the bunkbeds so you can see it when you’re falling asleep!”

According to Kardashian, Mason’s room also features two — yes, two! — sets of Restoration Hardware bunk beds at $1,999 each, a $964 light fixture, a $2,949 chair, and an $899 tree-shaped bookcase in the room’s reading nook.
“Kids love small spaces, so this zone has oversized pillows and a sheepskin rug—it’s cozy and fun to climb in and out of,” Kardashian shared. “We finished the room with a large custom pin board to holds all of Mason’s patches, artwork from school and family photos.”
