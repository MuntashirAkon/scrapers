Today, Jan. 20, 2017, was the polarizing inauguration of the 45th President of the United States, Donald J. Trump.

It was rainy, gray day in Washington D.C. as an estimated 700,000 to 900,000 people descended upon the Capitol and the National Mall — a smaller turnout in comparison to Barack Obama’s inauguration, which drew 1 million people. The Washington transit agency even compared travel rates between the inaugurations of Trump, Obama, and George W. Bush.


Metro Ridership: As of 11am, 193k trips taken so far today. (11am 1/20/13 = 317k, 11am 1/20/09 = 513k, 11am 1/20/05 = 197k) #wmata

Vendors of Trump merchandise told USA Today that they had only sold six items as they entered their second hour of selling memorabilia a few blocks away from the White House.
“It’s been real slow,’’ said vendor Karone Williams, who said that she sold more during Obama’s inauguration, the 1995 Million Man March, and its reunion. “We’re just trying to make a few pennies.”
