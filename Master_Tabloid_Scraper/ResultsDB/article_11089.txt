When Kaley Cuoco wore a low-plunging dress to the 2017 Golden Globes, she couldn’t help but to make a play on words and joke about her boobs.

Before stepping out in a revealing Tommy Hilfiger dress this Sunday, the Big Bang Theory star called attention to her ample cleavage in a cheeky photo. Posing with her boyfriend, Karl Cook, and her glam squad, Cuoco playfully captioned the shot, “Heading to the Golden Globes with my golden globes.”

In another photo, Cuoco wrote, “✨💫⚡️globes indeed.”
The 31-year-old turned heads when she hit the red carpet with Cook at Warner Bros. Pictures and InStyle’s after-party. Cuoco was all smiles as she happily posed for pictures with Cook, who was wearing Ralph Lauren for the night.
