As strange as it is typing these words, First-Lady-to-be Melania Trump took the victory stage with her president-elect husband, Donald Trump, on Tuesday night (Nov. 8, 2016), wearing a very familiar white jumpsuit and leading many to believe she was taking a jab at Hillary Clinton’s go-to look.
According to the L.A. Times, Trump wore a Ralph Lauren ensemble, a ruffled, one-shoulder jumpsuit with an asymmetrical ruffled overlay and also chose the color white, which has historically been a symbol of women’s suffrage.

Is Melania that calculating? Probably not. The whole day was spent with Clinton supporters tweeting at the hashtags #pantsuitnation, #pantsuitstothepolls and #WearWhitetoVote, so Trump might have just been following suit, so to speak, to show, you know, she’s a hip American. Good luck with that.
Launch the gallery above for a look at Melania’s style evolution over the years.
