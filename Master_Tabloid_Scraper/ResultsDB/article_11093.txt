Kendall Jenner and Bella Hadid killed it on the Ralph Lauren NYFW runway, proving everyone who doesn’t think they’re real models wrong.
Following Stephanie Seymour and Rebecca Romijn’s comments earlier this year, Jenner and Hadid made it clear that they’re not “b–ches of the moment.” Despite taking a little tumble during the Michael Kors show on Wednesday (Sept. 14, 2016), Gigi’s sister put on her fiercest face as she strutted her stuff for Ralph Lauren.

She rocked a sheer long-sleeved gown with a chunky necklace, while Jenner walked in a black leather jacket worn over an unbuttoned white shirt.
The two also had a star-studded audience, including Rosie Huntington, Jessica Alba, and even Julianne Moore, who was joined by her 14-year-old daughter Liv.
