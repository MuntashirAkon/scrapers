According to a source with People, Ryan Lochte is in negotiations to join ABC’s series Dancing with the Stars for their upcoming 23rd season.

This new development comes just days after news broke that the gold medal-winner had lost his Speedo USA and Ralph Lauren sponsorships in the aftermath of the Olympic scandal.
“I’ve been thinking about it a lot, because I have a big heart, and I feel like let down a lot of people. I feel bad that I have let people down,” Lochte told People. “Everyone started watching it, and they didn’t watch the athletes. That’s another reason why I’m so hurt by it, because it took away from the games.”
Although the new season hasn’t been announced yet, the insider claims that Lochte is at the top of their wish list.
