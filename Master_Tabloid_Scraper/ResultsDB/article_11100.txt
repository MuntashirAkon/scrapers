All those in favor say “neigh.”
It’s good to be one of Ignacio “Nacho” Figueras’ prized ponies. The international polo star, who has been the face of Ralph Lauren’s Black Label line since 2005, recently constructed a remarkable, modernist home and stable outside Buenos Aires for his talented equines.

“We wanted to create a place that was practical, yet as inspiring as an art museum,” Figueras tells Architectural Digest in their May issue. (The cover story’s writer Derek Blasberg points out that the horses “can fetch prices similar to Old Master paintings.”)

The 38,000-square-foot facility, designed by architect Juan Ignacio Ramos, features a grass-covered roof where the 44 horses who reside there can graze — and where Figueras occasionally does, too. “My favorite thing to do is sit on the stable roof at sunset with my friends and a bottle of wine,” he says. “The staircase is like a sculpture, and when you’re there you forget you’re anywhere else.”
