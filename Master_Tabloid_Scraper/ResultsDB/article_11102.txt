Karate Kid's Ralph Macchio and William Zabka are reuniting for a new TV series, Cobra Kai, a half-hour serialized show coming to YouTube Red in 2018. YouTube announced the "true continuation" of the Karate Kid saga at the 2017 TCA summer press tour.Josh Heald, Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg are re-imagining the classic rivalry."The minute I heard about this project, I knew we had to have it. The Karate Kid became an instant classic in the 1980s, and still resonates with audiences around the world and on YouTube today," Susanne Daniels, global head of original content at YouTube, said in a statement. "We're thrilled to partner with Sony TV, Overbrook and the talented writing team led by Josh Heald, Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg to add a fresh, new comedic twist on one of Hollywood's most storied rivalries."

The first season is 10 episodes.Cobra Kai takes place 30 years after the events of the 1984 All Valley Karate Tournament and finds Johnny Lawrence (Zabka) on the hunt for redemption by reopening the infamous Cobra Kai karate dojo. This reignites his old rivalry with the successful Daniel LaRusso (Macchio), who has been working to maintain the balance in his life without mentor Mr. Miyagi.

In a release, YouTube said the show is about "two men addressing past demons and present frustrations the only way they know how: through karate."Are you excited to see the world of Karate Kid again?
