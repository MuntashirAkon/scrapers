Lupita dishes on how she observed Fiennes' preparation for the role and noticed he is a "very still man on set.""I'd try to make chitchat, asking, 'What's your favorite film? Of all the films you've been in, which have you enjoyed the most?' He was so polite, and he responded to me. At one point, though, he just said, 'Lupita, give me my space.'"
