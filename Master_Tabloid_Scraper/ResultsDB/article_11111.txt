Ralph Lauren

"I feel like my style is very much androgynous. It's rock, chic, like casual wear, but then on the flip side to that, being that it's so androgynous, it'll either be skinny jeans and a leather jacket, or if I'm doing a red carpet or event, I'll completely flip that and be wearing a suit or a dress," she told PeopleStyle, who first shared the photos."But I have a very eclectic style—for me, it's about how I feel in that moment and what's going to make me comfortable and happy and bring out whatever I'm feeling internally and externally. Because fashion essentially is art, and as an artist and someone who is also a musician and an artist in regards to drawing and painting, anything I can do that expresses my feelings is something I'm really drawn to. So [my style] changes a lot, but generally it is on the rocky, androgynous, chic side."
