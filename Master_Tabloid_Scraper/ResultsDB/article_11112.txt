America's Olympic Sweater and The Great Muses of Ralph Lauren Like us, you're probably asking yourself, "Where exactly did Ralph Lauren draw his inspiration?" Lucky for us, an exclusive source led us to his muses.  1. A C.../n
The uniforms for the opening ceremony of the Olympics are meant to exude national pride, the spirit of the game, and celebrate the heart of a tradition that can be traced back to 776 BC. Designer Ralph Lauren knew that he could create a look for United States athletes to wear on that very night...one that will surely be remembered for years to come.
