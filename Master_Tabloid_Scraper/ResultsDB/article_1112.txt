Mila Kunis' Episode Of Two And A Half Men Was FULL Of Inside Jokes With Ashton! Check Out The Best HERE!/n

Mila Kunis finally made her appearance on Two And A Half Men last night, and she and fiancé Ashton Kutcher seemed to have a ball!
The episode was filled with great in-jokes between the real-life couple, all about celebrity, their former roles, even their former luvahs!
All in all, it made for a classic moment in TV! Ch-ch-check out the highlights …AFTER THE JUMP!!!
On being named Vivian, Mila's character says:
"My parents got it from that '70s show… What was it called? Oh, Maude!"
On getting rained on, Mila says:
"It's just a little water. I'm not gonna melt. It's not like I'm the Wicked Witch of the West."
Finally, Ashton tells Mila (in character, wink wink):
"Before I met you, I was very close to asking another woman to marry me. But then I didn't, because I couldn't stop thinking about you."
Ouch! We hope Demi Moore doesn't watch CBS! Oh, but who can resist the lure of The Mentalist?? LOLz!
