Crow's Baby Finally Leaves the Nest/nIt didn't take long for Sheryl Crow to introduce her brand-new baby boy to the paparazzi -- less than 2 weeks! The adoptive rock star mom took son Wyatt shopping in the Cross Creek section of Malibu this weekend, leaving a gang of shutterbugs furiously snapping away. Sheryl bottlefed the kid in the middle of a Ralph Lauren store, accompanied by nanny-to-the-stars, Marva, who took care of Julia Roberts' twins. Sheryl recently told OK! Magazine that she wants to adopt again, but check out the bags under her eyes -- she might want to wait a while!/n
