The Simpsons Killing Off An Iconic Character This Season!  Get The Clues For Who It Will Be HERE!/n

After 25 seasons on television, someone is bound to die!
The Simpsons have already buried series regulars in the past, like Maude Flanders, Bleeding Gums Murphy and Snowballs I, II and III, just to name a few.  
Well, fans can expect to say farewell once again this season, as the show is promising to kill off another iconic character!
Producer Al Jean recently shared the series' plans to off just one of the hundreds of familiar faces seen on The Simpsons.  He wouldn't say WHO but he did offer up a hint!  
Al revealed: 
"I'll give you a clue that the actor playing the character won an Emmy for playing that character, but I won't say who it is."

D'oh!  
A lot of people have won Emmys for their performances on The Simpsons!  Eight people to be exact: Anne Hathaway (who knew?!), Dan Castellaneta, Hank Azaria, Nancy Cartwright, Julie Kavner, Yeardley Smith, Marcia Wallace and Kelsey Grammer.
Anne didn't voice a series regular and the next 5 names have several different characters to their credit.  But the last two are Mrs. Krabappel and Sideshow Bob!
Either one of those two characters would be a death NO ONE would have seen coming!
Guess we'll have to tune in to Season 25 to see who bites the dust!
