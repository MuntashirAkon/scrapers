Taylor Swift Blows The Mind Of Judd Apatow's Daughter!/n

Aww! 
We never would've thought that one of Taylor Swift's biggest fans would be the daughter of one of the world's most sardonic comics! 
But Judd Apatow's daughter Maude totally loves her some T-Swift and was able to snag some backstage time with the pop star after Swift's latest concert! 
Here's what Maude tweeted: 
Just went to @taylorswift13 concert. Words cannot express… Mind blown… Nicest person ever… Lovelovelove pic.twitter.com/rojvp7jBmo

Aww! This is is such a great picture!!! 
They both totally nailed that whole "Eh, no big thing" pose even though it totally is obviously a big deal for Maude. 
We'd love to see Taylor and Maude in a Judd Apatow movie together. 
Maybe it could be like Freaky Friday  where they switch bodies! 
Think about it!!!
