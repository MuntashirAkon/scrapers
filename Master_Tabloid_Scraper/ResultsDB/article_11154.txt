Pay Up! Jules Wainstein Claims Ex Owes $135K In Child Support/n
Jules Wainstein and her estranged husband Michael returned to divorce court this morning — and the hearing was nastier than ever!
RadarOnline.com can exclusively report that the former Real Housewives of New York star’s attorney claimed that her ex has refused to pay child support, maintenance and legal fees since the split, and has racked up a bill of $135,000.
Meanwhile, the lawyer alleged, Michael has been spending cash on his own lavish lifestyle!

“He comes up with money for his own purposes,” the lawyer told the judge in New York court. “He flies to Florida, he pays for his own expenses, dines out, threw a laser tag birthday party for his son at Chelsea Piers…When you say you don’t have money you should have priorities.”
Jules called for her ex to be held in contempt of court.
In rebuttal, Michael’s team claimed he only owed $34,000.
“He’s paid Con Ed, he’s had his mom pay for the kids’ summer camp, I would say the contempt is not clear,” his attorney argued. “I have a dispute with how it’s calculated. To me it’s not clear what he needs to be paying. He’s been in good faith. He paid $3,000 this week for child support.”

After eight years of marriage, they split last summer amid cheating accusations and brutal fighting.
