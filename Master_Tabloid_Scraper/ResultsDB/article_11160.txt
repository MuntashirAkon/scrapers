Witness Vanessa Aguirre said a man came in around 4.00 P.M. and "started to shoot" into the air. She told the Eastern New Mexico News: 

"It all happened so fast… We took off fast. My purse is still in there."
Clovis City Manager Tom Phelps told the newspaper the shooter was taken into custody "without incident." He also declined to identify the fatalities.
Kim Tipton, who was across the street in the American Classified building, saw police arrive a few minutes after 4:00.

"Their guns were drawn, AK-whatever they were, they were drawn."
Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims of this crime.
