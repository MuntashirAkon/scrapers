Caitlyn Jenner is under fire again for going against the LGBTQ community.

The 67-year-old Olympian, who announced her transition from man to woman in 2015, was called out by activist Ashlee Marie Preston during a heated face-to-face confrontation at the Trans Chorus event in Los Angeles over the weekend. Though Caitlyn previously insisted she did not support President Donald Trump’s decision to ban trans people from serving in the military, she was nonetheless ambushed and brutally blasted for helping the former real estate mogul for get elected into the Oval Office.
Via Wet Paint:
“It’s really f**ked up that you continue to support somebody…that does everything with the military, that’s erasing our f**king community,” Ashlee told the I Am Cait star on Saturday, August 26.
“And you support it.”
