What’s worse that running into an ex? Running into them while you’re out with your current boyfriend.

Kourtney Kardashian had a bit of an awkward moment Wednesday night when she took Younes Bendjima to Hillsong in Beverly Hills — a church her alleged former fling, Justin Bieber, also frequents as a member of its parish. Dressed casually in jean and a bomber jacket, the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star, 38, tried to avoid the “Sorry” singer, 23, while attending evening prayers with her beau.
The two, who hooked up with for a few months in 2015, had already run into each once during the Aug. 16 service in Hollywood, according to People.

Following mass, Kourtney and Younes, 24, made a quick exit from church. The pair were photographed leaving together in a black car with the mom-of-three behind the wheel.
Meanwhile, Justin left in a separate vehicle with his own entourage.
Earlier this year, Kourt and Biebs were spotted partying at The Peppermint Club in West Hollywood following a mutual friend’s birthday bash. Insiders at the time said the two were “just friends” and remained friendly during the encounter.
