Ed Sheeran made his Game of Thrones debut in the season seven premiere. The people of the internet had a lot of thoughts.The singer, who isn't the first musician to make a cameo on the series, appeared in a scene with Maisie Williams' Arya Stark, right after she did one of her most badass things (read all about that here). His appearance, which included singing, was done for Williams, a fan of Sheeran."For years, we tried to get Ed Sheeran on the show to surprise Maisie, and this year we finally did it," co-creator David Benioff said at a SXSW panel in March.

"Audibly groaned when Ed Sheeran came on screen in #GameOfThrones because it was entirely unnecessary and not subtle in the slightest," @Adam86Valentine tweeted.The cameo didn't turn everybody off. "Ed Sheeran already a top 5 GoT character," @sMILESw_ said."I was not ready for this... #GameOfThones.Â  This show never disappoints. @edsheeran #BestCameoEver," @MDG676 said.
