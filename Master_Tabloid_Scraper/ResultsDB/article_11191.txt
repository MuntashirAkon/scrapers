Behind-the-scenes, Sheeran and Ronan became good friends. He even asked the actress to write "Galway Girl" so he could have it tattooed on his body in her handwriting. Hilariously enough, she misspelled the title and now he has "Galway Grill" inked on his body.He debuted the tattoo, which is on his right forearm, during his concert in Glasgow, Scotland. "Thought I'd tell you that," he told the concert audience. "Haven't told anyone about that yet… I'm actually kind of proud of it. It's the kind of thing that I would do." 

At least he has a sense of humor about it!Watch the music video to see Saoirse Ronan shine.
