Taylor Swift’s ‘Mine’ Video: New Still/n
How do you possibly make a Taylor Swift video any sweeter? Throw in a little birthday cake—and an adorable four-year-old blowing out the candle.
A new still from Swift’s upcoming video for her single “Mine” has made its way onto the Internet, offering a potential clue as to the video’s plot. Do Swift and her video co-star, Covenant actor Toby Hemingway, have a baby in the video? Or do they just make it a habit to drop in at random children’s birthday parties, in a less-creepy variation on Harold and Maude?
The video, directed by Roman White in Kennebunk, Maine, will debut on CMT on August 27. The song, which is the first single from Swift’s forthcoming album Speak Now (out on October 25), was released on August 4.
