'Game of Thrones' Actor Liam Cunningham Possibly Spoils Davos' Destiny/n "Game of Thrones " actor Liam Cunningham has some potentially spoiler-filled advice about betting on his character to last on the show ... but you know you want to hear it. We got Liam -- aka Ser Davos Seaworth -- on L Street in San Diego heading to Comic-Con festivities Saturday ... and our guy tells him he's banking on Davos to survive. Watch for yourself ... but it certainly doesn't seem like a lock. Betting on ANYONE to survive on HBO's hit show is about as wise as using a fork to fight a White Walker, though. Plus, if Ed Sheeran can pop up with a singing cameo ... anything can happen. We don't have to wait long to see what's next for Davos ... 'Thrones' airs Sunday night at 9./n
