Bea Arthur Saves Animals With PETA From Beyond The Grave/n
Bea Arthur has risen from the grave to come out in support of PETA, or so it seems. The animal rights organization has released a new ad that features Saint Bea criticizing McDonald’s for their chicken farming practices.
Almost anticipating Bea fans clucking at their use of the deceased star without her consent, the ad explains that Bea left some money in her will for PETA to fight the factory farming of animals and now they are using her money (and image) to chastise McDonald’s.
PETA hopes that the ad will convince McDonald’s to use a more humane and less violent method of chicken slaughter of their chickens.
The ad ends with Bea’s Maude character saying “God’ll get you for that.”
