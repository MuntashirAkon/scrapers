“It’s tough — it’s very, very tough,” the Rocky star told ABC News correspondent Cecilia Vega. “Time, hopefully, will heal, and you try to get through it, but it’s just something. It’s a reality of life.
“I think it’s important to get back and start reliving your life — otherwise, you can go into a spiral.”
