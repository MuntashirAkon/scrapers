Hot Music Duo Karmin Storms The Charts!/n
The wait is almost over! After building buzz on YouTube for months, pop duo Karmin is finally about to hit the airwaves with their debut album, Hello.
 The X Factor judge L.A. Reid — who signed Amy Heidemann and Nick Noonan, both 25, to his label, Epic Records — assembled a team of superproducers to help guide the pair, including Claude Kelly, who has worked with Britney Spears and Kelly Clarkson, and Christopher “Tricky” Stewart, who has worked with Rihanna, Mariah Carey, Beyoncé and Justin Bieber.
How did Amy and Nick measure up? “Amy can sing her [butt] off,” Stewart says. 
Fans can find out for themselves when Hello hits shelves on May 8! /n
