The filming of his death will be broadcast on BattleCam.com, a 24/7 Reality TV website where live events are regularly cast to a wide range of audiences. The site is run by billionaire businessman Alki David, who purchased the exclusive rights to broadcast the process.
“I am grateful to Mr. David and his team for making this possible,” Ivanisovich told Russia Today. “My family will be able to live in prosperity after I pass. May God bless Mr. David for his kindness and generosity.
