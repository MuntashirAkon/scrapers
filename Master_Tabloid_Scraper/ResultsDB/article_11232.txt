CANNES GLAM: Robin Hood Opens Up The Film Festival In High Style/n
Robin Hood, starring Russell Crowe and Cate Blanchett opened up the Cannes Film Festival in the South of France on Wednesday, in truly, glamorous fashion.  Kate Beckinsale hit the carpet in jaw-dropping form, wearing a beyond-beautiful, pale blue Marchesa draped tulle gown, which featured a ruffle skirt and intricately embroidered detail, while Eva Longoria Parker looked princess-like in her white, Emilio Pucci gown, which featured a dramatic train of tiered chiffon.

Salma Hayek added a little bit of spice to the mix with her richly-hued, burgundy Gucci Premiere collection gown, which flaunted her covetable curves to the max.  The one-shouldered number featured crystal-embellished shoulder and waist detailing.

Helen Mirren always manages to make a dramatic statement in black.  The divine Dame smoldered in a Fall 2010 Elie Saab jersey floorlength, which featured an embellished strap, rocking dazzling diamond cuffs on each wrist.
