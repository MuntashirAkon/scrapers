Wanda Sykes: 'Jon & Kate Gave Me Parenting Tips' /n
New mom Wanda Sykes says she turned to Jon and Kate for parenting tips.  
Sykes- who plays the wisecracking Barb on CBS’  The New Adventures of Old Christine –appeared on The Tonight Show Wednesday night and joked to host Jay Leno, “I watched Jon & Kate Plus 8. I figured they have eight kids, I could get some tips from them.” 
Sykes and her wife Alex  welcomed twins –a boy and a girl — on April 27.  Alex is the birth mother.
The actress/comedienne also joked about the childbirth process, and compared it to an episode of CSI, saying when doctors tell you not to look that way, don’t do it.  
Sykes said:  “There’s no such thing as a smooth delivery. Babies are very inconsiderate. I was like ‘look babies you guys have to hurry up and get here.'” 
Sykes wed Alex on October 25, 2008 in California.  Alex, whose maiden name is not known, took Sykes’  last name.  
The twins –Olivia Lou and Lucas Claude –are the couple’s first children together. /n
