Wanda Sykes Welcomes Twins With Wife/n
Still basking in the glow of her White House Correspondent’s Dinner speech, comedian Wanda Sykes announced on Wednesday that she and wife Alex welcomed twins on April 27. 
‘All are happy and healthy and at home,” Sykes’ rep Danica Smith told People. 
Alex gave birth to daughter Olivia (6 lbs., 7 oz. and 19-inches long) and son Lucas Claude (7 lbs., 9 oz., and 20-inches long). The couple were married in October.
