TRAVEL: Vacation like a Rock star/n
Want to party like a rock star?  Make like the English rockers and beat a path to Eden Rock in St. Barts. Recently re-opened in 2005, after a fabulous makeover, Eden Rock has 18 suites and cottages. Each of the luxuriously appointed rooms open out onto your own private terraces or wooden sundecks. Ohh la la! 
Thirteen new beachfront accommodations have recently been added by English owners David and Jane Matthews – all personally and individually decorated, so you can enjoy a “themed” stay. Our favorite– not that we’ve stayed there yet– is  the Waterlily House – a one bedroom beach-front suite with an infinity pool overlooking the ocean and a further spa pool on a large terrace . But if you’re working on your latest CD, the place to reserve is the “Rock Star Villa” which has its own state-of-the-art recording studio, a music room and a 20-seat Cinemascope home theatre. Besides that, it contains four super deluxe suites, two staff cabins, swimming pool, spa pool, gym and every other thing you’d expect from an $18 million dollar villa. 
Named Eden Rock because it’s perched on rock  — we figured that one out — some of the rooms have 360’ panoramic ocean views. You won’t go hungry with 3 restaurants, not to mention the bars. For lunch try the relaxed ‘toes-in-the-sand’ Sand Bar and at night, head for the On-The-Rocks restaurant and tapas bar for chef’s Claude Dufour’s fusion cuisine, followed by cocktails high over the reef.
At approximately $400 a night, it’s a bargain. Even if you’re not a rock star. /n
