Talking about his upcoming, semi-autobiographical film JCVD, Jean-Claude Van Damme got a little too explicit with a female reporter from Newsweek.
“I really opened myself up in JCVD,” the martial arts star said. “I peeled back the skin of the fruit, cut the pulp and then took that very hard seed…and inside that seed was a kind of liquid cream substance of the man I am.”
As if that wasn’t bad enough, he added, “It was like being naked — I would love to be naked in front of you.” 
The 48 year-old star of Time Cop and Universal Soldier wrapped things up by asking her to come to the premiere wearing a black dress and high heels.
Hey, the guy knows what he likes, right? /n
