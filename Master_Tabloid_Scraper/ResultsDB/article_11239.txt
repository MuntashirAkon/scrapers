This is a brilliant idea!
Chelsea Clinton is writing a children's book about influential and strong women in American history.

Called She Persisted, the book will feature the stories of 13 tenacious and inspiring women — Harriet Tubman, Helen Keller, Nellie Bly, Maria Tallchief, Claudette Colvin, Clara Lemlich, Ruby Bridges, Margaret Chase Smith, Sally Ride, Florence Griffith Joyner, Oprah Winfrey, and Sonia Sotomayor.
We LOVE that the title refers to the time Mitch McConnell attempted to silence Senator Elizabeth Warren in the Senate. Way for that to backfire on poor old Mitch! LOLz!
In a statement, Chelsea said: 
"I wrote this book for everyone who's ever wanted to speak up but has been told to quiet down, for everyone who's ever been made to feel less than. The 13 women in She Persisted all overcame adversity to help shape our country—sometimes through speaking out, sometimes by staying seated, sometimes by captivating an audience. With this book, I want to send a message to young readers around the country—and the world—that persistence is power."
Hell yeah, Chelsea! You go!
The book will be available in stores May 30.
