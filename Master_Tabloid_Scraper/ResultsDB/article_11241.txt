Irate Jean-Claude Van Damme Storms Off TV Interview After Being Asked 'The Same Questions For The Last 25 Years'! Watch The Awkwardness!/n

Somebody had a case of the Mondays Thursdays!
Jean-Claude Van Damme was doing an interview with the Australian morning show Sunrise yesterday when things sort of fell apart, leading the action flick actor to get up and walk away mid-show!

The actor, who was in Thailand at the time and doing the interview via a satellite connection, became fed up with the morning show's hosts after he accused them of asking the "same" questions.
He was clearly in a bad mood when he ripped into the show hosts through the screen, saying: 

"Sorry guys I cannot do this anymore. The press, they have been asking me the same questions for the last 25 years. Kylie [Minogue], how's your training? How's your this? How's your that? They are boring. Okay, next question. You have something interesting to ask me?"
Yikes!!
Of course, Van Damme recently admitted to having had a relationship with Kylie Minogue in the '90s, so it'd make sense that outlets might want to ask him about that… but whatever.
Watch the entire thing go down (below):

LOLz!!
The best news here is that Van Damme is going to get his wish — very soon, he'll embark on a speaking tour Down Under.
He can only hope he doesn't get asked the "same" questions by fans!!
