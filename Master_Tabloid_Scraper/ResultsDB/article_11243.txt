Ariel Winter has grown up before our eyes!

Nonetheless the 18-year-old reassured fans that she was wearing pasties for the role, as Miz Winter wrote: 

"Today's office…relax everyone it's cranberry juice and I'm wearing lady bit pasties. #DogYears #set #movie"
What a tough job! LOLz!
Still, a mature post like this one isn't necessarily odd for the up-and-comer's IG account as she's been proudly showing off her body a bit more these days. We mean, did anyone else catch her SLAYWORTHY graduation dress?
While Ariel is best known for playing the dorky Alex Dunphy on the ABC sitcom, she's changed up her looks by dying her hair red and sporting fake tattoos in order to play an emotionally unstable woman in the Burt Reynolds led movie. We wonder what ex Laurent Claude Gaudette thinks of her new look??
We bet he's missing her these days. Way to slay, girl!
