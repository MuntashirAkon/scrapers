HIGHlarious! Although, we can't say we're surprised to see the 18-year-old channel Kim Kardashian West for inspiration as she previously defended the KUWTK star from critics over her viral nude selfie.
Nonetheless, just to make sure people got the message Miz Winter also shared on IG:

We had our suspicions Ariel and Laurent were no longer an item since the twosome had unfollowed each other on social media. Not to mention, Ariel quoted Beyonc√©'s breakup track Sorry on one of her prom pictures. Oh, and the former flames haven't been spotted together since Coachella.
Regardless, we're sad to see these two call it quits on their relationship as they've been on and off since 2013. Still, things weren't always perfect between the up-and-comers as they briefly broke up in 2015.
At the end of the day, we can't really blame the Sofia the First star for flaunting her single status as she is about to start college at UCLA soon. Go have some fun, girl!
P.S. To celebrate 2 million IG followers, the actress also posted this ass shot:




2 million!!! Wow! I can't believe it‚Ä¶love you guys so much ‚ù§Ô∏è #thankyou #loveA photo posted by Ariel Winter (@arielwinter) on Jun 26, 2016 at 4:41pm PDT
