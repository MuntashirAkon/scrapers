Ariel Winter was certainly in the white Christmas spirit on Sunday (Dec. 18, 2016) and feeling a little sexy, to boot!
The Modern Family star was spotted taking her family to see Santa at The Grove in Los Angeles, showing off some eye-popping cleavage in a short white dress and wedge sandals.
Winter and her new boyfriend, Levi Meaden, made their red carpet debut as a couple earlier this month when they attended the Trevor Project’s TrevorLive Los Angeles 2016 fundraiser together in Beverly Hills, Calif.
