Ariel Winter and her new boyfriend, Levi Meaden, made their red carpet debut as a couple.
Following their display of public affection in November, the two made their relationship official on Sunday (Dec. 4, 2016) when they attended the Trevor Project’s TrevorLive Los Angeles 2016 fundraiser together in Beverly Hills, Calif.
Other than her new man, all eyes were on the Modern Family star’s chest. She put her cleavage on display in a plunging black and white pleated gown.
