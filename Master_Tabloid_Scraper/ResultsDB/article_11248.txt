Ariel Winter has a new man in her life. The Modern Family star, who was spotted out grabbing lunch with a friend on Tuesday (Nov. 29, 2016), is said to be romantically involved with Canadian actor Levi Meaden.

The two were recently seen kissing after celebrating a “friendsgiving” together. After grabbing some coffee, the new couple were photographed packing on PDA as they took shelter from the rain at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.

“We came to LACMA to see the Guillermo del Toro exhibit and it was closed and now it’s pouring rain and we’re stuck in it and we parked far,” Winter said in a snapchat video. She later shared that they went to a local restaurant instead as a date.
A rep for Winter since confirmed to E! News that the actress is seeing The 100 alum. Earlier this year, the 18-year-old split with boyfriend Laurent Claude Gaudette after two years of dating.
Guess she’s no longer “single AF!”
