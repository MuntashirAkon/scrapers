Could Ariel Winter have a new man in her life?
The Modern Family star was spotted in L.A. on Saturday (Nov. 26, 2016), walking hand-in-hand and looking sweetly at a young fellow after the two had lunch. She was wearing ripped black jeans and a white tee paired with white sneakers, and carrying a black Celine handbag. Click on the gallery above for pics!
The 18-year-old was also seen heading into West Hollywood the night before, in a very low-cut black romper suit. It looks like her mystery man was with her, as well. You can’t see him but the same plaid shirt he wore to lunch above is seen in the foreground (see the pics here).

This past summer, romance rumors swirled around Winter and actor Sterling Beaumon, best known as the young Ben on Lost, but Winter told Entertainment Tonight, “We’ve been best friends for 10 years. We’re not dating. We see each other every day but no, we’re like literally best friends.” Guess she meant it.
Winter confirmed her split from longtime boyfriend Laurent Claude Gaudette earlier this year.
