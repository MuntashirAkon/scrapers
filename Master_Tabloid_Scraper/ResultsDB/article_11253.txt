Ariel Winter was seen having lunch in Beverly Hills on Friday with Sterling Beaumon, best known as the young Ben on Lost, fueling rumors they two are an item.
Rumors of their romance started earlier this summer, after Winter confirmed her split from longtime boyfriend Laurent Claude Gaudette.
The Modern Family star and Beaumon attended an L.A. event in July, stopping to pose for a photograph with their arms around each other.  An eyewitness told E! News at the time, “The two arrived at the SkySpace LA event together and left together. They were seen hanging out all night and it seemed like they were more than just friends,” adding, “They were definitely very flirty and always close to each other.”

The former child stars have known each other for years, co-starring in a 2010 Nintendo commercial and have been friends ever since.
Winter recently told Entertainment Tonight, “We’ve been best friends for 10 years. We’re not dating. We see each other every day but no, we’re like literally best friends.”
Uh-huh.
