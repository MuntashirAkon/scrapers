The Modern Family actress is already reportedly cavorting with a new beau.

Ariel Winter appears to be moving on after splitting from her boyfriend of two years Laurent Claude Gaudette last month. The 18-year-old star is rumored to be seeing a lot of Lost actor Sterling Beaumon in recent weeks.
The two actors were spotted together at the SkySpace Launch Party in LA last week looking surprisingly friendly.
“The two arrived at the SkySpace LA event together and left together. They were seen hanging out all night and it seemed like they were more than just friends,” an insider told E! News. “They were definitely very flirty and always close to each other.”
The new couple has also been seen together around town at celebrity watering holes like The Nice Guy and The Roxy, mingling with friends.
Recently, Beaumon shared a black-and-white photo of himself and Winter with the caption, “Stay down with my day ones.”
