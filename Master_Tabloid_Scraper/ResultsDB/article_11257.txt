Ariel Winter shared a photo of the workspace for her upcoming film, Dog Years, that has people considering whether they chose the right career path.

The 18-year-old Modern Family star stripped down to chill in a candlelit bathtub with a glass of “wine” and beat controversy to the chase when she wrote in the Instagram photo’s caption, “Relax everyone it’s cranberry juice and I’m wearing lady bit pasties.”






 Today's office…relax everyone it's cranberry juice and I'm wearing lady bit pasties. #DogYears #set #movie

Winters’ role in Dog Years appears to be a mature role in comparison to her nerdy sitcom persona as Alex Dunphy on Modern Family. WBIR reports that she will play an emotionally unstable girl named Lil who is assigned to be the driver of an aging movie star, portrayed by Burt Reynolds.
