WATCH: Jean Claude Van Damme Storms out of Australian TV Interview/n

Bloodsport star Jean Claude Van Damme wants to be asked more “interesting” questions during interviews.   
The actor appeared via satellite on the Australian morning show Sunrise on Thursday, but his interview didn’t go as planned as Van Damme, 55, ultimately stormed off after he accused the hosts of asking the same questions.   
“Sorry guys I cannot do this anymore,” he starts. “The press, they have been asking me the same questions for the last 25 years. Kylie [Minogue], how’s your training? How’s your this? How’s your that? They are boring. Okay, next question. You have something interesting to ask me?”  
Afterwards, Van Damme – who recently admitted to having a relationship with Kylie Minogue in the nineties – stands to leave the set, ripping off his microphone as he states that he needs to use the restroom while he questions, “What the f— is going on with Australia?”  
According to Australian digital outlet, News.com, Van Damme is doing interviews in preparation for a speaking tour he has in the country next month.
