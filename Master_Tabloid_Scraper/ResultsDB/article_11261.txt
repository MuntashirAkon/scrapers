Laurent Claude Gaudette and Ariel WinterAngela Weiss/Getty“When I first came to this school and met him, I immediately thought there was something special about him,” Winter, 18, said. “I got to know him and, almost three years later, we’re here.”  
She added: “I love him, he’s great.”  



The pair have been dating since late 2013 and, despite a short split at the end of 2015, are still going strong.  
Winter also opened up about the impact being so open about her breast reduction surgery has had on her and other women.  
“I am very grateful to speak out and reach girls older and younger than me,” she said. “It was very gratifying to hear some of their stories and how they said I inspired them. There are so many young girls going through what I am going through so I thought it was important to share.”
