Winter, sipping on a virgin drink with grenadine, seemed to be having a great time with her longtime boyfriend and stopped by the photo booth to snap a cute photo of the two of them kissing.  
They were later joined again by Gould, and the two Modern Family stars sang and danced around when the DJ spun Flo Rida’s “Wild Ones,” before the group dispersed to wander around the party some more.  
Winter and Gaudette have been dating for over two years, though they split briefly in December. By January, they were back together, celebrating her 18th birthday and stepping out soon after for a romantic date night at the Nice Guy in L.A.  
Earlier this month, the two made their first red carpet appearance since the breakup at the Delta Airlines “Sites and Sounds” Grammy Awards pre-party in L.A.
