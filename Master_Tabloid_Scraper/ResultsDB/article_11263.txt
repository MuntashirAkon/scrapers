Ariel Winter Steps Out with On-Again Boyfriend: 'If You Really Love Someone, You'll Make It Work'/n
Ariel Winter isn’t one to give up without a fight.  
The Modern Family star stepped out with on-again boyfriend Laurent Claude Gaudette at the Delta Airlines “Sites and Sounds” Grammy Awards pre-party on Friday in Los Angeles, marking their first red carpet appearance together since they broke up in December.  
Winter wore a black off-the-shoulder crop top with a tight black miniskirt and accessorized her trendy getup with a sparkly bag and wide black choker necklace. Gaudette opted for a dark burgundy suit over a white button-down shirt.

The pair have been dating for over two years. Although Winter dropped hints on Instagram in December that she was single, the pair celebrated her 18th birthday together in January and stepped out soon after for a romantic date night at the Nice Guy in L.A.   
Winter spoke to PEOPLE ahead of their split about the key to a successful relationship.  
“It’s being able to listen and compromise and not trying to change people,” she said. “It’s hard and I myself am guilty of it as well but you just have to realize people are who they are and love them for that.”  
She continued: “I think you really just have to make an effort to make it work and realize that just because if things get a little rough, it doesn’t mean that’s the end of the world. … If you really love someone, you’ll make it work. I think that’s really important.”
