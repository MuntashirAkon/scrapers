The Modern Family star and Gaudette have been dating for over two years, though they seemingly split for a brief period in December when Winter suggested she was single on Instagram. (“Start of a new week, start of a new chapter #dancinglikebeyoncemood,” she captioned a photo from Beyoncé‘s “Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)” video.)  
But the couple celebrated Winter’s 18th birthday together last week.  


“Had the pleasure of spending the day with this beautiful and perfect birthday girl,” Gaudette wrote on Instagram on Thursday. “Happy Birthday, love you!”  
On Sunday, Gaudette also shared a series of photo booth pictures of the two from Winter’s birthday bash.
