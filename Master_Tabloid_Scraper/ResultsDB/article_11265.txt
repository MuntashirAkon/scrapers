Ariel Winter and her boyfriend were the picture of Modern love at a charity event Sunday.   
 The actress and Laurent Claude Gaudette posed for cameras in Culver City at the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation’s 26th A Time For Heroes family festival at Smashbox Studios.   
 Ariel, 17, turned heads in hot pink mini-dress, while Gaudette looked more casual in jeans and a blue flannel shirt.   
 The Modern Family star and her beau recently celebrated their two-year anniversary.   
 “I love you so much that I don’t even know where to start,” she captioned a romantic Instagram of the couple kissing at sunset. “When we first met two years ago, I felt this insane, unexplainable connection with you and I knew from that day one that you were the one I wanted to be with.”
