Ariel Winter and Laurent Claude Gaudette Celebrate 2-Year Anniversary – Read Their Sweet Messages/n
Ariel Winter certainly isn’t shy about her love for her boyfriend.  
On Sunday, the Modern Family actress took to Instagram to celebrate her 2-year anniversary with Laurent Claude Gaudette with a long, heartfelt message.
“Happy 2 year anniversary my shmoo! I love you so much that I don’t even know where to start,” Winter, 17, wrote as the caption to a dramatic sunset photograph of the two embracing. “When we first met two years ago, I felt this insane, unexplainable connection with you and I knew from that day one that you were the one I wanted to be with.”  





 Happy 2 year anniversary my shmoo! I love you so much that I don't even know where to start. When we first met two years ago, I felt this insane, unexplainable connection with you and I knew from that day one that you were the one I wanted to be with. Our first argument was the day I think I figured out just how in love I was with you, because even though we seemed to absolutely not get along, opposites still attracted. From that day forward, we've had our trials and tribulations, but a day has never gone by where I haven't been madly in love with you. You are everything to me; my love, my other half, the one person who can always challenge me, and occasionally win, and the one that I'm always grateful for. When we aren't together, I miss you immensely and feel like a piece of me is missing. You really do complete me, Laurent. Throughout these two years we've accomplished so much personally, separate and together, and I'm so proud of the adults we're becoming and the direction our relationship is beginning to take. Although I may not always remind you of this, but I am extremely grateful for you and feel like the luckiest girl in the world to hold the keys to your heart, as you hold the keys to mine. I love you so much baby. Remember, shmooery never foolery 😉 ∞❤️∞

Gaudette, 18, also took to Instagram on Sunday to share his sentiments: “Happy two years! These two years have been a hell of an adventure and you’ve been my partner in crime through it all,” he wrote as the caption to photo of a red cake with their names and the infinity symbol written in black and white icing.  
“Thank you for making me better every day with your words and actions. What I’ve learned from our experiences taught me more than I could teach myself,” he continued. “No matter what happens in life I’ll always remember and love you for what you have shown me through these two year. You’ve made me a better overall man wether you believe it or not. I love you more than words can tell. Happy anniversary!”  

Winter – who recently opened up about undergoing a breast reduction surgery in June – has made several glam public appearances with her beau.  
 Most recently, the actress and Gaudette attended a family wedding together, and Winter dazzled in a white bodycon dress.
