Looks like this teen romance is more than just puppy love.Modern Family's Ariel Winter took to Instagram to wish her boyfriend of two years, Laurent Claude Gaudette, a very happy anniversary.The 17-year-old actress posted a sweet photo of the two embracing before a romantic sunset along with a lengthy love note for her fans to read."Happy 2 year anniversary my shmoo! I love you so much that I don't even know where to start. When we first met two years ago, I felt this insane, unexplainable connection with you and I knew from that day one that you were the one I wanted to be with."

Gaudette also posted a picture to Instagram of an anniversary cake for the two with hearts and an infinity sign above their names frosted over the red dessert. The singer-songwriter was not shy about his feelings either as he posted a love note of his own.
