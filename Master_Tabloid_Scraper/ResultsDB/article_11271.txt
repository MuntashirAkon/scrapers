Jean-Claude Van Damme Arrested/n
Chiseled action star Jean-Claude Van Damme was arrested this morning in Los Angeles on drunken driving charges.                    The Muscles From Brussels was pulled over at 3:40 a.m. (PT) after police noticed him driving erratically along Sunset Boulevard in West Hollywood, Sgt. George Decoulombier of the L.A. Country Sheriff's bureau said.                    No official word on the 39-year-old actor's blood-alcohol level, but California's legal limit is 0.08 percent. The actor was released this morning at 8:50, after being charged with driving under the influence. His hearing is scheduled for November 29 at the Beverly Hills Municipal Court.                    Things were starting to look up for the problem-plagued star. In June, he remarried his third wife, Gladys Portugues. The actor and the mother of two of his three children reconciled in 1997, with all issues from their messy 1992 divorce apparently cleaned up.                     His previous marital splits have all been rather sticky, actually. Prior to his current marriage, he faced an ugly break from Hawaiian Tropic model Darcy La Pier, who finally checked out after filing divorce papers three times. His first marriage ended when he moved to the States and his second ended after only one year.                    The self-proclaimed "Fred Astaire of karate" also has a history of substance abuse. In 1997, La Pier called him an emotionally erratic cocaine abuser. Van Damme entered himself in a 30-day treatment program at a Southern California substance abuse clinic in December of 1996.                   This summer, Van Damme hit the big screen with a resounding thud in Universal Soldier: The Return, the dud sequel to his 1992 shoot-'em-up. He's currently working on the sci-fi flick Abominable, with Deep Blue Sea director Renny Harlin.
