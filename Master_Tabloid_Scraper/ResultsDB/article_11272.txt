Jean-Claude Van Damme Recreates 1989 Kickboxer Dance Scene on Conan—Watch Now!/n
"I'll be the first in line," O'Brien promised. "I really will!"That said, the late-night host needed to know if the "Muscles From Brussels" could really "still dance like that"?Van Damme's response? "I still got the moves," he said with a smile, moving his shoulders to prove it.

Beau Williams' "Feeling So Good Today" began to play, and with a little prompting from O'Brien, Van Damme was up on his feet! Team Coco even provided a new table of bad boys for Van Damme to set straight—which he did while dancing, naturally.Once Van Damme had successfully danced the danger away, O'Brien joined him and showed off some moves of his own. It was, to say the least, quite a sight to behold! See for yourself in the Conan clip above.
