Is the Muscles from Brussels down for the count?Just one day after his 50th birthday, sources have told E! News that '80s relic Jean-Claude Van Damme suffered a heart attack while shooting his latest all-kick-boxing (we assume) extravaganza, Weapon.

The production was running smoothly in Romania until last week, when  the cast and crew flew to New Orleans for three days of filming. Shortly  after setting up shop, unspecified complications put the entire shoot  on hold.Well, those complications have since been specified: JCVD is  said to have suffered a minor heart attack.According to TwitchFilm.net, which first reported on Van Damme's condition, the star was briefly admitted to a hospital, where he was joined by  his wife, Gladys Portugues. The duo reportedly flew back to Belgium  after his release, and he is expected to make a full recovery. Get  well soon!(Originally published Oct. 19, 2010, at 2:05 p.m. PT)
