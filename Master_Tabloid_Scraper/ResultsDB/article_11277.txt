Jean-Claude Van Damme is swiftly kicking down reports that he recently took ill while working in New Orleans."Hours ago, I read a rumor online about me suffering heart attack!!," the Muscles from Brussels wrote on his Facebook page. "Please, do not believe all what you read from rumors on any unofficial JCVD sites. Jean-Claude Van Damme is 100% healthy, training well for taking the fight and sending his fans & friends much love."Wait. 100 percent healthy?…

The supposed heart attack in question was first reported by TwitchFilm.net, which claimed the action star did in fact suffer a minor one as he was filming his latest movie Weapon and was briefly admitted to a hospital in the Big Easy—a story that sources also confirmed with E!'s own movie guy, Ben Lyons.What's more, Sheldon Lettich, who penned several Van Damme screenplays, had just taken part in a discussion about the actor's health on a JCVD fan website and wrote on his own site that "JC felt some tightness in his chest just hours after he'd arrived in New Orleans, and checked himself into a local hospital for tests."Lettich added that those on the Weapon set didn't say anything about the situation "because we were asked—by JC and his agent—to keep it quiet until they could release a statement. Guess the cat somehow got out of the bag before they could do that."And, like a cat, we're now even more curious.
