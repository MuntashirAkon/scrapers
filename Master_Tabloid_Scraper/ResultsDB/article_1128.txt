Luckily, Swift already gets along with her new siblings, too."Just went to @taylorswift13 concert. Words cannot express...Mind blown...Nicest person ever... Lovelovelove," the couple's oldest daughter, Maude, tweeted.Swift's concerts must be a sight to see, because on Tuesday, the 23-year-old country-pop star was honored with a commemorative plaque and an inscribed silver wrist cuff by Staples Center for having the most sold-out shows of all time (11 is the magic number, in case you were wondering).No wonder Judd and Leslie are so proud.
