Jean-Claude Van Damme's Change of Heart -- We're Not Getting Divorced (VIDEO)/nJean-Claude Van Damme's wife has had a change of heart,  according to him, because he's no longer headed for divorce court. The awesome actor is all over the place in our video, explaining the reason for the reconciliation.  First he suggests it's for the benefit of their kids, but then waxes poetic about his love for wife Gladys, who filed divorce docs back in March ... pulling the plug on their 15-year marriage. The Muscles from Brussels and Gladys were married before ... between '87 and '92.  They remarried in '99. Hopefully, third time's a charm./n
