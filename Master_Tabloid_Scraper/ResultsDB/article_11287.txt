UFC's Nick Diaz: Training with Van Damme ... 'Dream Come True'/nUFC star Nick Diaz says training with Jean-Claude Van Damme this weekend was a dream come true -- especially since JCVD helped grow his love for fighting back when he was a kid.  Both Nick and his bro Nate Diaz hooked up with the action legend for a clinic in leg strikes -- so, we hit up Nick to find out what exactly went down when the 3 got into the gym.  Check out the clip ... Nick was clearly stoked to train with the guy and says things went so well, he plans to do it again soon.  But the funniest part ... watch how quickly Nick shut down the question when we tried to ask about his brother and Conor McGregor. Dude wasn't havin' it. /n
