Jean-Claude Van Damme -- I Had an Affair with Kylie Minogue ... in 1994/nThe movie  "Street Fighter " will now be known for more that just being one of the worst movies of all-time -- it will be known as the movie that led to Jean-Claude Van Damme having an affair with Kylie Minogue.  JCVD made the startling and completely unnecessary revelation to The Guardian while promoting his new movie,  "Expendables 2. " When asked about the fling, Van Damme stammered his way through one of the greatest answers ever ... saying:   "I tell you what, you should ask her. She'll have a better memory. I'm 51 years old, do you know how much I was punched in the face on The Expendables? No, no. No. And let's just say it happened, so what? Who wants to know? ... Sometimes you let go of stuff ... I don't know, maybe. Yes. OK. Yes, yes, yes. It happened. I was in Thailand, we had an affair. "He then goes on to give a little more detail than anyone wanted to hear, explaining:  "Sweet kiss, beautiful lovemaking. It would be abnormal not to have had an affair, she's so beautiful and she was there in front of me every day with a beautiful smile, simpatico, so charming, she wasn't acting like a big star. I knew Thailand very well, so I showed her my Thailand. She's a great lady. " "Street Fighter " was released in 1994, but it's unclear when exactly it was shot. Van Damme was married to wife #3 until 1992 (though he re-married her in 1999) and married wife #4 in February 1994 ... so it's unclear whether or not JCVD was cheating on either of them at the time.  The more you know./n
