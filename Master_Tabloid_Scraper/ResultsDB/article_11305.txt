Love Triangle Gone Wrong! Former Neighbor 'Shocked' By Triple Homicide/n
Retired pilot, Mike Bullinger, has not been seen for ten days since police issued a nationwide warrant for his arrest after labeling him a person of interest related to a triple homicide following the discovery of three “badly decomposed” bodies in a shed in Idaho last Monday, Radaronline.com has learned.
Although the nationwide warrant does not list any charges that allege a role in the triple homicide, Canyon County Sheriff’s Chief Deputy Marv Dashiell did reveal that Bullinger is a person of interest in the killings.
Mike Bullinger, 60, has been charged with “failing to report the deaths” after police found the bodies were covered in plastic on a property that he had purchased with his wife only last month.

The victims include Bullinger’s wife of two years, Cheryl Baker, his mistress, Nadja Medley, 47, and Medley’s 14-year old daughter, Peyton.
Radar exclusively spoke to a former neighbor of Medley, Edwin Rex, who says the woman lived next door to him in Odgen, Utah, for nearly nine years.
The 86-year-old expressed grief upon hearing the news this morning of Medley and her daughter’s murders.
According to Rex, Medley’s husband died four years ago, and she then became enamored by her new boyfriend, Bullinger, who she started dating only six months ago.

“I was her neighbor for about nine years, and she just moved out of her home two months ago for this guy, it’s crazy. The house is up for sale now,” Rex said.
Rex would occasionally have Medley and her daughter over for dinner.
Another family friend of Medley’s tells Radar she had no idea Bullinger was married to Baker.
