Sienna Miller, keeping things trendy in New Yawk's SoHo neighborhood, shopping for some new sunglasses—prolly to block the harsh gaze of the judging public and the glare of paparazzi cameras, is our guess. Babe stopped by chic luxury specs boutique ILORI after getting a facial at Amore Pacific. S.M. kept it casual in jeans and a tee with her hair pulled back in a ponytail. No B. Getty in sight. Or her breasts. Come to think of it, are we positive this was really Sienna Miller? Yes, afraid it's true. Enjoying his night out on the other coast was...Gilbert Gottfried, at the Academy Theatre in Hell-Ay checking out a screening of a family flick he's in. The loud-mouthed comedian salivated over several tables of dessert goodies served to guests, tho the dude really should be munching on carrot sticks instead. Our set of eyes swore G2, draped in baggy jeans and a flowing red shirt (way to dress up for an event, jeez) resembled a "pregnant lesbian." Who's got the last laugh now, huh, Gil? Taking in more fancyass entertainment were the old Mad About You twosome otherwise known as...Helen Hunt and Paul Reiser, downtown Hell-Ay at the Mark Taper Forum, 'twas a virtual boob-tube reunion, what with Mad costar John Pankow taking to the boards in The House of Blue Leaves, the show H 'n' P were taking in, how sweet. H2 was casual, had on an orange maxidress with drapey gold necklaces and a brown sweater coat. I dunno, Hel's sure got great style always, but sounds little Maude does Venice Beach to moi. By the by, I hear yoga pro Ms. H's figure isn't quite so drastically thin these days, thank heavens! Gotta tell those stick-thin Nazis where to stick it, right?—Additional sass by Becky Bain
