Despite having announced her retirement from acting just last week, Angelina Jolie will be back on the screen in the spy thriller Edwin A. Salt.
And get this: she’s replacing Tom Cruise!
Cruise sources deny that he’s actually been replaced by Jolie, only that the filmmakers wanted him for the movie and the deal didn’t come together. 
Or maybe they got an advance look at his World War II thriller Valkyrie? /n
