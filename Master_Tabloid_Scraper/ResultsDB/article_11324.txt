John F. Kennedy's Only Grandson Jack Schlossberg Is HOT!/n

Meet Jack Schlossberg, everybody!
The political world doesn't often boast a new hottie, so thank goodness for the Kennedy family.
Related: BTW, Mike Huckabee Sucks!
Jack is the son of Caroline Kennedy, the only living child of John F. Kennedy and Jacqueline Kennedy, with husband Edwin Schlossberg. He's also JFK's only grandson! American royalty!
The 24-year-old made his first TV appearance Friday on The Today Show (he also accompanied his mom to the Met Gala on Monday!), where he promoted the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award, which will be awarded to President Barack Obama in Boston on Sunday.
Regarding his own aspirations, Jack said: 

"I'm inspired by my family's legacy of public service. It's something that I'm very proud of, but I'm still trying to make my own way, figure things out, so stay tuned."
The political scion is also about to enter Harvard Law School! Looks, smarts, major connections — he's got it all, and Taylor Swift should date him!
Oh wait, she dated his cousin. That might be awkward. LOLz!
Anyway, Twitter was understandably shook over this unexpected introduction to a political prince:

jfk's grandson (jack schlossberg) is young, single, yale graduated, and INCREDIBLY wealthy 👀👀👀
