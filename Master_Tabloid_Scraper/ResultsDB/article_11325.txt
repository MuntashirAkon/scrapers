Laughs, Tears, & FOUR Post-Credits Scenes! First Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2 Reactions Hit Twitter!/n

Don't worry, Baby Groot. It's mostly positive. Mostly.
Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2 is opening stateside in just over two weeks, and we can't wait to see Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, and the rest of the gang back together saving the universe.
Oh, and did we mention Kurt frikkin' Russell and Sylvester Stallone?!

Critics finally got their first looks at the film on Monday night, and though full reviews are embargoed for another week, they were allowed to share the most basic, spoiler-free responses on Twitter.
People couldn't agree at all on who the best character was, but what was pretty universal is that this movie has a lot of humor and even more emotion! (And four of those Marvel after credits scenes!)
See the best reactions (below)!

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is funnier than the original, a ton of surprises, and an unexpected emotional profoundness. I am Groot.

I need to see GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY VOL. 2 a second time, but after one viewing: very funny, a bit shaggy, grade-A Kurt, and so much heart pic.twitter.com/IO4GXO4ANX

Don't think I've heard so much laughter at a press screening. People seemed to really be digging Guardians Vol. 2. Can't say more (yet)

Going in with through-the-roof expectations, Guardians Vol. 2 still left me wishing it was never going to end. I seriously loved it. pic.twitter.com/kMvGQCeRiS

GUARDIANS VOL. 2 feels like a solid one-and-done issue between big stories; lots of character bits, not much story. MVP: Dave Bautista.

Baby Groot is cuter than you can possibly imagine, Star-Lord reminds me why I liked Pratt, but YONDU ðŸ’™ðŸ’™ is the real standout. #GotGVol2

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a whole heap of fun. Gorgeous, a bit mad, and surprisingly emotional. And yes, Baby Groot is everything.

The problem w/ GOTG2 is that the VFX threaten to swallow the film, which is way too long & too reliant on music cues. Too much family drama.

I will say that I loved @PomKlementieff as Mantis, a great addition to the sequel who had strong chemistry with Drax. More of her, please!

Also: Come for the movie, stay for the not one, not two, not three, but *four* post credit scenes.

FOUR post credit scenes?? OMG we need another Baby Groot dancing sequence in our lives so bad!
We mean, he does have legs now, how about some electric slide? Ha!
