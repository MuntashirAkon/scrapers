Twitter Crowns Wendy Williams 'The New Stacey Dash' Over Her Response To Jesse Williams' Speech Drama! Watch!/n

Uh oh.
Wendy Williams tried to put her two cents into the controversy surrounding Jesse Williams' powerful speech at the BET Awards.
But the daytime talk show host's response was faced with controversy in itself over comments she made about historically black colleges and the NAACP!

During Wednesday's Wendy Williams Show, the 51-year-old spoke out on the Grey's Anatomy star's moving speech after receiving the Humanitarian Award for his documentary on the Black Lives Matter movement.
She told the audience: 

"His speech was very poignant, on one hand. On the other hand, you know, I would be really offended if there was a school that was known as an historically white college. We have historically black colleges. What if it was the National Organization for White People only? There's the NAACP."
Umâ€¦ what?
Even if Wendy was trying to play devil's advocate, most viewers pointed out that she came across more like an internet troll who had no idea what the hell she was talking about!

Critics fled to Twitter to call out the host, many noting that while some schools are HBCUs (historically black colleges or universities) most universities are in fact PWIs (predominately white institutions).
One Twitic even said Wendy's ignorant rant puts her in the ranks of Stacey Dash â€” which is the ultimate insult, as we all know she's the lowest of the media bottom-feeders.
