Because Superbad was such a big hit, I thought I'd give star Jonah Hill a victory lap. Go ahead, pop that champagne, homie. After not one, not two, but three movies to open at number one this summer, it's safe to say that the L.A. native is here to stay. (Knocked Up and Evan Almighty are the other hit films, if you're keeping track.) His big break, though, came in Accepted, with Justin Long. And who can forget him adorning that hot dog suit and screaming, "Ask me about my wieeeeeeeneeeerrr!"I first met Jonah at least year's Comic-Con, and we have remained friendly ever since. He's always enthusiastic and down-to-earth, and I think the fact that Jonah is from Hollywood has helped him to not become Hollywood.

Before we get to some of his favorite movies, I gotta mention that some of Hill's best work fell under the radar last year. So, be sure to check out the opening scene of 10 Items or Less. It begins with Jonah driving alongside Morgan Freeman. Hill's a production assistant on an indie film, Freeman's an actor who thinks he's above this kind of movie, and the two go toe-to-toe.
