‘Lone Survivor’ Trailer: Mark Wahlberg, Taylor Kitsch and Ben Foster Go to War/n
Here is your first look at Mark Wahlberg’s new action drama war picture Lone Survivor, courtesy of Universal Pictures and Moviefone.
The film, directed by Peter Berg (Friday Night Lights, Battleship), is based on the real-life events of a 2005 mission to capture or kill a Taliban leader, as documented in Marcus Luttrell’s book Lone Survivor: The Eyewitness Account of Operation Redwing and the Lost Heroes of Seal Team 10.
Taylor Kitsch, Ben Foster, Eric Bana, Emile Hirsch and Alexander Ludwig play members of this elite SEAL team on the big screen.
Lone Survivor opens in limited release on Dec. 27 before a nationwide opening on Jan. 10, 2014.
(By the way, did the opening of this trailer make anyone think of Explosions in the Sky and all the magic they’ve done with Berg and FNL? Here’s a gentle reminder).
