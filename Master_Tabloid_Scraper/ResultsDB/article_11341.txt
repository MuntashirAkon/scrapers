Erin Brockovich Says She’s Sorry for That Whole Drunken Boating Incident Thing/n
It’s called booze, Ed.
Erin Brockovich-Ellis, better known as that woman whose story helped Julia Roberts win an Oscar in 2001, issued an apology on Sunday after she was arrested and charged with an OUI (that’s Operating Under the Influence, for you sober people) while boating Friday near Las Vegas.
In a statement obtained by PEOPLE, the 52-year-old activist said:
At no time was the boat away from the dock and there was no public safety risk. That being said, I take drunk driving very seriously, this was clearly a big mistake. I know better and I am very sorry. After a day in the sun and with nothing to eat it appears that a couple of drinks had a greater impact than I realized.
So the story goes, Brockovich-Ellis went to the slammer after a warden for the Nevada Department of Wildlife noticed she was having trouble docking her boat at Lake Mead. As it turns out, she was “significantly” over the .08 percent legal limit for operating a boat, according to spokesperson Edwin Lyngar.
“She was obviously struggling to put the boat in the slip, and if you’ve had any experience, it’s a simple enough operation,” Lyngar said.
She was later released on $1,000 bail and a whole bunch of new ideas for a sequel.
