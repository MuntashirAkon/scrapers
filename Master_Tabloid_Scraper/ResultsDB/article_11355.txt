And here's our good friend Ron:

The same person, is it not?! But sadly, Swanson is a talented woodworker and could care not less about a marble statue that may or may not be of him. Or that's what we're assuming.Either way, we're so glad someone found this statue because we are all about having a permanent piece of art made of our jazz-loving hero. It would serve as a daily reminder for the many life lessons we have learned from him, such as:Staying true to yourself:

The best dieting rules:

Giving it your all:

Asking for exactly what you want out of life:

How to create an inviting party atmosphere:

How to dance:

And last, but not least, emergency preparedness:

Since this statue actually isn't of him, maybe we should commemorate a day to Ron Swanson instead, in which no one is allowed to drink clear alcohol or eat salads. Just a thought.
