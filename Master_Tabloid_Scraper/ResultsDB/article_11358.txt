Frank Ocean -- R.I.P. to My Homie ... Christopher Breaux Dies in Court/nIt wasn't easy, but Frank Ocean finally got a judge to help him kill off someone very close to him -- Christopher Edwin Breaux ... as in the name Frank was given at birth, but is now ditching. Frank's request for a legal name change got a judge's stamp of approval today in L.A. As we previously reported ... Ocean filed legal docs a year ago to make the switch, but a judge put the brakes on the process until Frank cleared up some drivers license issues. Breaux, born in Long Beach, CA,  was 27. He died of severe anonymity and underappreciation. R.I.P. /n
