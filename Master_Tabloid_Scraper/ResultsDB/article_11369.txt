Frank Ocean -- I'm Changing My Name ... To Frank Ocean/nFrank Ocean has made a drastic decision to legally change his name ... but fear not ...  it's not a  Prince-esque symbol. Ocean -- whose real name is Christopher Edwin Breaux -- filed legal docs to officially change his name to Frank Ocean.To make it official ... Frank has to plaster his intentions in a newspaper on 4 separate occasions -- once a week, 4 weeks in a row.  The idea is that if he's using the name to defraud someone, potential victims can come forward and object in court.Yes, newspapers still exist./n
