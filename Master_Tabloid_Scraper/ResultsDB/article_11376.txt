Ben Affleck Ditches Church For New Romance/n
Ben Affleck has turned his back on religion since going public with new girlfriend Lindsay Shookus!
 The troubled actor regularly attended Sunday services in Pacific Palisades, Calif., with ex Jennifer Garner and their three kids,
 But spies said Ben’s barely been at church in the past three months, preferring to spend time with the “Saturday Night Live” producer, instead! 
 A parishioner, who wished not to be named, spilled: “He doesn’t really come here anymore, unless it’s to drop his kids off at Sunday school.”
  “It’s a shame he’s not [at church] more often because it could be good for him to keep on track after everything he’s been through.” /n
