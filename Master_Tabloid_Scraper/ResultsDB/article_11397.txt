On Friday's Rap Radar podcast, the Smile rapper explained:

"Rumi is our favorite poet, so it was for our daughter."
That's beautiful. Seeing as that was the only Rumi we knew for a long time, we had kinda guessed that one. But what about the Beyhive's guess that Sir was named after one of Bey's fave makeup artists?
Jay's explanation of his son's name does not include Sir John at all. Instead Jay says: 

"And then Sir was, like, man, come out the gate. He carries himself like that. He just came out, like, Sir."
So it was all about his commanding personality? No namesake at all?
Damn, sorry, Sir John. And Sir Ben Kingsley. LOLz!
Innerestingly, this also tells us that at least Sir for sure was named after the birth, after they had already met him. And here we thought they were keeping the secret for months…

Jay also spilled about how Blue Ivy Carter ended up doing her freestyle rap on his new album 4:44:

"She got the headphones and she climbed on the little stool, and then she just started rapping… I was like, 'Oh shit!' I have [the whole thing] on my phone. Five minutes! Five minutes of her doing that."
Aww! We love what a proud poppa he is!

"She kept doing that 'boom shakalaka, boom shakalaka'. I was like, 'Oh, she understands the concept of a hook.' She's 5, and she understands the concept of a hook."
For a rap mogul, that must be better than first steps!
