Ben Affleck and Lindsay Shookus are out on the town again.
The two were spotted in Santa Monica, California, on Saturday afternoon, taking a stroll in the sun after sharing breakfast together at Snug Harbor. Affleck went casual for the outing – wearing a black Detroit Motor City T-shirt and a pair of jeans, while Shookus wore high waisted denim shorts and a cropped grey shirt knotted over her trim waist. Both sported shades.
