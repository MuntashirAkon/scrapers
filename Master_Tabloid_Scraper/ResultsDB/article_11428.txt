Previously the two have been spotted out and about in Los Angeles, where Ben lives. This is the first time they've been seen together as a couple in the City That Never Sleeps.A source tells E! News that the duo were talking and walking happily together on the bustling streets of the Big Apple around 2:30 p.m. The two were outfitted in casual ensembles with Ben, donning a low-key t-shirt and jeans.
