'The Purge' Producer Claims Dog Walker Made Threats Over Matt Damon, Ben Affleck/nOne of the guys behind 'The Purge' movies had to purge his dog walker because she allegedly threatened to kill his pup ... all over a creepy obsession with Matt Damon and Ben Affleck. Brad Fuller -- who also produced  "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre " -- says this horror story started in May when the dog walker accosted his wife, demanding to meet Matt and /or Ben. According to legal docs, obtained by TMZ, she said  "many lives would be lost " unless she got the intro. Brad fired her and changed his locks, but says the woman started texting his wife 150 times a day ... and threatened to poison their dog. He says they reported her to LAPD, but after a detective went to her home ... she texted his wife,  "I will make sure you never walk again. " Brad says the woman was put on an involuntary 72-hour hold at UCLA Medical following the incident. The court granted him a restraining order, which also protects his wife and their Rottweiler, Duke.       Duke easily wins the big head competition!
