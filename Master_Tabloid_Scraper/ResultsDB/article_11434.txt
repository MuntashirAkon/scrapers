Ben Simmons Crushes Alley-Oop from 12-Year-Old with Cerebral Palsy/nForget the Clippers ... Ben Simmons turned PHILLY into Lob City today -- with the help of a stud 12-year-old hooper diagnosed with cerebral palsy.  The 76ers superstar hit the gym Thursday to surprise Tyler Osowski -- who just underwent a major operation in June to help him walk better.  Simmons had heard Tyler was a HUUUGE Sixers fan -- and loves Simmons -- so, he worked with FOX 29's Dawn Timmeney to set up a shootaround.   What ensued was pretty great -- the two bro'd down on the court and Tyler even dished up a pretty sweet alley-oop!  Great story -- props to everyone involved. /n
