Chris Christie Gets in a Cubs Fan's Face, 'You're a Big Shot' /nChris Christie wasn't having it this time with heckling fans at a baseball game over the weekend ... seeing how he got within inches of one guy's face.   At #Cubs #Brewers game. #ChrisChristie was getting razzed by fans, so he got in the face of one of them. 5:30 on @WISN12News pic.twitter.com /sx8euMgFy2 — Ben Hutchison (@BennyHutch) July 30, 2017  Christie was at Miller Stadium Sunday in Milwaukee for a Brewers-Cubs game, and this clip shows the tail end of what looks like a heated confrontation with a Cubs fan that luckily ended with just words.  You clearly hear the NJ governor tell the dude,  "You're a big shot " -- before he pulls back and continues down the steps ... nachos intact and all. Unclear what exactly set off the stare-down ... we haven't heard back from his office for comment.  As we reported ... Christie got destroyed by Mets fans earlier this month when he caught a foul ball and was showered in BOOOs. He also hasn't fared well on sports radio.  Seems like he's fed up with the ridicule lately﻿./n
