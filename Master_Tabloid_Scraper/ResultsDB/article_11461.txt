Major drama erupted in Guthrie’s brief absence. In early January, NBC announced they had hired Fox news anchor Megyn Kelly for a big role at the network.
Soon, rumors swirled that Kelly, 46, would be taking over at Today, and Tamron Hall quit following her firing from the 9 am slot.
“Everyone is just on edge, all the time,” a source told Radar. “They don’t know what’s going to happen.”
