Bad Romance! Therapy Reality Show Actually Breaks Up Couples/n
By Debbie EmeryRadar Reporter
A new show may have proved that reality TV really can’t save a relationship after all, and it may even totally sabotage them!
VH1’s Couples Therapy was supposed to help five reality romances, but instead all of the pairings have parted ways since the show was filmed, and the new issue of Star magazine has exclusive details on their explosive endings.
Bachelor Pad alums Vienna Girardi and Kasey Kahl had moved in together and were hoping to marry before they went into Therapy, but now they are not even speaking. “Kasey and I are absolutely not together,” Vienna told Star. “It is completely over.”

Other blossoming romances suffered similar fates, with Jersey Shore’s Angelina Pivarnick discovering that her bad boy lover Chris Nirschel was a “liar and a cheater,” she claimed. “He’s a manipulative womanizer, and the show’s doctors couldn’t change that.”

Shockingly all of the remaining pairs — rapper DMX and wife Tashera Simmon, Linda Hogan and boy toy Charlie Hill, and Amazing Race champ Reichen Lehmkuhl and boyfriend Rodiney Santiag — have all split too!
