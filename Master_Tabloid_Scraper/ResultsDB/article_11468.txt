However, both sides are keeping mum on the ruling, with the Judge ordering a closed court during the afternoon’s proceedings, and barring either party from disclosing the outcome.

As RadarOnline.com previously reported, Cryer was in court seeking to reduce his ordered $8,000 a month child support payments down to zero, with the argument that as he has temporary full time custody he should not have to pay his ex-wife a cent.
A source disclosed to RadarOnline.com that Cryer currently makes upward of half a million dollars a month.

Trigger’s lawyer told RadarOnline.com, “The Judge made a ruling today and we are relieved it is over.”
Another source implied that the ruling definitely went in favor of Trigger, but was unable to give more details.
Both Trigger and Cryer were there at the downtown LA courthouse in person – Cryer’s new wife, Lisa Joyner, attended with Cryer in the morning, sitting next to her husband and providing support to the somber looking actor. RadarOnline.com has learned though that Joyner left at lunchtime and did not return, leaving Cryer to battle it out with his ex-wife solo. /n
