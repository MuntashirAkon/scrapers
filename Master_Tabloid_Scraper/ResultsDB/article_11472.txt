First Lady Michelle Obama Shows Off  New  “Bobbed” Do/n
First Lady Michelle Obama continued her fashionista ways by showing-off a new ‘bobbed’ hairstyle Tuesday.
The President’s wife swept back her tresses at a celebration of country music at The White House.
The elegant new look was matched with a white patterned dress at the event that was also attended by her daughters Malia and Sasha and which featured performances by country stars Charley Pride, Brad Paisley, Alison Krauss and Union Station.
While Michelle Obama continues to cement her reputation as one of the world’s most fashionable women, her husband, President Barack Obama has confessed he feels like the frumpy half of the couple.
The President  told NBC: “Here’s my attitude. Michelle, she looks fabulous. I’m a little frumpy.”
Mr. Obama was commentating on criticism of the ‘dad jeans’ he wore to throw the first ball at a Saint Louis baseball match last week.
The most powerful man in the world admitted that he hates to shop for clothes and that he was never going to sport a pair of ‘tight jeans’.
