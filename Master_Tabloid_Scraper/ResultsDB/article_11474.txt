7th Heaven Is Gonna Start Playing On Its Network Again For The First Time Since The Stephen Collins Scandal?!/n

Seriously?
Reruns of the show 7th Heaven have been off the air since October after an audio recording was leaked of the show's leading actor Stephen Collins admitting to past child molestation.
But the network UP TV, who had originally pulled the plug on the show, has very quietly put the show back on their schedule!

When contacted about these concerns, UP TV apparently claimed they WERE going to air the show again because so many viewers disagreed with their decision to take it down.
Here's what network head Charley Humbard said:

"We brought the show back because many viewers expressed they could separate allegations against one actor from the fictional series itself…As it turns out, they cannot."
UP TV has since reversed course on this decision, it seems, and now they're claiming they actually won't be playing 7th Heaven on its channel again.
Which, as you can imagine, is kind of extremely confusing!

We assume the show has given them a lot of ratings in the past and the network wants to play the show again, but they're too afraid of the fallout that would happen if they did.
And honestly we don't blame them. Because there definitely would be a fallout!!!
