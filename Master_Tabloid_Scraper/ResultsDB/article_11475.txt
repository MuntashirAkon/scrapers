Finally! American Apparel Does Something To Empower Women!/n

American Apparel has been making a LOT of changes recently! 
A month ago, news broke of them finally firing founder and CEO Dov Charney after years of battling sexual harassment claims against him — including one lawsuit accusing Dov of making an employee his sex slave. 
Now they've also replaced four board members, and one of the replacements is a woman!! While that shouldn't be a big deal, it is; she's the first female to ever hold a board position for AA. 
Her name is Colleen B. Brown, and she was previously employed as chief executive of media for Fisher Communications.   
According to the founder of Standpoint Research, Ronnie Moas, Colleen was a smart move. He explained: 
"It's a good public relations move in the eyes of people that thought Dov Charney was disrespecting women. You are moving away from the culture that they had under his watch and taking the company in a more serious direction."
Serious is good, especially after Dov was caught on camera dancing nude in front of female employees… (Attorneys have been busy trying to erase all evidence of that video from the internet, but it definitely exists.) 
As progressive as Colleen's hire was, hopefully her professional input will be just as valuable as her gender. American Apparel is currently over $200 million in debt, which is a difficult hole to climb out of no matter who you are! 
So, the question is this: 



Can a female board member save American Apparel???
