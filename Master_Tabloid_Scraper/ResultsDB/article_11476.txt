When You Hear What American Apparel's CEO Has To Say For Himself, Even YOU Will Be In Denial!/n

American Apparel may have fired CEO Dov Charney for sexual misconduct, but according to the man himself, it's a really big MAY.
The creator of the brand has given his first post-termination interview, and he's using the strategy that cheaters have been employing since time immemorial: deny â€™til you die.
To all the accusations of sex slavery and ongoing harassment, Dov says: 
"I believe the allegations made against me in my termination letter to be entirely false. I think it's highly unusual that a board - any board - would indulge in such a hateful PR campaign against its founder."
He may be stating the claims are false, but his lawyer isn't using quite so concrete language. Nevertheless, both seem to think they can get the former boss his job back! Charney told the Financial Times:
"I think I will be back in my office before long. I will make this company happen with me still at the helm."
Yeah, something tells us they'll find plenty of evidence he's guilty of sexual misconduct. For instance, EVERY AMERICAN APPAREL AD EVER MADE!
We'll call them Exhibit AA! LOLz!
