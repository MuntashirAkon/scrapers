American Apparel's Controversial Ex-CEO Turns The Tables! Learn What He's Planning HERE!/n

As more light sheds on American Apparel’s controversial CEO Dov Charney’s termination, it seems he won’t be leaving without a fight!
According to his lawyer, Patricia Gliser, he is gearing up to sue the company for wrongful termination after the retailer’s board unanimously voted him out last week and then refused to meet with him again to discuss next steps for the company, which he founded in 1998.
Though American Apparel claims the firing was due to a misuse of company funds and alleged misconduct, Dov’s lawyer stated that most of the claims: 
"involve activities that occurred long ago (if at all) and about which the Board and the Company have had knowledge for years."
And she continued:
"By presenting Mr. Charney with this absurd and unreasonable demand, the Company acted in a manner that was not merely unconscionable but illegal…Unless these matters are addressed immediately, we intend to pursue legal action against the company."
The deadline to reinstate Dov was set to today, but no word on American Apparel’s decision, yet.
Obviously, there is much more to the legal situation than what was previously shared, but we can only hope they stand ground with their decision. 
It's about time!
