American Apparel's Freshly Fired CEO Caught Dancing Nude In Front Of Alleged Employees In Newly Released Video/n

Well, at least he was fired BEFORE this video leaked??
For those of you who haven't heard, American Apparel's extremely controversial CEO Dov Charney was FINALLY let go a few days ago — after YEARS of sexual harassment claims and even a sex slave lawsuit. 
And before you argue that the allegations against him may have been blown up or exaggerated by the media, wait until you see THIS footage…
In it, Dov is dancing completely nude in front of two of his (alleged) employees while he asks for more girls over the phone. And while the ladies in question haven't fully been identified as AA vets, one source has come forward to say that they are either current or former employees of the brand, saying: 
"I worked for AA years ago. That girl in the video used to be my boss. And the girl he's referring to, Daisy, also used to work with me. I think she still works for the co."
Yes, it all sounds pretty unbelievable, but seeing is believing, right?
So see the entire NSFW video for yourself …AFTER THE JUMP!!! 
There are no words.
We're just glad his days at the company are over! 
UPDATE: Video has been removed at request of attorneys.
