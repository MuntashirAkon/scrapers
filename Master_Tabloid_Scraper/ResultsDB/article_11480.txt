Hollywood legend Doris Day just learned something new about herself on her 93rd birthday: Her real age.

The Hollywood Reporter obtained a copy of Day’s birth certificate that confirmed that she as born on April 3, 1922, in Cincinnati, which would make her age 95 instead of 93.
“I’ve always said that age is just a number and I have never paid much attention to birthdays,” Day said in a statement to The Hollywood Reporter. “But it’s great to finally know how old I really am!”
Day’s spokesman, Charley Cullen Walters, said that there has long been speculation about the actress’s true age.
“The story I have heard the most is that at one point Doris was up for a role when quite young and her age may have been miswritten on the audition form,” he told THR. “We don’t know if that’s correct, but if so it could’ve simply stuck for all these years.”

Betty White, one of Day’s closest friends, also turned 95 this year in January. According to Walters, Day would joke about White’s age.
“Now we know that they are actually just a couple months apart,” Walters said. “Turns out it’s an even bigger exciting landmark than we thought.”
