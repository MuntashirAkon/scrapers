Linda Hogan Dates Her Son’s Friends/n
With her son behind bars and her marriage in shambles, Linda Hogan has been finding comfort in the company of a younger man…a much younger man. The identity of the 19-year-old bottle blonde spotted cavorting with the 48-year-old mother of two at parties has been revealed to TMZ.
According to the gossip site, Charley Hill was “definitely friends” with Linda’s son Nick when both were younger and attended the same Florida church as the Hogan family. He spent time as an alter boy at this very house of worship.
The cougar-loving teen was only one grade above Nick, with whom he often played sports. Is she in competition with her husband Hulk for most disgusting, inappropriate parent on the planet? Because so far, it’s looking like a draw.
