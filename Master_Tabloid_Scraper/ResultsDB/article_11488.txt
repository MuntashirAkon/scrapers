"I had a low-lying placenta with [my first child] Vale, so about nine days before my due date, my doctor recommended a C-section," Savannah shared. "The whole experience was just fantastic. Afterward, I was high on life—and probably a couple of painkillers. This time, when I said, ‘Do you think I'll have a C-section again?' the doctor said, 'Let's talk about it when it gets closer.' And I like that about my doctor. He's real chill."What's also pretty chill is how open Savannah was with Today show viewers during her pregnancy journey.Back in September, Savannah's colleagues including Hoda Kotb, Al Roker and Matt couldn't hide their excitement when their friend revealed the sex of baby No. 2 on live TV.

When the time for the reveal came, Matt held a blue milkshake and a pink milkshake in each hand. Soon after, viewers saw a banner fly through the air that announced, "It's a boy!"As the couple adjusts to life as a family of four, Savannah is filled with so much gratitude as she begins another exciting chapter of her life."The thought of getting to add to our family now is beyond every hope, dream and prayer I have ever had," she shared in a Today show blog. "It is not simply double the joy — it is joy multiplied infinitely."(E! and NBC are part of the NBCUniversal family)
