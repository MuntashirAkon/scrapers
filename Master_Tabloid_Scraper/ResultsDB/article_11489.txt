Charley Pride's Brain Drain/n
      Country singer Charley Pride is on the mend after undergoing brain surgery last week.            The Texas native was hospitalized last Wednesday for a subdural hematoma, which occurs when blood from a torn vessel pools between the brain and skull.            Pride, 66, sought medical advice after suffering severe headaches, according to his manager, John Daines. The surgery was performed over the weekend at an undisclosed hospital.            Daines said the Country Music Hall of Famer was alert and awake in the hospital Monday and could be released as soon as Tuesday.             Pride's nine-date tour of Canada that was scheduled to begin this week has been rescheduled for August. He plans to rest and recover at his Dallas home for four to six weeks, and is expected to make a full recovery.            The country crooner's career spans 40 years. He was signed by legendary RCA Records exec Chet Atkins in 1965 and since then has gone on to sell over 70 million albums.             According to his Website, www.charleypride.com, he is RCA's second-highest selling act of all time, after Elvis Presley.            His biggest hits include "Kiss an Angel Good Morning" and "All I Have to Offer You (Is Me)". His latest album, Comfort of her Wings was released in April 2003 by Music City Records.            If his health permits, Pride is scheduled to play dates across the U.S. this summer and into the fall.
