Working from home used to be so taboo, but these days everyone does it.From bloggers to stay-at-home moms to entrepreneurs, pretty much everyone needs that quiet creative space that's all their own. But having a dedicated area to get your work done (whatever it may be) is the easy part.Once you've decided on a location, you have to decorate it. And how you decorate it says a lot about you. For instance, if you're in the millennial set, go for the metallic. Lots of gold sculptures, brass chair legs and more.

And then there's fabric: Whatever you do make sure it's luxe. A furry white rug, a plush pink bench or a stuffed leather chair are all good options.Just think of millenial style as a cross between cute and sophisticated. 

Into it, aren't you?
