Josh Kelly is feeling quite a bit lighter these days.The actor dropped a significant amount of weight for the third season of the critically acclaimed Lifetime series UnReal in order to showcase the internal battle his character is facing on the show.In case you missed it, Kelly plays Everlasting cameraman Jeremy Caner who is now grappling with the fact that he helped orchestrate a car crash, which seemingly killed a producer and an undercover journalist during the season two finale of the show.

"I lost 70 pounds after the second season," Kelly told a small group of reporters at the Television Critics Association's summer press tour yesterday, per The Hollywood Reporter.He continued, "[Jeremy is] dealing subconsciously but he's not yet dealing with, consciously, the fact that he may or may not have killed people. You know when someone's clean sober but clearly something's up in their head? They're like, 'No, but look, I'm totally fine. Look, I'm skinny, everything's good.'"

This is just the latest turn of events for Kelly's character who has also been dealing with a breakup from his ex-girlfriend Rachel (played by Shiri Appleby) that turned sour after things got physical."My first season went one way. Second season went a completely different direction," Kelly explained. "For the third season, I really got to change it up, and it was a lot of fun."
