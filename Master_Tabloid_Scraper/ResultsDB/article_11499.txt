Hyun-jin Ryu -- DON'T BLAME ANNOUNCER FOR JINXING PERFECT GAME ... Says Vin Scully /nYou CAN'T blame Dodgers announcer Charley Steiner for jinxing Hyun-jin Ryu's perfect game yesterday ... even though he started talking about it with only 6 outs to go ... so sayeth Vin Scully. Dodgers fans started cringing at the top of the 8th inning when Steiner brought up Sandy Koufax -- and mentioned how Ryu was only 6 outs away from joining the Hall of Fame as the only other Dodger to throw a perfect game. Two pitches later ... it was all over. But according to Vin Scully (via an L.A. Times interview from  1960) ... you can't blame the play-by-play guy. "I've called two near no-hitters this year. And have kept the listeners informed from the fourth inning on, " Scully said at the time.   "It's insulting the listeners to make them think they're silly and superstitious enough to believe my telling them that a no-hitter is going will affect the game. "So there you have it ... Steiner, you're off the hook. [H /T Awful Announcing]  /n
