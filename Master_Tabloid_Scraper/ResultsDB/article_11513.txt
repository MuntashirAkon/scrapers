Linda Hogan -- Returning to Reality TV ... in a Wedding Gown/nLinda Hogan isn't gonna let a little thing like NOT having a fianc√© stop her from searching for the perfect wedding dress -- and then documenting that search on reality TV show. Five years after the demise of  "Hogan Knows Best, " Linda will return to the world of reality to appear on the season premiere of TLC's show  "Brides of Beverly Hills " -- even though she's not a bride (or even close to being one). Sources close to the production tell us, 53-year-old Linda was originally booked on the reality show while still engaged to her 23-year-old ex Charley Hill ... but that relationship bit the dust back in May. We're told, despite no longer having a wedding to plan for, Linda still wanted to tape her special episode -- which features her  "search for the perfect gown. "We spoke to Linda and she tells us ... she wanted to do  "BOBH " regardless of her situation, because it shows  "the other side of weddings " -- and that sometimes they don't work out./n
