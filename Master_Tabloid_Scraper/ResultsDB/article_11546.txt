Michelle Rodriguez may have starred in five Fast and the Furious movies, but she’s ready to walk away from the franchise if things don’t change.

The actress celebrated the digital release of The Fate of the Furious by threatening to leave the series. In an Instagram post, Michelle wrote she “might have to say goodbye to a loved franchise” if better material isn’t provided to the female cast.
“F8 is out digitally today, I hope they decide to show some love to the women of the franchise on the next one. Or I just might have to say goodbye to a loved franchise,” she captioned a photo collage of her co-stars. “It’s been a good ride & Im grateful for the opportunity the fans & studio have provided over the years… One Love.”

While Charlize Theron, Helen Mirren, and Gal Gadot have joined the franchise in recent years, Michelle believes the films are still primarily dominated by men.
“It does weigh heavy on my head — especially in the male-dominated environment that I work in,” told Entertainment Weekly earlier this year. “At the end of the day, the only leverage I have as an individual is my participation. That’s the only leverage I ever use with anything. It’s like, look, this doesn’t agree with my ethics, morals. My heart doesn’t feel right doing this in front of millions of people, so I can always oblige myself and depart because money, to me, isn’t as important as my lines that you’re not allowed to cross.”
