Love is in the air for Lady Gaga!

The “Million Reasons” singer was spotted canoodling with new boyfriend Christian Carino during a seaside stroll in the Hamptons. Clad in matching white hats, the two lovebirds looked positively smitten with each other as they held hands.
Via TMZ:
Lady Gaga’s last day of Spring played out just like the ‘Little Mermaid’ t- shirt she was wearing Tuesday while out with her agent-turned-boyfriend, Christian Carino.
The couple looked totally enamored with each other on a beach walk Tuesday in the Hamptons. News they were dating first came out in February, around Gaga’s Super Bowl halftime gig.
