By Radar Staff
A Glee star’s lesbian lover was in a Georgia court last week in an ongoing custody battle with her ex-husband, RadarOnline.com is exclusively reporting.
 Dot Marie Jones’ live-in girlfriend, Bridgett Casteen, 39, has two children with ex-husband Jack Parham, and is fighting him for custody.
 In an exclusive interview with Radar, Bridgett says, “I sued my  ex-husband for custody so that I can have my children in California with  me and Dot.  We had a verbal agreement where I was providing food and  clothes for them.  It wasn’t until we went to court earlier this month  that we were told by a judge that the verbal agreement didn’t have legal  standing, and that I owed $28,000.  I immediately paid $10,000 of that  amount.”

Bridgett’s caring grandmother Mabel White tells us, “The girls live with their father in Georgia and Bridgett  comes to see them every month and has them for holidays. She wants the  girls to go live with her so hopefully they can next year. She’s found a  job now so she wants to pay off her bills which she couldn’t before.
“Dot  has come here to visit me and she’s very nice and supportive. She’s a  great lady,” Mabel says of the actress who has a recurring role as Coach  Shannon on the Fox series.
