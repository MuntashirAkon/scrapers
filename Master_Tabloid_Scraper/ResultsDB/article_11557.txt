RuPaul is bringing back more Drag Race all-stars for season 3, henny.
VH1 announced Monday it has greenlit a third edition of the reality competition spin-off, which reunites formerly ousted RuPaul’s Drag Race cast members for another chance at winning the title and securing a place in the Drag Race Hall of Fame, next to prior All Stars champions Chad Michaels and Alaska.
“The world is calling out to see more of these beautiful queens and I am going to give them every bit of it they can handle,” RuPaul, who also executive produces and hosts the series, said via statement. “These All Stars represent the best of the breasts, legs, and thighs. They are giving everything and you’re not going to want to miss it!”

Filming for All-Stars‘ third season reportedly began in July, the same month RuPaul’s Drag Race scored seven Emmy nods — including one for Outstanding Reality Competition Series, making it the first LGBT-oriented show to land a nomination in the category.
Companion series Untucked — a behind-the-scenes aftershow that airs online after new Drag Race episodes — has additionally been renewed for another season, following its debut Emmy nomination among the Unstructured Reality Program set, and will premiere alongside season 10 of the main competition next year.
All Stars‘ third season is expected to debut at the top of 2018, with the 10th season of Drag Race following in spring.
