“Sometimes I have to resist the urge to speak,” Willis says. “I learned it from dealing with my kids. That’s my number-one rule.”
“It applies in life,” he says. “But it’s more about being a father. I’d rather hear what they have to say. You learn more by listening. And this stuff is just a matter of not equating drama with actions that will help them. Teach them to shun drama.”

Another rule of parenting from Willis?
“Take responsibility for when you are wrong,” he says. “They hear you own up, and they learn to own up.”

“You have to give them a code,” he explains, before getting to the fourth rule. “Beginning with things like ‘Don’t bite people.’ That becomes something like ‘It’s not okay to be mean. Ever.’ That was our watchword when the girls were younger.”
