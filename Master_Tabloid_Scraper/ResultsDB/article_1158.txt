By Radar Staff
Bruce Willis has become a father again – at 57!
The Die Hard Star – who already has three daughters with ex Demi Moore – became a dad for the fourth time Sunday when his new wife Emma Heming Willis gave birth to a little girl, Mabel Ray, who weighed in at 9lb, 1oz.
A rep for the actor says the couple is “overjoyed about the newest member of their family. Both mother and baby are healthy and doing beautifully.”

Willis married the British designer/lingerie model in March, 2009 and previously seemed indifferent to having more children.
At one time, he said: “I’d like to have a thousand more children, or zero more children. It doesn’t matter. Emma makes me feel great.” 
Willis is already dad to daughters Rumer, 23, Scout, 20, and 18-year-old Tallulah.
