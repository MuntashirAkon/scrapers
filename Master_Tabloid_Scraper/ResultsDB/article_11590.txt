Killer Mike Says 'Big Brother' Star Has the Right to Be Stupid /nKiller Mike's take on freedom of speech is simple -- even stupid people have the right to do stupid crap. We got Mike at LAX Tuesday night and asked him for his take on the  "Big Brother " controversy. You'll recall, 'BB' star PaulÂ Abrahamian planned to wear blackface for a stunt to mock a fellow houseguest ... who is black. Mike's adamant -- people have the right to be stupid but not without consequence. In Paul's case, the firestorm's already impacted his family's life ... his mom says she's received death threats but she insists her son's not a racist./n
