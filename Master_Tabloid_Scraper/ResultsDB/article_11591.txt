Rumi and Sir Carter Birth Certificates, Delivered by Kardashians' OB/GYN/nNow we know ... Rumi Carter is the big sis and Sir is the little bro -- their birth certificates reveal when and how they came into the world. TMZ obtained the docs forÂ Beyonce and Jay-Z's twins, and it nails down their delivery date and time -- June 13 at 5:13 AM. Rumi came out first, and Sir followed shortly thereafter. What's really interesting is the doctor who pulled off the delivery -- none other than Dr. Paul Crane. The same guy who delivered Kim and Kourtney Kardashian's 5 kids ... and Rob and Blac Chyna's little girl, Dream. That guy's catcher's mitt is well-worn!/n
