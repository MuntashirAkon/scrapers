Klay Thompson's Dad Says Carmelo Anthony On The Rockets Would Be Serious Threat To Warriors/nKlay Thompson's dad, Mychal, says the Warriors better hope the Carmelo Anthony trade is dead, 'cause if the Rockets get Melo, they'll be a legit threat to dethrone his son's team. Houston's already stacked with James Harden and CP3 ... so we asked Thompson -- a former NBA stud himself -- if acquiring Melo would make the Rockets the best team in the league.  "You add Carmelo Anthony to Chris Paul and James Harden, you gotta take them serious. " But is it enough to topple KD, Steph, Klay and Draymond? We also talked to Mychal about Klay's epic dance moves in China ... guess where KK got those moves./n
