New Details Emerge About Russell Brand's Baby With FiancÃ©e Laura Gallacher â€” Find Out The Little One's Sex & Name HERE!/n

Russell Brand is the proud poppa of a baby girl!
As we previously reported, the comedian and his fiancÃ©e Laura Gallacher welcomed their little one into the world sometime late last week after an under the radar pregnancy!
And it seems the twosome have already named their new arrival as it's been reported Brand's daughter's moniker is Mabel. What sweetness!

Not to mention, Laura's sister Kirsty Gallacher confirmed the sex of her niece when she took to Twitter on Wednesday and posted: 

Thanks for messages, proud to be an auntie for first timeâ€¦ well done to @DaisyPoppets & @rustyrockets. Sadly can't meet her â€™til am well ðŸ˜”

Awwww!
Still, we have a feeling Katy Perry's ex won't be rushing to announce his newborn's sex as he previously explained on The Jonathan Ross Show:
"We don't know the gender. I may not even ever impose a gender upon itâ€”let the child grow up and be whatever the hell it is."
Honestly, that's a smart parenting move. Also, the new parents have been pretty tightlipped about their latest addition. Although the Forgetting Sarah Marshall star DID let it slip his baby girl had finally arrived during a show on Sunday. Classic, Russell!
Congrats you two!
