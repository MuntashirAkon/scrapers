Amy Robach Apologizes Over Racial Slur 'Mistake' On 'GMA'/n
Time for a mea culpa! Good Morning America co-anchor Amy Robach made a big apology on Monday, after letting the term “colored people” slip during a live broadcast on the show.
The 43-year-old had been filling in for rumored rival Robin Roberts on a diversity segment, when she noted recent criticism for casting white actors “in what one might assume should be a role reserved for colored people.”
Backlash occurred immediately online, with Twitter users calling her comment “offensive.” One fan even threatened to stop watching the show altogether.

#amyrobach "Colored people"? Honest? Last time I recall that term it was either Edith Wharton or Virginia Woolf.

Robach managed to recover from the flub quickly, however, releasing a statement shortly after the show explaining that she had meant to say “people of color.”
The GMA host called the whole thing a “mistake” and “not at all a reflection of how I feel or speak in my everyday life.”

@gma Oh the horror #amyrobach said. Flog her & send her to interior of Mississippi. More 2 worry bout than this.  What does NAACP stand 4.
