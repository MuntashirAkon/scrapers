Robert De Niro & Usher Team Up For 'Hands Of Stone' Film — Watch The Trailer!/n
Robert De Niro, Usher, Edgar Ramirez and Ana de Armas have teamed up for this summer’s biggest boxing blockbuster!
Hands of Stone follows the life of Roberto Duran (Edgar Ramirez), the Panamanian fighter who made his professional debut in 1968 as a 16 year‐old and retired in 2002 at the age of 50.
In June 1980, with the help of his trainer Ray Arcel (Robert de Niro), he defeated Sugar Ray Leonard (Usher Raymond) to capture the WBC welterweight title, but shocked the boxing world by returning to his corner in their November rematch, famously saying the words “no mas.”
