Boxing legend Roberto Duran wants to test Donald Trump’s strength!

Ramirez is playing Duran in a new film about the Panamanian boxer’s life, and helped translate Duran’s answers.
One question posed to the boxing legend was, “who would you most like to step in the ring with today?”
Duran did not hesitate to respond saying, “I would like to step in the ring with Donald Trump to see how many Latinos he’s going to deport and to see how strong he really thinks he is.”

Defending his country and culture, Duran, who is beloved in Panama, went on to say that Trump’s controversial statements against Latinos has ignited a culture war. Getting in the ring with Trump would allow Duran to defend his people.
Trump has yet to respond to the challenge, but considering that Duran’s professional record includes almost 70 knockouts, it might be best to stay out of the ring.
