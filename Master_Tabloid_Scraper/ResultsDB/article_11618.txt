Star Wars Meets Horror In This HIGHlarious Cosplay Mashup!/n

The best thing about convention season? It gives us that sweet, sweet costume fix three months before Halloween!
The first great one we've seen this year has to be this ridic Star Wars/horror literature mashup: Edgar Allan Poe Dameron!

Cosplayer Beth Grimes blew away fans on the floor of Minnesota's CONvergence this past weekend, and the pic has since gone viral.
She tweeted:

The clever outfit even got the stamp of approval from the official Star Wars Twitter account, who sent her:

Amazing!
But Grimes isn't in it for viral fame; it's all about the laughs! She told Buzzfeed:

"I was just glad it got a good laugh. My favorite part is when people look you up and down and you can tell they are trying to figure out what the costume is, then after a beat IT CLICKS! There's a chuckle or a groan or they yell, 'I GET IT NOW!"
Here's another one Grimes shared from last year — see if it clicks for you:

Thanks for all the love for Edgar Allan Poe Dameron! For those who didn't see it, I was Purple Rey (a play on Purple Rain) last year! pic.twitter.com/ubIk0msCZC

We're guessing that's her Little Ren Corvette beside her? Ha! Stellar work, gurl!
