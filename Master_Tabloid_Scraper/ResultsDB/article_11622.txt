Sry, GaGa! Penelope Cruz Takes The Role Of Donatella Versace In American Crime Story Season 3!/n

Alert the fashion authorities — Ryan Murphy has finally found his Donatella Versace!
Fans were upset to learn earlier this year that Lady GaGa would not be playing the fashion icon in the third season of FX's American Crime Story, despite being kinda the perfect casting choice.
But now all is forgiven, as Murphy traded in the American stunt casting for a European acting treasure — by which we mean Oscar winning actress Penelope Cruz!
According to reports, the Vicky Cristina Barcelona star is set to play the lead role in Versace: American Crime Story!

The third installment of the crime anthology series will explore the murder of Gianni Versace (Edgar Ramirez), who was killed on the steps of his home in Miami Beach by serial killer Andrew Cunanan (Darren Criss).
Cunanan slayed five people that year before killing himself on a houseboat eight days after murdering Versace.
And based on her past roles, we have a feeling Cruz will totally slay this role. Tell us, Perezcious Readers, do YOU think the Spanish beauty will do a better job than GaGa would have?
