Emily Blunt and John Krasinski matched in Prada on the red carpet of The Girl on the Train’s New York City premiere, which means that the bar on coordinating couple fashion has been raised indefinitely.

Blunt wore a cascading, floor-length, custom Prada gown to the film’s premiere on Tuesday night (Oct. 4, 2016) while Krasinski sported a Prada tuxedo.

The premiere was also attended by Blunt’s castmates Justin Theroux, Laura Prepon, and Haley Bennett. Her co-star Edgar Ramirez nicknamed her “The Girl in the Dress.” See? The puns are endless.
Blunt and Krasinski will be starring in a table read of Good Will Hunting in New York on Oct. 7 with Krasinski serving as the director.
