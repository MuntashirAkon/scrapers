Aww! In fact, this most recent update comes shortly after Chad's PLL costar Sasha Pieterse announced her engagement and the drama's creator I. Marlene King noted that the hit show was not confirmed to end after seven seasons. Whoa!
It's a good time to be a member of that cast. LOLz!
Congrats again to the expecting parents! Be sure to let us know the MINUTE you pick a baby name.
WE KID…sort of.
