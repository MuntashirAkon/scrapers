Ryan Murphy has found his leading men for the Versace edition of American Crime Story: Edgar Ramirez (Joy) and Darren Criss (Glee) have been cast as Gianni Versace and Andrew Cunanan, respectively.
The talented designer behind the same-named fashion house, Versace was shot by killer Cunanan outside the steps of his Miami home. Cunanan later died by suicide before police could figure out a motive for Versace’s death.
The Versace story is expected to air after season 2’s Katrina: American Crime Story, which is scheduled to premiere in 2018.
