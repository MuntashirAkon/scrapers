Mabel comes from a musical family!
Her mother is the iconic Neneh Cherry. And her uncle is Eagle Eye Cherry. Her grandparents were also musicians, so music is in her blood.
The Brit is making a name for herself for her specific brand of R&B pop. It is empowering. And it is effortlessly cool!
We can't get enough of her and her song Know Me Better!
