Leonardo DiCaprio Keeps Way Too Many Secrets in J. Edgar/n
Not only does the trailer reveals glimpses of Leo holding forth as both young Hoover and old with what just might be his most self-important accent since 2006's Blood Diamond, but it also shows the moral ambiguities of the lawman, whose life was the subject of endless speculation.From questionable ethics about his willingness to bend "the rules a little," such as spying on Eleanor Roosevelt and Civil Rights activists, to rumors of an affair with his number two, Clyde Tolson (Armie Hammer), portraying the controversial crimefighter on the big screen has always been a difficult endeavor."When morals decline and good men do nothing, evil flourishes," DiCaprio's J. Edgar Hoover intones darkly.With a supporting cast also including Judi Dench and Naomi Watts and a screenplay by Milk scribe Dustin Lance Black, Eastwood and Co. look poised to pull it off come Oscar time.
