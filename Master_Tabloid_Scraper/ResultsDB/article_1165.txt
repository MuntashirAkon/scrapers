The Birdcage actor's rep noted:

"Nathan and Devlin were married in a small ceremony in New York City this week. Everyone is extremely happy."
That's AH-Mazing! Though we are curious to learn if any A-Listers turned up to the private ceremony?? HA!
In case you forgot, the funnyman and his producer-love recently worked together to create a children's book called Naughty Mabel â€” which just happens to be based on their adorable French Bulldog. Talk about #RelationshipGoals!
In a previous interview, Delvin shared:

"She's become our version of a child .. really all she wants is for you to pick her up and hold her like a baby."
Awww! However, Nathan later quipped:

"She's a little neurotic and needy at times. It's like living with a supermodel. And now that she's become a celebrity, you know, it's very difficult."
HIGHlarious! We can't be the only ones that want to attend a dinner party at their home, right?!
Congrats again you two. Let us know if you EVER need a dog sitter. LOLz!
