Talk about a tease!Director Edgar Wright took to Twitter on Wednesday to give fanboys (and fangirls) a first glimpse from the set of the highly anticipated Ant-Man."Now I'm back in LA, it's high time to finish something I've been working on...," the man behind such films as The World's End and Shaun of the Dead wrote along with the above photo.While details about the long-in-development project (like who exactly will be playing the Marvel superhero) are still relatively unknown, this pic is definitely a step in the right direction.

If you recall, Wright screened an Ant-Man test shoot during San Diego Comic-Con 2012 that lasted for about 30 seconds.At the time, he said, "I'm taking the Terrence Malick approach when it comes to superheroes," referring to the lenghty period of time he's been supposedly working on the script and name-checking a director who takes a notoriously long time between films.Well, seeing how the movie isn't scheduled to be released until July 2015, that quote probably isn't too far off the mark.Of course, we're counting down the days nevertheless!
