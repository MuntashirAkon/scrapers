UFC's Max Holloway Wants Tag Team Match Vs. Frankie Edgar & Cub Swanson/nUFC star Max Holloway is calling for a tag team match -- a 2-on-1 meg-brawl with Cub Swanson and Frankie Edgar ... and let's be honest, THAT SOUNDS AWESOME!!! TMZ Sports spoke with Holloway about the next man on his hit list -- and he told us he's ready to fight both dudes ... even if it's at the same time. Yeah, we know it ain't gonna happen -- but we can dream, right? On a serious tip, Holloway has a real message for Dana White about why the UFC should host a major event in Hawaii ... and it's a pretty compelling argument./n
