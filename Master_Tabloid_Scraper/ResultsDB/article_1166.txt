Bruce Willis And Wife Emma Heming-Willis Have TWO Adorable Little Girls On Their Hands!/n

Aww! 
This is SO sweet! 
Bruce Willis' wife Emma Heming-Willis gave the world an ah-mazing present when she shared one of the most adorable pictures we've seen all week! 
The Instagram photo featured the couple's children: newborn baby girl Evelyn and her big sister Mabel, together in an adorable state! 
Here's what the hawt momma wrote in the pic's caption: 
"The start of a beautiful friendship #MabelRay #EvelynPenn"
The start of a lifelong friendship too! 
We know Bruce wants a son real bad, but we bet he wouldn't trade his daughters for any boy in the world! 
Who could?? They're way too cute!
