Johnny Depp is Back in L.A. Working the Comedy Circuit /nJohnny Depp returned to L.A. for the first time since his domestic violence allegations surfaced, and his first stop in public, was a stage at the famous Comedy Store. Depp was at the legendary Sunset Strip location Saturday night with a few friends, including comedianÂ Doug Stanhope ... who's been viciously defending Johnny against Amber Heard. Witnesses tell us Johnny surprised the crowd by getting onstage and mumbled something most people couldn't understand ... it's kinda his thing nowadays. But we're told the crowd went nuts cause no one expected to see him, and it was a great intro for Mat Edgar who was about to perform. #ToughActToFollow/n
