Dana White: B.J. Penn Underachieved ... Shoulda Been One of Best Fighters Ever/nHe's already a UFC Hall of Famer ... but B.J. Penn could have been EVEN BETTER ... so says Dana White﻿, who tells us the guy had the talent be one of the greatest MMA fighters of all time. We spotted White in NYC -- and asked if there was a fighter who had insane raw talent ... but didn't have the drive to reach their full potential.   "B.J. Penn, " White said ...  "B.J. Penn probably should have been one of the best ever ... to ever live ... to ever do it. B.J. was so talented. "  "I think B.J. in his own words would go back and do things differently if he could. " B.J. was 28-10-2 in his MMA career -- but couldn't figure out a way to beat guys like Frankie Edgar (lost 3 times) and Georges St-Pierre (lost twice).  Still, Dana admits ... the guy was  "awesome.
