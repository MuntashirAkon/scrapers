‘The Baby Might Come Now!’ Kailyn Lowry Admits If She’s Finally In Labor/n
Kailyn Lowry is ready to pop, but will it be today? The Teen Mom 2 star revealed if Baby Lo is finally on the way!
Lowry, 26, tweeted that she was brought to tears when she watched a contestant perform on America’s Got Talent.
“Isaac said the baby might come now cause I’m crying,” the MTV star tweeted.
But unfortunately, Isaac, 7, who is Lowry’s son from a previous relationship with Jo Rivera, he has yet to meet his baby brother or sister.

“On the road bright and early for soccer camp,” Lowry tweeted the next day. “I guess this makes me a soccer mom.”
She then posted videos and photos on Snapchat of Isaac and her son Lincoln, 3, with ex-husband Javi Marroquin.
Lowry is expecting her third child with her third baby daddy Chris Lopez. She will continue to be a single mother when her child is born, as her baby daddy has not been involved in her pregnancy.
“Kail became a relationship of convenience for him,” a source close to Lowry told Radar. “He never actually loved her. It was a relationship, but he just decided he wanted something different and things didn’t work out so they went their separate ways.”

Despite their rocky relationship, the insider revealed she would reach out to him when she goes into labor.
“She wants to give him the opportunity to see his child being born,” the source said. “She never said Chris couldn’t be involved with his child. She would hope he would want that, but she won’t force it or chase him to do so.”
When do you think she’ll give birth? Will Lopez be there? Tell us in the comments!
