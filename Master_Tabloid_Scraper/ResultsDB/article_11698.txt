“Been getting a lot of texts asking if I’m in labor lol,” she tweeted. “I’m not.”
Yesterday, she stunned during a maternity photo shoot at the beach.

When Lowry does go into labor, she may be welcoming her child, who she does not know the gender of, without her third baby daddy.
“Kail became a relationship of convenience for him,” a source close to Lowry told Radar. “He never actually loved her. It was a relationship, but he just decided he wanted something different and things didn’t work out so they went their separate ways.”
Despite their estrangement, she will reach out to him when she goes into labor.

“She wants to give him the opportunity to see his child being born,” the insider said. “She never said Chris couldn’t be involved with his child. She would hope he would want that, but she won’t force it or chase him to do so.”
