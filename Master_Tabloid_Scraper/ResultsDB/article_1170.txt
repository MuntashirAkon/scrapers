Bruce Willis’ Wife Emma Heming Snapped Breastfeeding in First Photo of Baby Evelyn/n
There aren’t words to describe how beautiful new mothers and fathers are with their children and celebrities aren’t any different.
Long story short, Bruce Willis is a new dad (again) and his wife Emma Heming shared the first photo of their baby girl Evelyn just a few hours ago.


The tender moment was shared Saturday on Emma’s Instagram, showing her little girl eating “the breakfast of champions.” And hysterically, she even gives B. Willis a photo credit.
The 59-year-old  father of five and 35-year-old Heming welcomed the bundle of joy just two weeks ago, this photo being the first time she’s been introduced to the world.
Thankfully, Heming, who’s other daughter with Willis is 2-years-old, apparently has no qualms breastfeeding in public. She even joked about it on Twitter saying, “Nothing like answering the door and realizing your boob is hanging out after the fact #BreastfeedingMom.”
She also often jokes about the difficulties of raising two young children.
A shower And I brushed my teeth! Now that's twitter news worthy, right? #NewMomOfTwo Trying to figure this thing out!

Willis is also dad to daughters Mabel, 2, Tallulah, 20, Scout, 22, and Rumer, 25.
“[We] didn’t know what we were gonna have until the baby came out,” Willis told People last week. “In general, I think women should be in charge of everything. Women are just much smarter than men.” He added, “Even if I had boys, I’d still feel the same way.”


can you guess who these celeb babies belong to?!?
