Oscar Isaac has a little one on the way — and no, we’re not talking about the fake baby bump co-star Olivia Wilde has been recently sporting on the set of Life Itself.

The Star Wars: The Force Awakens actor is expecting his first child with girlfriend Elvira Lind, according to E! News. While the notoriously private couple have not confirmed the report, Lind was recently spotted in New York City with a budding baby bump underneath a loose-fitting maxi dress.
Isaac and Lind, a documentary director, first made their romance public at the 2016 Golden Globes. While accepting his award for his work in Show Me a Hero, the 38-year-old seemingly confirmed the relationship by kissing Lind on the lips on his way to the podium.
