A How I Met Your Mother spinoff is finally on the way and it’s being brought to you by the writers of this year’s hit show, This Is Us. 

Hollywood Reporter reports that the spinoff, How I Met Your Father, is currently being developed by This Is Us co-writers Isaac Aptaker and Elizabeth Berger. The show will be told from a woman’s point of view and will narrate a totally new story with completely different characters, but still tell the story of how the main character met her spouse.

The original series’ creators Carter Bays and Craig Thomas will serve as executive producers on the show, but will not be directly involved in its development. Bays and Thomas paired up with Saturday Night Live alum Emily Spivey in 2014 to create How I Met Your Dad, which would have starred Greta Gerwig, but the pilot was never picked up.
