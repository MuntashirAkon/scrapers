Divorce can get ugly, but Mary J. Blige’s split with her husband, Martin “Kendu” Isaacs, is just plain messy.

According to the singer, her ex is refusing to return some of her most prized possession — including a Grammy Awards. In legal documents obtained by TMZ, Blige accuses Isaacs of withholding “achievement awards” and several luxury vehicles leased under her company’s name.
While Blige offers to let Isaacs, who was once her manager, keep their Mercedes C300, she’s demanding the return of a Range Rover and a Mercedes SL550 as part of their divorce. The 45-year-old is also demanding that Isaacs pay back the $420,000 he allegedly took but never used on business expenses.
As previously reported, Blige filed for divorce from Isaacs in July after 12 years of marriage.
In September, Isaacs filed a petition asking for spousal support and for his estranged wife to pay for his lawyer. He listed the date of their separation as July 25, 2016.
