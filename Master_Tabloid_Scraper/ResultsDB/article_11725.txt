It looks like a new little X-wing fighter pilot is on his (or her) way: Star Wars: The Force Awakens star Oscar Isaac and his girlfriend Elvira Lind are expecting a baby together.
The private couple were spotted Monday out and about in New York City, with Lind’s blossoming baby belly peeking through her maxi dress.
They also appeared together at the 2016 Golden Globes, where the actor, 38, took home the award for best actor in a limited series or TV movie for his work in Show Me a Hero.
