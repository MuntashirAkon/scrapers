"From the planet Moon," the 53-year-old fashion designer repeats as we're left hoping that a producer quickly performs a Google search. "Isn't the moon a star?" Treacy replies, suddenly questioning her facts. And that's when the conversation really took a turn for the worse. "No, the moon is a planet, darling," Mizrahi says before Treacy continues, seemingly becoming more baffled as time continues, "Is the Moon really a planet? Don't look at me like that. The Sun is a star ... Is the Sun not a star?"

"I don't know what the Sun is," Mizrahi admits. We'll spare you our reaction since, let's be honest, the poor model's face says it all.
