Sorry, fellas. Isaac Mizrahi is officially off the market.The fashion designer and Project Runway: All Stars judge revealed on The Wendy Williams Show this week that he and his boyfriend of six years, Arnold Germer, quietly eloped in a private ceremony last fall.

"We've been together for six years, but we met 10 years ago," the   50-year-old newlywed explained to Wendy during the interview, after she  finally took notice of the gold band gracing his wedding finger. "We  didn't think we wanted to get  married until they said we could in New  York, and then it was like,  'We're getting married!'"

And while the private ceremony still proved overwhelming for the fashionisto."I started sobbing," he said, recounting the justice of the   peace-manned ceremony. "It was one of those moments, I wasn't expecting   that kind of emotional, emotional impact. I think when it's right, you   know it."And take heart, left out friends and family. Mizrahi and Germer haven't ruled out a massive celebration just yet."I think on the year-end anniversary, we'll have like a giant thing,"   he said. "And yes, I will call Vera Wang, and she will do my dress."Congrats, Isaac!
