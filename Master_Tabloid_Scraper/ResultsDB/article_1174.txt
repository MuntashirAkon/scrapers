Pauly D’s Ready to Meet His Baby — and Have Sleepovers/n
Pauly D has been eagerly anticipating meeting his baby girl that he’s already taking his daddy duties to heart — by decorating the nursery, Celebuzz has learned.
“He has a home in Rhode Island and Las Vegas and he just decked out the whole place in Rhode Island for his little girl,” a source told CB!. “The nursery is ready and he bought everything.”

Up next, he plans on outfitting his Sin City crib with a crib of its own and much more.
All this comes after the reality-star-turned-DJ is finally visiting with 5-month-old Amabella for the first time Wednesday, CB! can confirm.
“They’re meeting today and he’s been beyond excited,” added our insider. “He even flew in early from Las Vegas to get to the back east in time.”
According to the source, Pauly’s been waiting on the East Coast since Sunday for word from the lawyers in each camp that the meeting was a go.
“He just found out today. It’s only for a few hours, but he is so happy.”
But don’t get any ideas, this still doesn’t mean Amanda Markert and Pauly are on good terms. The 26-year-old baby mama even took to Twitter begging the Jersey Shore star to “bond” with their baby. But that’s not the reason behind the meet-up.
“This was all done through their lawyers. They definitely don’t speak… and won’t. But she insisted on being there for the reunion,” said the source.
Pauly and Amabella are meeting at an undisclosed location in New Jersey as we speak, and there’s no doubt they’re having some adorable daddy-daughter moments.
