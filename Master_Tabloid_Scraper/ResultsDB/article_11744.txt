The 'Real' Captain Phillips -- I'm No Captain Stubing/nCaptain Richard Phillips -- the real-life HERO behind the Tom Hanks movie  "Captain Phillips " -- tells TMZ he wasn't inspired by the  "Love Boat " ... 'cause that show SUCKED. At least, that's what we think he said ... he's got a pretty thick Massachusetts accent. Here's the deal, CP was at an event in D.C. yesterday and we jokingly asked if he was inspired by the classic '80s TV show. Â It sounded like he said,  "Not at all. Poor TV in port. " Some people in the office think he said,  "In poor " instead of  "in port " ... but that wouldn't really make much sense. We've literally been debating this for 10 minutes.Either way, dude's a hero ... he wasn't a huge  "Love Boat " fan and we should all probably see his movie. It's what Isaac Washington would want .../n
