2 Chainz Makes It Rain ... On Anti-Gravity Strippers [VIDEO]/nIsaac Newton was full of crap -- 2 Chainz made it thunderstorm last night on a bunch of strippers in Phoenix ... and the laws of physics DID NOT APPLY.It all went down at Essex Gentlemen's Club -- 2 Chainz was hosting some after party -- and you have to see the video to believe it. At one point, a stripper twerks UPSIDE-DOWN on another stripper ... while the other stripper spins on the pole. It's some really groundbreaking stuff.And if that wasn't awesome enough, one of the girls' names is Spyda.What hoes up must ho down./n
