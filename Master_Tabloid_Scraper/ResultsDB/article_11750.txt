Britney Spears: Hamburger Helper?/nLooks like Britney Spears has a backup plan if her stalled musical comeback flops ... and it involves a paper hat.    var config = new Array(); config[ "videoId "] = 433480809; config[ "videoRef "] = null; config[ "lineupId "] = null; config[ "playerTag "] = null; config[ "autoStart "] = false; config[ "preloadBackColor "] =  "#FFFFFF "; config[ "width "] = 400; config[ "height "] = 350; config[ "playerId "] = 353549946; createExperience(config, 8); Wanting a snack and attention, the pop star and a few close friends hit Hamburger Mary's restaurant in West Hollywood last night to chow down on a plate of nachos. During the meal, the ladies snapped several photos of each other at their booth before taking the picture-party to the center of the eatery.Late for a date at a recording studio, the posse made their way out of Mary's back door. A stuffed Spears made sure to thank the curious cooks, and offered to  "work in your kitchen one night. " Brit and K-Fed might have something in common after all.Brit and company then shot over to Record Plant studio, where she met up with R&B star Chris Brown and Tabu from the Black Eyed Peas --but the only guest she seemed to care about was her new boytoy, Isaac Cohen. As the K-Fed-alike and a female friend made their way inside, photogs asked,  "Are you and Britney getting married? " The two just laughed.    var config = new Array(); config[ "videoId "] = 433318512; config[ "videoRef "] = null; config[ "lineupId "] = null; config[ "playerTag "] = null; config[ "autoStart "] = false; config[ "preloadBackColor "] =  "#FFFFFF "; config[ "width "] = 400; config[ "height "] = 350; config[ "playerId "] = 353549946; createExperience(config, 8);  After the session, Isaac chivalrously offered his hat to Britney to shield her face from the waiting photogs. (Yes, she's camera shy.) The lovebirds then jumped in a car and sped off into the night.  Related Links      Brit's New Boytoy: What Team Is He on?
