Madonna's 'Confessions' Marks Return to Her Roots/nMadonna is back and this time she's ready to dance. While some of her more recent work has focused on spirituality and politics, 'Confessions On A Dance Floor' is, according to the Material Girl herself,  "about having a good time straight through and non-stop. I want people to jump out of their seats. "  Out in stores today (Nov. 15), 'Confessions On A Dance Floor' features the new single, 'Hung Up,' currently #20 on the Billboard's Hot 100 list.  The new album continues Madonna's recent return to her dance music roots. After finding success in the '80s and '90s with favorites like 'Holiday' and 'Vogue,' Madonna had gone in other directions creatively. But this album is a clear indication that Madonna is looking to capture the feel of her earlier hits.  'Confessions On A Dance Floor' also features the songs 'Get Together,' 'Sorry,' 'Future Lovers,' 'I Love New York,' 'Let It Will Be,' 'Forbidden Love,' 'Jump,' 'How High,' 'Isaac,' 'Push' and 'Like It Or Not.'  The entire CD is seamlessly segued in a classic dance club format.  For more info: www.madonna.com Madonna at AOL Music! Madonna On...
