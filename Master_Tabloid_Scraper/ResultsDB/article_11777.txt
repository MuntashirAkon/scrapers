Limp Bizkit Reunites After 8 Years/n
     
The group that gave us “My Way” is once again doing it their way.
The original band members of Limp Bizkit (Fred Durst, Wes Borland, Sam Rivers, John Otto, and DJ Lethal) have reunited after an 8 year break.
“We decided we were more disgusted and bored with the state of heavy popular music than we were with each other” Fred Durst and Wes Borland told Access Hollywood.
“Regardless of where our separate paths have taken us, we recognize there is a powerful and unique energy with this particular group of people we have not found anywhere else. This is why Limp Bizkit is back.”
The band, which first found major worldwide success with their second album in 1999 called “Significant Other,” will kick off a world tour in thespring.
Limp Bizkit is also planning its first full length studio album in 9 years. /n
