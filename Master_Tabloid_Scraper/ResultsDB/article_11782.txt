Everything You Missed From Demi Lovato's 25th Birthday Party!/n

So much fun!
On Sunday, Demi Lovato rang in her 25th birthday with her closest family and friends (Hi, Wilmer Valderrama!) at Dave & Buster's – and it was complete with twerking, gaming, and laughter all-around!
Even though fans weren't invited, we were able to follow along with all the birthday festivities via Instagram and Snapchat! Bless you, social media.

Clearly, it was enough of a good time to leave the singer feeling some type of way by the end of the night as she penned to Twitter:

Can't sleep.. still on a birthday high!! I love you all so much. Thank you for an incredible birthday!!! #25
