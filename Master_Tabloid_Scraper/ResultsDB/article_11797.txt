Bella Hadid Continues to Rock the ’90s Trend with Rainbow Bellbottoms and Denim Bralette/n
The spirit of the ’90s is still alive — if you’re a supermodel.
Bella Hadid was spotted in New York City on Friday wearing a super ’90s denim ensemble. The supermodel paired flared rainbow jeans with a denim bralette, a white button down shirt, gold hoop earrings and two gold chains.
The 20-year-old has been seen sporting a few ’90s styles this summer, including a head-to-toe plaid ensemble with era-appropriate tiny sunglasses when she hit up Couture Fashion Week in Paris.

And although she has been seen wearing throwback looks, Hadid has also stuck to her traditional go-tos — sexy bikinis and summer styles.
On July 13, Hadid posted a picture of herself in a pool in a green bikini during her Mykonos, Greece, vacation. The picture, set against a beautiful mountainous background, was captioned, “Glow.”

On that same trip, she was spotted with Kendall Jenner splashing around with a group of friends while wearing a white bikini and sexy sheer dress. Jenner wore sheer black cover-up over a black shirt.
