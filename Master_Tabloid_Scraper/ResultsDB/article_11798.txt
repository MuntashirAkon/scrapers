The Moment Billy Ray Cyrus Found Himself 'Slightly Above Rock Bottom'
/n

 
When you’re a boozed-up, aging country singer–turned–Elvis impersonator turned illegitimate preacher, making one measly dollar for a night’s work isn’t the worst thing that could happen — but it’s pretty close.
And that’s just where Vernon Brown, played by Billy Ray Cyrus, finds himself on the latest episode of Still the King.
Cyrus shared an exclusive sneak peek with PEOPLE Now before sharing just how much fun he’s had making CMT’s family comedy with a country twist.
“I set out to do the pilot thinking, ‘If I do one of these, it’ll be great.’ So, we’re like 26 [episodes] into it now,” said the singer/actor, 55. And he couldn’t be more thrilled.
“I love thought of it, the creativity. I love our team, writers. Our cast could not be more incredible. It’s one of the funnest things I’ve ever done in my life,” he added.

In the sneak peek clip, Vernon is finally back in the music game, playing a local bar gig with his band. But there’s a slight problem: Of the $200 they collect for their performance, the house, waitstaff and the kitchen all need to take a cut. Then, like any group of half-decent country singers, they have a hefty bar tab. So, the humbled crooner collects a singular dollar bill, but his attitude is unshaken.
“Slightly above rock bottom, I guess,” Vernon declares with his signature positivity.
Still the King airs Tuesdays (9 p.m. ET) on CMT.
