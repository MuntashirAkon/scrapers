The world is changing. I hope this brings different eyes to the magazine and new audiences," Washington said in a press release regarding the news.

"This is a story and a chapter in my life to build around. I'm enjoying the ride, and right now I'm doing whatever I want to do, day by day. That's how I live. That's what my life is about. As long as I'm doing what I want to do, I'm happy. Right now, being a part of Playboy is what I want to do."In addition to the honor, Washington also receives $100,000 in prize money and a two-year lease on a 2017 Fiat Spider.While legions of new fans will come to recognize her for her sultry poolside photoshoot for the June 2016 issue, the 31-year-old originally came to fame a decade ago as one of Tyra Bank's aspiring models on the hit CW reality show.
