Dutch Princess Mabel Brings Her Child Bride Crusade to New York/n
Two years after her husband’s death at age 44 following a tragic ski accident, Dutch Princess Mabel is stepping back into the spotlight.  
The royal mom of two, 47, has taken a more active role in the charity Girls Not Brides, which campaigns against child marriage.   
“One takes place every two seconds,” the princess recently told an audience in London, snapping her fingers at two-second intervals. “That s 15 million a year.”  
This week sees the princess in New York to bring Girls Not Brides work to a wider audience at the United Nations.

The charity aims to stamp out child marriage – in which girls as young as 9 are married off to significantly older men, sometimes as one wife among many – by 2030.  
“When I was 7, I wanted to be a missionary, with the Bible in hand education books, food and agricultural bring to Africa,” she told Reuters. “But when I look at what I’m doing now, I feel like a 21st- century missionary.”  
Since her husband’s 2013 death following some 18 months in a coma, Princess Mabel of Orange-Nassau has lived quietly in London with her young daughters, 10-year-old Luana and 9-year-old Zaria.   
On Saturday Princess Mabel made a rare public appearance in her homeland, when she joined her brother-in-law King Willem-Alexander, 48, Queen Méxima, 44, and other members of the Dutch royal family at Amsterdam’s neo-Renaissance Theatre Carré to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the founding of the Netherlands.
