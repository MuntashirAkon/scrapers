Mamma mia!Congratulations are in order for Margherita Missoni and her husband, Eugenio Amos!The heir to Italian fashion label Missoni and her race-car driver hubby welcomed their first child, son Otto Hermann Amos, on Friday, Sept. 6.Missoni documented her pregnancy on Instagram and Twitter, often using the hashtag "waitingforotto" to tag everything from a shot of her showing off her bare bambino bump in a bikini to Eugenio lovingly cradling her belly.In fact, she alerted her followers on Thursday that Otto's arrival was imminentâ€”as well as the fact that she'd broken her wrist!

"#KeepOnSmiling #BrokenWrist #WhenTheGameGetsToughJustLaugh @eugenioamos spend the last few hours as a twosome #waitingforotto shouldnt take much longer," she shared, along with a picture of herself standing next to Amos and brandishing her bandaged arm.And it seems her affinity for social media has rubbed off on her hubby, as Amos took to Twitter today to publicly welcome his little one to the world via the social networking site."Benvenuto Otto!" he gushed.We can't wait until either Missoni or Amos share the first picture of their little bundle of joy.Until then, we'll be closely monitoring both of their social streams for any signs of Otto!
