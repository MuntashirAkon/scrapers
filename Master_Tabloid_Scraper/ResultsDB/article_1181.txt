Chad Lowe Says Daughter Mabel Is 'Beloved'/n
There hasn’t been a girl born to Rob and Chad Lowe s family in almost four generations, but that all changed with the birth of Chad s 5-month-old daughter Mabel in May.  
“You can imagine the position she’s in,” Chad Lowe told PEOPLE at Saturday s Children s Institute Hosts Poker for a Cause in Commerce, Calif. “She is the only girl. It is the first Lowe girl born in 72 years. She’s got a lot of doting uncles and cousins. She is beloved.”  
As for older brother Rob as an uncle? “He’s great. The cousins are great, his boys [John, 13, and Matthew, 16],” Lowe adds.  
As a first-time dad, Lowe, an Emmy winner for the show Life Goes On, enjoys coparenting with his fiancée Kim Painter, a film producer.  
“I get up for feedings and try to experience a little bit of what mommies have to go through, which is the sleepless nights,” he notes. “It is the hardest job you will ever love. I love it more than anything.”  
Lowe, who is directing episodes of Brothers & Sisters and Bones this year, in addition to guest-starring on The Ghost Whisperer, gives kudos to Mabel’s mom.  
“Kim is extraordinary with the baby. I can’t believe my good fortune to have a partner that is as committed, loving, tolerant and present as she is. She is the best mom I could ever imagine.”  
Of his own take on parenthood, Lowe, 41, says, “As any parent can say, it just changes your life. It changes your perspective. It has been the greatest gift and joy I could ever possibly imagine.”
