Are you as mad as we are that Animaniacs went off the air?Yes, we still miss it. There's a slapstick comedy-filled hole in our hearts for this show.We have some good news for people who are fans of amazing, awesome, totally underrated things... the '90s cartoon series is now on Netflix.Like, all of it.That's five seasons worth of Yakko, Wakko, and Dot, as well as Dr. Otto Scratchansniff, Hello Nurse, Pinky and the Brain, and Slappy Squirrel.

Fun fact! Did you know Oscar-winning film legend Steven Spielberg was the executive producer for this show?Academy Award collector Steven "Tom Hanks and I hang out on the reg" Spielberg believed in this show.And for good reason: this series was our must-watch 'toon from '93 to '99.Why? Let us count the ways...

We loved that it was a kids show, but there were a ton of risqu√© jokes thrown in there, too, which we now appreciate even more.Apparently if you say "good night, everybody" after it makes it OK to say completely inappropriate things in a cartoon.
