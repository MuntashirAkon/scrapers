Another Homeland finale, another major death. Or at least that's how things look right now. After almost dying multiple times this season, Quinn (Rupert Friend) has officially (most likely) met his end, and it was Carrie (Claire Danes) who had to pull the plug. Quinn was already in pretty bad shape, but a brain hemorrhage turned out to be the last straw. Fresh off of reading Quinn's profession of his love to her, Carrie had to say her goodbyes and let him go at the very end of the episode. At least, that's how it appeared. The doctor claimed that Quinn was brain dead and would not recover, but we will of course have to see what happens when the show returns next year.

This episode also marked a major turning point for Carrie, with two very different job offers making for a potentially very different season six. Saul offered Carrie the chance to pick her own CIA team and head up her own mission, but Otto wants Carrie as his partner at the During Foundation. There were no decisions made, but either direction could hold some great storytelling. Elsewhere, Saul (Mandy Patinkin) finally got a hold of Allison (Miranda Otto), and by that we mean she is no more. He made a deal with Ivan in order to find out where she was, and had her care fired upon. She dead, but we can't say we'll miss her. What did you think of Homeland's season finale?
