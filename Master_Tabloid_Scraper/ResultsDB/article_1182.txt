'Elegance' at 75: The Mabel Mercer Story/n
She is not as well known to the public as some of those she has deeply influenced—Frank Sinatra, for example, once said she taught him everything he knew. Billie Holiday and Nat King Cole were other disciples. And so it was fitting that on her 75th birthday, Mabel Mercer, the reigning grande dame of cafe society entertainment, should be toasted by the most luminous names in her business, as well as by some 400 other close friends and most worshipful fans. The festive dinner-dance was held in the St. Regis Hotel, which houses one of several intimate New York night spots Miss Mercer has made famous since she emigrated here in 1941 from Paris. As its birthday gift, the hotel renamed the lounge where she plays the Mabel Mercer Room.
Some notable music friends—singers Bobby Short and Sylvia Syms and songwriter Cy Coleman—sang their tributes to Miss Mercer, while others—Sinatra, Leontyne Price and Johnny Mathis—sent affectionate messages. The praise was welcome, but embarrassing too, the guest of honor admitted: “I’ve always been shy of singing. It’s a surprise to me when people say nice things. I can’t bear to listen to myself.”
Her audience had no such reservations. After a rousing, stand-up sing-along of Happy Birthday Just after midnight, Miss Mercer took her familiar seat next to the piano. For an hour, this daughter of a white Welsh woman and a black American man who died before she was born sang more than two dozen of her best-known numbers. Her audience sat motionless, as each crisp syllable floated past. To them, Mabel Mercer had again proved why she is, as composer Leonard Bernstein described her that evening, “the eternal guardian of elegance in the world of popular song.”
