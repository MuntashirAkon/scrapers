Throw Me a Frickin' Clone Here!/nAnyone against  "cloning " may have second thoughts after this adorable puppy video of Lancelot Encore -- the first commercially cloned canine in the US.When their original doggy was diagnosed with cancer, Florida couple Edgar and Nina Otto had their pooch's DNA frozen -- and when the original Lancelot died last year, the couple shelled out a huge wad of cash for a scientifically engineered clone! The dog was  "created " in South Korea for the low, low price of $155,000. That's a lot of Puppy Chow!Worth it?/n
