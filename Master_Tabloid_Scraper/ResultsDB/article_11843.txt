Boy George Claims He 'Slept With Prince' In Taping Of The Voice UK/n
Boy George raised eyebrows in claiming he’d slept with Prince during a recent taping of The Voice UK, which caused producers to stop filming in the ruckus.
The “I’ll Tumble 4 Ya” singer made the shocking claim when reviewing notes with fellow judge Paloma Faith about who they’ve worked with in the past.
The Culture Club frontman reportedly told Faith: “I have duetted with some of the greatest soul singers in history including Luther Vandross and Smokey Robinson.”

Paloma shot back, “Well OK, if we’re throwing big soul names out there I’ve performed with Prince.”
The openly-gay singer then dropped the bomb, saying, “Forget that, darling, I’ve slept with Prince.”
Eyewitnesses told the UK Sun about the uproar that erupted upon the 54-year-old’s surprise announcement.
“We just couldn’t believe what he had come out with — and the guys in the gallery were beside themselves. The crowd went absolutely wild because they thought they had just witnessed a massive celebrity exclusive.”
The source continued, “Production staff had to come up on stage and speak to them. After that Boy George started backtracking saying he hadn’t really slept with Prince and that in reality, he just had his poster on his wall.
“But as far as the crowd were concerned, the cat was already out of the bag.” /n
