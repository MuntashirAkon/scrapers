“That comes from cats on tour running around, might have a little wifey back home but you know, ain’t finished doing they thing …” Jay Z told interviewer Luther Campbell as the lingerie-clad women continued their sex session pressed up against him.
“They probably send us about 30, 60 chicks,” Jay Z continued.

The video was reportedly filmed in 1997, five years before Jay and Beyonce met. But the blog points out, “[it] will probably lead to Jay sleeping on the couch if Beyonce ever gets wind of it!” /n
