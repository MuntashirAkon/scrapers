'Lost' Tomi Lahren Really, Really, Really Wants Your Sympathy Amid Termination From TheBlaze/n

It's really difficult to take Tomi Lahren seriously when there's a "Make America Great Again" hat proudly displayed right over her shoulder… but we digress.
In a new emotional interview with ABC's Nightline, the controversial TV personality is asking Glenn Beck and TheBlaze to simply "let her go" following her termination from the network after revealing she's pro-choice last month.

Speaking out against the company's attempt to keep the rights to her Facebook page and followers, the 24-year-old said:
"Let me go. Let me move on. I'm deeply hurt by what has happened; I'm disappointed in what has happened. But if this is the way that it is, let's just part ways, cleanly. I just want to work and have the freedom to put my voice out there, and I want to interact with my fans and followers. That's all I want out of this."
Adding: 
"It's my job. This is my life. Without that, I feel lost. When your outlet is taken away from you, when your catharsis is stripped from you and you don't understand why and you're so disappointed and you're so blindsided by it — it hurts."

And as far as where she does stand on women's reproductive rights, Miz Lahren went on to try to explain:
