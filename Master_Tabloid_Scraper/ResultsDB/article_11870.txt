Ben Stephenson and David Brewington, will also act as executive producers. So far, the show has yet to be acquired by a network.
Before You Judge Me, which is due out June 21, centers around “Jackson’s campaign to recharge his career” and centers around the “hiring and firing managers and advisors, turning to and away from family members, fighting depression and drug dependency” before his sudden passing at the age of 50.
