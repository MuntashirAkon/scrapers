Idris Elba is, without a doubt, the man of the moment.
Not only did he make history by winning two SAG awards on Saturday night (Jan. 30, 2016) — one for Beasts of No Nation and the other for Luther — but he’s freakin’ cool. In fact, he’s so cool that when Anthony Horowitz, author of the upcoming 007 novel, made an ignorant comment about Elba being “too street” to portray James Bond, the British actor took it upon himself to respond. For that reason and more, he’s Celebuzz’s Man Crush Monday this week.

He has appeared in many films over the years, including Thor and Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom, proving over and over again that he’s an extremely adaptable actor. He’s basically taking over Hollywood one role at a time. It doesn’t end there — he will also appear in the new Star Trek and voice characters in both Finding Dory and The Jungle Book.
But besides acting, Elba has been DJing for years. He plays sets at famous London clubs and even performs at sold out festivals, such as Glastonbury. Cool, huh?
