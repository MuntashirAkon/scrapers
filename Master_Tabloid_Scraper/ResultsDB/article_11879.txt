Luther Vandross Sings Again!/n
     Luther Vandross is firmly in the "Here and Now" as his difficult recovery continues from his devastating stroke this spring.          The R&B; crooner, who spent close to a month in a coma then battled meningitis and pneumonia following the attack, is reportedly talking--and singing.          Patti LaBelle, who recently paid Vandross a visit, says that when they sang a duet, he corrected her on a lyric. "His voice is the same as it ever was," LaBelle discloses in People's October 20 issue.          Vandross is recovering at a New Jersey rehabilitation facility, according to the magazine.          He was found unconscious in his Manhattan apartment on April 16 and spent a touch-and-go month in intensive care comatose and breathing with the aid of a tracheotomy tube inserted into his precious pipes.          His manager had insisted at the time that the operation wouldn't damage his vocal abilities, but Vandross' prognosis remained unclear.          Then in May, the 52-year-old began to show signs of recovery--moving his eyes, and nodding "yes" and "no" in response to questions.          In June, as his latest album, Dance with My Father, was climbing the charts, Vandross checked out of New York's Weill Cornell Medical Center and into the private facility in Jersey where his respirator was removed.          His next album, Luther Vandross: Live at Radio City Music Hall is scheduled for release on Otcober 28.           Vandross is also up for two American Music Awards for Soul/R&B; Favorite Male Artist and Favorite Album to be determined on November 16. According to his label, J Records, Vandross' mother will attend the ceremony in his place and, should he win, accept the awards on his behalf.
