Luther Vandross Suffers Stroke/n
             The "Here and Now" must be especially precious for Luther Vandross, felled by a stroke Wednesday.                           "Vandross is under medical care, and his family and friends are hopeful for a speedy recovery," Carmen Romano, the singer's business manager, said in a statement.                           The three-time Grammy-winning R&B; star turns 52 on Sunday.                           News of Vandross' attack came from his label, J Records. There was no official word on his condition, other than he was recovering at a New York hospital. But the Associated Press quotes a "source close to the singer" saying Vandross suffered the stroke at his Manhattan home and that it was serious, but the singer is  conscious.                         The singer's latest album, Dance with My Father, is due out June 17.                          The album is the 15th of Vandross' solo career and features contributions by Beyonc√© Knowles, Queen Latifah and Stevie Wonder, among others.                          He was scheduled to perform April 30, in Memphis, at the grand-opening ceremonies for the Stax Museum of American Soul Music, dedicated to the legendary R&B; label Stax Records (home to the likes of Otis Redding and Sam and Dave).  He also was slated to do a guest-judge cameo on the May 6 episode of American Idol.                          Vandross' health has been the subject of speculation for years, due to his very public battles with the bulge. The sultry-voiced, six-foot-three soul man has weighed as much as 340 pounds and as little as 200. In recent years, he has been on the svelte side.                           "As a celebrity, rumors start," Vandross told the Website HealthTalk in 2001. "There were rumors that I died. There were rumors that I had AIDS, all because of the weight loss."                          According to Vandross, he's just a yo-yo dieter, gaining and losing 120 pounds 14 separate times in his life.                          "I don't function in the gray area well," he told HealthTalk. "I'm a black-and-white person. I'm either thin-thin, or I'm WWF heavy."                          Vandross also copes with diabetes, a condition he was diagnosed with at age 18, and hypertension.                          No amount of health issues, though, thwarted one of the most successful music careers ever. Beginning with his 1981 solo debut, Never Too Much, the New York-born singer-songwriter became R&B;'s standard-bearer of the smooth love song. In short, long before there was American Idol's Ruben Studdard, there was, and is, Luther Vandross.                           His greatest hits could (and sometimes do) fill a wedding reception: the title track from Never Too Much, "Give Me the Reason," "Always and Forever," "Power of Love" and "Here and Now."                           Vandross' career dates back to the early 1970s, when as something of a prodigy (he was 20), he composed a song, "Everybody Rejoice (A Brand New Day)," for the Broadway musical The Wiz.                          Throughout the 1970s, he apprenticed as a backup vocalist for the likes of Bette Midler, Barbra Streisand and David Bowie. Bowie's landmark 1975 album Young Americans even contains a track cowritten by Vandross ("Fascination").                          Of his new album, Vandross said in a statement, "I have been reexamining the way I write: I don't want to say anything that was just nifty."
