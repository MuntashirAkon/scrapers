Sorry, Avengers, but a new super team is here in the form of BBC's Gillian Anderson, Benedict Cumberbatch, Idris Elba and Martin Freeman. The superstars came together, in character as DSI Stella Gibson, Sherlock Holmes, John Luther and Dr. John Watson, respectively, for a new promo for BBC's Pure Drama initiative, highlighting, well, new drama."One crime. Four of the world's favorite characters," BBC teased. "Will they find the killer?"Anderson, who stars in The Fall (which can be seen on Netflix in the United States) and The X-Files returning to life on Fox this January, took to Twitter and summed up everybody's reaction best: "Hot damn!"
