Arrest Warrant for 2 Live Crew's Luther Campbell/n
Investigators in two Southern states are looking for 2 Live Crew frontman Luther Campbell (aka Luke Skywalker). Police in Lafayette, Louisiana, issued an arrest warrant accusing Campbell of second-degree battery for throwing a woman off a stage and knocking her out. Police in Miami--the rapper's hometown--have been unable to find him since the warrant was issued earlier this month.According to the Lafayette Sheriff's Department, the controversial rapper was performing at a club called Strawberries on July 14 when he grabbed a woman who came on stage for a dance contest and then pushed her down. "She was then jumped by some of his entourage, female dancers who were with him. At that point, he picked her up and threw her off the stage into the crowd. She hit the floor and was knocked unconscious," said Capt. Mike Savoie.Savoie said that the woman did not immediately report the incident, which explains the delay between the concert and the issuing of the warrant less than two weeks ago. Savoie said that Miami police were cooperating with his office.Campbell's Miami record company, Luke Records, did not return calls today. A publicist for Houston-based Rap-A-Lot Records, Campbell's distributor, said she did not know about the incident or where the rapper was.In 1994, Miami police accused Campbell of waving a gun at his girlfriend and threatening to kill her, then dropped the charges when she refused to press charges. Campbell became a First Amendment poster boy in 1990, when 2 Live Crew's album As Nasty as They Wanna Be was ruled obscene by a federal judge and lambasted by Tipper Gore. That same year, the group was acquitted of concert-related obscenity charges by a Florida jury. In 1994, Campbell and bandmates Christopher Wongwon and Mark Ross were cited by police for simulating sex acts on stage and inciting a riot during a Birmingham, Alabama, performance.
