It looks like somebody's got Bruce Willis wrapped around her tiny finger.That would be none other than the actor's adorable 7-month-old daughter, Mabel, who swung by the London set of Red 2 to pay her proud papa a visit. (With a little help from Mommy, Willis' wife, Emma, of course.)Not surprisingly, the 57-year-old star was all smiles as he playfully interacted with his little lady.

This isn't the first time we've spotted Willis as the doting dad lately.Over the summer, he was seen enjoying a stroll on the streets of Manhattan with Mabel, not long after Emma posted a cute photo of Willis cradling his then 1-month-old bundle of joy.Aww!
