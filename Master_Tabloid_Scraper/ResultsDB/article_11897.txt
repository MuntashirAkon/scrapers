Boxer Jermain Taylor -- Mandatory Mental Evaluation ... After Arrests, Bizarre Behavior/nBoxing champ Jermain Taylor has been ordered to undergo a mental evaluation ... after a string of arrests and strange behavior that clearly raised some red flags with an Arkansas judge. Taylor's own attorneys had asked the judge to move the 36-year-old to a state hospital for a full mental evaluation ... after he turned himself in for allegedly firing a gun during an altercation with a family at a Martin Luther King Day parade. As we previously reported, Taylor kinda sorta acknowledged he fired the gun in a bizarre YouTube video ... in which he blamed his outburst on the fact that several kids at the parade did not have candy. Taylor has been charged with aggravated assault and endangering the welfare of a minor for the incident.  Prosecutors believe Taylor is a danger to himself and others. The results of Taylor's mental evaluation are scheduled to be presented to the court in April. "Everybody is saying this isn't the Jermain Taylor they know, " Taylor's attorney told ArkansasOnline.com ...  "We're trying to figure out who in the heck it is. "Before the MLK incident, Taylor had been arrested in August for shooting his cousin. He was also accused of throwing a brick at a woman in December./n
