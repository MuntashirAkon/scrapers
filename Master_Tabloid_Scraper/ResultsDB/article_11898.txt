WWE -- Brain Injury Lawsuit Is Nothing But a Cash Grab/nThe guys suing the WWE over alleged brain injuries are a bunch of  "nobodies " brainwashed by lawyers to believe they can score a quick buck ... at least according to a WWE lawyer.  TMZ Sports broke the story ... Big Russ McCullough, Ryan Sakoda and Luther Reigns claim the WWE has known for years its athletes are suffering brutal and debilitating injuries, but it's only interested in making big money. We spoke to Jerry McDevitt, WWE’s outside counsel from K&L Gates. He tells us the guys -- who only wrestled for a short time -- are  "being targeted by attorneys who tell them there's hundreds of thousands of dollars they can make by joining a class action suit like this. " McDevitt adds,  "We know these claims are fraudulent, and will fight them. " He claims other wrestlers who've been approached to join the suit think it's a scam. McDevitt believes the suit spends more time talking about Chris Benoit and other wrestlers than it does the actual plaintiffs.   "It's sensational, but if you really look at ... what was done specifically to them? " McDevitt says.  "There are almost no details as to what they actually suffered as a result of working with WWE. " Among the details included in the suit -- the plaintiffs say they were forced to wrestle, even when they'd suffered injuries like torn ligaments and concussions. McDevitt says no WWE wrestlers were complaining they'd suffered brain damage or dementia. before the lawyers started contacting them. He says the WWE will ultimately prevail./n
