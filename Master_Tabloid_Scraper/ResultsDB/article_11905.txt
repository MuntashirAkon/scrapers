Oprah Winfrey -- I Can't Stand People Who Use the N-Word/nOprah Winfrey says she has no tolerance for anyone who uses the N-word around her -- no matter the color of their skin -- saying,  "You cannot be my friend and use that word around me. "Oprah -- along with Forest Whitaker -- just spoke about the race issues with Parade magazine to promote their new movie  "The Butler. "During the interview, Oprah was asked about the N-word -- which becomes extremely relevant in the wake of the racial comments made by her former  "Color Purple " co-star Rae Dawn Chong. As we previously reported, Rae lashed out against Oprah and said she would have been a  "field n**ger " back in the slave days. Oprah never mentions Rae in the interview, but makes it clear she doesn't respect people that throw that word around.  "It shows my age, but I feel strongly about [the n-word] … I always think of the millions of people who heard that as their last word as they were hanging from a tree. "The interview is interesting ... with Oprah claiming kids today don't know  "diddly-squat " about the civil rights movement. She also explains why she thinks Martin Luther King's dream has not been completely fulfilled.  "Are more people judged by the content of their character than by the color of their skin?  Yes.  Is everybody judged by the content of their character?  Absolutely not.
