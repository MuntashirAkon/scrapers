Ringo: P.S. I Don't Care/nOne of the two surviving Beatles, Ringo Starr, was in a pissy mood last night -- refusing to stop for photos or sign a single autograph in New York. Though autograph seekers tried to get a rise out of the former moptop by shouting,  "Sign for the dead people, sign for Martin Luther King, " the Beatle stonewalled them all -- shouting and pushing his way through the crowd.
