Ne-Yo Remixing 'One Shining Moment' ... But Not Usurping Luther /nThe NCAA is adding a twist to its annual  "One Shining Moment " montage at the end of the Final Four tourney ... Ne-Yo will be doing a version this year -- but he's NOT bumping Luther. Luther Vandross' version of the song has been mostly used since 2003 ...  with 1 exception, in 2010 he was replaced for Jennifer Hudson. But people got pissed so they brought back Luther's version the next year.  Now, the NCAA has announced a new singer will be taking on the song ... Ne-Yo -- but warn he will NOT replace Luther on the main broadcast.  Instead, Ne-Yo's version will reportedly be featured on TNT and truTV -- while Luther's version will air on the main broadcast on TBS.  So, chill everyone ... it's gonna be fine. And hey, it might even be good./n
