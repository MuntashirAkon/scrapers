Jealousy Destroys Chris Pratt And Anna Faris’ Fairytale Marriage/n
Hollywood wrecked the storybook marriage of Anna Faris and Chris Pratt!
 As Chris’ career skyrocketed, Anna was consumed with jealousy — and now the two will fight over their $50 million fortune in divorce court, sources say.
 When they met in 2007, Chris was a 300-pound fatty who admitted: “I was impotent, fatigued, emotionally depressed.”
 But he transformed into a rock-hard action star in “Jurassic World” and “Guardians of the Galaxy” — and began drawing women like flies!
 “As Chris’s waist got smaller, his head got bigger,” tattled a source.
 “Meanwhile, poor Anna was left alone for months at a time and was literally starving for his attention!”
 Insiders said Anna hit her breaking point over 38-year-old Chris’ steamy sex scenes with Jennifer Lawrence, 27, in the sci-fi flick “Passengers.”
 “Jennifer assured her that she had nothing to worry about, but Anna never trusted her,” said a source.
 “In the end, Anna had enough of Chris’ absence and wild ways.” /n
