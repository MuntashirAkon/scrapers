May Mabel Pantaleon be found safe and sound.The 31-year-old actress, whose credits include appearances on Dexter and Mystery ER, was reported missing on Sunday, the NYPD confirms to E! News.She was last seen at her family's Manhattan apartment at around 9 a.m., according to her mother, who told ABC News that her daughter has a history of manic-depressive disorder and had been taking medication—but a recent incident led her to believe Mabel had gone off her meds.

"She was staying with me," Sylvia Pantaleon recalled. "She saw something on the Internet and got very upset, and she started saying a lot of weird things. She said, 'I'm leaving from here, all of you are terrorists, you're not my mother.' I knew it wasn't her."Sylvia said that Mabel, a former nursing student, had moved to California to pursue acting but had returned to New York last year. Mabel lost her own place on 45th Street and moved back in with her mother, who said that she called the cops right after he daughter disappeared but was told that she had to wait 24 hours to officially file a report.Police told E! News that Mabel was last seen wearing a red T-shirt with "Drake" across the front and may be driving a silver 2004 Toyota Camry.—Reporting by Holly Passalaqua
