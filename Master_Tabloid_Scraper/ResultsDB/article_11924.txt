Sharon Tate’s Family In Pain Over Quentin Tarantino’s New Charles Manson Movie/n
Quentin Tarantino’s next film will be a drama revolving around the Manson Family murders, and he’s currently deciding between Margot Robbie and Jennifer Lawrence to potentially play Sharon Tate, director Roman Polanski’s actress wife who was brutally killed in 1969 while eight-months pregnant.
While Robbie, 27, was believed to be the front-runner, Tarantino’s recent lunch with 26-year-old Lawrence made it clear it had become a two-horse race.
Whoever Tarantino chooses, RadarOnline can exclusively reveal that Tate’s sister, Debra Tate, 63, is preparing to butt heads with the Oscar-nominated director, whose films are known for their use of excessive violence.

“The pain of losing Sharon the way she did has never left Debra,” a source told Radar. “She’s fiercely protective of her sister’s legacy.”
And that means standing up to Tarantino and his Hollywood backers.
“She’s going to make things very difficult for Quentin unless he brings her on board as a consultant of some kind,” said the source.

However, that may be easier said than done.
An insider close to Tarantino told Radar: “Quentin does things his way and only his way. I don’t see him needing any kind of consultant next to him. No one has seen his script yet, but he’s always handled the violence and gore in his pictures with a master’s touch.”
The movie depicting the murder of Sharon Tate, added the insider, “will be done with the same care and respect.”
