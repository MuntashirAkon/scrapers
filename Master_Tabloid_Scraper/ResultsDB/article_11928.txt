Teen Text Killer Trial Verdict: Judge To Announce Michelle Carter's Fate!/n
Judgment day is here.
A verdict has been reached for Michelle Carter, who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in the grisly suicide of her boyfriend, Conrad Roy III.
Carter waived her right to a jury trial in the teen texting case, and Judge Lawrence Moniz announced that he had come to a decision and will reveal the verdict on Friday, June 16.
She is accused of encouraging Roy to kill himself via carbon monoxide poisoning in his truck, parked in a Kmart lot.

One text message Carter, now 20, sent to Roy, 18, read: “You can’t think about. You just have to do it. You said you were gonna do it. Like I don’t get why you aren’t.”
Roy left a suicide note for Carter, which read: “Keep strong in tough times. You taught me how to be strong and carry on. This life has been too challenging and troublesome to me but I’ll forever be in your heart and we will meet up someday in Heaven.”

Another cruel message Carter sent to Roy stated, “You are ready and prepared, all you need to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy.”
Her defense attorney argued that she was “involuntarily intoxicated” when she was overprescribed medication not appropriate for a teenager.
During closing arguments, the prosecutor told the judge “Her actions on July 12, 2014 caused the death of Conrad Roy. They were reckless and she knew it. She was 18. It was a felony and she caused serious bodily harm.”
Radar will be livestreaming the verdict at 11am EST on Friday, June 16, 2016.
