Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon Has A New Hot Hollywood Player/n
Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon has a new ‘Center of the Hollywood Universe’ — super hot Hollywood director Jeff Fisher!
Fisher is an Emmy Award contender for Hallmark channel’s My Christmas Love and now he’s hot on Bacon’s heels as the new-and-improved leading man in the popular Six Degrees parlour game — a concept that any two people on earth are six or fewer acquaintance links apart.
Movie buffs should be up for the challenge to find the shortest path between an A-list actor and the seasoned director.
In recent years, Fisher has worked with a parade of who’s who in Hollywood, including Kaley Cuoco (Big Bang Theory), Paul Wesley (Vampire Diaries), Meredith Hagner (Search Party), Leighton Meester (Gossip Girl), Parker Young (Imposters), Jennifer Lopez (Dance Life), Kim Kardashian (KUWTK), Juliette Lewis (Cape Fear), Nene Leakes (RHOA), Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie (Simple Life), Robert DeNiro, Samantha Bee (Full Frontal), Kendall Jenner (KUWTK) and the late Bobbi Kristina Brown, just to name a more than a few.
And using Six Degrees’ clever association trick, Fisher is connected to Jennifer Lawrence, Bradley Cooper, Cate Blanchett, Ben Affleck, Margot Robbie, Ryan Reynolds, James Franco, Jennifer Garner, Blake Lively, Chris Pratt, Drew Barrymore, Uma Thurman, Kanye West, Taylor Swift, Alec Baldwin, Tina Fey, Ryan Gosling, Britney Spears, Harrison Ford, Jessica Lange, Justin Timberlake, Rihanna, Cher, Justin Bieber, Goldie Hawn, and pretty much every A-list celebrity on the planet.
Quite a feat for the young director whose career is really starting to gel.
