Sweet Jennifer Lawrence LOVES To Give Back!/n
Jennifer Lawrence owes a lot to her Hunger Games fans,
and just like Katniss, she likes to give back.
So when she was approached recently by two young sisters in London’s Heathrow airport,
where she was filming scenes for her spy thriller Red Sparrow, she didn’t hesitate to make their day.
A source says the down-to-earth star chatted with the girls at length during a break in filming,
signing autographs and sharing their excitement about jetting off on vacation.
After taking their parents aside and getting their thumbs-up, she even gave the girls a little spending money for an ice cream.
“Jennifer was so warm ,” says the source.
“And it was fun to watch her snap back into character when cameras rolled again, all stern and serious.”
