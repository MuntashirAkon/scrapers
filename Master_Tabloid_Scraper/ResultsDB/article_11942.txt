Taraji P. Henson crashed a Maserati into a fire hydrant…and the fire hydrant won.

Henson was filming a scene behind the wheel of the super expensive sports car on the set of Proud Mary in Lawrence, Massachusetts on Sunday (May 21, 2017).
TMZ reports:
She had done 4 takes without incident, but on the fifth she cut the wheel too hard and slammed into the hydrant.
The Empire star was not hurt, but the Maserati was definitely the worse for wear. The hydrant had just gotten a fresh coat of paint so that’s down the drain, but otherwise the car suffered way more damage.
