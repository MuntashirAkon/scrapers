Who knew Liam Hemsworth was such an artist?

Apparently, the Hunger Games hunk — who was spotted attending a Flaming Lips concert with fiancée Miley Cyrus on Wednesday night (May 9, 2017) — is quite the Picasso, according to his future father-in-law.
“Liam is a great guy. I like his heart. He’s got a great spirit about him,” Billy Ray Cyrus recently told Entertainment Tonight. “I’ll tell you something you don’t know about him though: he’s a great artist.”
“He’s a painter,” he said of Hemsworth, who was also responsible for the cover art of “Malibu,” Miley’s new single about the actor. “He’s got painting after painting, that’s just incredible stuff.”

Billy Ray also shared Hemsworth has been spending a lot of time with the family. While he wouldn’t reveal anything about the upcoming nuptials, he did say the 27-year-old is closer with Miley, 24, and the Cyrus clan than ever before.
“We have been hanging out more in the last couple of months than the last couple of years,” he said. “It’s been a really great time period. There is something full circle, if you will, maybe about our family and our lives and looking at it now and saying, ‘Wow OK, what actually happened here?'”
