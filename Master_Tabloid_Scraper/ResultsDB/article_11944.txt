Jimmy Kimmel delivered a direct message to his critics after making a personal plea to politicians about equal access to healthcare on his show.

Last week on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Kimmel revealed that his son Billy was rushed into emergency surgery hours after he was born at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. He followed this anecdote by asking politicians to ensure Americans have access to healthcare, especially if they are suffering from pre-existing conditions. He also suggested that his viewers donate to Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, where his son underwent surgery.
The talk show host let his audience know that his son is “doing very well” and thanked them for their monetary gifts to Children’s Hospital Los Angeles at the top of Monday’s show. However, he assumed a different tone when he began to address headlines that criticized him for being an “elitist creep” following his remarks last week.

“My father – on the rare occasion we took a family trip – would hide our dog in the car and then smuggle it into the motel room to avoid paying a two-dollar pet fee. So after that, my dream was to become an ‘out of touch Hollywood elitist.’ And I guess it came true,” Kimmel rebutted.
“Anyway, I’d like to apologize for saying that children in America should have health care. That was insensitive – it was offensive – and I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me.”
He also criticized former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich for his response to Kimmel’s monologue on Fox News Sunday. Hear what he had to say in the clip at the top of the page.
