Chris Pratt says that he has to sacrifice selfies with his fans in order to live his life like a normal human being.

The Guardians of the Galaxy actor explains his no-selfie strategy in an interview with Cigar Aficionado magazine in their May/June 2017 issue.
“If I go out and want to do normal things, I have to be comfortable disappointing people,” Pratt discloses. “So I just don’t take pictures with people. Because that’s not about enjoying the moment; it’s about stealing the moment to brag about later. So I say, ‘Would you settle for a handshake?’ And then they take the picture anyway.”
Pratt says that he misses is sitting down and talking to strangers so he can discover them and they can discover him.
“It’s tough sometimes, the amount of management you need to do on things you used to do spontaneously,” says Pratt. “I’d say the majority of people I meet have an idea about me before they meet me. There’s something nice to being able to surprise somebody.”

Despite his success, Pratt hasn’t adjusted to being a recognizable figure among his peers.
“There was this moment when I was at a party and Barbra Streisand and Jim Carrey both came up to me to tell me they loved what I’d done,” he recalls. “Streisand asked me, ‘How does it feel? You’re this year’s big thing.’ Jim Carrey told me the same thing. That was when those people stopped being my icons and became my peers.”
