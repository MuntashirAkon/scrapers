Rumors are swirling that Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth secretly got hitched after Billy Ray Cyrus shared a photo of his daughter wearing all white.

As if the embroidered, wedding-appropriate gown wasn’t already giving off some sort of a vibe, the country crooner captioned the picture with something that sounded like a proud papa who just walked his little girl down the aisle would say. He wrote, “I’m so happy…you are happy @mileycyrus.”

Billy Ray continued to fuel rumors that the “Wrecking Ball” singer had tied the knot with the Hunger Games hunk when he retweeted several tweets from fans asking if a secret nuptial took place.

Dating on and off since meeting on the set of 2010’s The Last Song, Miley, 24, and Liam, 27, got engaged in 2012 but parted ways that following year. In late 2015, the couple rekindled their romance after Miley spent the holidays with Liam’s family in Australia. Soon after, the former Disney Channel star started wearing the Neil Lane engagement ring from Liam again, sparking rumors of a reconciliation.
Though they never actually confirmed a second engagement, Miley hinted about it during an interview with Ellen DeGeneres last October.
“This is really weird because this is like real jewelry and most of my jewelry is made out of gummy bears and cotton candy,” Miley said, when explaining why the 3.5 carat diamond bauble was back on her finger. “I am like, ‘This isn’t really my aesthetic but I’ll wear it because you [Liam] love me.'”
