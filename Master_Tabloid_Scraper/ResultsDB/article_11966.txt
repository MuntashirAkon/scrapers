The Academy award-winning actress stars alongside Javier Bardem, Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer in a film about "love, devotion and sacrifice."Although this is Lawrence's first film with director Aronofsky, the two have spent a lot of time with each other off set. Sources tell E! News the couple has been dating officially "since August" 2016.Earlier this year, the Black Swan director traveled all the way to Budapest where Lawrence was filming for the movie, Red Sparrow.

After screening at film festivals in Venice and Toronto, mother! will hit theaters Sept. 15.
