Manchester United -- FIELD-INVADER GETS OBLITERATED/nSome idiot soccer fan got absolutely ANNIHILATED when he ran on the field at a Man U game last week ... thanks to two badass security guards who hit like NFL linebackers. It all went down in L.A. when the L.A. Galaxy hosted Manchester United for a friendly match at The Rose Bowl. Right after the final whistle blew (finalizing Man U's  7-0 victory) ... the fan jumped on the field and started approaching some of the players. That's when security raced after the guy and delivered a BONE-CRUSHING tackle on the guy that woulda made Lawrence Taylor proud. Perfect. Form. Tackle./n
