“Proud of my dad for his grace!” Ira tweeted Sunday night minutes after the shocking mistake. “It’s live, stuff happens. Showbiz!”

As Radar readers know, the Oscars finished out with the insane flub, when the award for Best Picture was handed to the wrong film, La La Land, after Beatty and Dunaway were given the incorrect envelope.
A report from Jeffrey Fleishman backstage revealed the jaw-dropping moment when workers backstage realized the mistake, with one stage hand even blurting out: “Oh, f**k. Oh my God. He got the wrong envelope.”

Sadly, by the time it was discovered that Moonlight was the rightful winner of the award, the three producers for La La Land were well into their acceptance speeches. In fact, Fred Berger was still in the middle of speaking when fellow producer Jordan Horowitz cut in to announce that Moonlight had won.
PricewaterhouseCoopers, the accounting firm that counts the Oscar ballots, later issued an apology statement that seemed to take the blame for the whole ordeal.
