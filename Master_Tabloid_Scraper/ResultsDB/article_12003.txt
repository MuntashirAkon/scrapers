 Murder Plot Foiled? 6 Suspected Terrorists Arrested Ahead Of Prince Charles & Camilla's.../n
Six men were arrested in Ireland on terrorism and explosive charges Wednesday, just ahead of a highly-anticipated visit from Prince Charles and Camilla.
The six suspects — linked to militant cells dubbed the Continuity and the Real IRA — were taken into custody in connection with suspicion of directing terrorism, membership of an unlawful organization and possession of explosives, according to An Garda Siochana, Ireland’s national law enforcement agency.

An Garda Siochana said that authorities scoured 20 separate locations Wednesday linked to extremist republican dissident groups, and found guns and materials used to make bombs, only a few miles away from a location the royals will stop by.
An insider told the U.K. Daily Mirror  that law enforcement “have been monitoring a number of people over the past few months,” and cracked down ahead of the royal visit.
The uptick in security comes with a historical footnote to it, as Prince Charles and Camilla — who will visit Ireland from May 19 to 21 — are slated to stop by Mullaghmore, the town where the prince’s great-uncle Lord Louis Mountbatten was killed via a bombing attack from the IRA in 1979.
