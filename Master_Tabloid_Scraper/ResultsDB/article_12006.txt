 Mick Jagger, Family Mourn L’Wren Scott At ‘Intimate’ Funeral Service At Los Angeles.../n
Mick Jagger was surrounded by close friends and family on Tuesday morning as he farewelled his late girlfriend L’Wren Scott.
The New York fashion designer and socialite was laid her to rest in an “intimate” ceremony at Hollywood Forever Cemetery after a private service at a Los Angeles funeral home, which was attended by about 60 guests amid tight security.
“It will be an intimate service for close family and friends to pay their respects to L’Wren,” a source told the New York Daily News, before the occasion.

Scott, 49, committed suicide in Manhattan on March 17.
“The service with blessings and prayers led by Reverend Ed Bacon (All Saints Church in Pasadena, California) included memories and words of tribute from Mick Jagger, her brother Randy Bambrough, Justinian Kfoury, Ira M. Hammons-Glass and Adam Glassman,” Scott’s publicist revealed to Radar.
“Poems were shared by Jagger’s daughter Karis, as well as Ellen Barkin. Mick’s daughter, Jade, read Psalm 139, and his grandchildren, Mazie and Zak, read Psalm 23. Randy’s daughter Hannah read Shakespeare Sonnet 18.”
Jagger, 70, arrived in Los Angeles just days prior to the service having canceled the Rolling Stones’ Australian tour upon learning of his long-time partner’s shock death.

Jagger and Scott’s brother, Randall Bambrough, reportedly arranged the funeral in Los Angeles, much to the chagrin of her estranged sister, Jan Shane, who complained that she had been shut out of the arrangements.
She also said that her late parents wishes for their children to be buried in Utah were ignored.
Speaking from her home in Roy, Utah, Shane, 53, told Radar: “I have been frozen out of my own sister’s funeral.

“[My brother] Randy won’t talk to me or call me about the arrangements, or my hopes that L’Wren be buried beside mom and dad. I am very angry about this and I cannot get answers from anybody — and now, I have given expecting up to hear from Mick or anyone.”

Choking back tears, Shane added: “It is clear that I will not be able to attend the funeral or service in Los Angeles and it has left me heartbroken.
“How could this happen to my family when we were so close not so long ago?”
