By Debbie Emery – Radar Reporter
A piece of musical history has hit the real estate market as the Gershwin penthouse in New York City has been listed for $2.5 million, and RadarOnline.com has photos of the inside.
 The iconic apartment where Broadway legends George and Ira Gershwin created magic together in the 1920s is a pre-war cooperative made up of two adjoining penthouses, reported Zillow.com.

 With three bedrooms and 2.5 bathrooms, the historical home on Manhattan’s Riverside Drive boasts views of the Hudson River, hardwood floors and spiral staircase leading to the lower levels.
 While the location, layout and decor are both stunning, it is the penthouse’s former tenants that is the real selling point.
 Along with being the scene of partying and musical collaboration between the talented brothers, it is most famously where actress Ethel Merman was summoned by the Gershwins to audition for their new musical Girl Crazy in 1930.
