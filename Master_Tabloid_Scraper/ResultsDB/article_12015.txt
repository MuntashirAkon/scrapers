“He will not be attending the funeral out of consideration for his daughter-n-law’s and grandchildren’s privacy,” his lawyer, Ira Lee Sorkin, told RadarOnline.com  
“He will be conducting a private service on his own, where he is presently incarcerated.”
Madoff is serving a 150-year sentence in a federal prison in North Carolina after pleading guilty in March 2009 to carrying out a decades-long fraud.
