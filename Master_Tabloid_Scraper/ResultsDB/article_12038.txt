 Just got home from Texas. I was in San Antonio, so it wasn't as bad as other areas of Texas. I'm praying for my home state and all those who are suffering through the devastation of Hurricane Harvey. Stay strong Texas and a big Texas size thank you to all the first responders, National Guard, Red Cross, volunteers, etc. Everything is bigger in Texas, and that includes our hearts and capacity to help. #GodBlessTexas 🙏🏻

“Stay strong Texas and a big Texas size thank you to all the first responders, National Guard, Red Cross, volunteers, etc. Everything is bigger in Texas, and that includes our hearts and capacity to help,” she added.
Hurricane Harvey caused terrible wreckage after making landfall in the town of Rockport on Friday night, as a Category 4 storm. Port Aransas and Rockport took the brunt of the storm, which hit the coastal area with 130 mph winds. The storm left homes flooded, many without power and several buildings destroyed.





 Very easy thing I just did. You can too, if you're so inclined. Text HARVEY to 90999 to donate 10 dollars to the @americanredcross for hurricane relief AND/OR text HURRICANE to 20222 to donate 25 dollars to @savethechildren. My thoughts and prayers are with everyone in the path of Hurricane Harvey. ❤️

At least five people had been reported dead on Sunday as a result of Harvey, according to The Chicago Tribune. Officials said they expect the number of fatalities to rise in areas hit hardest with flooding.
As officials, crews and residents scramble in Texas, Bachelor alum Sean Lowe, who is from Arlington, looked to take action.


Anyone in the dallas area have a small boat I can take to Houston to help with evacuations? I'll pay for the rental.

“Anyone in the dallas (sic) area have a small boat I can take to Houston to help with evacuations? I’ll pay for the rental,” he tweeted on Sunday.
Singer Chris Young also vowed to help, pledging $100,000 to the Red Cross — and setting up a GoFundMe page for others to donate.





 As everyone knows, Texas was hit Friday by Hurricane Harvey which made landfall as a category four hurricane, the largest storm to hit the area in decades. Port Aransas, Rockport, Corpus Christi, Houston and so many other places are going to be dealing with so much damage and loss of life for a long time to come. I’m worried about the people there — my friends, family and neighbors — and I want to help. I’m starting this GoFundMe campaign in an effort to help everyone in Texas that has been affected by this hurricane. I’m pledging $100,000 to relief efforts and hope you will join me (link in bio).

He announced the pledge in a moving Instagram post, noting that he has friends and family in Texas, as well as a house that was likely destroyed in the storm.
Stars including Miranda Lambert and Kim Zolciak-Biermann sent well-wishes to those affected by the hurricane.





 We are currently overseas in London and all I can think about is how devastated I am as I look at images of the damage Hurricane Harvey has caused. I am praying for the safety of all those affected. Houston has truly been a home to me over the last 8 years. Myself and @futuretheprince are working with local relief groups to aid and assist the people of Texas in anyway we can and in the most immediate way possible. I also want to thank all the men and women of service and volunteers for their courageous efforts to help people in need. I encourage everyone to do what they can to assist the people of Texas knowing whatever effort you can make to help will go a long way.
