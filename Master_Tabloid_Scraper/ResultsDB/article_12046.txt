Prince Philip couldn't retire without one final joke on Thursday.Just an hour after announcing he is stepping down from his royal duties, the 95-year-old Duke of Edinburgh got attendees laughing with his always irreverent humor.Mathematician Sir Michael Atiyah was one of the first to approach the prince after his announcement. He couldn't help but tell the royal, "I'm sorry to hear you're standing down," to which Philip replied, "I can't stand up much longer!" LOL!But this type of humor is exactly what the Duke became known for over his years in the monarchy. In fact, sometimes it got him into a bit of trouble...Let's look back at 22 of his biggest gaffes and most memorable one-liners below:

2002: The family of Stephen Menary, a teenage army cadet who was blinded in an IRA bombing, was invited to meet the Queen and her husband at a tree planting event in Hyde Park. After the Queen asked the 15-year-old how much sight he had left, the Duke of Edinburgh responded: "Not a lot, judging by the tie he's wearing." Oof!That same year, he asked Australian aboriginal leader William Brin, "Do you still throw spears at each other?"2003: The Queen and Philip attended a Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in Abuja, Nigeria, which marked the Queen's first visit in 47 years. They were greeted by Nigeria's President Olusegun Obasanjo, who was wearing a traditional robe. Philip quipped: "You look like you're ready for bed."2009: During a Buckingham Palace reception to honor 400 influential British Indians, he told an Indian executive named Atul Patel, "There's a lot of your family here tonight," after seeing his name badge.

He asked Miller, "How many people have you knocked over this morning on that thing?"2013: He met Malala Yousafzai, who survived an assassination attempt by the Taliban due to her desire to gain an education and has now dedicated her life to promoting girls attending school without fear.

Cringe.2017: He paid a visit to the Charterhouse almshouse for elderly men earlier this year, and when he met one pensioner, he quipped, "You look starved."On Marriage: Finally, one of his undoubtedly most famous quotes was about marriage in which he stated, "When a man opens a car door for his wife, it's either a new car or a new wife."Needless to say, Prince Philip will go down in history as one of the most shockingly outspoken royals of all time.
