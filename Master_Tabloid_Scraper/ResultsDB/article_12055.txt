Bobby Shmurda: Close To Freedom ... Legal Team Making Push /nBobby Shmurda finally has a slight glimmer of hope -- his legal team has a plan to spring the rapper from jail as early as Thursday. Sources close to the case tell TMZ ... Shmurda's family has stepped forward to offer up collateral for his $2 million bond. Most notably, Bobby's aunt has put several properties on the line to help set the rapper free. We're told the family has been working closely with NY bondsman Ira Judelson.  As for why Bobby's team feels this bail package will be approved? We're told they've put together a 200 page document that details the source of every single penny, and it's essentially  "bulletproof. " His camp is pushing to present its case to a judge ASAP. You'll remember, Bobby was charged with conspiracy to commit murder and other weapon and drug charges late last year, and has been sitting in jail since then. We reached out to Shmurda's attorney Alex Spiro about the arrangement, but he had no comment. /n
