But, Lisa Vanderpump’s resident bad boy doesn’t seem too heartbroken, as he’s been spending time with rocky couple Katie Maloney and Tom Schwartz.

Cartwright and Taylor began dating shortly after they met in Las Vegas in between seasons four and five of Vanderpump Rules. Cartwright has been eyeing a proposal, but Taylor admitted he isn’t ready to take the next step in their relationship yet.
Meanwhile, Maloney, 30, and Schwartz, 34, are “on the rocks” because of her mean girl ways and trust issues.
