What Killed Patrick Swayze? Inside The Actor's Mysterious Death/n
Patrick Swayze was best known for his starring roles in Dirty Dancing and Ghost, but fans were clueless as to what was really going on behind the curtain. Experts are now questioning whether his lifestyle contributed to his early death.
A new series by Reelz called Autopsy: Patrick Swayze will have Dr. Michael Hunter, a leading forensic pathologist, re-examine the star’s medical documents to reveal what ultimately killed him.

“So far, I’ve discovered that Patrick was riddled with injuries, both from dancing and performing his own stunts. It’s clear he was a determined man, used to dealing with and often dismissing pain,” Dr. Hunter says during a sneak peek.
“But of greater concern is that just two years before Patrick’s death, medical records show that he was suffering from chronic constipation, weight loss, light-colored stools and jaundice,” Dr. Hunter went on. “Jaundice is a sign of a malfunctioning liver. And one of the most common causes for liver damage is excessive alcohol use.”
