President Donald Trump is going to be grandfather for the ninth time.

The commander-in-chief’s second son, Eric Trump, is expecting his first child with wife Lara Trump. According to the businessman, their bundle of joy — a boy — is due in September.
“We found out on my birthday, which was pretty cool,” Eric tells People.
“I was exhausted in the beginning,” adds Lara, a former Inside Edition producer. “It surprised me, because I’m a very active person, and until the fatigue hit, I didn’t believe it would actually happen to me.”
“It really affected me. But I’m feeling really good now,” she continues.
The couple married in Mar-A-Lago in 2014 after six years of dating.
