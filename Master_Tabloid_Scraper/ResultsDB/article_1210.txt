We just have to note that Miz Latifah's speech at the Hollywood event was the perfect balance of #Humblebragging and inspiring. LOVES it!
What's even better is that the A-lister beat out fellow industry vets Nicole Kidman in Grace of Monaco, Christina Ricci in The Lizzie Borden Chronicles, Susan Sarandon in The Secret Life of Marilyn Monroe, and Kristen Wiig in The Spoils Before Dying.
Color us impressed. Ch-ch-check out her wonderful speech (above)!
