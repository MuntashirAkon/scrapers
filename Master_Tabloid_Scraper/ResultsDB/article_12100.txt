The winter storm that’s about to hit the Northeast isn’t an issue for Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez, who are staying warm together in the Bahamas.

The new couple arrived at Marsh Harbour from Miami via private jet on Friday (Mar. 10, 2017) at 9:30 p.m., according to E! News. Lopez and Rodriguez then transferred to a boat that whisked them away to Bakers Bay Golf & Ocean Club on Great Guana Cay in the Abaco islands. E!‘s report states that Rodriguez made sure Lopez’s seat on the boat was dry before she sat down. Cute!
On Sunday (Mar. 12, 2017), Lopez posted a photo on Instagram Stories that appeared to feature Rodriguez in the background. She quickly deleted the photo, but a social media detective swooped in to get the screenshot.
