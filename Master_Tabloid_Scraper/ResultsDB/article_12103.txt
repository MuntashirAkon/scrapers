Perhaps giving Jon Hamm a run for his money, Scott Disick left very little to the imagination this week when he stepped out wearing sweatpants that clung onto every curve in his nether regions. Needless to say, the internet — us included — were shook by what we saw.

“It’s like an elephant’s trunk,” Kardashian said of Disick’s manhood way back in 2011 during an interview with xoJane.  “Scott was wearing a suit with no underwear last night, so you could see, like, something.”
Clearly, he hasn’t lost his touch one bit.
