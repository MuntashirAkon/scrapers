Danica Patrick Shares Inspiring Message With Real Vs. Produced Pics of Her Abs/n
She's got strong abs and a powerful message!Danica Patricktook to Instagram earlier today to prove an important point about the reality behind fitness photos. The outspoken personality also made sure to call out that photos like hers should be used to inspire instead of flagellate one's self.The 35-year-old stock car race driver posted side-by-side images of her fit form, which were taken at different angles, in a sports bra and biker shorts. Along with the photos, she wrote, "I kinda love when people do real vs produced shots. The difference between the two is lighting, pose, and clothes adjustments."Patrick added, "We all want to look our best at all times, no shame in that. But don’t let someone else’s body put yours down. Use it for motivation.”

Patrick posted the unaltered "raw" image (which looks extremely similar to the original) and wrote, "Because minimal retouching has been important to me with ALL the pictures, from lifestyle to fitness to food for @prettyintensebydanica ...... I wanted to show you the raw image from when I was deciding which one to use for the cover."She continued, "Many of you thought it was highly retouched and the main thing they do is even out the skin tone, mostly on the legs. I worked very hard. Anyone can be lean and muscular if they want to.....but you have to put in the work and learn how to eat right. It's all possible, believe in yourself."That sure shut the haters down!You can watch Patrick in action when NASCAR returns to NBC on July 1, live from Daytona for the Coke Zero 400.
