The pair was married in Italy in an intimate ceremony with just 45 people. The reception, however, was a little more extravagant, complete with fireworks and performances from Elton John."Take that, George Clooney!" David joked with Neil jumping in to add "Yeah, take that, Clooney. I don't see you showing pictures of your wedding on talk shows!"Of course, the two most important guests at the wedding had to have been the couple's fraternal twins. The Series of Unfortunate Events villain is a proud father of two (and yes, his kids love the show too!) to six-year old twins Gideon and Harper.

Congrats to the happy couple on 13 years together!
