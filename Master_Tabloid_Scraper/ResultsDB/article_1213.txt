Wow, what a total roller coaster moment!
Just moments before Lady GaGa dramatically took home Best Actress in a Limited-series or TV Movie at the 2016 Golden Globes, Ricky Gervais made a HILARIOUS joke about Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie wanting to adopt Kevin Hart and Ken Jeong.

Seriously, it was one of Ricky's better jokes of the night!
Funny moments aside, L.G. was super emotional as she accepted her Best Actress award for her celebrated work in American Horror Story: Hotel. According to the actress, it was the "best moment" of her life!
The teary-eyed and grateful GaGa stole the show from fellow nominees Kirsten Dunst (Fargo), Sarah Hay (Flesh and Bone) Felicity Huffman (American Crime), and Queen Latifah (Bessie).
Considering the blonde revealed she always wanted to be an actress first, it's likely AHS won't be her last TV role.
