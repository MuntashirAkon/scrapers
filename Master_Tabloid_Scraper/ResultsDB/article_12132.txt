Mike Vick Regrets Kaepernick Hair Comments: 'Truly Sorry For What I Said'/nMike Vick says he never should've suggested Colin Kaepernick cut his afro to look more presentable to NFL owners ... and admits he  "should've used a better choice of words " when addressing the free agent QB. Vick's been under fire since he made controversial comments about Kap on FS1's  "Speak for Yourself " earlier this week ... and the ex-NFL star says his original message was taken out of context.  "Obviously, we all know his afro has nothing to do with him being signed, and I wasn't trying to relay that message. It was just more so about helping him at the end of the day, " Vick told the  "Dan Patrick Show " on Thursday. Vick says he's always been a Kaepernick supporter and is  "truly sorry for what I said. "   "First thing we got to get Colin to do is cut his hair. " — @MikeVick advises Kaepernick on rebuilding his image pic.twitter.com /YENvUPOIgP — Speak For Yourself (@SFY) July 17, 2017/n
