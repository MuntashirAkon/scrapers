Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes Throws a 96 mph Fastball/nKC Chiefs rookie QB Patrick Mahomes has a rocket for an arm -- in fact, he once threw a baseball 96 MPH!!!  Mahomes was a baseball star in high school before focusing on football -- plus his father, Pat Mahomes, was an MLB pitcher for 12 years. So, we asked if he could still fire the rock -- and he told us he really believes he could hit 100+ if he got back in the baseball groove. For the record, Patrick once threw a football 62 mph -- on video. If he says he can hit 100 mph with a baseball ... we kinda believe him.
