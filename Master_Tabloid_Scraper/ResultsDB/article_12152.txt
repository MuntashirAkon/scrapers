A source told RadarOnline.com: “Justin was wearing a baseball cap, a white hoodie and black knee length shorts. But under his shorts he also had on black stockings that ended just above his knees.
“We have seen everything in New York but this was a new thing. He wasn’t looking to be photographed or seeking attention, this was just a guy wearing what he was comfortable in taking a walk in the city.”
