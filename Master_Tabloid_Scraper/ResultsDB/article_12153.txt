But now she’s looking more to the future than to the past.
A source told RadarOnline.com: “Part of the reason she wanted to sign off on the custody agreement with their son Julian was that she really wanted to move her life on.

“On a personal front she is ready to start dating again and would love to meet a really cool guy, she’s over being angry with Robin, she wants to take control of her life and personal happiness from now on in.”
Thicke and Patton had been High School sweethearts and were together for over 20 years before they got divorced in March 2015.
The ‘Blurred Lines’ singer then embarked on an affair with Geary who announced that she was pregnant via Instagram recently.
