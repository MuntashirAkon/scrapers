DNCE Looks Like A Group Of Hot Hipsters At The MTV VMAs Red Carpet!/n

What a fun group!
On Sunday, Joe Jonas and his band, DNCE, made an appearance on the MTV VMAs red carpet. And, boy, did they look great!
We mean, each member of the group took a risk as they all rocked bold red carpet numbers. Leading the charge, Mr. Jonas made a statement as he donned a white suit with a purple bedazzled lapel. AH-Mazing!
JinJoo Lee dressed to impress as she looked like a punk rock princess in a black sparkly number. Looking good.
As for Jack Lawless and Cole Whittle, they both looked like they were attending a hipster prom â€” and we're so about it!
Good job, you guys!
