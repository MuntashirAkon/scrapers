Cutest Campers Ever! Kendra Wilkinson Goes Off The Grid To Oregon With Her Adorable Family!/n

Not a bad time of year to visit Oregon — especially if she was around there to watch the eclipse come through earlier this week!!
Kendra Wilkinson is back on Twitter today after a few days away from all her online accounts because of a family trip to the great outdoors!

About six hours ago, Kendra tweeted the photo shown (above), with the caption: 

"Hey guys. Back to having service again. This is what my last 5 days looked like. #Oregon"

And in follow-up tweets and Instagram posts, it sounds like Kendra is an outdoor girl now (below)!!!
