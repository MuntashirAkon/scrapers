Blac Chyna Dumps Mechie After 2 Months of Dating/n
Blac Chyna is a single woman again.

The 29-year-old reality star called it quits with rapper Mechie just after two months of dating.
Via TMZ:
Sources close to BC tell us she got into an explosive argument Monday night with Mechie over his constant flirting with other women on social media. They’d been dating for less than 2 months but that didn’t stop Mechie from getting BC’s initials tattooed behind his ear.
The ink has barely dried and already she’s told him to take a hike … and to take all his stuff with him.
