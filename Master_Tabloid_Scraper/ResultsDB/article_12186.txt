Kylie Jenner has a small inner circle of friends — and she prefers it that way.

In a new preview for her upcoming E! reality series, Life of Kylie, the 19-year-old reminisce about her high school days. While trying out dresses to surprise a fan at his prom, Jenner tells her assistant, Victoria Villarroel, exactly why she didn’t go to prom and deleted all her friends off social media as a result.
“I was home schooled,” she says. “It was really sad actually. I had to unfollow all my friends that I went to school with.”
According to Jenner, she had to remove all of her high school friends from Instagram because their prom photos were giving her a serious case of FOMO.
“They probably all thought I hated them but I just couldn’t see it, you know, because they would always post photos and they were all at the prom and I was like, ‘Can’t see it,'” she explains. “It really just made me sad.”
However, it seems the lip kit queen ended up going to prom after all. As reported, the Kylie Cosmetics founder ended up attending a fan’s prom in April after he had been rejected by his date. So who’s really missing out now?
