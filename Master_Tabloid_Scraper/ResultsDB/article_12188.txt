Video footage taken from the photographer who was hit by Justin Bieber’s car has hit the web. Needless to say, it’s pretty intense.

As previously reported, the  singer was leaving a church service in Beverly Hills Wednesday night when his pickup truck nicked a photographer stationed outside the Saban Theater. The man was later hospitalized for minor, non-life threatening injuries.
Now, the video he shot of the incident has been released.
Via TMZ:
You can see and hear the accident from the pap’s view — and you also see how Justin sprung out of the truck and ran around to check on the guy. The camera was still rolling as Justin knelt down and repeatedly asked, “Is there anything we can do to help you?”
