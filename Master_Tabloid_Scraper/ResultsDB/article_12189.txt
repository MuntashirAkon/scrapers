McDonald’s finally delivers.

Famous foodie Chrissy Teigen celebrated the franchise’s #McDelivery campaign with UberEATS this week, kicking off a new era in which customers in 13 countries can order Big Macs and McNuggets straight to their door. The 31-year-old model was on hand at the Hoboken Firehouse on Wednesday to surprise firefighters with a free meal and limited edition items from McDonald’s McDelivery Collection, a line of fashion-forward items created specifically for Global McDelivery Day.

“Ok, you guys know how obsessed I am with getting food delivered AND my love for @McDonalds,” Teigen wrote on her Instagram. “My two faves have come together, thanks to #McDelivery now on @UberEATS.”

Of course, this wasn’t the first time Teigen feted something big with food from the Golden Arches. For her baby shower, the mother-of-one served guests like Kim Kardashian and Jenna Dewan Tatum items off their All Day Breakfast Menu.
While the Cravings cookbook author won’t be able to make every delivery out there today, fast food fans will still receive a chance to snag free swag from the capsule collection with every McDelivery order placed on UberEATs Wednesday (July 26, 2017) while supplies last from participating restaurants. The line — which is only available for one day only — features onesies, slides, hoodies and sweats adorned with images of the chain’s culinary creations.
Someone get us the onesie with a side of fries, please!
