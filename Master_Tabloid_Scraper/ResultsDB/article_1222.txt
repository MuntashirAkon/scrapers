ICYMI or ICYFI (in case you fell asleep).

We would be bigger liars than Dick Whitman/Don Draper if we said that the Emmy Awards were an easy show to watch. It’s a marathon night full of campy bits, nearsighted presenters who can’t read the teleprompter, and speeches that should have ended an hour ago. Fortunately for you, we are obligated by employment to report the highlights of this mildly eventful evening.
We will be updating the official winners list throughout the evening by bolding the category winner in the list below. Keep refreshing throughout the broadcast or check back in the morning so that you can blow away your co-workers with an impressive knowledge of 2015’s television regalia.
