Justin Bieber Ponders Flat Tire in Beverly Hills /nJustin Bieber has had his share of car problems in the last few weeks ... the latest of which appears to be a very perplexing flat. The Biebs was outside the Montage hotel Saturday in Bev Hills when he pondered the flat. It's apparent from the pic he's not a tire iron kinda guy. You'll recall, Justin accidentally ran over a photog and got slapped with a ticket for yakking on a cellphone while driving. Judging by his expression, we're guessing a nice man from AAA came to the rescue./n
