The pricey items don’t end there, as they also ask guests for a $255 drill and $189 Hoover Vacuum Cleaner.

Instead of fine china, they’re only asking family and fans to spend $31.99 on dinnerware and $19.99 on a frying pan set.
Although Duggar and Caldwell have plenty of items on the registry for cooking, it seems they plan to eat out a lot!
