Power Tools & Panera Gift Cards: See Joy Duggar’s Down-Home Wedding Registry/n
Joy Anna Duggar will be roughing it as a newlywed, if her wedding registry is any indication. The list of items she and fiancé Austin Forsyth are asking family and friends to buy for their new home ranges from power tools to camping gear and more!
Joy, 19, and Forsyth, 23, have a wedding site registered under their names on TheKnot.com.

According to that profile, the couple plans to wed on October 28, in Joy’s hometown of Springdale, Arkansas.

And instead of fancy stemware and décor, Joy and Forsyth’s registry is shockingly practical.
One of the top items on their list is a $55 wet-dry vacuum, followed by a sander, jigsaw, toolkit, and table saw.
The items they chose for their new home are similarly no-frills, with the linens, towels, and tableware all falling in a grim shade of gray.

How will the couple spend their newfound alone time? If the registry is any indication, they’re looking forward to date nights with no chaperone at Panera, Cracker Barrel, Olive Garden and Red Lobster (funded by gift cards from their registry).
The outdoorsy duo also clearly have camping in mind, having asked for a hiking cookware set, 2-person tent, and cozy $100 sleeping bag.
Forstyh proposed in March after dating for four months. The couple have known each other for nearly 15 years, however.
