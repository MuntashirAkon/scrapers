'Disturbed' Teen Decapitates Mom & Carries Her Head Outside!/n
A North Carolina teen has been charged in the brutal killing of his mother after emerging from their home carrying a butcher knife in one hand and her decapitated head in the other, RadarOnline.com has learned.
Cops came to the scene after Oliver Funes-Machado, 18, called 911 Monday afternoon from his 35-year-old mother’s house, 190 miles east of Charlotte.
According to reports, he was taken into custody without resistance, his lawyer calling the teen “profoundly disturbed.”

Back at the family property, police discovered the rest of Machado’s mother’s body inside, where two girls had been at the time of the incident. They remained unharmed, however.
“It does appear there’s some substantial mental health issues involved in this case,” C. Boyd Sturges III said, after speaking with Machado for close to an hour. “I’m not a doctor, so I can’t really elaborate.”
The teen is expected to undergo a mental health evaluation, said District Attorney Mike Waters.
Machado’s is due in court March 14.
