John Oliver Explains Why Your Local News Is Sneakily Getting More Conservative!/n

Listen up, Snowflakes!!!
John Oliver put a much needed spotlight on a growing epidemic in local news stations across the country: conservatism in sheep's clothing!
The main segment of Sunday's Last Week Tonight was dedicated to explaining how of media giant Sinclair Broadcast Group is injecting right-wing talking points into your local news coverage.
The company now controls 173 TV stations in 81 markets across the nation, which brings in more viewership than any current primetime show on Fox News.

The bad part of this local news monopoly? Oliver says Sinclair can "sometimes dictate the content of your local newscast" by "injecting Fox-worthy content into the mouths of your local news anchors."
Basically, this media giant — whose right-wing chief political analyst is a former Donald Trump advisor — is tipping the scales of balanced coverage in the country's trustworthy local news teams to the far right, and no one even realizes it!
Yikes! Ch-ch-check out the clip (below) to see Oliver explain the local news crisis.
