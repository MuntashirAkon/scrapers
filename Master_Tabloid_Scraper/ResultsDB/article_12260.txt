Rick Perry REFUSES To Give Up White House Podium While Claiming Science Isn't Settled On Climate Change! See The Most Frustrated Reactions!/n

Much like our environment, the Trump administration is getting a ton of heat for pulling American out of the Paris Climate Agreement.
So to help ease our minds, Energy Secretary Rick Perry held a White House press conference on Tuesday encouraging some "intellectual conversation" on the contentious topic of climate change.
But after rambling for 30 minutes and deflecting reporters' questions, it became clear the former Texas governor had little intellectual conversation himself to offer!

After letting Perry yammer on about the administration's "Energy Week" for over half an hour, deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders started giving Perry the signal to wrap it up.
But the Dancing with the Stars veteran continued to speak, practically causing reporters to beg for Sanders to pull the plug on the radioactive energizer bunny!
Watch a clip Perry failing to understand a reporter's question (below), along with scathing Twitter reactions!

Ha!
Though the best reaction included a video of Sen. Al Franken shutting Perry down when the Secretary tried to use the same argument at a budget hearing last week:
