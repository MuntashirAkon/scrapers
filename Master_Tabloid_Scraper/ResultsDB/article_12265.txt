Crash star Don Cheadle claims President Donald Trump once used a racial slur to describe black people.

In a lengthy Twitter debate with users this Sunday (March 5, 2017), the 52-year-old alleged that commander-in-chief dropped the n-word during a private conversation at a sporting tournament held at the Trump-owned gold course in Doral, Fla. When someone accused Cheadle of “Trump-hating way before treason,” the actor replied, “Hated him since he asked my friend’s father at a Doral pro-am if he’d ever ‘f*cked a n****r…’ Did it for me.”
He added that he didn’t speak up at the time because it wouldn’t have made a difference.

1) Have you never been in a stuaition where language like this was used to describe a person of color, woman, gay person, Jewish person, https://t.co/pSfijOtteC

2) LGBTQ person, Muslim, anybody, and just “kept to yourself?” We’ve ALL probably done something like this and then repeated it later to https://t.co/pSfijOtteC

3) someone we know/trust/love, and sometimes with regret and shame that we didn’t speak up at the time. Same thing here. A father repeating https://t.co/pSfijOtteC

4) it to his daughter with both disbelief of hearin the words and regret that he stayed quiet and minded his own business. Like that. https://t.co/pSfijOtteC

When asked for proof, Cheadle added, “Her father wasn’t wearing a wire. But look up the 2M or so articles about Drumpf and racism if you need a primer. Start with his own book.” (Drumpf is a name popularized by comedian John Oliver during an anti-Trump segment on Last Week Tonight.)
Cheadle’s accusations came before Trump signed a revised travel ban prohibiting the immigration of citizens from six Muslim-majority countries. The new ban, which takes effect March 16, will block citizens of Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen from obtaining visas for at least 90 days. People who already hold valid visas from those countries will be exempted from the ban.
