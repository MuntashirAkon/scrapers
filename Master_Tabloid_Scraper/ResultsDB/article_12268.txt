Between Russia’s hacking, Julian Assange’s steady drip of private emails and Oliver Stone’s justifiable paranoia, 2016 has been a year preoccupied with the transparency of elected officials and our right to privacy, and it looks like the trend will continue next year. The trailer for Emma Watson and Tom Hanks’ new film The Circle was just released teasing a terrifying future determined to eradicate the world of secrets.

Mae Holland (Watson) is a twenty-something who lands her first job at a cutting-edge technology company that aims to rid the world of privacy and help civilization achieve its potential. Hanks is Bailey, the company’s brilliant, mysterious leader who proclaim to his employees: “Because knowing is good, but knowing everything is better.”
As you can guess, all is not well in this utopian, Google-esque corporation. Soon, Holland learns just how powerful The Circle actual is and what they aim to control.
The film is based on Dave Egger’s 2013 novel of the same name and also stars Bill Paxton, Patton Oswalt and John Boyega.
The Circle arrives April 18, 2017.
