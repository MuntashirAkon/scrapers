Bessie the Dog Plays Foster Mom to Abandoned Tiger Cub/n
Bless Bessie the dog’s little heart!  The German Dachshund has become foster mom to a tiny tiger cub who was abandoned by its parents. The story of the cuddly pair, who live at the Stroehen Zoo in Northern Germany, has been melting hearts around the globe. 
A sad accident actually brought these two together. After the tiger’s mother stopped caring for it, another surrogate dog, named Monster, reportedly stepped in to care for the feline. But 9-year-old Monster died suddenly when he was hit by a car at the zoo. That’s when Monster’s 1-year-old daughter, Bessie, made it her mission to care for the tiger. Sometimes angels do come in furry little packages!
