Kate Hudson opened up about her relationship with her estranged father, Bill Hudson.
The actress stopped by The Howard Stern Show where she discussed life without her biological father. She also got real about how his absence has affected her dating life.
“I think that’s like the age-old psychological core issue for any situation,” she said. “Anybody who has had an experience with a parent that is absent, it’s going to manifest.”

“I really do recognize whatever those issues are, it’s just something that he has to live with, and that must be painful for him, so I forgive him,” Kate, 37, added. “There is always the inability for me to understand my father. I don’t understand it. I don’t even want to add fuel to anything. It’s a 36-year-old issue at this point.”
However, the Almost Famous star has her loving stepfather, Kurt Russell, to thank for filling the void. “When you have a father like Kurt who’s sort of been there for the hard stuff,” she revealed, “the thing is he’s not a perfect man, no one is, but the trust that I got from him in terms of his dependability was just priceless for me.”
