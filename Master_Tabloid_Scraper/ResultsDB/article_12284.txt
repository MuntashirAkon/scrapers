First Amy Schumer responded, now it's John Oliver's return to chime in regarding his Gilmore Girls shout out.Netflix released the first Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life teaser at the 2016 TCA Summer Press Tour. It featured footage shot just for the trailer of Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel as Lorelai and Rory Gilmore talking about pop culture happenings. In the teaser, Graham's Lorelai wandered if Schumer would like her and later asked if Oliver, the host of HBO's Last Week Tonight, would think she was hot."Lorelai, the answer is yes I do find you hot and I'll tell you why. I'm a red-blooded male with an inbuilt heat detector," Oliver said on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert, gesturing to his groin. "And my heat detector registers you as en fuego."
