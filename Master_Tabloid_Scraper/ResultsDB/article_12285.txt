Step aside, Oprah Winfrey!John Oliver just staged the largest one-time giveaway in television history during Sunday's show of Last Week Tonight, forgiving nearly $15 million in medical debt and helping 9,000 Americans. The move surpassed Oprah's previous record in which she gave 276 members of her audience a free car, for a total value of just under $8 million.Oliver's giveaway was part of a 20-minute segment on the show, lambasting the debt-buying business and the politicians who have kept it deregulated for so long. "It is pretty clear by now debt buying is a grimy business, and badly needs more oversight, because as it stands any idiot can get into it," he said. "And I can prove that to you, because I'm an idiot, and we started a debt-buying company. And it was disturbingly easy."
