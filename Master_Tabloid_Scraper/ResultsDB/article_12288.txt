When all the good guys have been captured, it's time to round up all the former bad guys.That's where Arrow is headed in its season finale tonight, which finds Oliver (Stephen Amell) teaming up with some of the series' former villains to take down Adrian Chase (Josh Segarra) and save his friends once and for all. One of those bad guys is Slade Wilson (Manu Bennett) who's apparently been locked in an underground prison on Lian Yu for years. In this exclusive clip of tonight's finale, Oliver and Slade reunite, and Oliver finds that Slade's sanity has returned after his bout with mirakuru. "Why do you want to help me, after everything I've done?" Slade asks, reminding all of us that he was the one who killed Oliver's mother, and that Oliver probably should have killed him for that. 

"Maybe what's happening now is the reason I didn't," Oliver says. He explains that he needs help to get his friends and family back from Prometheus, and even offers Slade the chance to find his son before offering him something else: a very familiar orange and black mask. "You and me kid, like old times," Slade says.So Deathstroke's back, and it's hard to imagine that Adrian Chase is getting out of this alive. Tonight's finale will also feature Oliver joining forces with Malcolm Merlyn (John Barrowman), Nyssa al Ghul (Katrina Law), and Digger Harkness (Nick E. Tarabay) against Prometheus' team, consisting of Black Siren (Katie Cassidy), Evelyn Sharp (Madison McLaughlin), and Talia al Ghul (Lexa Doig), in a fight that's surely going to end in a death or two (or three or four...). 

Arrow airs tonight at 8 p.m. on the CW.
