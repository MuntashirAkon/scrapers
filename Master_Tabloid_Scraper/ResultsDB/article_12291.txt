Oliver Stone: Hurricane Sandy Is "Punishment" for Obama and Romney Ignoring Climate Change/n
"I was a little disappointed at the third debate when neither of them talked about climate control and the nature of the situation on earth," Stone said. "I think there's a kind of a weird statement coming right after it. This is a punishment. Mother Nature cannot be ignored."The Born on the Fourth of July helmer predicted that the increasing climate crisis will continue to rear its ugly head well beyond the current election.He added: "That's all I thought about. The storm will pass. The campaign will pass. But unfortunately the nature of this present world situation will not."Stone, by the way, also revealed that he voted early and cast his ballot for Obama, despite bashing the president for continuing some of the Bush administration's policies in a new book he co-authored called The Untold History of the United States that hit stores yesterday.
