Halle Berry, Olivier Martinez: We're Back On ... But Not That Way/nHalle Berry and Olivier Martinez are back together ... but it's not what you think. We're told the soon-to-be divorced couple were leaving LAX for a flight down to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico with their 2-year-old son, Maceo, and Halle's 8-year-old daughter, Nahla. The divorce started out super nasty. Halle felt Olivier's temper was out of control and was furious she got dragged into a lawsuit over an assault at LAX. Our sources say the two are now getting along and even friendly, but there's  "no chance " they're getting back together./n
