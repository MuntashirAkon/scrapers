Tarantino -- Stranger Than Pulp Fiction/nQuentin Tarantino sure knows how to strike an outrageous pose.   The eccentric director hijacked a tourist couple's sidewalk photo shoot outside Winston's, jumping into their shots and making absurd faces and Vogue-like poses. The couple didn't seem to mind though -- they'll go back to Ohio with photos of Tarantino!Tarantino's badass  "Death Proof " star Rosario Dawson and Lindsay Lohan were also at the club, with Lohan flashing some much friendlier sign language to TMZ cameras than she did the previous evening. At Teddy's, a shady Sean Stewart, son of Rod, announced he was going to  "f**k " the unlucky blonde leaving with him, though she wisely denied it and hid her face in embarrassment. Rod indeed. Also out: a covered up Courtney Love, the always gorgeous Cindy Crawford, another fine mess Kelly Osbourne in her Oliver Hardy look, and Demi Moore, looking sporty on her way to the gym. All this in today's tourist-friendly Star Catcher./n
