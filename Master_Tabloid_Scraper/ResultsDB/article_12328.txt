Larter made sure to save her second pregnancy debut until she could appear on The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon.

“[Three years ago] I came on and I was pregnant and it went so well, and I said to my husband, ‘I’m going on Fallon, you know what that means — gotta get pregnant!’” she joked during her August appearance.
While the couple hopes to stop and take a breath with their new baby on board, it seems to be another busy year for the duo. Larter’s show Legends was renewed for a second season, while MacArthur signed on for the upcoming TBS comedy Angie Tribeca.​ /n
