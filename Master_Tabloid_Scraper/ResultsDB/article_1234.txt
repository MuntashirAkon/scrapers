"Oh, my god. I'm in shock right now," she tells the crowd.

"Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you, my compadres, brothers and sisters in the struggle, respect to everyone in this category, respect to everyone who voted for me, thank you, because anyone could have won it and many others have," she continued."Wow. Thank you, my partner at Flame Unit. Thank you, HBO for giving us a shot to make this happen after 22 years. Thank you, Dick and Lily for finding something in me 22 years ago and giving me a shot to play this part of Bessie Smith. I am in shock right now. I shouldn't be. But I am. I'm really just very grateful. Thank you so my wonderful castmates. I couldn't have done the movie without you. Richard, my acting consultant. "The actress concludes with an inspiring message for those who may feel subjected to fitting a certain ideal."Thank you, mom and dad for believing in me, and telling me I could achieve anything if I just believe in myself. And I hope that anyone out there who does not come in the package that people say you should, keep fighting for it. Flip those rocks over. Keep pushing. Keep turning. You can do it. You build your own boxes. Not people. So knock that thing away and do you. Thank you."YOU. DO. YOU. BOO. Queen Latifah said so.
