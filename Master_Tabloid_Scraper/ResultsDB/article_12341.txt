While it's easy to assume the decision was based on Donald Trump's horrific policies, the company says it was simply a matter of business.
A spokesperson told Business Insider:

"Each year we cut about 10% [of brands carried] and refresh our assortment with about the same amount. In this case, based on the brand's performance we've decided not to buy it for this season."

On the day of the announcement, Trump's label was no longer listed under the store's collection of brands.
Sorry girl!
