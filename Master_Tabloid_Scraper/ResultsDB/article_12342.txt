NOW Donald Trump Wants To Release Weekly Reports Of Crimes Committed By Immigrants/n

Wow!!! There is no low to which this man will not sink!
Diseased pumpkin Donald Trump reportedly plans on releasing a list of crimes committed by immigrants every week, although it's unclear if the list will include illegal immigrants or just immigrants in general.

We wouldn't be surprised if it's the latter!
The Secretary of Homeland Security issued a statement saying: 
"To better inform the public regarding the public safety threats associated with sanctuary jurisdictions, the Secretary shall utilize the Declined Detainer Outcome Report or its equivalent and, on a weekly basis, make public a comprehensive list of criminal actions committed by aliens and any jurisdiction that ignored or otherwise failed to honor any detainers with respect to such aliens."
This is so beyond fucked up! And calling immigrants "aliens" is just adding insult to injury!
Immigrants literally built this country. For Drumpf to paint them all as criminals is extremely damaging and straight-up reprehensible.
