Emma Stone, nominated for Best Actress for La La Land:
"What a morning. I am so grateful for this honor and I'm so happy to share this feeling with my La La Land family. The greatest part of life is connecting with people, and I love the deeply talented, kind and passionate people I was lucky enough to work with on this movie. I'm also overjoyed that the movie has connected with audiences in the way it has, and that it's hopefully bringing a kick in their step to those who watch it. This is beyond any of our wildest imaginings and we can't wait to celebrate together."
Viggo Mortensen, nominated for Best Actor for Captain Fantastic:
"I'm thrilled that CAPTAIN FANTASTIC has been included among this year's Academy nominees! Our movie has heart and brains. It entertains, inspires, and encourages honest communication in equal measures. I'm extremely proud to represent Matt Ross' extraordinary story. It is one of the finest collective efforts I've ever been a part of. YES WE CAN!"
Viola Davis, nominated for Best Supporting Actress for Fences:
"Thank you to the Academy for recognizing this extraordinary, important film and my work in it. Thank you Denzel for being at the helm!"

Jeff Bridges, nominated for Best Supporting Actor for Hell or High Water:
"Woke up this morning in beautiful Solano Beach after playing a cool gig at the Belly Up with my band the Abiders to find out I've been nominated for my performance in ‘Hell or High Water.' What a thrill, especially for a movie that is so close to my heart. I really dug playing with Gil, Chris and Ben and being directed by the talented David Mackenzie. And such a GREAT script from Taylor. Woo Hoo! Thanks Academy."

"Thank you to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences — thank you so much for this honor. I spent a good chunk of my childhood memorizing Billy Crystal's musical Oscar monologues, so this is insane. Seeing The Little Mermaid changed my life at 9-years-old, so to work with its directors Ron Clements and John Musker on Moana has been a dream come true. I share this humbling honor with them, my Moana songwriting partners Opetaia Foa'i and Mark Mancina, and the entire Disney family. Congratulations to all this morning's incredible nominees. And future congratulations to the kids watching the telecast this year, singing along with their favorite songs, performing epic private concerts for the mirror with a comb or a toothbrush microphone. You're next."
Best of all might just be Meryl Streep's though! Her rep emailed over her statement simply as a GIF:

Congrats all!
We can't wait to tune in!
