Now that the Golden Globes have come and gone, it's time for another award show to take its place and luckily the 2017 BAFTA Awards nominations are in!

Seeing as how La La Land got SO much love at the Globes, it shouldn't shock you to learn the musical flick is the BAFTA frontrunner as it landed 11 nominations! What's even better is Ryan Gosling earned his VERY FIRST BAFTA nod! Not to mention, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them got some love!
What might surprise you though is Arrival and Nocturnal Animals both came in second earning 9 nominations! Good year to be in an Amy Adams flick… unless your names are Batman or Superman. HA!
Ch-ch-check out the full list of nominees (below) and let us know if you'll be tuning in to the show when it airs on February 12!
