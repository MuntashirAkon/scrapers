‘Mockingjay’ Will Feature an Original Character/n
Lionsgate’s recent announcement that Robert Knepper, who’s best known for his role as Theodore “T-Bag” Bagwell on Prison Break, will play Antonius in The Hunger Games: Mockingjay has left a lot of fans scratching their heads — probably because the actor’s character name has never appeared anywhere in the famed Suzanne Collins novel.
That’s right: there’s a rando an original character in the film franchise.

According to the studio’s official Twitter, Knepper will appear in both Parts 1 and 2 of Mockingjay.

Of course, speculation as who Antonius could be has already begun. Many diehard readers have noted that most of Capitol’s figureheads — such as Stanley Tucci’s Caesar Flickerman and Donald Sutherland’s Coriolanus Snow — have Roman names, suggesting that Knepper’s character may be working for the president.
For now, Lionsgate has not released further details on the role.
