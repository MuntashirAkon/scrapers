Time to party in the U.S.A., y'all: Miley Cyrus got inked again!Yes, the 19-year-old bride-to-be stepped out in Hollywood Tuesday showing off a thoughtful new tattoo. Permanently etched on her left forearm is a quote from a speech given by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1910.It reads: "So that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who knew neither victory nor defeat."The significance?

It's a snippet from Roosevelt's inspiring oration that reminds us it's "not the critic who counts."Miley, who's faced her fair share of criticism through the years, excerpted this quote for her new tat:"The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, who strives valiantly, who errs and comes up short again and again, because there is no effort without error or shortcoming, but who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, who spends himself for a worthy cause; who, at the best, knows, in the end, the triumph of high achievement, and who, at the worst, if he fails, at least he fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who knew neither victory nor defeat."This is just the latest in Miley's ink collection—she got "Just Breathe" etched on her side when she was just 17—and since then she's gotten several others inked on her body. And while we love the dreamcatcher on her side and her gay marriage equality symbol on her hand, we think this new tattoo might be her best yet.
