The 2016 Soul Train Awards are just around the corner, and we have some excited news ahead of the big night!E! News can exclusively reveal Erykah Badu will host the show once again, bringing her unique sense of style, her moving music and her comedic commentary to the stage as she helps to honor those in R&B and Soul music.She will be joined by Edward Theodore "Teddy" Riley who is set to receive the night's highest honor, the Legend Award, as well as Brandy, who will be honored with the 2nd annual Lady of Soul Award. Both Brandy and Riley are being recognized for their "longstanding presence in the music industry and influence on the world of soul and R&B music past and present," a statement about the awards show reads.

Meanwhile, Badu made headlines after hosting the 2015 Soul Train Awards during which she called out Iggy Azalea.She kicked off the night with a monologue that poked fun at the fact that rap music has to be excluded from the awards show, which honors R&B music. While addressing the crowd, the "Next Lifetime" songstress made light of her own rapping ability."As you know, I am the queen of neo soul, and people say I have this common effect on rappers: that I make them change gods and wear crochet hats, shoulder pads," she said. "So they have banned me from all of the hip-hop awards with a sign saying 'Erykah Badu, leave our rappers alone.'"

But Badu continued to take her joke one step further when she decided to make fake phone calls and pretend to invite certain artists. One of her "phone calls" was to Azalea. "Uh yes? Who is this? Iggy Azalea?" she said. "Yeah, hey. Oh, no, no, no, no, you can come, 'cause what you doin' is definitely not rap."Azalea responded a couple days later. "We are days from 2016, but i came online today and saw its still cool to try and discredit my 2014 accomplishments. LOL," she tweeted. "F--king hell. Seems exhausting. Anyway - Ive been enjoying the holiday season and i hope you all have too."The 2016 Soul Train Awards will be filmed on November 6 at the Orleans Arena in Las Vegas and will air on Centric and BET November 27 at 8 p.m.
