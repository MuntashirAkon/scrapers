Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner welcomed their third child, a bouncing baby boy named Theodore, into the world on Sunday, and the mommy-of-three has been loving every minute of it.Donald Trump's daughter took to Twitter to share a photo of her hubby and their eldest child, 4-year-old Arabella Rose, sitting together with the newborn on a chair in the hospital room.Arabella looks ecstatic to be an older sister again, while Jared can't help but smile from ear to ear.

Ivanka married Jared—a real estate developer—in 2009 after dating for seven years. They announced the news of their third pregnancy in September."I couldn't be more thrilled to share the news with you that I am expecting," Ivanka wrote on her website at the time. "At the end of the day, it's my family that is at the center of my life—and to be adding another baby to our family is a tremendous blessing...Jared and I are so thankful, and so excited!"Despite all the craziness of welcoming a new baby, Ivanka has continued to help alongside her father during his presidential campaign, publicly endorsing him and traveling around the country to rally in support of him.
