Does it seem like everything is turning 20 this year?Alanis Morissette re-released a special edition of Jagged Little Pill in honor of its birthday, and now we're getting some serious nostalgia by way of The Baby-Sitters Club movie. In honor of its 20th anniversary, the cast reunited for a special screening of the movie at the Alamo Drafthouse in Austin, Texas, Tuesday.Rachael Leigh Cook, who played Mary Anne, uploaded a selfie with Bre Blair (Stacey), Larisa Oleynik (Dawn) and Marla Sokoloff (Cokie) to kick start the reunion. "It's ON! #BSCreunion," she wrote alongside the photo.Sokoloff also tapped into all of our emotions by sharing a touching black-and-white photo of her gal-pals and former co-stars.

"I've known these ladies for 20 years and I feel so lucky to share this special evening with them. #bscreunion @drafthouse #cokiemason," she captioned her Instagram pic, which also featured Schuyler Fisk (Kristy), Stacey Ramsower (Mallory) and the movie's director, Melanie Mayron.We're all about some of our favorite casts reuniting, but we have to askâ€”where are Claudia (Tricia Joe) and Jessi (Zelda Harris)?!The movie was based on Ann M. Martin's best-selling young adult book series of the same name. The books followed a group of girls who started a baby-sitting business for neighborhood kids. Twenty years later, we still want to be part of the baby-sitters club.In the two decades that have passed, the cast has certainly grown up. Cook now has two children, a boy and a girl, with husband Daniel Gillies. E! News exclusively confirmed the couple welcomed their son, who they named Theodore Vigo Sullivan Gillies, in April. Theodore became Charlotte Easton Gillies' little brother.

Hear about another notable reunion!
