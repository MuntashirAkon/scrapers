Palin Sued For $100k Over Alleged Traffic Conspiracy/nSarah Palin is the mastermind of a dark conspiracy to punish an Alaskan citizen who dared to speak out against her over the traffic situation in Juneau -- this according to a lawsuit obtained by TMZ.Â  A man named Theodore Thoma claims he had a serious issue with traffic in the neighborhood surrounding the Governor's Mansion back in 2009 ... back when Sarah was the Gov. In fact, Thoma claims he proposed state action to solve the problem and even made up signs and fliers to push the issue. But Palin didn't take kindly to the criticism, says Thoma, and she  "undertook a campaign against [Theodore] ... to punish, embarrass, discredit and silence " him.It's unclear what she did ... but according to Thoma's suit, Palin's actions have caused a  "chilling " effect on his ability to exercise his federal constitutional rights.Thoma wants Palin to fork over more than $100k for all of the harm she's caused. Calls to the Palin camp have not been returned./n
