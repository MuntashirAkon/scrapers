Lady Gaga is coming to a movie theater near you. After years of collecting musical accolades, the 30-year-old songstress celebrated her first foray onto the small screen last year in American Horror Story: Hotel—a role that sent her home with a Golden Globe.Less than a year since her awestruck acceptance speech, Gaga has officially landed her first silver screen lead role in an upcoming reboot of the 1954 classic, A Star Is Born, directed by and also starring Oscar nominee Bradley Cooper. "Im elated to be directed by & starring w/ Bradley in this project. He's a brilliant visionary artist," she tweeted Tuesday upon announcement of the news. While Gaga has proven her acting chops on television, her expected success in film will solidify her as a true triple threat in Hollywood. Fortunately, she's in the most esteemed of company. While venturing into a new genre of work may be daunting, a handful of the industry's most prominent and celebrated stars began their careers not in front of a camera, but behind a microphone. 

In arguably one of the most unexpected career turns in Hollywood history, former American Idol contestant Jennifer Hudson was an aspiring singer who landed the role of a lifetime when she was cast in Dreamgirls alongside Beyoncé and Jamie Foxx. The Hollywood unknown quickly made her mark on the industry when she won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress at the 2006 ceremony.
