Liz, 52, likened her swashbuckling heroics to something from The Three Musketeers.
She said: “Once, when we were in Spain, a snake slithered towards his Moses basket and I leapt over a table like d’Artagnan and cut its head off with an axe. Note to others: never get between a lioness and her cubs.”
Liz previously dated actor Hugh Grant, 56 – Damian’s godfather – and was wed to Indian textile heir Arun Nayar, 52.
