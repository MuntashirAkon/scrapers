SiriusXM Fires Opie After Video Scandal: He Pissed Off ‘The Wrong Person’/n
SiriusXM has said goodbye to radio host personality Gregg “Opie” Hughes, three years after dumping co-host Anthony Cumia.
The company wrote in a statement: “SiriusXM confirms it has terminated its relationship with Gregg ‘Opie’ Hughes, host of the ‘Opie Radio Show’ weekday afternoons on the Faction Talk channel. SiriusXM does not publicly discuss internal personnel issues.”
As Radar exclusively revealed this past May, the outspoken duo has long been known for their controversial on-air appearances, including a segment in which they encouraged people to engaged in public sexual acts.
Cumia was then bashed for a string of racist tweets, after which he was let go, leaving Opie with comedian Jim Norton as co-host.

According to insiders, Opie’s firing came after the host was blasted for making “of an employee using the bathroom.”
The host also recently got bashed for breaking into Howard Stern’s studio and uploading a video on YouTube about his scheme.
“Howard got wind of that really quick and he didn’t like it one bit,” an insider told Radar.

The dismissal of the host comes as no surprise, since show insiders had previously confirmed the relationship between Sirius executives and Opie had turned sour after one too many incidents.
“There are too many ominous signs to ignore,” a source said. “It’s almost like he pissed off the wrong person and now he’s paying for it.”
