The Harry Potter Cast That Could've Been But Never Was!/n

Lots of big name actors made their way to Hogwarts throughout the Harry Potter film series.
But if just a few things went differently, audiences would have been accepted to an even more star-studded school of Witchcraft and Wizardry!
Hugh Grant was originally considered to play Gilderoy Lockhart. While the Love, Actually star's toothy grin would have been perfect for the character, Grant had to drop out due to scheduling conflicts and the role ultimately went to Kenneth Branagh.
Like Grant, many other A-list Brits were considered for roles that didn't end up happening. Some actors felt they weren't good enough for the series, and others completely looked down upon the magic! (*COUGH* Tilda Swinton *COUGH*)
So while we reflect on HP's bday, meet the Harry Potter cast that almost was (below)!
