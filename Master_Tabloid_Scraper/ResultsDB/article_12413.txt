Victim's Lawyer Fights Back In Lawsuit Against Venus Williams Following Fatal Car Accident/n

Was Venus Williams driving recklessly?
As we previously reported, the top ranked athlete was involved in a nasty car accident last month at a Florida intersection, leaving Jerome Barson dead and his wife injured. While footage from the scene has since cleared Miz Williams' name in the criminal investigation, it appears as though Barson's estate is still suing the tennis champ for allegedly causing the fatal collision.

The victim's attorney Michael Steinger filed new docs on Tuesday claiming the 37-year-old accelerated from 0 to 20 mph in 4.2 seconds in order to clear the intersection, according to black box data obtained by TMZ. The police report recorded the Barson's Hyundai at 25 mph.
Steinger alleges Venus "looked up, saw the red light, and gunned it" before the Barson's vehicle T-boned her.
Stay tuned for her team's response.
