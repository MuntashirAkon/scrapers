Celebs Who've Been Candid About IVF!/n

Our hearts are just breaking for Bridget Marquardt.
As we previously reported, the Girls Next Door alum got candid about her recent unsuccessful attempts to get pregnant. During an appearance on Australia's The Morning Show, the blonde stunner revealed that she and Nick Carpenter have tried pretty much every option to conceive a child â€” but, with little luck.
Thankfully, Bridget is keeping her spirits up and still has hope that one day she'll be a mom. Awww.
In fact, Miz Marquardt isn't the first starlet to face fertility problems while trying to conceive, AND she's definitely not the only one to get candid about the struggz.
