Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are about to attend a wedding in Jamaica together for one of Prince Harry’s closest friends.

The Daily Mail reports that Harry flew out of Gatwick to Montego Bay on Wednesday (Mar. 1, 2017) to celebrate the union of Tom ‘Skippy’ Inskip and Lara Hughes-Young, a literary agent. According to the tabloid, Harry sat in a premium economy seat on the Virgin Atlantic flight out and an elderly woman was forced to move to accommodate his security detail.
Now in Jamaica, the Prince is lodging at “one of the most luxurious resorts” on the coast and will stay there for a week. Markle flew out of Toronto on a private jet on Thursday night (Mar. 2, 2017) for the ceremony today, on Friday (Mar. 3, 2017).

Inskip and Harry have been friends since they were children and attended Elon together. When they grew older, Inskip became Harry’s “wingman” on their rambunctious nights out. Friends tell the Daily Mail that the three-day wedding celebration will be the “the mother of all parties.”
It’s assumed that this will be the first wedding that Markle and the Prince will publicly attend as a couple, however, Markle has already been introduced to many of his friends during their time together. Enjoy the Venetian hour, you two.
