Scarlett Byrne, who previously played Pansy Parkinson in The Half-Blood Prince and Deathly Hallows Part 1 and 2, posed nude for the March/April issue of Playboy.

Byrne, whose fiancé is Cooper Hefner — Playboy’s Chief Creative Officer and Hugh Hefner’s son — stripped down to make a stand for feminism in the upcoming issue of the magazine after the publication announced last year that it would stop publishing nude photos. Hefner revealed on Monday (Feb. 13, 2017) that Playboy would reinstate nudity through a post on Twitter, admitting that the ban was “a mistake.”

Byrne penned an essay entitled “The Feminist Mystique,” which discusses the role of female nudity in mainstream media, to run along with her photo shoot.
“The fact that women continue to be second-class citizens around the world was inherent even within this particular situation. Many in society continue to diminish female intellect, deny them ownership of their sexuality, reject feminism and all else that makes being a woman so powerful,” writes Byrne. “It starts with equal pay and goes all the way to free the nipple.”
