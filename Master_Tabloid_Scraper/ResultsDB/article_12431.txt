The Aussie actor, 48, is beaming as he wraps his arm around his wife of 21 years while wearing a grey V-neck sweater and sunglasses. Furness matches her hubby’s casual look with a matching pair of sunglasses and a black sweater.
Jackman often sings his wife’s praises on social media and shared a selfie of the two of them two weeks ago, calling Furness his “beach babe”

The couple met on the set of the Australian drama Corelli in 1995 and have two kids together, Oscar, 15, and Ava, 10.
They celebrated their 21st anniversary in April, with Jackman posting a short and sweet tribute to his wife on Instagram. “To the love of my life. 21 glorious years. I love you with all my heart,” he wrote along with a selfie of the two playing tennis.
