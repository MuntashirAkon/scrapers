Move over Wolverine, there’s a new mutant in town — and she’s in charge now.
Hugh Jackman got adorably upstaged by his 12-year-old Logan costar Dafne Keen at the MTV Movie & TV Awards on Sunday night.
When the pair took the stage to accept the award for best duo, Jackman reached for the mic to give his acceptance speech.
“Thank you, thank you. Listen, on behalf of —” Jackman began, before Keen interrupted.

“You do 17 years [as Wolverine], I don’t speak for half of the movie, and you get to say the thank-yous? Okay, no,” she said as she grabbed the mic from her costar.
“Tonight I want to thank MTV and mom,” Keen continued. “Happy Mother’s Day in Spain.”


Best DUO ever! Love you Dafne. Thanks so much @MTV https://t.co/gtVu4DCJLh

But before she could continue, Keen noticed that Jackman left a very important person off his thank-you list — and she wasn’t afraid to call him out for it.
“You didn’t write your parents here,” she said. “He thanks Mom and Dad.”
The two wrapped up their speech with a joint Wolverine-style growl.
