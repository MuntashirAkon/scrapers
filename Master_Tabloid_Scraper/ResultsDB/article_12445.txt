If you're thinking of ending a diet, take a page from Hugh Jackman's menu.After 17 years, the actor starred as Wolverine for the ninth and last time (allegedly) in the X-Men spinoff film Logan, which is set for release on March 3. He appeared on NBC's Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon Friday to talk about the movie. While backstage in his dressing room, he decided to have a little snack.Make that a humongous snack. Make that the Wolverine of snacks. He posted on his Instagram page a photo of himself holding a fettuccine dish large enough to feed a whole group of X-Men, courtesy of celebrity chef Mario Batali."Happy Break The Wolverine Diet! @mariobatali you are legend! @jimmyfallon @wponx @20thcenturyfox," Jackman wrote.

"The new @thehughjackman #wolverine diet includes pasta. lots of pasta," Batali said.The photo also showed a smaller plate with a mostly eaten portion of pasta sitting alongside a glass of red wine. Now that's a way to break a diet!
