 Naya Rivera Is At It Again! 'Glee' Star Blatantly Rips Off Kim Kardashian's Nude Baby.../n
If imitation is the highest form of flattery, Naya Rivera LOVES Kim Kardashian! The former Glee star continued her trend of following in the reality star’s footsteps by posing in a nude baby bump shot hours after the mega-famous reality star did the same.
The sexy image — showing the 28-year-old stunner wearing just a strategically-placed fur coat — was actually posted by her hairstylist Clyde Haygood, who captioned the post: #Uncle Clyde can hardly wait to meet Baby Dorsey… #anticipation.”
As RadarOnline.com previously reported, Kim confidante Jonathan Cheban called out Rivera as a copycat and a phony late last year after the actress claimed that Kim’s racy nude spread for Paper magazine was inappropriate behavior for “someone’s mother.”

Cheban ripped into Rivera’s nearly-identical styling to the reality star, comparing her to Jennifer Jason Leigh‘s copycat stalker character from the 1992 film Single White Female, and saying she was on a “year-long tour of impersonating Kim.”
Cheban added that the criticism was also a calculated career move, writing: “As expected, she’s getting some press and when all else fails, use Kim.”

Rivera Monday wrote in her blog about entering her third trimester of pregnancy, detailing the struggles she faces as a mom-to-be.





 First they said I'm too skinny so I have to be faking it…Now they say I'm too big so I have to be faking it…SMH! Some days I'm photographed before I eat & look smaller, some days I've just eaten & I look bigger. It's all a part of the process. I think you all know me well enough to know I would document  the process if I got a surrogate. Everyone's body is different, every pregnancy is very different! I've learned to love my body at every stage! I'm going to get even bigger & that's beautiful too! I'm blessed to even be pregnant & even luckier to not have preeclampsia as far as I know, so I don't have the swelling issue this time! They also say your body carries a boy different than a girl! Whatever the case may be I'm grateful to God for this miracle & no matter what rumors or comments you throw my way this time they truly don't affect me! #NoFilter #NoPhotoShop #GoodLighting 😜

“Being in my third trimester means hard work is ahead and every day a new body part aches or seemingly falls apart. But it also comes with its share of really fun and exciting things too,” the stunning actress wrote. “So hats off to all of the strong, powerful women and mothers in the world, baby or no baby, you’re all amazing!” /n
