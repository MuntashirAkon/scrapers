By Radar Staff
Call it a Motown makeup and hair malfunction!
She has channeled Sophia Loren, Marilyn Monroe and tanning mom Patricia Krentcil, and now Kim Kardashian has attempted to emulate singing legend Diana Ross. The 31-year-old posted photos on her blog and Twitter page on Friday, dressed up like the Queen of Motown – and RadarOnline.com has the photos.

Wearing her hair in a huge afro with her face over painted with extreme makeup, the reality star didn’t exactly do the 68-year-old Supremes star justice with her homage.
Kim paid homage to the superstar for a photo shoot with Hype Williams.
“Clyde Haygood and Joyce Bonelli glammed me up and we went for a fun, crazy look, channeling Dianna Ross,” Kim blogged. “Definitely a new look for me.”
