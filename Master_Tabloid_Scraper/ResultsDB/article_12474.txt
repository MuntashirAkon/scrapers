Idris Elba & Matthew McConaughey Face Off In First Trailer For The Dark Tower — And Stephen King Fans Are Divided!/n

The Dark Tower wasn't shot with a camera, it was shot with heart.
Still, fans of the Stephen King dark fantasy series were teetering between delight and disappointment after the first epic trailer dropped on Wednesday!
The gritty trailer features Idris Elba as trigger-happy vigilante The Gunslinger and Matthew McConaughey as the sinister Man in Black.

King already revealed the film would deviate from the plot of the first 1982 book and mostly take place in the modern world, but assured fans would still "get behind it, because it is the story."
Welp, the novelist wasn't totally right about that — some fans were not feeling alterations like eye color (gasp!), cinematic grittiness (the horror!), and the Man in Black's sudden southern twang (Leave McConaughey alone!).

I was…expecting more from "The Dark Tower" trailer. Muddled. Not enough Man in Black.

The Dark Tower: It may not follow the books but I do not care. I am so excited for this movie. I actually almost teared up a little.

Me, three minutes ago: "Ooh, THE DARK TOWER trailer is here!"
Me, now: "Oh. So…um…that's…certainly a movie that was made."

Folks, film is a vastly different medium from print. Of course the Dark Tower films are going to deviate from the books. They have to.
