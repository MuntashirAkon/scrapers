Two words: doggy daycare.

Amber Heard and Johnny Depp released an apology video on YouTube in repentance of the incident last summer wherein the couple was charged for bringing their dogs, Boo and Pistol, into Australia without declaring them while filming the latest Pirates of the Caribbean film.
“Australia is a wonderful island with a treasure trove of unique plants, animals and people,” says Heard in the video at the bottom of the page. “I’m truly sorry Pistol and Boo were not declared. Protecting Australia is important.”

The canine Bonnie and Clyde faced up to a maximum of 10 years behind bars and up to a $75,000 fine, but Heard pleaded guilt on Monday to providing a false immigration document and was given a one-month good behavior bond. This holds her at a $750 fine should she break any more laws in Australia over the next month, according to Entertainment Weekly.
The country’s biosecurity laws, which entail that a visitor with a pet apply for a permit and quarantine of at least 10 days upon arrival, are a standard preventative measure against the spread of rabies.
“If we start letting movie stars — even though they’ve been the sexiest man alive twice — to come into our nation (with pets), then why don’t we just break the laws for everybody,” said Australia’s Agriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce last May of Depp and Heard. “It’s time that Pistol and Boo buggered off to the United States.”
