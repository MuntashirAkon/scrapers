 “Crazy in Love.” “’03 Bonnie and Clyde.” “Déjà Vu.” “Drunk in Love.”
By now, it’s beyond clear that Beyoncé and Jay Z make good music together. Thus, the news that they may be recording a full album is some of the best we’ve heard since, well… the surprise appearance of “Drunk in Love.”

Noel Fisher, aka Detail, the veteran producer who worked on (and won a Grammy last night for) “Drunk in Love,” seemed to confirm the imminence of the long-rumored Bey-Z collaborative album.
“I’m working with a couple of new projects that I don’t want to unveil, and then me and Beyoncé and Jay Z are actually doing something together this year,” he said. Something? Is this something an album?
“When you think of Jay and Bey together, you think ‘album.’ You should already know,” he added. Will it be out this year?  “In my imaginary mind, I will work to say it’s true.”
Without being actual confirmation, that sounds almost exactly like confirmation. Prepare to bow down to the Carters once again in 2015.

While, for us plebes, this sounds like the greatest news of all time, Beyoncé is likely happier about winning three Grammys last night, bringing her total to 20 (!!!).
After the show, Beyonce took to Instagram to pose with her trophies (and her husband). Here, a little dance:

Should Beyoncé and Jay actually release this rumored collaboration, expect her Grammy count to go up in 2016.
