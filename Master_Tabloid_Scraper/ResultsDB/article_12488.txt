 Continuing with its cute puppy theme, Budweiser’s entry for this year’s Super Bowl features a lost dog and a Clydesdale horse who just wants his best friend back.

 #Repost @mc_gutty ・・・ Was roaming around The South Street Seaport and ran into the lost @Budweiser puppy. He said he was lost in NYC trying to find his bud, so I gave him some directions. Has anyone else seen him? @Budweiser | #BestBuds #Ad #NYC #SouthStreetSeaport
