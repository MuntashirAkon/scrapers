Dwarf Billy Goat Helps Clydesdale Friend Flee to Freedom
/n
Lancelot knows the most important thing in life is freedom. Well, freedom and friendship.
That’s why the Californian dwarf billy goat went out on a limb to help his nearly one-ton friend, Buddy the Clydesdale, escape their farm. Lancelot butted open the stable gate Wednesday, owner Tamara Schmitz told the Santa Cruz Sentinel. (“Buddy,” incidentally, is short for “Budweiser.” Go figure.)
Buddy (and another Clydesdale named Harry) took their opening and escaped to the pastures and fields of the surrounding Santa Cruz Mountains. Harry apparently didn’t quite have the heart to extend the pair’s Down by Law-esque excursion, and he was captured the next day in a nearby meadow.

Buddy, however, is different. “Buddy’s very elusive,” Schmitz said. “He’s not like other horses. He’s not attracted by meadows and other horses. He can stay hidden.”
Buddy’s elusiveness was demonstrated over the course of the next five days, when he went on the lam throughout a three-mile stretch of the mountain range. The community rallied around Schmitz, helping her track Buddy on horseback and foot. He didn’t make things easy.
“One of the neighbors heard him snorting across the ravine one night … but by the time we would arrive, we would only find his tracks.”
Buddy trekked, wraithlike, across the mountains, avoiding even the temptation of a reunion with his old friends Harry and Lancelot, who were trotted out to try and tempt him back.
Schmitz’s biggest worry was that Buddy would wander onto Highway 17, but things worked out eventually; after five days, Buddy was discovered “hiding in some Manzanita [shrubs] about a mile from the house,” Schmitz said. His escape curtailed — until next time — Buddy was led back home.
