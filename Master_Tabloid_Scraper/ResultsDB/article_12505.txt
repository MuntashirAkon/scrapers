Heidi Klum is armed and dangerous.It's not one of her signature Halloween costumes, but the German-born supermodel sizzles nonetheless as she dresses up gangster-style for a Hunger magazine spread inspired by everyone's favorite Depression-era villainess, Bonnie, of Bonnie and Clyde fame.In one shot, Klum offers up her best Faye Dunaway impression as she sports a beret over bobbed blond hair while sitting behind the wheel of a vintage 1930s-style automobile, sultry eyes staring into the night.

In another, the former Victoria's Secret Angel looks absolutely criminal lounging in the backseat, wearing a trilby hat pulled low over her eyes with a white and peach-print button-down shirt, black slacks and brown belt.

In the last photo, Klum sits backwards on a chair in a tailored black suit, fur wrapped around her, while gazing at the camera. Clearly this criminal's not intimidated by anybody.The 39-year-old mother of four also stars in a minute-long video from the shoot that kicks off with the words, "Heidi Klum is a warm gun," flashing across the screen and shows Klum packing a pistol alongside her Clyde, played by a hunky male model.She can rob our bank anytime.
