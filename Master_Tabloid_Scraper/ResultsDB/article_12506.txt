Word to the wise, Evan Ross and Ashlee Simpson—the more obvious the costume, the more likely you get caught. We can't tell if these two are headed to rob a bank or star in a community theatre production of Oliver (mostly the "Yes Me" singer).Given how many places there are to hide rolls of bills in the couples' baggy getups (the over-sized purse, the over-sized shorts, underneath that ridiculous hat...) we're going robbers. Though if the real Bonnie and Clyde ever saw these two flashy fools, they'd flat out retire. 

Here's hoping the almost married get their styles in check before the big day. If this in any indication of the wedding theme, we're in trouble. We assume Diana Ross would sooner disown her son than see him walk down the aisle in the tux version of this awkward "suit." And while we love the leather skirt Jessica Simpson's little sis is rocking, it's pointless hidden behind that roomy jacket. So where's the light, bright pre-wedding wear? Or at the very least, the light, bright, it's-the-middle-of-June wear?Tune-in to an all-new Fashion Police this Friday at 10/9c!
