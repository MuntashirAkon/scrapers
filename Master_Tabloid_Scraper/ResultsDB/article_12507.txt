People still love Bonnie and Clyde!On Sunday night, A&E premiered part one of the docudrama miniseries starring Holliday Grainger and Emile Hirsch as the infamous crime duo Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow. Although some fans and critics were outraged that the four-part docudrama (which also aired on the History Channel) was not historically accurate, that didn't stop people from tuning in.Bonnie & Clyde premiered across three different networks (A&E, Lifetime and History) and delivered major ratings: 9.8 million viewers tuned in, and the docudrama also snagged the top spot as the most tweeted about program of the night.

Sunday's first installment of Bonnie & Clyde helped score some of the best numbers in A&E's history. Outside of History's Hatfields & McCoys and The Bible, Bonnie & Clyde is cable's best miniseries opening among total viewers since 2006's Broken Trail.Bonnie & Clyde was the first-ever simulcast across Lifetime, A&E and History and with numbers like these, we have a feeling it won't be the last!Part two of the miniseries airs tonight at 9 pm.
