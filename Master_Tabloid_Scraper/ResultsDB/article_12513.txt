Katt Williams: 5 Women Claim He Held Them at Gunpoint/nKatt Williams is on a Bonnie and Clyde style crime spree ... if you believe the 5 women who've now come forward claiming he and his crew held them at gunpoint. The women say they ran into Katt and his 15-person entourage Sunday morning at 2:30 in downtown Atlanta. They say they noticed the comedian and asked for a photo, but when Williams noticed one of them was recording video ... he allegedly lost it. The women say he punched one of them -- which started an all out brawl, until Williams took out a gun and pointed it at them. They claim he and his entourage took all their phones. One woman says she managed to grab a phone from their car ... and dialed 911. When cops arrived Katt told officers a different story. He claims the women were harassing him, and one of them tried to snatch a chain from his neck ... and that's when he punched in self-defense. He does admit taking out a gun, but only because he heard one of the women mention a gun. In the end, police made no arrests because there were no independent witnesses and no injuries -- but they are continuing to investigate. As we've reported ... Katt was arrested the next day in an Atlanta suburb for allegedly punching an employee in a pool supply store. The 5 women have lawyered up./n
