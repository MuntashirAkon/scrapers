Clyde Drexler -- Cleared for Marriage ... Met Fiancee Through NBA Legend/nClyde Drexler is about to glide into his second marriage ... and TMZ Sports has learned it's all thanks to a huge assist from another NBA superstar. We know ... Clyde and his GF Tonya filed for a marriage certificate in Texas on February 11th ... and sources connected to the situation tell us they plan to officially tie the knot in the next few weeks. But get this ... the person who introduced Clyde to his special lady is none other than Clyde's old NBA pal Dominique Wilkins -- the Human Highlight Reel. We're told Clyde and Tonya first started dating around 2 years ago ... and the rest is history. Congrats!/n
