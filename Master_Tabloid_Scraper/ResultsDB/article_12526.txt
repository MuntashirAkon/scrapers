Maria Shriver Violates Road Rules ... Again!/nNot to be outdone by hubby Arnold Schwarzenegger, Maria Shriver broke two more road rules yesterday, but again she got off scot-free.The rebellious First Lady of California was walking out of Peet's Coffee in Santa Monica when a vigilant parking enforcement officer noticed her meter had expired. The officer pulled out his rusty, trusty  "auto-cite " device to ticket the vehicle, when suddenly one of Maria's security dudes from the CHP's Dignitary Protection Unit ran up to him, flashed his badge at the officer and did some fast talking.In the end, the officer backed off without writing a ticket. Maria then got in her SUV, took off her glasses and began eating her muffin as the expired meter continued blinking.Oh, and there's this .... she drove off without securing her seat belt.A police official says writing a parking ticket is  "discretionary. "Just days earlier, Maria's hubby, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, parked his sweet Porche in a red zone. He was not ticketed and said yesterday,  "No on is perfect. Not even me. "  And of course, over the last month, we've caught Maria several times driving while yakking on her cell phone, a violation of California law.They're like the Bonnie and Clyde of the roads.
