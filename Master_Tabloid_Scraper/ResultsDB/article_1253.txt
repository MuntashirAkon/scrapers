Situation: Take Two? 'Jersey Shore' Cast Hints At Reunion Show!/n
A Jersey Shore reunion may be in the works, and former cast members are saying they would absolutely love an on-screen comeback, RadarOnline.com can report.
It’s been nearly five years since the popular reality hit’s finale aired, but the show’s stars, including Nicole “Snooki” Polizzi, Jenni “JWOWW” Farley, Mike “The Situation” Sorrentino, and Paul “Pauly D” DelVecchio, have not forgotten all their good — and bad — times.
“We always talk about it!” said Sammi “Sweetheart” Giancola.

Rumors of a reunion have been swirling on the web over the past few months, and now several cast members have revealed to In Touch that they would, in fact, be down to return!
The Situation said he would “obviously” be pumped for another Jersey Shore run — and he recently hinted that it may already be in the works.

In a tweet from June 19, the 34-year-old reality star posted a video of himself looking excited, and he captioned it “Something on the way #GTL.”
That tweet was followed up by an even more obvious sign of what’s possibly to come. Mike wrote: “Up to Something,” and he tagged costars Snooki, Pauly D, JWOWW and Sammi Sweetheart.

Vinny, 29, said that he is “down for a lot, as long as it’s entertaining and as long as it’s funny.”
“There are some things in life that are like, no I’m not gonna do that if it doesn’t fit me, but of course I would love to,” the star added. “Whatever entertains people,”
Sammi, 30, agreed with Vinny, saying she “totally would” do a reunion show and does’nt “know why it hasn’t happened already!”
JWOWW echoed her costars’ enthusiasm, gushing they should bring their partners along for the ride.

“I have always been open to a reunion. I think it would be fun to have all of our significant others involved so our fans can see the dynamics between all of us and how far we’ve come,” the 31-year-old reality vixen said.
As Radar reported, Jenni tied the knot with Roger Mathew in 2015, in the presence of her Jersey Shore cast mates.
The mom-of-two said that “time will tell” if there is actually something in the works for the famous crew.
