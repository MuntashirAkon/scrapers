Making Bank Behind Bars! Jodi Arias Gets A RAISE For New Prison Job/n
Jodi Arias has a new prison job and RadarOnline.com has learned it’s much better than her last!
The convicted felon, who is serving a life sentence behind bars at the Perryville Prison in Arizona, had been scrubbing toilets for a measly 10 cents an hour.
On March 28, 2017, however, the Arizona Department of Corrections posted that Arias was given a new prison job: working in the Store/Warehouse at a whopping rate of 50 cents an hour.

Alexander’s murderer was given life without parole in the notoriously tough prison, and the new job confirmation fell just a few days short of her two year incarceration anniversary – April 13.
Arias, who stabbed Alexander 29 times, slit his throat and shot him in the face, has been ordered to pay his family $32,000 in restitution and made a payment of $531.00 in late 2016.
The check enraged his sister, Tanisha Sorensen who said she hoped her brother’s killer would “burn in hell,” for her heinous crime.

Radar also confirmed that Arias has worked 72.5 hours in her new position, earning a paltry $36.25 so far.
“I’m at peace knowing the monster is rotting in prison until the day she passes away from this life and enters into yet another prison where she will stay until she is sent to her eternal home in hell burning within the flames,” Sorensen wrote about Arias’ December check.
