The Latest Snake Theories Surrounding Taylor Swift's Social Media Return!/n

You already know Taylor Swift's fans are off to the races trying to figure out the singer's latest cryptic videos!
The 10-second video posted on Monday and 20-second clip from Tuesday seemingly show some sort of slithering snake — BUT WHAT DOES IT MEAN?!
Some fans have pointed out a 2 and a 5 (release this Friday, the 25th, perhaps?!) in the graphic, while others are making connections to mythical creatures.
Quiz: How Well Do You Know Taylor Swift?
One fan on Tumblr (femmetay) seems to think it's a "fucking basilisk" — which is defined as: 

"In European bestiaries and legends, a basilisk (/ˈbæsɪlɪsk/ or /ˈbæzɪlɪsk/, from the Greek βασιλίσκος basilískos, "little king;" Latin regulus) is a legendary reptile reputed to be king of serpents and said to have the power to cause death with a single glance."
 
That does sound very Taylor-esque!
Another Swiftie thinks the length of the two videos hints at a possible album release date: October 20 (below):
