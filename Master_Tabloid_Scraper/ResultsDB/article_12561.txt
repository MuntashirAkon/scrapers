The Swifties are speaking out!
As we reported, Taylor Swift is facing radio DJ, David Mueller, in court this week after a 2013 incident where he allegedly grabbed her ass during a meet and greet. The controversy took a messy turn when Mueller sued Swift for slander, and the hitmaker hit back with a sexual assault and battery countersuit.
After the Shake It Off singer's emotional testimony on Thursday, Twitter rallied behind the 27-year-old to show their support during this legal battle.

Fuck your shitty Taylor Swift jokes. A woman publicly testifying about her sexual assault deserves nothing other than unwavering support.

I thought taylor would be upset & nervous on the stand but the fact she's being so strong and standing up for herself MAKES ME SO PROUD

It is SO important for sexual assault victims to be confident & stand up for what they KNOW happened & Taylor is out there setting that ex.

I'm not trying to trivialize Taylor's trial in any matter, but she truly ended Mueller and his team.
