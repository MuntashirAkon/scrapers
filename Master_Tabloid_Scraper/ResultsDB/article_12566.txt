George and Amal Clooney’s family just got bigger — by two!

The couple welcomed a pair of twins — a boy and a girl — early Tuesday morning (Jun 6, 2017). A rep for the new parents since confirmed the happy news, telling People in a statement:
“This morning Amal and George welcomed Ella and Alexander Clooney into their lives. Ella, Alexander and Amal are all healthy, happy and doing fine. George is sedated and should recover in a few days.”
News of the pregnancy was confirmed in January after George’s mother accidentally revealed the sex of her grandchildren, telling Vogue, “It will be one of each! Yes, a boy and a girl. That’s what I’ve been told.”
George and Amal married in September 2014 after a four-month engagement. The twins are the first children for the pair.
Congrats!
