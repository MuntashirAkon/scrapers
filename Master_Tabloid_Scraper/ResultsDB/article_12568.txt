Don’t let those holes in her pants fool you. Ariel Winter’s latest outfit costs quite the pretty penny.

The Modern Family star was color coordinated AF when she stepped out in a head-to-toe blue ensemble Monday (Apr. 10, 2017). Grabbing coffee at a Starbucks in Los Angeles, Winter was going braless in a $29 halter top from Urban Outfitters — which, unfortunately, has since been sold out — paired with $138 jeans by One Teaspoon. The 19-year-old accessorized her sporty chic look with a $575 Alexander McQueen sneakers and a $400 colbalt-colored Fendi keyring.
The total cost of her outfit? A whopping $1,142 (and we haven’t even taken into account the cost her matching manicure just yet).
