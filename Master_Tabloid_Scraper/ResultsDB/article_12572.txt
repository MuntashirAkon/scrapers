There are many times when we look at Kylie Jenner’s outfits and say, “Ohmygod I need this,” and then we admit to ourselves that we wouldn’t actually have anywhere to wear it. However, this giant coat that she tried on while visiting with German designer Philipp Plein during New York Fashion Week is the exception.

Jenner posted a photo of her and Plein wearing these enormous black down coats on Sunday (Feb. 12, 2017). “NYFW,” she wrote in the caption with the middle finger emoji.
