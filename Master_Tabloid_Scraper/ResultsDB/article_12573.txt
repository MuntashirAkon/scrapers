Tracee Ellis Ross loves fashion, but she doesn’t obsess over what size she is at a given moment.
The Black-ish star told People, “You know, I am not a sample size. I am not a model size. I am small for people and big for an actress. My weight fluctuates a lot and I move with it. It is what it is. That’s why I try not to have a relationship with the size that I am. I actually own my favorite jeans in three sizes—28, 29 and 30.”
Ross added, “Depending on how I feel, I always start with the big ones and if I get to go down, great. It’s the same thing with dresses and clothing. I want to wear something that makes me feel gorgeous, not that makes me feel self-conscious about my body. Hiding insecurities or putting attention on the stuff that feels good is really the key.”

The actress also credited her sense of style to her mother, Diana Ross, saying, “As a child, going through my mother’s closet was one of the ways I connected to her and her legacy. I’ve always been connected to the narrative of clothing. My mom taught me that you can spend money on nice things if you’re going to use them. For example, I have an Alexander McQueen jacket that I wear with everything, even sweatpants.”
“There’s no real method to my madness,” she said, explaining that the key is to “ask what is the best thing out of my closet or the best thing on the rack that makes me feel good and fits.”
