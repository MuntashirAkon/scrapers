We're officially steaming with envy thanks to Alexander Skarsgård.The actor sat down with Andy Cohen on his weekly SiriusXM show Andy Cohen Live Monday and dished the details about his experience working with Prince Harryfor the international charity trek, Walking With the Wounded, a few years ago.The pair joined up with 12 wounded soldiers and took a 208-mile ski trip to the South Pole, which lasted several weeks. "He's a really nice guy," Skarsgård said of spending time with the royal. "It's a very bonding experience to be down in Antarctica for a month…and when you're with a small team and it's -45 degrees, you kind of have to work together. You become a unit. You have to help each other out. You kind of forget who is a Prince and who is a marine and who is an actor."

Prince Harry and the True Blood actor ended up arriving at the South Pole on Friday, Dec. 13, 2013, after their 208-mile trek, which began on Dec. 2. "Huge congratulations to all on the @supportthewalk expedition with Prince Harry," the official Clarence House Twitter posted after they completed the difficult task.Three teams—Soldier On (Australia and Canada), Soldiers to Summit (United States of America) and Walking With the Wounded (United Kingdom), which was led by Prince Harry—took part in the charity event.Originally, the American, British and Commonwealth teams were competing against each other, but due to weather conditions, the teams ended up going at their own pace.Walking With the Wounded is a U.K. charity that helps retrain and reeducate wounded servicemen and women to help them find long term employment after they have left the Armed Forces. Harry serves as patron of the charity.
