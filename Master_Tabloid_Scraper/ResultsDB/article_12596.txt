Kenny Smith: Beyonce Owning Rockets Would Change Sports/nHouston Rockets legend Kenny Smith believes the chances of Beyonce becoming a part owner of the team are  "very good " -- and would immediately  "change the whole dynamic of sports. " The singer is reportedly interested in buying a stake of the NBA team -- with current owner Les Alexander recently announcing he's looking to sell. Smith -- who won 2 NBA Championships with the Rockets -- is still close with the team and even had a  "date " with management last year about possibly being the head coach.  So, we hit up Smith for the 411 -- and it's obvious, he's all about getting Beyonce into that owners' box.   "I would love to see that, " Kenny tells TMZ Sports ...  "That would be something I look at my daughters and say, 'Look, see you don't have to be a part of the team. Own the team! " /n
