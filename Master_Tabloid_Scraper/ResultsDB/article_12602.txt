George Clooney's Twins Ballin' Out on Private Jet on 1 Month Bday/nWhen your father's a mega-rich tequila baron, you fly to Italy on a private jet ... even when you're just 1 month old!!! That's how George and Amal Clooney rolled this week ... touching down at an airport Monday in Milan on a sick PJ, with babies Elle and Alexander getting the total VIP treatment.Â  The kiddos -- born on June 6 in London -- each got their very own bassinet. George carried one, Amal got help carrying the other. It's been a pretty good year for the Clooneys -- besides the twins, George's Casamigos tequila company sold for $1 BILLION back in June. Welcome to the good life, kids./n
