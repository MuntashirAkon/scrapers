Seinfeld's 'Vandelay Industries' Resurfaces in Real-Life Fake Architect Indictment/n "Seinfeld " is back ... linked to a guy who's been indicted for passing himself off as an architect, and the investigation is called  "Operation Vandelay Industries. " Seriously. New York's Attorney General announced a 3-charge indictment Thursday against a guy auspiciously named Paul Newman -- yes, Newman -- for allegedly defrauding construction companies, business owners and others by pretending to be a licensed and registered architect. The AG says Newman drafted bogus designs for over 100 properties in 3 NY counties since 2010, making tens of thousands in the process. He was also the only employee at his company. George Costanza would be proud./n
