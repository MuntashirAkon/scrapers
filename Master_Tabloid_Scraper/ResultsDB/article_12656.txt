Thing may be rocky for Scott Disick and Kourtney Kardashian, but he has nothing but love for his ex-girlfriend’s mom.

The father-of-three seems to be on good terms with Kris Jenner these days. While the mother of his three children vacationed halfway around the world in Egypt with Younes Bendjima, Scott met up with his ex’s mom for a cordial lunch Wednesday, August 9th, in Woodland Hills, Calif.
The pair enjoyed a casual meal together at Maria’s Italian Kitchen, sharing a laugh as they chatted about family matters. During the outing, Scott, 34, planted a sweet kiss on the 61-year-old matriarch’s cheek before parting ways.

According to sources, the meting was a friendly one and the momager had no ulterior motives. Kris met up with Scott not because she wanted to make sure he would follow his across the globe again (need we remind you of that Cannes debacle), but rather she wanted to catch up and see how he was doing now that Kourtney has officially moved on to another man.
“Kris wants Scott to have a good relationship with her grandchildren,” an insider told Celebuzz. “She only wants the best for her family.”
