Did Kevin Hart Cheat on His Pregnant Wife?/n
Kevin Hart is breaking his silence amid rumors that he’s cheated on his pregnant wife, Eniko Parrish.

Recently, the 32-year-old Ride Along star was accused of having an affair when photos of him allegedly hooking up with another woman in a car surfaced online. Supposed insiders claimed “they were up to no good” as the two were seen leaving a nightclub in Miami.
In response to the allegations, Hart shared a photo of cackling to Instagram, seemingly refuting rumors that he was caught being unfaithful to his wife of almost a year. “At the end of the day, you just gotta laugh at the BS,” he wrote. “#LiveLoveLaugh ….. SMDH.”

Hart and Parrish, 32, married last August in California after a two-year engagement. The couple announced they were expecting their first child together in May. (Hart is also the father of two children from a previous marriage: son Hendrix, 9, and daughter Heaven, 12.)
Though Parish did not personally respond to the cheating allegations, she did share a selfie of her flaunting her budding baby bump in a bikini.
“Well H E L L O #WCW,” she captioned a photo on Instagram. “Much hasn’t really changed. I’m still in the gym 3-5 days a week and I feel GREAT! The BBB’s got a little bigger…Boobs,Butt,& Belly of course but I’ll take it!”
