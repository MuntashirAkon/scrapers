See Wild Behind-The-Scenes Footage Of The 'Jersey Shore' Reunion/nSnooki, who is now a mother-of-two, showed some behind-the-scenes footage as she and her reality star family taped some scenes.In one clip that has been released ahead of the premiere by E!, Snooki, Jenni “JWoww” Farley, Mike "The Situation" Sorrentino, and Pauly "DJ Pauly D" DelVecchio are seen talking about their former life, which involved lots of hookups.“They filmed 24/7 so all the hookups were on tape,” Pauy D said. “I wonder what they do with that footage, I want it.” He probably should burn it, but since he’s now single again after splitting from singer Aubrey O’Day in July, we guess he’s free to reminisce a bit.And the cast will be doing a lot of that, since the show, titled Reunion Road Trip, is more about a trip down memory lane as they recall their fondest memories from the show, which ended five years ago.“Viewers will follow the lifelong friends as they come together to gossip about each other's lives, what has been said about them in the press, the juiciest moments and stories from behind the scenes that we never saw, and most of all talk about the pop culture hit that has bonded them forever,” Hollywood Reporter states about the E! show.What are your thoughts on the show making a comeback?
