Even some of our less tech-savvy celebs gave thanks to the HFPA in written statements:
Natalie Portman:

"I'm so honored to be recognized by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association. I had such a beautiful experience making this film with the most wonderful cast and crew, and particularly with our great director, Pablo Larrain, that it feels like icing on the cake to be nominated."
Nicole Kidman:

"This nomination is even more emotional and I'm more grateful than ever before. Thank you to the Hollywood Foreign Press!"
Ruth Negga:

I am profoundly grateful for this recognition‚Ä¶ I can't thank the HFPA enough for their support, this is such an honor. I am humbled to be in the company of all of these extraordinary, talented, and powerful women. It has been such a gift to share Mildred and Richard Loving's important story with the world. I share this honor with my partner in the film, Joel Edgerton, our incredible director Jeff Nichols and everyone involved in bringing Loving to life."
Jessica Chastain:

"I'm thrilled to be acknowledged in this talented peer group with such amazing actresses. I would not be here without the brilliant direction of John Madden. Thank you to EuropaCorp for making such a daring film, particularly now, and thank you to the HFPA for this honor."
Octavia Spencer:
"I am deeply humbled to be nominated for a Golden Globe for playing this particular role. The women of Hidden Figures story are hidden no more. Thank you HFPA."
Matt Damon:

"Congratulations to our incredible crew and a deep thank you to Kenny Lonergan and the entire cast who poured their hearts and souls into this, and thank you as well to the HFPA for championing a little movie like ours."
Amy Adams:

"Thank you so much to the Hollywood Foreign Press Association who have always been so incredibly supportive of me throughout my career. I'm really honored to be recognized for Arrival, a film I so deeply loved working on. Thank you to Eric for his brilliant script, Jeremy for being an amazing partner and Denis for his incredible guidance and capturing the true heart and soul of this film. I'd also like to congratulate Tom Ford and Aaron Taylor Johnson for their Nocturnal Animals nominations."
Congrats again, everyone!
