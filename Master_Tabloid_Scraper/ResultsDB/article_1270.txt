F*ck Cancer Gently With A Chainsaw! Shannen Doherty Officially Signs On For The Heathers Reboot!/n

Yass!
We've been keeping our eyes on TV Land's upcoming Heathers reboot ever since the announcement was made earlier this year.
After finding out that the "Heathers" this time around would actually be the outcasts of the school — a black lesbian, a gender queer redhead, and their large-and-in-charge leader — we weren't quite sure how this reimagining would work.

But now our faith in the project is restored, because Shannen Doherty (the OG Heather Duke) revealed she will have a role in the upcoming dark comedy reboot!
On Tuesday, the actress took to Instagram to make the announcement — complete with a very caption:

AH-Mazing!!!
Doherty's role is being kept under wraps for now, with TV Land only confirming she will play a "pivotal, unnamed character."
Not only does this bring new life into the reboot, but it's also is a great sign that the 45-year-old's health is looking up amid her ongoing battle with breast cancer.
Who do YOU think Doherty will be playing in the Heathers reboot?
