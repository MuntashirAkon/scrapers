 Another MTV Arrest! '16 & Pregnant' Alum Whitney Purvis Jailed For Beating Baby Daddy.../n
Jenelle Evans isn’t the only teen mom fighting with her baby’s father.
16 & Pregnant alum Whitney Purvis, 23, was arrested on felony aggravated assault and misdemeanor trespassing charges on September 2, Georgia’s Floyd County District Attorney’s Office exclusively confirms to RadarOnline.com.
The soft-spoken MTV reality star, who appeared on the series’ first season in 2009, allegedly attracted police’s attention by breaking into 26-year-old baby daddy Weston Gosa‘s home and beating him with a broom.
According to the D.A. spokesperson, the mother of two was thrown into Floyd County Jail after the violent incident. She was released by September 3, when she promptly took to Facebook.

“New beginnings are often disguised as painful endings,” she captioned a glam photo that was clearly more flattering than her mug shot taken the previous day.

Formerly engaged pair Purvis and Gosa have a tumultuous history. The bitter exes share sons Weston Jr., 6, and baby River Blake, who was born in October 2014.
“We’re happy, but in no rush to get married,” she told Radar during her second pregnancy.
But just two months after River’s arrival, the couple split.

Both Purvis and Gosa have previous arrests on their records. The young mom was arrested for stealing a pregnancy test from a Walmart in March 2012, while her baby daddy was arrested for DUI and possession of a controlled substance that July.
They were arrested together for damaging a person’s property and trespassing in December 2012.
Purvis’ mother April, who was pregnant at the same time as her daughter in 2009, also has a rap sheet. She was arrested for possession of marijuana and methamphetamine in June 2011. /n
