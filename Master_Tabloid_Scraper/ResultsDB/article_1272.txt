Sweden has set up a hotline which both men and women can call to report all the condescending assholes in their lives.
The number, established by Unionen, is a temporary service available between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. this week, and the calls will be answered by a staff of 20 people, both men and women.
Union spokeswoman Jennie Zetterström told The New York Times about the hotline: 

"Our objective is to contribute to awareness and start a discussion which we hope will be the first step in changing the way we treat each other and talk about each other in the workplace. It's important to create awareness about how seemingly small things that we do or say add up to a larger issue."
Jennie also dished about how they selected the number's staff, saying:

"The most important thing when we consulted these people is that they have knowledge and interest in the issue. Both women and men carrying valuable experience for such a type of activity."
She explained that women callers usually want advice about how they can respond to mansplainers, while men want to know how they can help their female coworkers deal with misogynistic d*cks.

But, Miz Zetterström made it clear their intention is not to bully these condescending colleagues, adding:

"Our intention has never been to point fingers or blame all men, our intention has simply been to spark an interest and start a debate at our work places and in society. Of course it's regretful if someone feels offended."
To be fair, we do think they should be knocked down a peg…
