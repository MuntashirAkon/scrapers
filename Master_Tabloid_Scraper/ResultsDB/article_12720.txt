During the first sermon in Cross Church’s five-week series, senior pastor Ronnie Floyd reportedly denounced infidelity, and even allegedly cited hacked website Ashley Madison. (Last week, Gawker revealed that father of four Josh, 27, was a member of the group, which arranges affairs for married men.)

“Adultery, being sexually or emotionally unfaithful to your spouse, that’s wrong,” the pastor allegedly said.
“We’re in a sexual epidemic of unprecedented proportions in this county.”
The Duggars have long been associated with the Cross Church, which has a location in the family’s native Springdale, Arkansas.

Josh’s sister Jill, 23, and husband Deryck, 26, even got married in the church.
While the Duggar kids have remained mum following their brother and parents’ announcement about Josh’s sexual sins, long-suffering wife Anna’s siblings are speaking out.
As RadarOnline.com first reported, the 27-year-old mom’s older brother Daniel, 30, slammed Josh as a “pig” on social media, and even revealed that he hopes the pair divorce.
Sources told Radar that Anna’s younger sister Susanna, 23, is also hoping the married couple of seven years split. /n
