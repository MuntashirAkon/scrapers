 It's Set! 'Arrow's' Stephen Amell To Face Off With WWE's Stardust As Part Of SummerSlam.../n
The ongoing feud between Arrow star Stephen Amell and WWE superstar Stardust is set to explode at SummerSlam later this month.
On RAW Monday, the bad blood, spurred by online barbs, exploded when Stardust hit Amell, a special guest on the show seated in the audience, with a cheap shot. The nimble Amell leapt over the barricades, entered the ring and tackled and pounced on Stardust until WWE officials led him away from the ring.
