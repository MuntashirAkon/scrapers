Kendall and Kylie Jenner are probably the most hated people in the music industry right now.

Notorious B.I.G.‘s mom Voletta Wallace blasted the two reality stars for using the late rapper’s image on a t-shirt in their new clothing line. Taking to Instagram, Biggie’s mother called the pieces “disrespectful, disgusting, and exploitation at its worst” for use Biggie Smalls’ face without the family’s consent.
“I am not sure who told @kyliejenner and @kendalljenner that they had the right to do this,” she wrote on Instagram. “The disrespect of these girls to not even reach out to me or anyone connected to the estate baffles me.”



I am not sure who told @kyliejenner and @kendalljenner that they had the right to do this.  The disrespect of these girls to not even reach out to me or anyone connected to the estate baffles me.  I have no idea why they feel they can exploit the deaths of 2pac and my Son Christopher to sell a t-shirt.  This is disrespectful , disgusting, and exploitation at its worst!!!

 The shirts — which feature Kendall and Kylie’s face superimposed on iconic music acts, including Tupac, Metallica, and Led Zeppelin — were sold for $125 each.
However, Voletta wasn’t the only person to bash the sister for their latest business idea. Sharon Osbourne, whose husband Ozzy Osbourne was also featured on the shirts, claimed the girls “haven’t earned the rights” to have their faces plastered alongside music legends.

Girls, you haven’t earned the right to put your face with musical icons. Stick to what you know…lip gloss. pic.twitter.com/BhmuUVrDBn

Fans also took to Twitter to air their grievances. Some were even angered by a print of Kylie wearing her hair in cornrows, calling the idea cultural appropriation.

If I see you wearing a Kendall+Kylie shirt with their faces on top of Biggie and Tupac… just know that I’m legally obligated to punch you.

Kendall and Kylie since issued a mea culpa for the gaffe and removed all the tops from their website. “These designs were not well thought out and we apologize to anyone that has been upset and/or offended, especially to the families of the artists,” Kendall shared in a statement. “We are huge fans of their music and it was not our intention to disservice cultural icons in anyway.”
