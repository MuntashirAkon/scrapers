Justin Bieber has lots of friends in the world of sports. It’s one of his things, like exotic pets or crying on stage. In the past, he’s been spotted hobnobbing with Floyd Mayweather Jr., hockey star Mike Fisher, disgraced quarterback Johnny Manziel and FC Barcelona player Neymar. In fact today (Nov. 21, 2016), the soccer star let his pop star pal join him and his teammates for practice.

Bieber took the field at the Joan Gamper, the club’s historic stadium in Barcelona, and kicked the ball around with the world-class players, even taking some shots on goalie Rafinha, and frankly looking like a natural.

Who knows how these friendships exist or what on Earth they have to talk about, but Bieber and Neymar sure are chummy out on the field!
Here’s a video summarizing the “Sorry” singer’s visit:

So, now he’s boxed with Mayweather and kicked the ball with Neymar. We vote he steps into the Octagon with Ronda Rousey next.
