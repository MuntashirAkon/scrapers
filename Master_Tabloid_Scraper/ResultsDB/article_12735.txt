Last week, Jimmy Fallon was accused of being “too soft” on Republican Presidential nominee Donald Trump during their interview on The Tonight Show.

Fallon further proved his point  that he’s never hard on any of his guests when Democratic Presidential nominee Hillary Clinton stopped by his show last night (Sept. 19, 2016). Clinton updated Fallon on her health and how her campaign is going, but Fallon didn’t let her leave without (literally) lobbing a few softballs her way.

Fallon presented Clinton with Trump’s “gifts” — a bag of softballs, a framed photo of Vladimir Putin, and a Pink Floyd The Wall CD — that he left behind after their interview last week.
“That’s as close as he’s going to get to the wall,” Clinton quipped.
“Oh no, that was my gift to him,” Fallon said. “That’s what I gave him. I’ll give them to you later in the evening.”
Later on in the episode, Fallon was joined by The Voice judge Miley Cyrus, who joined Fallon for the latest installment of his sketch “Ew!” after teaching him yoga.
