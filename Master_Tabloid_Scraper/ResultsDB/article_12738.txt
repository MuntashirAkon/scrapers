While the current season of Keeping Up with the Kardashians tells the story about how much the Kardashian/Jenner’s can’t stand Blac Chyna, in real life, things are totally different. Last night (June. 27, 2016), Chyna joined fiancé Rob Kardashian and the rest of the Kardashian clan to celebrate Khloé Kardashian’s 32nd birthday.

In true Kardashian fashion, Khloé shut down the Dave & Busters in L.A. for a star-studded birthday extravaganza with attendees like Chrissy Teigen, John Legend, Ashlee Simpson, Evan Ross, Miguel, Cassie, Floyd Mayweather and Casper Smart. Rob, who hasn’t been spotted in public much lately, stepped out with his very pregnant fianceé to celebrate his big sister’s birthday, and they made sure to document the fun night on social media.

But Khloé isn’t the only person totally embracing Chyna; Kylie Jenner, Kourtney Kardashian, and even Kris Jenner got in on the fun.

Tyga wasn’t photographed entering or exiting the party, but chances are high that he was there seeing as he and Kylie are definitely back. It’s likely that he and Chyna weren’t excited to see each other.
