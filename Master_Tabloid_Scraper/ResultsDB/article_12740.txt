Maybe it’s better to be a dog person?

Miley Cyrus just survived a vicious attack from her own cat, Harlem, and lived to tell the tale. In several graphic photos shared on her Instagram, the “We Can’t Stop” singer showed off bloody scratches she got from her feline friend — more like frenemy — on Monday (Apr. 4, 2016).
“Fucked up by a pussy cat fuuuuuuuck,” she captioned one picture of large painful scabs on her forehead.
The feisty furball also reportedly mauled Cyrus arm and scalp. Ouch.
Spoiler alert: The injuries are pretty bloody.
