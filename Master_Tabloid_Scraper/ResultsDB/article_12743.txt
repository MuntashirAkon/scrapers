Get out.
Remember MTV Cribs? Remember when JoJo gave us a tour of her “vacation house” that had two bedrooms, one and a half bathrooms and a sun room in eastern Massachusetts? Remember how jealous you were of all that apple juice in her fridge?
Like with all good things from our childhood, this one’s a lie, too.
According to JoJo in a new interview with the Huffington Post, girlfriend didn’t even live there.
“It was so ridiculous. The thing is, we didn’t have a home at that point. My mom and I were living our of suitcases and we were mostly in hotels. So that was actually my uncle’s house, on the Cape.”
Let that sink in for a minute or two. Ready for more truth bombs?
“That wasn’t my house. That wasn’t my stuff. When I was sitting on the spinny thing, that was his kids. That’s the truth.”

Looking back, the now 24-year-old singer says she should’ve “balled hard” and rented a place to show off on the program.
“But no. I just used my uncle’s crib. So that was me lying on Cribs.”
Elsewhere in the interview, JoJo gives her teenage self some advice (“Be nice to your mom”), talks social media (“Myspace was out when I first came out”) and describes her new album (“It’s eclectic”).
Read it all at the Huffington Post.
Her new tour, I Am JoJo, kicks off in November in Minneapolis.
