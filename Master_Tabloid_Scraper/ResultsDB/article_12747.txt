Watch out, people, Benedict Cumberbatch is here to party!The Hollywood actor surprised an arena full of David Gilmour fans tonight when he decided to hop on stage at Royal Albert Hall in London and debut his singing skills by belting Pink Floyd's "Comfortably Numb" with the group's former member.We know, we can't believe we missed this, either! Luckily, concertgoers didn't waste any time before capturing this memorable moment on their phones and sharing it with the less-fortunate (read: everyone who wasn't at the show) on social media.

Seriously, Benedict is showing us so many different sides to him, and we're loving it.When he's not hitting some notes in front of thousands on stage, he's asking the hard-hitting questions to fellow Hollywood stars.In a conversation with fellow British star Tom Hiddleston for the October issue of Interview, the Night Manager actor touched on a number of topics, including one that Cumberbatch couldn't ignore—his ex, Taylor Swift As we said, hard-hitting questions.Except, it wasn't what you probably expect.

"There's another weight of us being in the public eye, which is this presumption that, because your work and your promotion work is very public, your private life should be, too. And, without getting into a huge debate, I just want to say that I'm not going to ask questions about my friend's personal life just because there are unsolicited photographs of him and a certain someone, in a relationship or together," the Sherlock actor said."I'm not going to get into that. So that door is closed, dear reader."Fine, just sing us a song, Benny.
