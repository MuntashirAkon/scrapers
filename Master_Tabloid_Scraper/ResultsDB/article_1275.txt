Diane Guerrero, probably best known as the badass Latina Maritza Ramos on Orange Is the New Black, is about to take on a new project concerning an important issue currently facing the U.S. — immigration.

It will be called In the Country We Love and although the actress will be heading up the show’s cast, her involvement in the project goes far deeper than that. In fact, the concept is based on a book Guerrero co-wrote about being the only child of illegal immigrants in America and how it has painted her perception of this country.

When she was just 14 and living in Boston, her parents were taken from their home and deported back to Colombia. From then on, Guerrero had to rely on the kindness of friends and neighbors in order to survive in the U.S.
“I came home from school one day when I was at the beginning of high school and then they were gone,” she told Chelsea Handler on her Netflix talk show, via Fusion.
According to Deadline, the show will revolve around a corporate lawyer who begins taking on the cases of undocumented immigrants pro bono when a family emergency reveals that her parents were forced to leave the country.
