Hurricane Floyd Storms "Dawson's Creek"/n
Dawson's Creek meet Hurricane Floyd.                        The Wilmington, North Carolina, set of the hit WB teen drama is literally ground zero for furious Floyd's potentially destructive wind, rain and surf. The brunt of the storm is expected to touch down in Wilmington sometime today or tomorrow.                        The James Van Der Beek- and Katie Holmes-led series is one of several Hollywood projects affected by Floyd, now looming over the eastern seaboard.                Production on Dawson's Creek shut down Tuesday, with cast and crew departing the Wilmington area. A network publicist says the players aren't due to return to the set until Monday.                        Of course, that's assuming there's a set to return to.                           Series costar John Wesley Shipp, who plays Dawson Leery's dad, told Daily Variety columnist Army Archer that the crew was in the midst of shooting a high-school football scene on Tuesday when they were ordered to evacuate.                        Shipp said he and the Dawson's denizens have weathered two previous hurricanes (most notably Hurricane Bonnie, in 1998). But Floyd, he says, "is a monster!"                            Official evacuations of beach and low-lying areas in Wilmington were scheduled to begin at 9 a.m. today, according to Libby Johnson, a volunteer with the Human Resources Department of New Hanover County, North Carolina.                              "Pretty much all the businesses will be closed by this afternoon," Johnson said.                           Meanwhile, in Florida, crew members on the WB's new family drama, Safe Harbor, were ordered off their Jacksonville set Tuesday by the National Guard. The workers and their families were evacuated to Tallahassee, Florida, to wait out the storm.                     The stars of Warner Bros.' upcoming teen psychodrama, The In Crowd, have the dubious distinction of weathering two hurricanes this summer. The entire crew was evacuted from the Charleston, South Carolina, set yesterday, care of Floyd.         They also had the pleasure stopping production during August's less-damaging Hurricane Dennis--a storm that didn't exactly inspire them to hole up inside. "We went to the boardwalk, drank wine, and watched the hurricane," said cast member A.J. Buckley. "It was awesome."         Floyd body slammed TBS' nationally televised WCW Thunder event in Florence, South Carolina. The hurricane also washed out a second filming attempt in Norfolk, Virginia.                Floyd chased PBS's Nightly Business Report from its Florida home, too. Tuesday night's edition of the financial new show was broadcast from New York, rather than the waterlogged WPBT-TV studio in Miami.                   Meanwhile, the threat of Floyd also led to cancellations of the Backstreet Boys' shows yesterday and today in Fort Lauderdale, Florida--the first scheduled dates on their sold-out U.S. tour. The concerts have been rescheduled for December 5-6. Weather permitting, Friday's show in Charlotte, North Carolina, is still a go.                 And even Mickey Mouse couldn't escape the wrath of the vicious storm.                       Walt Disney World was among a handful of Florida theme parks, including Sea World Orlando and Universal Escape Florida, that closed their doors today and Tuesday.                      The Disney World closure is the first in the park's 28-year history. Officials say the tourist attractions should by reopen Thursday.
