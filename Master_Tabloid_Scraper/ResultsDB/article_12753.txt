Pink Floyd Wrote "Oz" Soundtrack/n
Of all the Judy Garland birthday tributes on tap--the legendary entertainer would have turned 75 Tuesday--this one has to be the, well, weirdest. That is, if it really is a tribute.            First things first: Garland, who died in 1969, is the focus this week of a three-day celebration in her Grand Rapids, Minnesota, hometown. Those on hand:  Two Garland kids (Lorna and Joey Luft),  three genuine Munchkins from the entertainer's 1939 signature classic, The Wizard of Oz, plus Roger Baum, the great-grandson of Oz author L. Frank Baum. (Sorry, no Liza.)               Weird things next: Garland's birthday comes amid much buzz that Pink Floyd's own signature classic, 1973's Dark Side of the Moon is an alternative heavy-rock soundtrack to Judy's trip to Oz--an urban myth that, in the last week, has tripled sales of the 24-year-old recording.            Say what?            It all started when a classic-rock radio deejay in Boston announced this spring that the album--both lyrically and musically--matches up eerily with the action depicted in the movie.             According to a Website established by a drummer in Lowell, Massachusetts, if you start playing the album right after Leo, MGM's logo lion, roars for the third time, you'll experience some startling bits of sound and picture synchronicity. Among them:            Dorothy (Garland) balances herself on Auntie Em's fence while our sly rockers sing of being "balanced on the biggest wave."            Side one of the album (on vinyl, that is) ends as Oz segues from black-and-white to color.            The song, "Brain Damage, " plays during Scarecrow's "If I Only Had a Brain" routine.                  For the record, Pink Floyd keyboardist Richard Wright told the Boston radio station where this story started that there's just no "there" there--no master plot.  (The Website devoted to the Pink Floyd/Oz connection acknowledges this possibility. "[But] this does not discount the magic of experiencing these two performances combined," it states.)            Capitol Records, which has always lived large off Dark Side, (the album charted on the Billboard Top 200 for 741 consecutive weeks)  isn't discounting the magic, either.  It's cranking out the CDs round the clock to keep up with demand.              Capitol, through a spokeswoman, is said to be "unaware" whether Pink Floyd intentionally set out to record a Wizard of Oz companion.            There are some other Judy Garland tributes we can assure you are real. Tomorrow, cable's Turner Classic Movies airs a Garland movie marathon, including her first flick with Mickey Rooney, 1937's Thoroughbreds Don't Cry. And A&E; rebroadcasts its Garland biography, Beyond the Rainbow, in two parts, tonight and tomorrow.
