Mayweather's Son: 'No Chance' Floyd Rematches Conor McGregor, 'Officially Done'/nSorry, fight fans -- Floyd Mayweather is  "officially done " ... meaning there's not gonna be a rematch with Conor McGregor -- so says his kid. We spoke to Koraun after the fight ... and he confirmed that Floyd's hangin' up his gloves.  "No chance. No chance. No rematch, " Koraun told TMZ Sports, when we asked if he might come back for another HUGE payday.  "Officially done. He's 40, gotta realize that. He's an old man. " Floyd's son says his dad's got a business to take care of too ... so he's happy retiring at 50-0. FYI, Mayweather said the McGregor fight was his last one  "for sure. "/n
