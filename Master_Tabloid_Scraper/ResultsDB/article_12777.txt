Floyd Mayweather Sr. Rips Justin Bieber, 'He Don't Know Boxing!' /nFloyd Mayweather Sr. is coming out swingin' at Justin Bieber -- saying the pop star doesn't know a DAMN THING about boxing if he thinks Conor's gonna go the distance. Remember, Bieber -- Floyd Jr.'s longtime friend -- recently shot down the idea that Mayweather would K.O. McGregor ... and that ain't sittin' too well with Floyd Sr.  "Justin Bieber ... he don't even know boxing, " Floyd's dad told us at LAX ...  "He knows Floyd. But he don't know Floyd like I know Floyd. "  Floyd Sr. also went in on Vegas gamblers putting their money on Conor -- saying they're crazy ... and a bet on Floyd is like taking free money! Papa Mayweather also says he thinks his kid should STOP FIGHTING after Aug. 26 -- because if he keeps taking on challengers, someone is eventually gonna knock his ass out!Â /n
