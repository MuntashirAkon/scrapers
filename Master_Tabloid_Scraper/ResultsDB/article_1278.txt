Fool Jennie once, shame on you.

Jennifer Lopez is rounding up all of the girls to fight the good fight in a new music video for her latest single, “Ain’t Your Mama”. As a defeated and drenched news reporter, she addresses the general female public with a rousing call to action prefaced by Hillary Clinton’s speech at the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women.
“Look, I don’t have to tell you things are bad. Everybody knows things are bad. Taken for granted, ignored, overlooked, under appreciated. We have a big, big problem ladies. First, you’ve got to get mad!”
