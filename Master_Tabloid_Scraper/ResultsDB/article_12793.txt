In one scene, the beauty queen-turned-governor and daughter Bristol –currently a finalist on Dancing With The Stars – went out for a little early morning fishing expedition. 
After the fish were caught, both Palins rolled up their sleeves for some fisherman’s grunt work – from bludgeoning the fish, to gutting them to getting rid of the slime – after which, then entire clan enjoyed the tasty treats.
