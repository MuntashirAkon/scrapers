VIDEO: Anne Heche's Home Burglarized; Says Son Homer Worried About One Thing  /n
In another example of “Kids say the darnedest things,” actress Anne Heche told David Letterman Thursday about her 8-year-old’s son’s reaction when she, beau James Tupper and son Homer returned to their Los Angeles house last week, only to find out it had been broken into and  burglarized. 
Watch the clip on RadarOnline.com “Our summer was so boring, except last week, our house was robbed,” the 41-year-old Hung star said, adding that the  burglars  got away with computers, iPods, jewels and other valuables.

Heche told the late night icon she wasn’t thinking about moving because of the incident. 
“Absolutely not — we’ll just buy more stuff and put it in there,” she said. 
She said son Homer was OK about everything — until he found out the family’s Wii (video game console) was among the casualties of the break-in.

“What? The Wii?” Heche said, imitating her little boy. “Oh my God, was there a game in it?!?”
