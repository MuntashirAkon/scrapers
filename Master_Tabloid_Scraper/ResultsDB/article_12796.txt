The locks come in a glass jar straight from the collection of Presley’s personal barber, Homer Gilleland, who routinely kept the strands he cut from Presley’s head to give to pals as gifts.
“Gilleland was given a credit card so he could travel to anywhere in the world where Elvis needed a color touchup or a trim,” Norwine said. “Throughout the years, he saved a quantity of the hair that he cut from the head of the King.
“One large quantity of that hair was gifted to one of his best friends, Thomas Morgan, Jr., who was responsible for commissioning Elvis as a Special Deputy and who, following Presley’s death – and at the request of Elvis’s father – would coordinate the Sheriff’s Department’s duties for security at the funeral and at Graceland,” Norwine said.
