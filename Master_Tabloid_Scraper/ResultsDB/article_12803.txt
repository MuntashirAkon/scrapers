The Simpsons is not going anywhere, folks. FOX just announced it picked up the longest-running animated series in history for another two seasons.
The series also broke another record as it will have the most episodes for a scripted TV show ever. Gunsmoke previously held the record for most scripted TV episodes with 635. The Simpsons will have 669.
“Take that Gunsmoke! You lost a race you didn’t even know you were running!,” Homer Simpson himself said in a statement from FOX (via E! News).
“This is yet another record-setting moment for what is truly a landmark series,” Dana Walden and Gary Newman, chairmen and CEOs of FOX Television Group, said in a joint statement.
