Bob Dylan was awarded the 2016 Nobel Prize for Literature, which makes him the first songwriter to receive the honor.

The prize was presented to Dylan “for having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition” with hits including “The Times The are A-Changin’. Dylan, at age 75, is the first American to win the Nobel Prize for Literature since Toni Morrison in 1993.
“If you look back, far back, 2,500 years or so, you discover Homer and Sappho and they wrote poetic texts that were meant to be listened to, that were meant to be performed, often with instruments — and it’s the same way with Bob Dylan,” said Nobel’s permanent secretary Sara Danius of his work.
