Alex Rodriguez of the New York Yankees will retire from baseball at the end of the week following his final game on Friday (Aug. 12, 2016).

Rodriguez announced his decision during a press conference on Sunday (Aug. 7, 2016) at Yankee Stadium. After Friday, he will be released from his player contract to become a special advisor and instructor with the Yankees through Dec. 31, 2017.
CNN reports:
“This is a tough day. I love this game and I love this team,” an emotional Rodriguez said at a press conference at Yankee Stadium, where he was not in Sunday’s starting lineup. “Today, I’m saying goodbye to both. I never thought I could play for 22 years.”
The three-time MVP nears retirement with 3,114 hits and 696 home runs, good enough for fourth on the all-time homer list behind Barry Bonds (762), Hank Aaron (755) and Babe Ruth (714). He was voted to the All-Star Game 14 times and signed a $275 million contract with the Yankees in 2007 — then the richest deal in baseball history.
