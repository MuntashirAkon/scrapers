 Yep, the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge has made its way to FOX’s first family.
On Tuesday, Homer Simpson took his shirt off and took the plunge — with a tiny cup of ice water.

He went on to nominate Ned Flanders and Donald Trump.

The Simpsons of course are everywhere these days. FX has been playing every single episode of the show from the very beginning since Aug. 21. (And if anyone cares, the 12-day marathon has already played my favorite episode, “Summer of 4 Ft. 2”).
Watch Homer complete the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, above.
