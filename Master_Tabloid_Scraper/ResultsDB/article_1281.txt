Yes, the 33-year-old Princess of Pop is making a television comeback with a guest starring role on the CW’s Jane the Virgin.
Spears is set to play a foil to Rogelio De La Vega, Jane’s father and a telenovela superstar (played by Jaime Camil).
“We are so thrilled that Rogelio’s ‘nemesis’ — Britney Spears — has agreed to appear on Jane the Virgin in episode 205,” show runner Jennie Snyder Urman explained. “Personally, after hearing about their long standing feud (from Rogelio’s point of view), we are eager to hear Ms. Spears’ side of the story, which we assume is quite different. #TeamBritney.”
LOL! Of course BritBrit also couldn’t help but gush about the opportunity:

See u at the Marbella Hotel soon, @hereisgina @jaimecamil! 🙈 Guest starring on one of my favorite shows EVER @CWJaneTheVirgin #DreamComeTrue

Jane the Virgin returns to television on Oct. 12.
