Nicholas Hoult is finally opening up about his very private relationship with Jennifer Lawrence.
The couple, who met filming X-Men: First Class, started dating in 2011, before calling it quits January 2013 and rekindling their romance seven months later. Speaking with V Man magazine, the former Skins star said despite the Oscar winner’s massive success, fame hasn’t changed their dynamic one bit.
“The privacy thing obviously changes but the rest pretty much stays the same,” Hoult said. “It’s like that thing whereby you don’t believe your own hype. Enjoy the good times, but don’t get swept away with it.”


Adding that Lawrence, 23, knows how to remain down-to-earth, the British actor explained”I think that’s something she’s capable of doing, and that’s what makes her special, but yeah, it is very odd, and I am just kind of a bystander in many ways. It is well-deserved for her. I haven’t really seen any change in her.”
“It’s fun because in this business you are away from one another for long periods of time, so when you’re on set together it’s a brilliant thing, because you actually get to spend time together,” he said in regards to working with his girlfriend on the new X-Men sequel. “Especially with this film, I got to spend time with her … It doesn’t really affect the acting though.”
Previously Lawrence told Elle magazine that Hoult, 24, is her “best friend.”
“He’s my favorite person to be around and he makes me laugh harder than anybody,” she said in the December 2012 issue. “We can eat Cheetos and watch beach volleyball and we turn into two perverted Homer Simpsons, like, ‘Oh, she’s got a nice ass.’ I never thought we’d have such different opinions on asses.”
