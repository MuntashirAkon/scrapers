 It’s been on TV since 1990, so of course The Simpsons has had tons of celebrity guest stars over the years. But who are the most celebrated pop culture icons to ever appear on the irreverent animated sitcom? Britney Spears, Lucy Lawless and Playboy founder Hugh Hefner are just a few of the names on the list.

Twentieth Century Fox is releasing an array of products including figures, collectibles, apparel and novelty items featuring the animated likenesses of the sitcom’s most popular guest stars. The list includes Oscar winner Tom Hanks, ‘The Godfather of Soul’ James Brown, Star Wars actor Mark Hamill and more. The limited-edition figurines and other merchandise is being released in waves at retailers and online.


Fox also just recently announced that The Simpsons will be getting a Lego-makeover in May. The entire episode, entitled “Brick Like Me,” will be created from the plastic building blocks. Homer gets trapped in Lego version of his hometown Springfield and he’ll have to figure out a way out, or be trapped in a plastic world forever. The episode airs on Fox May 4th.
