Guillermo del Toro Re-Imagines ‘The Simpsons’ Opening Credits for Halloween/n
It isn’t the first time The Simpsons has handed its now-iconic opening credits to someone else for re-interpretation (most notably Banksy’s), but this is certainly the most elaborate. For “Treehouse of Horror XXIV” (yeah, you’re old) Guillermo del Toro turned the couch gag into a nearly three minute celebration of all things horror. Seriously, there are a million references a minute in this thing.
Not only does del Toro reference his own movies, he also references classics like The Birds, The Shining and Phantom of the Opera. H.P Lovecraft, Stephen King, Alfred Hitchcock and Edgar Allen Poe also make cameos.
Of creating the title sequence, del Toro said:
The Simpsons titles are so iconic and yet they’ve never been riffed in this vein. I really wanted to land the connections between the [show’s] set pieces and the titles and some of the most iconic horror movies, and intersperse them with some of my stuff in there for pure joy. For example the idea that Ms. Krabappel could be outside the school with Alfred Hitchcock which is a reference to the sequence in The Birds that happens outside of the school in Bodega Bay. To use Chief Wiggum as the Cyclops from Harryhausen, dipping the [Lard Lad] donut in a water tank, to have the nuclear spill from Mr. Burns’ plant create zombies — all of this stuff seems to make sense to interconnect. If Homer really gets a radioactive isotope, he could turn into a reaper from Blade. Or the famous shot that is always in the titles — Maggie driving and then you pull back and there’s Marge driving, right? But in this case Maggie is driving, and she’s driving the car from the horror movie from the 70s called The Car, which is one of my favorite guilty pleasure B-movies. And what if Lisa is in the music class, but she’s in the music class with every Phantom of the Opera ever made? It was a unique opportunity.
“Treehouse of Horror XXIV” airs this Sunday.
