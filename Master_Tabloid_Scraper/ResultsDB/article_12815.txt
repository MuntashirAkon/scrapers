Don't Panic: Marge and Homer Simpson's Separation Will Be Temporary, Showrunner Says/n
Love is not dead after all.  
When Simpsons executive producer Al Jean told Variety that Marge and Homer Simpson would legally separate in the 27th season premiere and that Homer would fall in love with his pharmacist – voiced by Lena Dunham – the fandom basically had a meltdown.   
Bart was not too pleased by the news, either – the Simpsons‘ official Twitter posted a photo after the news went wide of Bart writing “Homer and Marge are not breaking up” on the chalkboard from the show’s credits.

Was it denial? Or did he know something we didn’t?   
As it turns out, Bart, Lisa and Maggie have nothing to worry about – the separation will be temporary.  
“My advice to everybody is that we never carry anything longer than an episode or two,” Jean told the New York Post. “For some reason, people thought this was going to last forever.”   
Jean added that “by episode 3, everything’s the same.   I never said the word ‘divorced.’ That implies finality. I was surprised that people would interpret it as a final move.”   
The EP is grateful for the reaction, however, which he calls “a real testament” to the show’s popularity and influence 27 years after its debut.
