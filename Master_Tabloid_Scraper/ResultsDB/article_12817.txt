Simpsons Fan Performs Side-by-Side Synchronized Snacking with Homer/n

Don’t be fooled: Eating like Homer Simpson takes precision, timing and a lot of practice.  
Or at least, it did to make this nine-second clip from the classic Simpsons episode “Lisa the Greek,” which opens with Homer practicing a game day ritual involving his favorite snacks.  
Gizmodo conjectures that the clip’s creator, Cinema Raven, did it with a sped-up camera, but even then you have to appreciate that someone took the time to mimic Homer’s arm positions perfectly. 
The sailboat painting and gaudy purple end table are just icing on the cake – and for the record, Homer would probably eat that cake, too.
