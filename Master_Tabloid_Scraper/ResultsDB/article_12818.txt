Adopt Me! Homer Wants to Make Himself at Home with You  /n
It’s Adopt-a-Shelter-Cat month, and in honor of the wonderful rescue cats out there, we’re introducing you to felines-in-waiting all throughout June. Today, we’d like you to meet Homer, a talkative 8-year-old tabby currently being cared for by the Home at Last Rescue of Berkeley, California.   
These are the eyes of a curious cat. Though he may be a bit shy at first, when he’s given the chance to relax, Homer is easygoing and affectionate.   
When he wants attention, Homer is happy to let you know. “He will purr to no end with a little encouragement,” reads his Adopt a Pet bio. “He loves to have his head, ears and belly rubbed and will quickly melt into a belly flop to have his soft underside pet.”


Looking for a cat with manners? Look no further. “He doesn’t jump up on tables so he would be an ideal cat for someone who does not like cats on tables, countertops, desks, or kitchen surfaces,” reads his bio. “Homer is a total gentleman.”  

Though he’s been around other cats, Homer would prefer to be the only feline in a household – because that means no competition for your lap! If you think Homer is the cat for you, contact the rescue at 510-981-0890. To read more about him, click here.
