What Should Marge Simpson Wear on Date Night With Homer? The Project Runway All Stars Have Some Ideas /n
[brightcoveplayer 2898035522001]
Is Marge Simpson having a midlife crisis? After 20+ years in her famous green dress, she’s looking for a new outfit to wear on a special dinner date with Homer, and she’s tasking the Project Runway All Stars to design it for her.
The guidelines? According to Marge, she wants something sexy and special and that will be easy for Homer to slip off after a few beers (TMI, Marge!). And of course: No green!

We got an exclusive sneak peek at the designers’ creations  — including a Kardashian-esque bodycon number and an orchid gown (it’s the Pantone color of 2014!) — modeled by Marge in the clip above.

The most exciting part? The winning look will be shown in a future episode of The Simpsons. It will be the first new outfit we’ve seen on Marge that we can remember. And since this week’s guest judges are Season 2 winner Anthony Ryan, along with Abigail Breslin and Alice + Olivia designer Stacy Bendet, we have a feeling it’s going to be a pretty funny show.
Below, check out a special “Simpsonized” photo of the show’s host Alyssa Milano and mentor Zanna Roberts Rassi (both on right), and judges Isaac Mizrahi and Georgina Chapman, and tell us in the comments: Which dress do you like? Do you spot any frontrunners?
