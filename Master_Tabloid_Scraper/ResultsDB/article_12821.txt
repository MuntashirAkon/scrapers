Couples Watch: Rihanna Goes Wild for Her Homerun Beau/n
• Rihanna had her hands in the air – and plenty of friends with her – to cheer on boyfriend Matt Kemp during the L.A. Dodgers’ opening day at Dodger Stadium. The singer, sporting a team hoodie, arrived in a party bus an hour before game time, then took her VIP seat in the Dugout Club before Kemp received the Silver Slugger and Gold Glove awards. And when Kemp hit a homerun – woot! – Rihanna was dancing like his biggest fan.  
• Joe Jonas and girlfriend Demi Lovato made “such a cute couple” while hanging at the Beachcomber at the Malibu Pier, a spy tells us. The two were there as Nick Jonas worked on reshoots for his new music video at nearby Surfrider Beach, and the threesome took a timeout to grab a bite. The boys indulged in burgers while Lovato ordered a Mahi Mahi sandwich.   
• Vince Vaughn and wife Kyla Weber enjoyed a couples’ getaway at Las Vegas’s Hard Rock Hotel & Casino. Joined by some friends, the duo dined at Nobu after Vaughn clocked some solo time at the blackjack tables. The next day, the two hung out in a private cabana with their friends, sipping cocktails and relaxing before finishing the evening with a meal in the private dining room at Rare 120.  
• How sweet – literally! Angie Harmon took her daughters to Crumbs Bake Shop in Calabasas, Calif., to pick out cupcakes for dad Jason Sehorn‘s birthday. Harmon was a patient mom, letting her girls pick out their own flavors to bring home as a surprise.
