The Simpsons did the unthinkable: it went live. Yes, a cartoon went live. At the end of the Sunday, May 15 episode, Homer Simpson (Dan Castellaneta) answered live fan questions for three minutes."It only took us 27 years to do what they could do in 1954," Lisa Simpson (Yeardley Smith) said in the introduction."This is the last episode of The Simpsons," Homer said. "Just kidding, The Simpsons will never end."The episode featured Homer gaining back his public speaking confidence by taking an improv comedy class.

Questions during the live segment ranged from what kind of car does he drive to does he like Chicago deep-dish style pizza or New York thin crust. The answer to those questions: a hybrid of old and terrible and Chicago deep-dish. While the calls came in, characters came in and out, including Bender from Futurama with a sign that read "Bring back Futurama again."Homer ended the segment saying the cast of Empire will answer the unanswered questions. Fox is doing the stunt again for West Coast broadcast.The Simpsons airs Sundays, 8 p.m. on Fox.
