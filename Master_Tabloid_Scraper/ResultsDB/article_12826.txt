Homer Chase Bumping Homer Simpson?/n
There are old-school sportswriters who can tell you how much pressure--from media and fans--late New York Yankee Roger Maris was under when he set the record for most home runs in a season with 61 in '61. Heck, the guy's hair fell out in clumps.        But Maris didn't have the entire Fox Television Network ready to preempt its prime-time lineup to watch him break the mark. That's what St. Louis Cardinals slugger Mark McGwire has to deal with now, as he approaches the venerable record he's almost certain to break after hitting his 58th and 59th home runs Wednesday.        And when McGwire hits numbers 61 and 62, Fox wants to be there. And not the company's cable divisions, Fox Sport Net or FX--Fox, the broadcast network Fox. Network suits are reportedly talking to Major League Baseball about airing games Friday night and Sunday afternoon between the Cardinals and Cincinnati Reds.        But if "Big Mac" doesn't belt his historic 62nd out by then, prime-time Fox will suffer.        With McGwire perhaps a game or two away from the record--and Chicago Cubs slugger Sammy Sosa also closing in with 56 homers--Fox execs confirmed that they'll likely move next Tuesday night's Cardinals-vs.-Cubs matchup from the little-seen FX to the big broadcast net.        That move will bump the heavily hyped season premiere of King of the Hill, which is the conclusion of last May's cliffhanger episode. (In support of our nation's pastime, Hank Hill probably wouldn't want it any other way.)        Of course, Fox could be sacrificing its prime-time schedule for naught--ESPN has the rights to Monday night's Cardinals-vs.-Cubs game, in addition to any Wednesday-night contest. That means McGwire could go deep on a rival network.        What's at stake? Well, for one thing, Fox could command low-six-figure prices from advertisers for prime-time games. Next is ratings--when Hank Aaron broke Babe Ruth's lifetime home-run mark in 1974, NBC captured a full 22 percent of the tube audience. There's also the prestige factor--the net that broadcasts the history-making homer will be immortalized on videotape along with McGwire.         If McGwire starts slumping, though, things could really get crazy. Fox's coverage of a weekend series between the Cardinals and Houston Astros would knock out the debut of two sitcoms on Friday, September 11.         And, in the unlikely event the thing goes through Sunday, September 13, not only would Fox's The Simpsons, et al., get preempted, McGwire's game would run directly opposite the Emmy Awards on NBC (which is also facing stiff competition that night from CBS' airing of Goodfellas).
