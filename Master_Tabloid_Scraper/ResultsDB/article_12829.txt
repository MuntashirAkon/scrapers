It's National Donut Day, but for Homer Simpson it's just another day that ends in "Y." The Simpsons patriarch has a long, storied history with round, sweet treats. In fact, donuts (and Duff beer) are pretty much synonymous with the cartoon character. Homer's been in donut hell after he sold his soul for a glazed delight. He's injected donuts like heroin. He even bonded with Family Guy's Peter Griffin over them (before they started fighting each other) during their epic crossover. Donuts are even part of one of the character's catchphrases. "Mmm…donuts." Duh.Besides getting your free donuts from Krispy Kreme and Dunkin Donuts (mmm…donuts), let Homer Simpson help you celebrate National Donut Day!
