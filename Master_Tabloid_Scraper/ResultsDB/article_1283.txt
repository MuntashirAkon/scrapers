Jennie Garth is getting ready to say “I Do” for a second time.
The former Beverly Hills, 90210 star is engaged to her beau Dave Abrams, the couple’s reps confirm to PEOPLE.
Abrams, an actor, popped the big question just after Garth’s 43rd birthday.
“Dave had been working on this for months, and really wanted to plan something special for her around her birthday and make it perfect,” according to a PEOPLE source.

The proposal comes just weeks after Garth’s ex, Peter Facinelli, confirmed his engagement to girlfriend Jaimie Alexander. Garth and Facinelli, who finalized their divorce in 2013 after more than 10 years of marriage, have three daughters: Luca,17, Lola, 12, and Fiona, 8.
Garth and Abrams, whose resume includes 2 Broke Girls, That ‘70s Show, and the short film The Hike, were first romantically linked last fall.
