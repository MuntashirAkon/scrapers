"The Simpsons": Big-Screen Homer/n
After 10 years as television's reigning dysfunctional family, and after years of rumors about a possible movie spinoff, you'd think fans of The Simpsons had all but given up on the idea of a big-screen Homer.        But just a few utterances from creator Matt Groening were all it took to spark a new round of frenzied anticipation from loyal devotees of Springfield's twisted yellow citizenry. The cartoon mastermind acknowledged this week at a press conference in London that, yes--praise be to Apu--a Simpsons movie will be made.          "It's a little daunting coming up with a half-hour TV episode, let alone a full-length feature," Groening said, according to London's Daily Express. "No deals have been struck, but we will do one."        Fans responded accordingly: Wooo-hooo!        "You wait for this moment your whole life, and then, when it finally comes, you don't know what to say," writes one loyal fan on alt.tv.simpsons--a message that, given the show's obsessed viewership, probably is a lot less sarcastic than one might figure.         But after years of Internet rumor-mongering, it seemed most viewers resigned themselves to the idea that The Simpsons' big-screen opportunity had come and gone. The closest the Simpsons have come to the big screen is a computer-generated Homer cameo for IMAX's upcoming megascreen compilation, CyberWorld.        But a movie seems only fitting, seeing that Homer, Marge, Bart and Lisa have already conquered most other media. On TV, the show surpassed The Flintstones as the longest-running animated series in prime-time, and this year, Fox has celebrated the show's 10th anniversary with special promotions, a new Website, and most recently, the Simpsons Mania Tour 2000.        The show's cast sold out three live script-reading performances in Britain, where (despite the edgy, American-oriented jokes) the show remains a huge hit. Castmembers like Harry Shearer (the voice of slouching fat cat Mr. Burns and his obsessed sidekick Smithers) and Hank Azaria (who plays everyone from Chief Wiggum to Moe the Bartender) joined Simpson family members like Dan Castellaneta (Homer) and Nancy Cartwright (Bart) onstage for a behind-the-toons look at the series.           When asked about the future of The Simpsons, Groening replied: "That is a bit like asking a marathon runner if he is tired. There is a shared vision and little disagreement about the direction of the show."        As Mr. Burns might say, "Excellent."
