Homer Chasing Pays for Fox/n
Fox got a homer Tuesday, but there was no "D'oh!" about it.           The decision by networks execs to yank the heavily hyped season debuts of King of the Hill and Costello and show Mark McGwire break the single-season home run record paid off big time. The broadcast scored the highest ratings for a regular season baseball game in 16 years.          Forget the distance the historic homer traveled. Forget McGwire's stats against Chicago Cubs' pitchers. For Fox--which moved the game from its FX cable net when it became apparent the St. Louis Cardinals slugger could hit No. 62 Tuesday--the real magic numbers were its 12.9 rating and 21 share of the audience.           And the ratings would have been even higher if Fox had the exclusive rights to the game. WGN, the cable home of the Chicago Cubs, also carried the contest.          Big Mac also delivered for ESPN. The sports net's telecast of the game Monday night in which McGwire tied Roger Maris 1961 mark scored a cable-incredible 9.5 rating (equal to about 7.1 million homes). That was ESPN's most-watched baseball game ever, eclipsing the game in 1995 in which "ironman" Cal Ripkin Jr. broke Lou Gehrig's record for most consecutive games played.
