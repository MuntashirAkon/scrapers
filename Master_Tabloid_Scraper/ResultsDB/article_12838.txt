Kris Jenner Pitching Animated Series on Kardashian Family /nKris Jenner is pitching an animated television series featuring cartoonie Kim, Khloe, Kylie and the rest of the fam. We've learned Kris had a meeting with Harvey Weinstein's company in L.A. earlier this month to pitch the show.   We're told  "the entire family " will be featured ... we're told it will not include Caitlyn. Our sources say this is a primetime pitch ... and not for kids.  /n
