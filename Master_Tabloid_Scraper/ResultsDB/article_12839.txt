'Simpsons' Executive Producer -- Homer's Coma Theory is Cool ... But TOTALLY FALSE!/nHomer Simpson has NOT been stuck in a coma since the '90s ... despite a fan theory that has thrown  "The Simpsons " fans for a loop -- so says the show's executive producer. The idea -- first posted on Reddit -- theorizes Homer's been in a coma since a 1993 episode where he was hospitalized. The fan theory is that he never woke up, and everything that's happened ever since was a dream ... but Al Jean tells us NOT TRUE. Al explains,  "It would mean back in 1993 we would presume the show was going on for years and years more and right before we left, threw this hidden monkey wrench in for all our successors, " adding,  "I’m afraid it goes with the 'Dead Bart' episode in the intriguing but false file.” Doh./n
