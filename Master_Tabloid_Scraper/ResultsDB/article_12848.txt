Anne Heche's Last Nightstand/nUPDATE: Two connected sources tell TMZ the reason Anne took the bed was because she bought it before she got married. It's hers! We're also told that crazy Coley asked Anne to either rent a king size bed for him or move the queen size bed into the master bedroom. But get this -- Coley wants to hire a mover and make Anne foot the bill! Anne Heche wants her bedroom set, dammit! The wacky  "Men in Trees " star stepped up her divorce battle with cameraman hubby /alleged chubby-beater Coley Laffoon yesterday -- and TMZ was in the courtroom! A judge told kooky Annie's attorney that the  "unconsented removal of property " (including their former love bed and matching nightstands) was not allowed! Bring that s**t back! Is it that hard to find new furniture in Vancouver? The split couple's swanky Hancock Park manse is currently listed for the bargain price of $3.795 million -- Coley is living there with son Homer. Lawyers informed the judge that there have been showings of the house that Anne's paying the mortgage on, but no offers. No word on who gets the porn collection./n
