Houston Astros -- EVERYONE'S AFTER OUR HOES ... Jerseys/nHoes up ... at least he was -- and ever since he smacked a homer off C.C. Sabathia last night, Houston Astros fans have been going crazy trying to get their hands his jersey ... TMZ Sports has learned. The guy we're talkin' about is L.J. Hoes -- a 2nd-year slugger who went deep against the Yankees on Tuesday -- igniting a Twitter frenzy due, in part, to his last name. Here's a few examples:  "L-J-Hoes! LJ Hoes! In Houston's area code (area), area codes "  "Was going to draft him in fantasy - but I don't trust Hoes "You get the joke. Anyway, we spoke with someone at the Astros team shop who tells us Hoes items have been a hot seller for a while, but demand spiked after he hit the home run last night. If he continues to produce at the plate, who knows ... you might see even more people spending their money on Hoes ... #CouldntHelpOurselves. /n
