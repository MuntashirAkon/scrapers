'Men In Black' Actress Linda Fiorentino -- Someone Bought the Farm ... And I Couldn't Be Happier!!!/n "Men in Black " actress Linda Fiorentino knocked it out of the park as Laurel Weaver in the hit movie ... she's about to hit another homer with her farmhouse. Our real estate sources say Fiorentino -- who also played Jesus Christ's last living relative in  "Dogma " -- is looking to turn her 2-bed, 3-bath 1679 sq. ft. Westport CT colonialÂ into over half a million in profit. We're told Fiorentino bought it in 1997 for $578k -- the same year as MIB. It was worth the price just for the beach house and 1 /2 garden. She just sold it for $1.1 mil. If you snag this crib, you could be MIB on the reg too ... Makin' It to the Beach. (sorry, we couldn't resist)/n
