Chris Pratt and Anna Faris may have been the picture perfect couple, but they broke up because they couldn’t be the family they wanted.

Insiders close to the situation say the duo, who married in 2009, split up due to a difference of opinion about kids. Though Chris is happy with just their 4-year-old son, Jack, Anna wants to have more children and introduce them to a more traditional family setting.
Via TMZ:
Chris, on the other hand, has had some life-changing experiences that has required him to adjust the balance between family and career. When he married Anna back in 2009, she was much bigger than him. He’s now at the top of the Hollywood food chain, and with that comes opportunities that take him all over the world, shooting movies that take him away from home for months at a time.
Our sources say he doesn’t want more kids … at least not in the foreseeable future, because he can’t juggle a growing family with his career. And he can’t be corralled in one place — even L.A. — because that’s not the way the movie industry works.
