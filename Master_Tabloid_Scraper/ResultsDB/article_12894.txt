Brad Pitt surprised fans when he made a special appearance during Frank Ocean’s set at Los Angeles’ FYF Fest this weekend, acting out a scene onstage as the “Sweet Life” singer serenaded the crowd.

The once-in-a-lifetime collaboration featured the War Machine actor holding a cell phone to his ear while Ocean covered  Stevie Wonder’s version of “Close to You” by The Carpenters. The duo kept up the act as the crooner transitioned into the Jackson 5’s “Never Can Say Goodbye.”
Via Revolt TV:
This was not an unforgettable show just for the set’s incredible video production, artfully and cinematically shot in part by video legend Spike Jonze, hopefully for some later release, incorporating ultra-crisp and dramatic shots of Frank’s luminescent rap-sung splendor, which were juxtaposed with highly intentional shots of someone sitting near stage on a computer surfing random apps and Hello Kitty videos and clips of people dabbing, like we all do all the time, even while in the midst of life-defining moments.
