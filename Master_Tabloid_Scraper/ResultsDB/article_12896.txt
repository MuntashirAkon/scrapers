Sorry, ladies! Brooklyn Beckham is off the market.

The 18-year-old son of David and Victoria Beckham is dating YouTube star Madison Beer, according to People.
Though the couple trying to keep heir relationship on the down-low, they were seen at seen attending a concert together in Santa Clara, Calif., before hanging out in Los Angeles this past weekend. A source told Page Six, who first reported on the news, the pair are “careful not to run into [Justin] Bieber, fearing it would be awkward.”

Madison, 18, was first discovered by the Canadian singer in 2012 while singing a cover of the Etta James’ “At Last” on YouTube. She went on to sign with Island Records, saying her mentor is “like big brother” and she’ll never date him.
The songstress was previously linked to musician Jack Gilinsky, who was accused of verbal abuse earlier this month when a recording of a heated argument surfaced online. “The abuse is real, and I let it happen,” she tweeted after the clip leaked. “I do not need verification or anyone to believe me. I know what I have been through and will continue to be strong.”
Brooklyn dated actress Chloë Grace Moretz for less than six months in 2016.
