Jack Antonoff — Bleachers frontman, frequent Taylor Swift collaborator, and Lena Dunham’s boyfriend — was caught eating a mid-show snack in the form of a banana during host Katy Perry’s opening at the VMAs on Sunday night.
And, well, he couldn’t look more bored. Naturally, the possible shade didn’t go unnoticed by the Twitterverse. Dunham herself joined the conversation, tweeting, “My boyfriend just casually eating a banana at the VMAs is a good reminder of why we’ve been at it half a decade.” She then Instagrammed a photo of Antonoff eating a sandwich on FaceTime, writing, “Boo at VMAs with a sandwich like the prince he is.”

Check out PEOPLE’s full 2017 MTV VMAs coverage.
It’s worth nothing that Antonoff co-wrote and produced Swift’s new, record-breaking hit “Look What You Made Me Do,” which is speculated to be partially about Perry and the years-long feud between the pop stars.
In case you missed it, the “LWYMMD” video also dropped tonight at the show and there was plenty of Perry-centric imagery. Antonoff also co-wrote Swift hits like 1989‘s “Out of the Woods” and “I Don’t Want to Live Forever” for the Fifty Shades Darker soundtrack.
Whether or not Antonoff intended shade, everyone needs a mid-show snack. These shows are long!
