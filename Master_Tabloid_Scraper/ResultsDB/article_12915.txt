Morgan was nonchalant about dating the famous playboy, saying, "Who hasn't? Don't forget how old I am and don't forget those days before cell phonesâ€”those old answering machines.""Did you have more than one night with him?" the host asked. The reality star smiled and replied, "Would you stop going into the lovers, the hookups? Nobody nails down Nicholson!" Morgan described their romance as "one big sloppy mess" that occurred "whenever we could."The game continued, and Morgan passed on the Dalai Lama, David Letterman, Vladimir Putin, Bill Gates and Prince Charles (whom she said is "too high profile" for her taste). When Cohen mentioned she'd just shared a secret about Nicholson, Morgan said, "That's on the down-low."

"Not anymore!" Cohen informed Morgan. "Not really."Morgan passed on Gary Busey and Donald Trump. She never dated the president (unlike Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Kim Richards), but they've "always" been friends. "I went to his wedding and his ex-wife Ivana's wedding," Morgan said, calling herself a "friend of the family."(E! and Bravo are both members of the NBCUniversal family.)
