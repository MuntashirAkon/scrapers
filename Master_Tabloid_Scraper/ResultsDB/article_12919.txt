'Titanic' Stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet Together in Saint-Tropez/nLeonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet will always be linked whether they're near, far or wherever they are ... but it's always best to see them together. The famous  "Titanic " couple hung out at Leo's villa in Saint-Tropez, France in late July ... and the 2 are clearly still very tight. Kate was visiting to attend the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation annual charity gala, but the old friends and fellow Oscar-winners found some time to chill by the pool and catch up. And our hearts will go on./n
