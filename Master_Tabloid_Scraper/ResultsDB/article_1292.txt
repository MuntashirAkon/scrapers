Jennie Garth on Divorce From Peter Facinelli: "It Happens to the Best of Us"/n
When Leno politely brought up the demise of her union with the 38-year-old Twilight star and the tough time she's been going through, Garth admitted the divorce hasn't been easy."It's unfortunate. It happens to the best of us. Yeah. But it's something that's been really tough, for sure," she told the funnyman.Prodded by Leno, the actress was more than happy to mention that the three daughters she and Facinelli have together——Luca Bella, 14; Lola Ray, 9; and Fiona Eve, 5—are their pride and joy."My husband and I, we grew up together, so we are very important people to each other and we do, we have three beautiful daughters, one of whom is here today," she added.

The thesp also made light of turning the big 4-0 when the late night gabber wished her a happy birthday and showed a picture of her celebrating with some elderly members of a Friendship House senior community (her "homies," she calls them) in California's Santa Ynez Valley where she lives."I just turned 24," she quipped after asking Leno's other guest that evening, Zac Efron, his age.Garth, who stopped by to promote her new reality series on CMT, Jennie Garth: A Little Bit Country, also discussed her current zip code and living on a ranch."I always wanted to get the hell out of L.A. and I wanted to experience a different life," she said. "I've been in L.A. working since I was 14 and 15, and I just needed fresh air. So…I moved my girls to the country and put them in public school."

While Jennie gets used to being a single mom, she's had a strong show of solidarity from her old 90210 costar Shannen Doherty, who has also been making the publicity rounds plugging her own reality show, Shannen Says."I think that for somebody like Jennie who values family so much, this is incredibly hard for her," Doherty told People Thursday. "I feel for her and, more importantly, I feel for her kids."
