Chris Pratt Goes Fishing with Son /nIt doesn't get a whole lot cuter ... Chris Pratt put up his  "Gone Fishing " sign on his trailer where he's filming  "Jurassic World 2 " for an outing with his son. Chris showed his casting skills in Honolulu Monday as 4-year-old Jack watched attentively. Chris is a well-known hunter but this time around he happily walked away from the stream empty-handed. The  "Guardians of the Galaxy " star reeled in a small barracuda, which he quickly released. The fish now has a good story to tell his friends. Â /n
