We're getting our first look at Jennie Garth's engagement ring!Days after getting engaged to her hunky fiancé Dave Abrams, the 43-year-old actress stepped out in L.A. on Tuesday sporting some new bling on her ring finger. While it's a little fuzzy, Garth's engagement ring appears to be made of yellow gold with a thin band and big gemstone. Well done, Dave!In addition to her new jeweled bling, Garth went casual for her shopping trip in a gray tank and black sweater. The blond beauty also looked fresh-faced without any makeup on as she carried her phone and purse sans her hubby-to-be.
