Tom Brady Goes Belly to Fat Belly with Sumo Wrestlers in Tokyo/nTom Brady is now picking on fat guys ... taking on sumo wrestlers in Tokyo -- and the good news, he didn't get wrecked! TB12 and his son, Jack, got a private workout while on tour with Under Armour in Asia this week ... and the 5-time Super Bowl champ hilariously tries to join the fun by grappling with a guy twice his size. Spoiler alert -- big guy didn't budge. But at least he didn't get sumo powerslammed. We've seen that before ...   Gotta give Brady credit for trying -- he even ditched his shirt to show off his 39-year-old dad bod physique -- but it's pretty weird to see him not dominate something for once./n
