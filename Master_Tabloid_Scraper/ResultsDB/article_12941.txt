Khloe Kardashian to Destiney Bleu: You're a Liar, I Didn't Steal Your Catsuit!!!/nKhloe Kardashian has lashed out at the woman who claims Khloe blatantly stole her design for a catsuit, saying the Kardashian design is a cat of a different color. Khloe's lawyer, Marty Singer, fired off a threatening letter saying Destiney Bleu has been lying on social media when she claims she sent Khloe a catsuit that she then copied and sold as part of her line, Good American.

The one Khloe designed is a sleeveless leotard, like a corset, with crystals concentrated in the bust area. The letter shows indignation from the get-go, calls it  "a cheap publicity stunt in order to garner attention for herself and generate sales of her merchandise. " The war has become a big deal ...
