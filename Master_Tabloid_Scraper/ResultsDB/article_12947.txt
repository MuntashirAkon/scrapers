Insiders told Radar that the reality star, 44, flew to Milan to join her costars in Italy, despite reports that she could be headed back to prison.

The officer’s official report stated that the mother of four was ticketed for talking on her cellphone while driving, and making an illegal left turn.
She was ordered to report any contact with law enforcement within 72 hours, but her officer said he found out much later than the deadline.

However, Giudice’s attorney James Leonard insisted to Radar that his client will not be heading back to the slammer.

“We are aware of what is required of Ms. Giudice and will continue to comply with the terms and conditions of her release,” he said. “Ms. Giudice continues to remain in good standing with probation, as she has since the day she was released.”
The reality star previously came under fire in January 2016 for getting pulled over after attending an event, but nothing came of the incident. She served a one-year sentence for bankruptcy fraud, and her husband Joe is currently serving his 41-month sentence in New Jersey.
