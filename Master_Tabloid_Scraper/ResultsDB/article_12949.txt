 ‘Hell On Earth!’ Man Sentenced To Five Years In Prison For Taping A Dog’s Mouth.../n
A man has been sentenced to five years in prison for animal cruelty after he taped a dog’s mouth shut, an action so heinous the judge said the dog suffered “hell on Earth.”
Caitlyn, a Staffordshire bull terrier mix, was found with her muzzle taped shut after her original owner, a drug dealer, dumped her with William Leonard Dodson.
Frustrated with her barking, Dodson taped her mouth shut with grey electrical tape, mashing her tongue between her teeth.
Aldwin Roman, the Charleston Animal Society’s Director of Anti-Cruelty and Outreach told a judge about what he found when Caitlyn came to his office.

Veterinarians unwound the tape from her snout and “she let out a scream,” Roman said.
“I remember seeing the fear … in her eyes,” Roman said during the trial on March 24, 2017. “That was 36 hours of torture.”
The judge interjected, “I would call it hell on Earth.”
Assistant Solicitor Ted Corvey claimed Dodson had said “I had to do it,” the South Carolina Post and Courier reported. Dodson also allegedly said, “She wouldn’t shut up.”

“I’m not trying to be mean,” Circuit Judge Markley Dennis told Dodson on Friday when he sentenced him to the maximum punishment for animal cruelty, “but I wish I could give you more.”
Dodson will be locked up in prison, where he is going to serve 15 years on a federal gun charge.
