Where did Richard get the inspiration for his female identity Fiona’s hair, makeup and fashion? RadarOnline.com has discovered that the 67-year-old looks nearly identical to an old glamour shot of his onetime dancer mother, Shirley!

With their brunette locks, red lips and angelic feathers, the two could be sisters.
Shirley’s modeling photo, included in her famous son’s 1999 memoir, Still Hungry— After All These Years, was taken during her days as a New York City fan dancer, before she tied the knot with Richard’s father Leonard Simmons in 1938.
“Shirley choreographed all her own numbers…the audience loved her,” Richard gushed in his book.
The following year, the couple relocated to New Orleans, where Richard and his brother Lenny were born and raised. Eventually, she put down her fans and took up cosmetics in order to stay close to home.

The workout pro lost his beloved mother in 1999 at age 87, but she clearly left a lasting impression on her youngest son.
As Radar revealed in exclusive photos, Richard has been dressing up in sexy gowns, jewelry and wigs while out on the town with gal pals.
He has denied transitioning, but sources told The ENQUIRER that he has gone so far as to begin hormone treatments and even undergo breast augmentation surgery.
A friend hopes the very, very private star will reenter the spotlight soon— as a woman.
“I know [people] will love Fiona!” a source said. /n
