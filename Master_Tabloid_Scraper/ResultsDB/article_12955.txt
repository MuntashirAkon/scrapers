Sorry Bobby Flay, your ex-wife has traded up! Actress Stephanie March, who split from the famed chef last year, has a new boyfriend, RadarOnline.com has learned.
According to Page Six, the 41-year-old debuted her new man — hedge funder Daniel Benton — at a black-tie Whitney Museum gala on Tuesday where Leonard Lauder was honored.
The pair got “very close” during the event, onlookers shared, while one source told the publication that they’ve been “very quietly dating for six months.”

“They’re crazy about each other,” the insider added.
As for March’s choice in men, Benton is a definite upgrade from Flay, earning a whopping $100 million in 2000, Forbes’ fourth-highest earner of that year.

As Radar previously reported, the exes finalized their nasty divorce only recently. March alleged in court papers that the marriage ended after her then-hubby carried on a string of affairs, including with Mad Men star January Jones.
