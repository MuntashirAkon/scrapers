Joe Checks In! Teresa's Husband Begins 41-Month Prison Sentence/n
Goodbye, Joe!
RadarOnline.com has learned that Teresa Giudice‘s 43-year-old husband turned himself over to federal custody on Wednesday.
The Real Housewives of New Jersey star arrived to Fort Dix Federal Correctional Institution in New Hanover Township, New Jersey at 12 pm to begin his 41-month prison sentence for fraud.
His wife, 43, and other family members were by his side for final goodbyes.
“His brother, his sister and several other family members of the Giudice family, as well as myself, were present when he turned himself into the prison, including Teresa,” Teresa’s attorney and family friend James J. Leonard Jr. said in a statement to Radar. “It was obviously a very emotional day, but this is a strong family with a tremendous support system and they will get through this, just as they did when Teresa was away.”

Just weeks before his check-in date, Joe broke down in tears over facing potential deportation once he completes his sentence.
“Anything can happen, you know? There is nothing in life that is certain,” he told Entertainment Tonight. “We will deal with that when I get out.”
Before her husband’s sentence, Teresa spent 11 months behind bars and was released in December. /n
