Katy Perry & Orlando Bloom Caught On Cozy Dinner Date With A-List Celebs/n
Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom seem to be building their it-factor as a couple this week, as the pair was spotted on a celebrity packed dinner date at the trendy Sunset Tower Hotel on Wednesday.
According to Page Six, the duo was cuddling together during a birthday dinner for producer Aleen Keshishian. Top celebs were in attendance for the fancy night out, including Jennifer Aniston and Jason Bateman.
“Orlando and Katy had that new-relationship glow about them,” one witness told the magazine. “They were cuddling and flirting with each other all night.”

As Radar previously reported, the two got very friendly at the 73rd Annual Golden Globe Awards earlier this month, as they were seen together during most of the after parties.
Then last weekend, Perry and Bloom were back at it, smiling for a selfie taken backstage for the production The Absolute Brightness of Leonard Pelkey, a play currently running in Los Angeles.
Meanwhile, the new couple reportedly almost ran into Perry’s ex John Mayer, who was also staying at the Sunset Tower Hotel this week. Let us not forget that Aniston also dated Mayer in 2009, before Perry — awkward!

Luckily, the fiasco was avoided.
“Perhaps John knew there was a table full of his ex-girlfriends in the restaurant, because he didn’t go into the Tower Bar and instead went directly into the hotel elevator,” an onlooker told Page Six.
