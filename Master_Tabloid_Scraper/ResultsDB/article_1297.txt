New couple alert!Jennie Garth seems to be getting pretty serious with the new man in her life, Michael Shimbo.The former Beverly Hills 90210 star has been spending lots of time lately with the businessman, who runs a San Francisco-based company called Planes, Trains and Automobiles.The new couple hasn't attempted to hide their budding romance, either.In fact, at the Comedy Central Roast of James Franco in late August, Garth was spotted getting cozy with her plus-one throughout the evening.But the lovefest didn't end there…

Garth has even taken Shimbo on a double date with former costar Shannen Doherty and her husband, Kurt Iswarienko, several weeks ago.The foursome went to Nobu for dinner and captured the coupled-up occasion on Garth's Instagram.She captioned the cute pic, "it happens in the bu," and tagged both Shimbo and Doherty in the snapshot.Garth is seen showing off a hint of her taut tummy and wearing an all-black ensemble with reading glasses. Her beau sported a vintage band T-shirt and denim jacket for the sushi outing.Doherty and her hubby were dressed casually as well, wearing almost identical outfits to their dinner partners.

It seems as though they all got along swimmingly, the group of four posed for the camera arm-in-arm after getting their grub on.And just hours ago, Garth posted another shot of her main man with the hashtag, "#luckylady." I mean…adorbs much?The 41-year-old was most recently linked to Jeremy Salken, whom she dated for several months following her divorce from Peter Facinelli.She and the Twilight actor were husband and wife for 11 years before announcing that they were ending their marriage in 2012.The former couple has three daughters together, Luca Bella, Lola Ray and Fiona Eve.Their marriage marked the second time that Garth had walked down the aisle.She was previously married to Daniel Clark before filing for divorce in 1996.
