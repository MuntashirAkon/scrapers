It's been a year since the death of Star Trek legend Leonard Nimoy and Zachary Quinto, who plays his character and starred with him on the big screen, holds a special place in his heart for him.The actor, who originated the role of Mr. Spock in the original series, died at age 83 on Feb. 27, 2015. Quinto befriended Leonard while playing his character's younger self in the first two new Star Trek movies, which contained elements of time travel."I've never met somebody actually who so fully embodied a sense of fulfillment in their life," Quinto said recently on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert. "I really haven't. He was such a tremendous artist and philanthropist and generous person and so intelligent. I miss him all the time. I really miss him so much at this point, obviously, marking the anniversary of his passing.""He was one of the greatest gifts that my career has brought into my personal life, for sure," he added.
