Mayweather Beats McGregor In ONE ROUND ... Says Sugar Ray Leonard (VIDEO)/nScrew the talk, screw the hype ... it would only take ONE ROUND for Floyd Mayweather to dismantle Conor McGregor in a boxing ring -- so says Sugar Ray Leonard.  The boxing legend -- who actually beat Floyd's dad back in 1978 -- was leaving Catch when he made it very clear McGregor doesn't stand a chance if they fight in a ring instead of an Octagon.  He's still gonna buy it though. We're all gonna buy it. /n
