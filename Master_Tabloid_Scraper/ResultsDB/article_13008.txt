Michael Jackson Estate Threatens MJ Tribute Promoters/nThe honchos in charge of the Michael Jackson Estate are threatening the people behind the Michael Jackson Tribute concert, claiming the promoters have sullied Michael's name and are possibly even ripping off the Estate.Howard Weitzman, lawyer for the Estate, fired off a letter to promoters of the concert -- set for October 8 in Wales -- expressing displeasure that one of the bands that will be performing is KISS, whose bassist, Gene Simmons, publicly accused MJ of being a hard-core child molester.  Weitzman wrote in his letter,  "It was extraordinarily embarrassing when no sooner than you announced this 'news' that he would participate in your concert that TMZ posted an item noting that Mr. Simmons called Michael Jackson -- the man you are purportedly honoring -- a child molester... "Weitzman also questions where all the proceeds for the concert will be going.  We're told Joe Jackson and Leonard Rowe are behind the concert, and they've always been quick to cash in on MJ's name.And Weitzman suggests promoters may be running afoul of the law by using  "intellectual property that is controlled by the Estate " -- which includes MJ images and his songs./n
