Not All Black People Look Alike!!!/nKhloe Kardashian is pissed at some of her  "f**king stupid " Twitter followers who have a hard time telling black people apart -- and it's all over a picture of Sugar Ray Leonard. The drama began when KK posted a pic for  "Throwback Thursday " today featuring Robert Kardashian, Bruce Jenner and Sugar Ray -- and said,  "#TBT I love this picture! My daddy. My second dad. My God father. "But some people confused Sugar Ray for OJ Simpson -- a friend and client of her father's -- and clearly, Khloe no likey.Â   "For those of you that are that f**king stupid.... That's NOT OJ in my #TBT, " Khloe tweeted ...  "That's Sugar Ray Leonard. Some of you never fail to amaze me! "On a related note ... Bruce sure looks different these day, huh?/n
