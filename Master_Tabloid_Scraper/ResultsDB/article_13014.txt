" When one of the paps reiterated the fan's mistake, a huffy Hayden yelled back,  "Don't ever call me that again! "Somehow, the Lilo fan didn't hear Hayden clearly and called her Lindsay again! Before Hayden could fire up her vocal chords to respond a second time, a paparazzo screamed a string of choice obscenities to the confused Lilo fan.
