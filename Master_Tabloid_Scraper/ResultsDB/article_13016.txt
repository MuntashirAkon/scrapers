Despite having a huge fan base the family opted for a private funeral instead of a large open service so that they could mourn the well-liked singer more peacefully.
Bennington, who had been suffering from depression, hung himself just over a week ago, aged only 41.
After news of his shock death emerged, friends said that while they never suspected he would kill himself he was ‘never the same’ after the death of his close friend Chris Cornell.
