Bennington has been open about struggling with mental health issues including addiction in the past.
“I was on 11 hits of acid a day. I dropped so much acid I’m surprised I can still speak! I’d smoke a bunch of crack, do a bit of meth and just sit there and freak out. Then I’d smoke opium to come down. I weighed 110 pounds,” he said in a 2016 interview.
In a tragic twist, Bennington’s longtime friend, Chris Cornell, committed suicide in May. Today would have been Cornell’s 53rd birthday.
