“I don’t have any information to release about her at this time,” a spokesman told Radar.
Sadly, Fairman struggled with substance abuse for years before her passing. She was arrested in 2015 on prostitution charges, and reportedly checked into rehab the year prior.

“She was fighting the fight,” Rivera insists. “She appeared in the right mindset. But the struggle was always there.”
