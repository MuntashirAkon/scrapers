'Survivor' Contestant Michele Fitzgerald Was Busted For Underage Drinking/n
After a bombshell investigation, RadarOnline.com can exclusively reveal that Survivor Kaoh Rong contestant Michele Fitzgerald was previously cited for public drunkenness and underage drinking!
West Chester Borough police stopped Fitzgerald, now 24, on April 1, 2010. The then-20-year-old appeared to be under the influence, a Pennsylvania State Police spokesperson told Radar.
Although she was not arrested, the bartender from Freehold, New Jersey was issued a citation, and forced to appear in court, where she pleaded guilty to purchasing the alcohol and was ultimately fined $337.

She was found not guilty of the public drunkenness charge, a Chester County District Court clerk said.
But that wasn’t her only boozy run-in with the authorities.
A year earlier in February 2009, Fitzgerald also ran into legal trouble after being caught trying to purchase alcohol while underage, and she was issued a citation.
