As Radar previously reported, ever since the now 17-year-old heiress to the Jackson family fortune broke up with the “love of her life” Chester Castellaw in 2015, she’s gone on sort of a wild streak – going on troubling tangents on social media and admitting to the world that she is now in A.A.
In a sign that life is looking up for Paris, she recently took to her Instagram once more to share a huge family photo with the caption: “too many Jacksons to tag… and this isn’t even the half of it!”

“Paris has no problems with anyone in her family, so they are all expected to be there.” /n
