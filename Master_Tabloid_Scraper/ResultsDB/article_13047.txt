The members of Linkin Park are in mourning.

Just days after Chester Bennington was discovered dead in his California home, the band has released an open letter paying tribute to the late frontman. In a lengthy note shared on Monday, the remaining members expressed their grief and opened up about the inner demons that ultimately led to the singer’s suicide.
“Talking with you about the years ahead together, your excitement was infectious,” the rock group wrote. “Your absence leaves a void that can never be filled—a boisterous, funny, ambitious, creative, kind, generous voice in the room is missing.”
“We are trying to remind ourselves that the demons who took you away from us were part of the deal. After all, it was the way you sang about those demons that made everyone fall in love with you in the first place,” they continued. “You fearlessly put them on display, and in doing so, brought us together and taught us to be more human.”

The statement comes just hours after the Los Angeles County coroner’s office determined Chester’s cause of death as a suicide by hanging. The late 41-year-old was reportedly found hanging from a belt on his bedroom door last Thursday.
Since the passing, Linkin Park’s One More Light North American Tour, which was slated to kick off July 27, was canceled.
