Ariana Grande is heading back to Manchester.

The “Dangerous Woman” singer will join a star-studded lineup at a benefit concert this Sunday to raise money for the victims of terrorist attack that killed 22 people and injured 119 people earlier this month.
Dubbed One Love Manchester, the event will feature performances from Miley Cyrus, Justin Bieber, Katy Perry, Coldplay and Pharrell Williams. Usher, Niall Horan and Take That will also take the stage, according to BBC.

The concert will be held at the Old Trafford cricket ground just less than 10 weeks following the bombing at Manchester Arena. All net ticket proceeds will go to the We Love Manchester Emergency Fund set up by Manchester City Council and the British Red Cross to aid the families and victims of the attack.
Fans who attended the original Grande show are being offered free tickets to the benefit concert, which they can obtain by registering on Ticketmaster by Wednesday (May 31, 2017).
“There is nothing I or anyone can do to take away the pain you are feeling or to make this better,” Grande wrote when she initially announced her plans to return to the city. “However, I extend my hand and heart and everything I possibly can give to you and yours, should you want or need my help in any way.”
She added, “We will not quit or operate in fear. We will not let this divide us. We won’t let hate win.”
