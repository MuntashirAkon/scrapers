“We are working on a special public event in Los Angeles to honor Chester’s memory, and look forward to sharing details with you soon,” the statement concludes.
Bennington, 41, died of suicide on July 20 at his home in Palo Verdes Estates in California. Four days after his death, the L.A. County Coroner’s Office confirmed to PEOPLE that Bennington died of suicide by hanging.
The singer was laid to rest on July 30 during a private funeral at South Coast Botanical Garden with over 500 of Bennington’s family members and close friends in attendance to pay tribute to the rock star.

Ted Stryker of KROQ led the service, while Chester’s Stone Temple Pilots bandmates Robert & Dean DeLeo, Kings of Chaos drummer Matt Sorum, Damon Fox and Jimmy Gnecco teamed up for a powerful and touching rendition of “Amazing Grace.”
Fans from around the globe held their own memorials to pay homage to his legacy. One fan even started a Google Doc, gathering all of the worldwide memorials to share with other fans around the world.
