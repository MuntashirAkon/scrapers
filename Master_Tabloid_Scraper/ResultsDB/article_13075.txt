Chester Bennington's Famous Peers and Fellow Rock Stars Pay Tribute to the Late Singer/n
Chester Bennington will never know his impact on the rock 'n' roll community, as was shown by the countless tributes and messages dedicated to the late singer. As E! News previously reported, the Linkin Park frontman was discovered dead from an apparent suicide around 9 a.m. this morning, exactly one-week before the alt-rock band was poised to hit the road on their One More Light world tour. He was 41.Bennington's bandmates Mike Shinoda and Dave Phoenix Farrell expressed their shock over the devastating news in a series of tweets shared hours after the announcement spread, but have yet to address the status of their upcoming tour dates. Similarly, plans for a memorial service have not been shared publicly. 

In the wake of Chester's sudden passing, plenty of famous faces and those who worked closely with the beloved recording artist have taken to social media to reflect on their fondest memories.Perhaps the most devastating came from Chris Cornell's wife Vicky, who suffered her own personal tragedy in May when the rock legend also took his own life. Chris and Chester shared an unmistakable bond over the years, and today marked what would have been Cornell's 53rd birthday.
