Chester Bennington's Family Wants Private Memorial /nChester Bennington's family wants to keep his funeral a close family and friends affair. Sources close to the late Linkin ParkÂ frontman tell TMZ ... the family wants to keep the memorial intimate -- and while they're aware fans want to pay their respects ... the plan, for now, is a private ceremony. We're told the family just hasn't figured out how to give fans their moment to honor Chester. As for Chester's final resting place -- we're told the family's not jumping at the offer to take the plot next to Chris Cornell at Hollywood Forever Cemetery because it's in such a public space./n
