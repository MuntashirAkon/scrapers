Chester Bennington Bought Family Home Just Before Suicide /nChester Bennington bought his new family home about 2 months before he hanged himself there ... adding another layer of mystery to his death. The Linkin Park frontman bought the Palos Verdes Estates house for $2.5 million back in June. The 5 bedroom, 4 bathroom house is in an affluent part of L.A. County famous for pristine neighborhoods and an excellent public school system. Everything about the 3,956 square foot pad says family home -- special nook perfect for game night, 3 outdoor decks, an expansive backyard with a spa and swimming pool. The purchase falls in line with what Chester's LP bandmates said -- that he'd spoken excitedly about future plans. Buying the perfect place for his family, but then taking his life there a month later just doesn't add up. The Benningtons closed on the house 8 days after Chris Cornell's suicide ... leading some close friends to believe Chester's suicide decision was sudden and fueled by his grief./n
