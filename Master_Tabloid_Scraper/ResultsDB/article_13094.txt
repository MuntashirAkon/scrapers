Dodgers Organist Honors Chester Bennington with Linkin Park Tribute /nEven the guy who plays  "Take Me Out to the Ball Game " at Dodgers Stadium was affected by the death of Chester Bennington ... and honored the Linkin Park singer with a musical tribute on the stadium organ. Just before the Dodgers took the field against the Braves, team organist Dieter Ruehle played his own version of  "Numb " over the loudspeakers. That's not all ... during the game Dodgers pitcher Brandon McCarthy used LP's  "Figure.09 " as his walkout music when he took the field. While Chester was from Arizona, the band was especially big in L.A. -- where the founding members are from. /n
