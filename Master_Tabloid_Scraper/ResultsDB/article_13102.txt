Reached at her home in Idaho, Esther Jenner said, “I haven’t turned on television today. I am not aware.”

When told how Caitlyn, 67, has undergone a further round of surgery and is now physically a woman, she added, “I don’t know anything about what you are talking about. I have no idea.”
Indeed, Caitlyn says in her book that the memoir is “the first time, and the last time” she “will ever speak of it.”
But she does want the world to know she’s thrilled.
“The surgery was a success, and I feel not only wonderful but liberated,” the former Olympian wrote.

Caitlyn added she underwent the surgery because she wanted to have “all the right parts.”
“It’s just a penis,” she insisted. “It has no special gifts or use for me other than what I have said before, the ability to take a whiz in the woods … I am also tired of tucking the damn thing in all the time.”
