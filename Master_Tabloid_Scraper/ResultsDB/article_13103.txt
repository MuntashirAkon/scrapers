After flirting at a charity gala in December, the 58-year-old singer and her actor ex, 56, have rekindled their romance, a source close to the situation said.
“Madonna and Sean are still hooking up and have been for months,” the insider revealed.
As fans know, the volatile couple was married for four years in the ’80s. But after a messy split in the midst of their exploding careers, the two became estranged for years — until recently.
According to the insider, when Madonna on her Rebel Heart tour in 2016, Sean came to “a ton” of shows and “always” sat in the front row: “It was during the tour that the two first had sex again.”
Then after Madonna’s 16-year-old son Rocco got busted for marijuana possession, Penn swooped in to help stage an intervention for the rebellious teen.
