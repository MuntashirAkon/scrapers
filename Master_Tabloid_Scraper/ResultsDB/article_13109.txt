“He had huge mood swings, too, which we attributed to hormone therapy,” noted the pal.

Even before the treatments, the gender-bending fitness guru was never very shy about hiding his feminine side. He often appeared in public wearing tiny tutus, dresses and other womenswear.

In the wake of Simmons’ publicist Tom Estey denying the story — he claimed it was “total crap” — The ENQUIRER provided Radar with this bombshell image.
