Oh, Baby! Caitlyn Jenner Begins Hunt For Surrogate To Carry Baby/n
Caitlyn Jenner has informed those close to her that she’s started the hunt for a surrogate! “Cait wants another child desperately,” one insider told RadarOnline.com. “She doesn’t want to completely freak out the whole family, but her own children are totally behind the idea.”
As Radar reported, Jenner, 66, was thinking about adopting as recently as last winter. But the reality star has decided surrogacy is the way to go.
“Cait has her heart set on another child because she wants to be as actively involved in the pregnancy as possible from day one,” said the insider.

The desire to raise a baby of her own is in line with Jenner’s excitement over reliving everything in her life for the first time as a female.
“She’s suffering from the empty nest syndrome and she really wants to experience parenting from a mother’s perspective,” the insider explained to Radar.
Sadly, there’s another reason Jenner is determined to find the right surrogate as quickly as possible.
