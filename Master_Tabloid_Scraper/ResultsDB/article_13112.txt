While the I Am Cait star didn’t share any details on her mother’s current condition, she did say in October that the 89-year-old was recovering after breaking both hips.
“She’s been mobile — she’s tough,” Jenner tweeted at the time.
After Jenner announced her decision to transition to a woman last spring, mom Esther was extremely supportive of her son, then referred to as Bruce.

“I love him dearly. It doesn’t matter whether he dresses like a male or a female. Whatever he needs to make him happy that’s all I care about,” Esther told the New York Daily News last summer.
Our thoughts and prayers are with Caitlyn’s mother in this difficult time! /n
