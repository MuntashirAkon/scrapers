Dame Edna Star Rips Into Caitlyn Jenner: 'She's A Publicity-Seeking Ratbag'/n
Barry Humphries, the Australian comedian who created alter-ego star Dame Edna, has gone on the attack against Caitlyn Jenner.
In a salacious interview with The Telegraph, the 81-year-old defended pal Germaine Greer, who ruffled feathers for calling transgender women “men who believe that they are women and have themselves castrated.”
“I agree with Germaine! You’re a mutilated man, that’s all,” Humphries told the publication. “Self-mutilation, what’s all this carry on? Caitlyn Jenner — what a publicity-seeking ratbag.”

“It’s all given the stamp — not of respectability, but authenticity or something,” the Aussie comic continued. “If you criticize anything you’re racist or sexist or homophobic.”
Ouch! Cailtyn, formerly known as Olympian Bruce Jenner, may want to watch out.
But the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star, 66, seems to be doing quite well, otherwise, receiving utmost honor at Glamour Magazine’s “Woman of the Year Awards” in November and renewing her docu-series I Am Cait for another season.

 I love when all my children are living their dreams. Last night my little angel @KendallJenner fulfilled her dream as a little girl to walk in a @VictoriasSecret show. So touching I cried!

This week, Jenner hosted a special screening of the film Tangerine, rocking some trendy bangs and a low-cut dress for the occasion. It’s safe to say she feels comfortable in her new skin!
