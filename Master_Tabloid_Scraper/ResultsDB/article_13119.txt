According to a well-connected Kardashian family insider, the 65-year-old “actually held auditions for the role of her transgender BFFs for the television show!”
“Caitlyn didn’t just meet all of these already famous transgender people by accident – of course they were cast and, yes, they are getting paid,” says the source.
“We’re just really, really good friends,” Cayne told Access Hollywood Live, confessing that they aren’t romantically involved, despite the creative editing on the show, and saying that she is into men.

And Cayne defended Jenner against haters, who claim that her transition and struggles are a “fairy tale” thanks to her vast wealth and resources.
“She’s lived her whole life being transgender but never being able to do anything about it,” Cayne explained. “That’s just as hard as somebody like me, who at 24 decided that’s what I had to do with my life in order to be OK with things. So I went through other struggles, but she did also.”
