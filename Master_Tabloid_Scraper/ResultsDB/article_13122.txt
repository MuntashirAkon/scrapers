will.i.am Confirms Fergie Has Left The Black Eyed Peas — So What About Those Nicole Scherzinger Rumors??/n

It's official — Fergie has left the Black Eyed Peas!
In a new interview with Ahlan!, will.i.am confirmed the rumors by saying:

"Since the beginning of Black Eyed Peas, we've always had amazing vocalists that appeared on the mic with us. People like Macy Gray, Esthero, Debi Nova, Fergie. On Elephunk, there were several females that appeared on that album. Obviously Fergie was the featured female, but on songs like Lets Get it Started, it's Noelle (Scaggs), and then Fergie, songs like Latin Girls, it's Debi Nova, and Request Line, it's Macy Gray. We'll always work with good females."
Adding: 

"As for replacing, what people know The Black Eyed Peas to be, nobody is replacing Fergie. She's working on her solo project at the moment, we're on this brand-new experience, celebrating 20 years of Black Eyed Peas putting out music. We worked on a bunch of songs on her solo record, we're proud that she has her label, but Black Eyed Peas are pushing it forward in terms of content, technology and experiences on our new project, Masters of the Sun."
And that new project does indeed feature the former Pussycat Doll, Nicole Scherzinger — we just don't know how:

"Nicole is on the new BEP project as well. I don't want to go into details how she's involved yet."
We called it!
Stay tuned alert!
