Justin Bieber Tries To Sing Despacito In Spanish & Miserably Fails!! Watch!/n

Que?
Justin Bieber got a bit tongue tied during a performance in NYC on Tuesday night when he tried to sing the Spanish parts of his hit track Depsacito.
The pop superstar was joined by Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee at 1Oak, where the three performed the number one song in the country.

But when the chorus came around, things got lost in translation for Biebs — so he improvised some of the lyrics.
Instead of singing, "Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito," the 23-year-old sang: 
"Nos vamos pegando, I quit smoking ciggies."
LOLz, way to kick the habit!
Bieber's remix of the remix got even worse when he replaced "Firmo en las paredes de tu laberinto," with, "Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
Well. Maybe he could just nod along next time?
Ch-ch-check out the clips (below) to see the lyrical fail!
