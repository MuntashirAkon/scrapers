Wow, build me up just to tear me down. Who's team #nobonezone and who's team #throwadogabone? #annablescouplestherapy @odetteannableA post shared by Dave Annable (@dave_annable) on May 18, 2017 at 9:43pm PDT


You tell him, girl! Not to mention, the brunette stunner shared the vid on her IG page too and captioned the post:

"I mean, I really wouldâ€¦ just not tonight. Who's team Odie and who's team Crushed dreams? #annablescouplestherapy @dave_annable"
HIGHlarious!
Nonetheless, we have a feeling the House star is used to the Brothers & Sisters alum's antics as they've been married for seven years. In addition to being husband and wife, the duo are also parents to their daughter Charlie Mae, who was born in September 2015.
At the end of the day, we're just glad to see that these two are still going strong! *Snaps*
