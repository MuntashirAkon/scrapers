Madonna's Twins Esther & Stella Start Their First Day Of School/n

First day of school! What a milestone!
Madonna's newly adopted twin girls Esther and Stella attended their first day of pre-school Monday and they looked pretty psyched! Well, one of them did anyway, LOLz!

"How Im Gettin through Monday!! 😂 First Day Of School Faces! 📚📙📘📗📕♥️"
It's obviously kind of a stressful time, but we bet they're getting a lot of love and support from their mom and siblings. Older brother David Banda giving them a big hug surely helped!
According to Yahoo, the girls are attending "a school that specializes in foreign language programs," similar to schools attended by older siblings Lourdes, David, and Mercy.
BTW, we love the matchy-matchy thing they have going on!
The four-year-olds also seem to be adjusting pretty well since their adoption about a month ago by the legendary pop star.
We love this clip (below) of them jamming out!
