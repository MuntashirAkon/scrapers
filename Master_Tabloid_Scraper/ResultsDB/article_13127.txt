Are These The Twins Madonna Recently Adopted???/n

OMG, these girls (above) could very well be the twins Madonna recently adopted from Malawi!
Madge's eldest child Lourdes Leon was photographed with twins Stella and Esther from the Home of Hope orphanage seven months ago during a visit to the country, and the pic was posted with the caption:
"3 Beauties! ðŸ’˜ Lola spends time with twins, Stella and Esther at Home of Hope Orphanage"
We wouldn't think much of it except that multiple news outlets, including The Guardian, E! News, and yours truly, reported that the adopted twins are named Stella and Esther! And they were adopted from the Home of Hope orphanage!!!

That's too much of a coincidence not to be true!
It also makes sense that Madonna and her children would have spent time with the four-year-old twins prior to the adoption, to get to know them and to allow the girls a chance to bond with them.
If these are really the twins the 58-year-old adopted, they're gorgeous and we wish them a smooth transition into their new reality!
