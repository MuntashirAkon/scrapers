The biological father of Madonna’s newly adopted twin girls believes he was misled into allowing the songstress take his children.

Adam Mwale told the Daily Mail he only signed off on the adoption because he was informed by the orphanage that his four-year-old daughters, Esther and Stella, would only be fostered by Madonna. According to him, he was under the impression that the twins would eventually be returned to his family in Malawi.
“I was told from the start that Esther and Stella were going to a rich woman’s home abroad, that she would give them a good education, then return them to me, to live with me and help all of my family,” he said. “I accepted they would go abroad but I was told they would also be coming back. They would always be my children, and I would always be their daddy.”
Mwale continued, “The orphanage boss told me it would be a wonderful chance for my little girls, and for their brother and sisters at home. I was told to agree with everything in court. I did not believe I would never see my girls again.”

As previously reported, Madonna’s adoption of the girls from the Home of Hope was finalized earlier this month. Appearing in front of a judge at the time, Mwale and his brother-in-law were present in the courtroom to witness the signing the final legal documents.
Mwale claimed he was forced to listen to “terrible lies” when a court-appointed guardian of the children told the judge that he had abandoned them after the twin’s mother, Patricia, died in childbirth. Though he has remarried, he insisted he had been a huge part of the twins’ lives and only kept them in the orphanage as a way to support them.
“It was me who took the girls to the orphanage after Patricia died. We had been happily married for many years. We had a good family life. But when she gave birth to the twins, she lost a lot of blood and died. The twins survived. I wanted the hospital to help but they said the orphanage was the best place. Everyone in the village knows I just wanted the best for them,” he shared, explaining that he made regular visits to the orphanage. “I used to cycle there down a dirt road, taking two hours each way. I brought little dresses and gifts for them and they would sit on my lap, one twin on either side, and laugh and play with me.”

Mwale added, “I thought they would have a great education, which I could never afford, and that we would one day be together again. Deep down I still hope for a future with them.”
Madonna previously adopted two other children from Malawi: David Banda, 11, and Mercy James, 10. She is also the mother to Lourdes Leon, 20, and Rocco Ritchie, 16.
The “Material Girl” singer’s adoption of the twin girls is said to be made permanent in 12 months. Madonna immediately flew her new daughters to the United States after the adoption process was completed.
