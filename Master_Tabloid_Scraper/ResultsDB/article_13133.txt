Madonna’s brood is getting bigger again.

The “Material Girl” singer appeared in Malawi court on Tuesday (Feb. 7, 2017) to adopt a pair of twin girls. Though she previously denied reports about expanding her family again, the 58-year-old joined her lawyer and the two 4-year-old girls to oversee the adoption proceedings.
The children’s father and uncle were reportedly present to witness the adoption.
Mlenga Mvula, a judicial spokesperson from Malawi, confirmed the news. “Their mother died a week after she delivered the babies,” he said of the twins. “After their mother died, the children were looked after by their grandmother, who could not fully provide for them, so they were taken into an orphanage.”
Mvula added that Madonna “exuded happiness” and “smiled while she was making her way out of the courtroom” with her new daughters.
According to the Guardian, the girls — named Stella and Esther — were adopted from the Home of Hope orphanage near the western border of Zambia, where Madonna’s 11-year-old son, David Banda, once lived.
Aside from David, Madonna is the mother to Lourdes Leon, 20, Rocco Ritchie, 16, and Mercy James, 11.
