Summer may be coming to an end, but Ricky Martin’s vacation has just gotten started.

The “Livin’ la Vida Loca” singer was spotted living the good life while out boating with boyfriend Jwan Yosef in Ibiza, Spain on Monday (Sept. 5, 2016). The couple, who’ve been dating since April, were joined by model Esther Canades for the outing.
Naturally, Martin documented his getaway so the rest of us back home can pass out from a case of major FOMO.



Te queremos Esther. ☀️
