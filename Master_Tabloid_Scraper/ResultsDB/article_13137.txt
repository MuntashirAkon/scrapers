We have a Bieber down.

Justin Bieber met the floor of the Sprint Center’s stage in Kansas City when he slipped and fell during a show for his Purpose world tour. It appears that the singer took a running start onto a wet portion of the stage and slid, much like a junior varsity softball player, onto his bum in the middle of his “Sorry” dance crew.
