“It’s an honor just to be nominated.”

Much to the behest of his eldest dog Esther, Justin Bieber just added a new member to his family ahead of Super Bowl weekend.

Phil seems like a swift critter, which is why we have bestowed the Rookie of the Year title upon him as we draft our ideal team for an unofficial (and yet-to-be-picked-up-by-Bravo) 2016 Celebrity Puppy Bowl. He most likely isn’t potty trained, but who really cares when your turf is literally a huge patch of grass?
