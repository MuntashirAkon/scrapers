Caitlyn Jenner announced that she will be embarking on a multiple-city speaking tour next year through the Unique Lives and Experiences, North America’s foremost women’s lecture series, entitled “Up Close and Personal”.
Tour dates have been announced in five cities thus far, including Toronto, Vancouver, Denver, San Fransisco, and Seattle from February 22-March 1. Jenner will reportedly speak on her personal experience over the past year as she made a public gender transformation to become a female. Tickets range from $40 to $500 for a VIP package that can include a meet-and-greet reception based on the city.
