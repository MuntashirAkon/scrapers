Caitlyn Jenner is by her mother’s side after the matriarch broke both her hips, the Olympian revealed in a touching Instagram post. Sharing a photo of her mom sitting in a chair, Caitlyn wrote, “Visiting my mom and she’s doing great after breaking both her hips. She’s been mobile – she’s tough.”

While Caitlyn, 65, continues to care for her 89-year-old mother, Esther, who is the grandmother of Kylie and Kendall Jenner, has been nothing but supportive of her daughter as well.
When Caitlyn’s transition was made public earlier this year, Esther only had kind things to say about her child.
“She’s beautiful,” Esther gushed over Caitlyn’s famous Vanity Fair cover. “It’s going to be a struggle for me to get used to the change, but happily so… I’m very happy for him — or her!”
