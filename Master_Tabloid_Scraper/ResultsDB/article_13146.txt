Now that's love!When you have children, it's hard enough to get them all to pose for a family photo even when they all live in the same house. Madonna made it happen; She posted on her Instagram page Friday a rare and sweet photo of her and all her kids—Lourdes, 20, Rocco Ritchie, 17, David Banda and Mercy James, who are both 11, and 4-year-old twin sisters Esther and Stella, at her 59th birthday party in Italy. The girls all wore near-identical floral outfits.Madonna also posted more photos of her and her kids at her birthday party, including a sweet pic of Lourdes kissing her on the cheek."Best ................" she wrote.See some of Madonna's past cute family pics with her kids.

Her birthday bash comes almost a year after the pop star settled a nine-month custody battle over Rocco with his dad and her ex-husband Guy Ritchie. The legal turmoil had begun when Rocco refused to return to the United States despite a court order that said he must return to be with his mother in New York after living with his dad father in London.He had joined his mother at her 58th birthday party in Havana, Cuba last year, a month before the custody battle was settled. 

Rocco was all smiles in Madonna's recent family pic.
