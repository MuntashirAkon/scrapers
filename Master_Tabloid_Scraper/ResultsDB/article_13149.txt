Does The Originals pact "always and forever" apply to the Mikaelson parents as well as the Original siblings?That's what The Originals attempted to figure out this past season by bringing back the Original mom and dad, Esther (Sonja Sohn) and Mikael (Sebastian Roche). But from the very start, it was clear that Klaus (Joseph Morgan), Elijah (Daniel Gillies) and Rebekah (Claire Holt) felt no love for the parents who spent their entire supernatural lives trying to kill them.Press play on the exclusive video from the season two DVD above now to find out what The Originals executive producer Michael Narducci and some of the cast thinks about whether or not Esther was a true villain, or if she was actually in the right in trying to kill her children.

Looking ahead to season three of The Vampire Diaries spinoff, get ready for a family reunion when Holt returns to take on the role of Rebekah in flashbacks. "Right now we're trying to work with Claire's schedule and it's all working out nicely," Narducci previously told E! News. "Claire is phenomenal and we love to have her on the show. We've got a whole flashback storyline that she will participate in, and then we have some ideas on how we might see Rebekah again in present day in both bodies. Not at the same time!"And she's not the only original Original returning for flashbacks: Nathaniel Buzolic is set to reprise his role as Kol and Casper Zafer is returning as Finn's original body as well.The Originals season three premieres Thursday, Oct. 8 at 9 p.m. on the CW, and the season two DVD comes out Sept. 1.
