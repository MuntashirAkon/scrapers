Esther Williams Dead -- Swimming Legend & Movie Star Dies At 91 /nEsther Williams -- the HUGE movie star who became internationally famous with her spectacular, synchronized swimming routines -- is now making a splash ... in heaven.  She died today, at 91.Williams starred in countless swimsuit spectaculars in the 40's and 50's --   "aquamusicals " as they were called -- where MGM honchos made any excuse to get her girl-next-door good looks and bangin' bod into the water.  Movies like  "Neptune's Daughter " and  "Dangerous When Wet " were every guy's wet dream. Esther started as a legit competitive swimmer, smashing records in her late teens ... but she missed the 1940 Olympics because of the outbreak of World War II. So she joined a music, dance and swimming show in San Fran ... where for five months she swam alongside Olympic swimmer and  "Tarzan " star Johnny Weissmuller ... and that's where she caught the eye of Hollywood scouts.In her later years, Williams lent her name to swimwear and other pool-related products, and was a commentator for synchronized swimming at the '84 Olympics.That chick really knew how to sync and swim. /n
