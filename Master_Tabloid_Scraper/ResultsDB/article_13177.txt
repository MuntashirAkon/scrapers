Trey Songz Says Fired Principal Knew Words to 'Best Friend'/nTrey Songz is calling BS on the assistant principal who was fired for appearing in his music video, saying she knew every word on the track,  "Best Friend. " Trey was leaving Henry's in WeHo Friday night, when he squarely took issue with Esther Adler-O'Keefe, who claims she had never heard the lyrics, which she says are  "vulgar, offensive and demeaning.
