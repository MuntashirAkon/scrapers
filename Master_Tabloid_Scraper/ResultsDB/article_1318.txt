Shannen Says 9021-No to Bev Hills/nAs TMZ knows, Shannen Doherty didn't exactly give the new  "90210 " a ringing endorsement anyway.And now, she won't have to: The wacktress won't be doing any more than the first four eps that she signed on for, reports EW.com.  "They asked me to do a lot more, " says Shannen. She says she is in the  "middle of pitching a show, " so she couldn't  "commit " to more time in the zip code. Okaaaay.On the other hand, Kelly Taylor /Jennie Garth is so popular she will be on five more shows. If it lasts that long.   Eva â€“- Not Preggers, Just Fat!

The clan didn't come out of their rooms and only had the most basic of needs (water, milk, and juice). And they traveled with their own organic food and linens and ... towels./n
