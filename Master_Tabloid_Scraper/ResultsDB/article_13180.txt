SPOILER: Who Was Sent Home On Dancing With The Stars?
After weeks of substandard performances, Monday’s Stevie Wonder-themed show marked a knockout blow for Ortiz, who wound up in the bottom two with Lowe.

“I had a blast,” the boxer told Tom Bergeron and Brooke Burke-Charvet following his ouster. “I made great friends, including you guys, you beautiful people, so at the end of the day it was a heck of an experience and hopefully, these beautiful people will follow me to my next championship bout.
“I’m happy to get this far. I definitely need some dance moves.”
