“Jay Z finally has 100 problems.”

Over the weekend, Beyonce blessed us with her sixth studio album, Lemonade. It is without a doubt one of the greatest pieces of work of Beyonce’s career this far, an absolutely breathtaking piece of art, but that doesn’t mean we can’t have a little fun with it. It took the internet no time to start cranking out memes about Bey, Jay Z, and “Becky with the good hair,” and we’ve rounded up the 21 funniest memes out there.



HAPPY TUESDAY BECKY! HOW’S YOUR WEEK GOING? #BEENPLOTTINGTHISWHOLETIME #LEMONADE
