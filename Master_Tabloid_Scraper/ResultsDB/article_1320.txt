"Twilight" of the Nobodies/nIf you were promised a party with the cast of  "Twilight ", would you be happy hanging out with anyone but Robert Pattinson?!A flier for a  "Twilight " event advertised the movie's  "cast " would be at PRIVE in Vegas this past weekend and featured a photo of the two leads, Pattinson and Kristin Stewart.
