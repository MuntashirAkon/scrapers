Before hitting the rails with his sweet skateboard, the singer made sure his outfit was totally on-point as she changed from black Nike sneakers for some checkerboard Vans slip-ons. Also clad in a baseball hat and hoodie, the 21-year-old did some ollies off the front porch before retreating to the comfort of his bodyguard-filled car.
Wow. What a TOTAL badass, right?
