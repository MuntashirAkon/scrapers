The Daily Treat: Border Collie Puppies Pose for Family Portrait/n
What could be better than a border collie puppy? Six of them!  
This sextet of siblings, born on The BIG Sheep farm in Bideford, England, was wrangled together by photographer Richard Austin for a family portrait on Sunday.  
The puppies are all looking for a home to call their own, so their caretakers believed a group photo would be the best way to show off the pooches’ adorable faces – and we couldn’t agree more! 


But more than the dogs’ looks, their obedience and ability to hit their mark – everyone’s got a piece of the fence! – is what truly makes this photo purr-recious.
