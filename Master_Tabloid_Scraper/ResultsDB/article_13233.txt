Cambridge, Massachusetts' Mayor Considers Soda Ban/n

Looks like the mayor of Cambridge, Massachusetts is taking a page out of NYC's mayor Bloomberg's playbook.
Mayor Henrietta Davis is considering limiting the size of soda and sugar-sweetened drinks served in restaurants.
The mayor has asked the city's health officials for recommendations on liming soda sizes.
Cambridge had already made several health related policies in regards to smoking and trans-fats.
The mayor said:
"The target of this effort is super-sized and over-sized sugary drinks, especially when children are the primary consumers. Malnutrition in this country is not only a problem of not getting enough to eat, but also consuming way too many empty, sugary calories."
Well said!
We're sure, just like in New York, there will be a lot of backlash, but honestly, at the end of the day, it really is in everyone's best interest.
Stay healthy!
