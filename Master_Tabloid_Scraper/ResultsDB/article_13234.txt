Oprah + True Blood = ???/n

When we first heard that Oprah Winfrey was teaming up with True Blood creator Alan Ball for a new HBO film, we immediately were pissed at Oprah for getting involved with vampires.
The trend is on its way out. Please let it die.
Apparently, she heard us because her new project with Alan has nothing to do with vamps. Actually, the film will be an adaptation of the nonfiction best-seller The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks. Henrietta's story is very intriguing, having died in 1951 of cervical cancer, but living on through science as pieces of the tumor that killed her were removed and used for medical exploration.
Interesting! 
Much better story than vampires!
