Jude Law Joins Robert Pattinson In Queen Of The Desert/n

Werner Herzog's Queen of the Desert — a biopic about English writer Gertrude Bell — just got added another beautiful British face to the growing A-list cast.
Jude Law will be joining Robert Pattinson and Naomi Watts in the drama that chronicles Bell's life as a traveler, writer, archaeologist, explorer, cartographer, and political attaché for the British Empire at the dawn of the twentieth century. 
At this point, we don't know what role we'll see Law in and if any other big names will climb aboard.  Based on who is involved so far though, we wouldn't be surprised to see more major stars get cast before the film is shot in Morocco this March.
