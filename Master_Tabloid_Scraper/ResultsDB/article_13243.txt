Picks and Pans Review: The Stars Fell on Henrietta/n
Robert Duvall, Aidan Quinn, Frances Fisher, Brian Dennehy
An artfully cut little gem of a movie, this Dust Bowl fable (produced by Clint Eastwood) is set in Depression-era West Texas. Duvall plays a bedraggled old oil wildcatter who is still hunting for his first strike. When he wanders onto an about-to-be-repossessed farm run by Fisher and her second husband, Quinn, he “smells” oil and tries to persuade them to let him drill a well on their property. The skeptical couple refuse, sending Duvall off to explore other partner possibilities, including Dennehy, as a blustery wheeler-dealer. Quinn eventually reconsiders, setting up an ending that’s predictable yet satisfying. Finally, a film about hope and determination—for adults. (PG)
