Robert Pattinson Snags Another Indie Movie Role In Queen Of The Night/n

Cosmopolis has definitely helped launch Robert Pattinson's foray into big boy movie roles!
The recently single hottie has best been known for his role as Edward in the Twilight franchise up until this point, but we have a feeling that is all about to change.
R-Patz has been cast in Werner Herzog's upcoming indie film Queen Of The Night, in which he'll play T.E. Lawrence — the British Army officer who is the subject of the 1962 classic Lawrence of Arabia.
He'll be acting alongside Naomi Watts, who is playing English writer Gertrude Bell.
The film will follow her adventures as a writer, archaeologist, explorer, cartographer and political attaché for the British Empire.
Before that, we'll see Pattinson continue to distance himself from the hoards of adoring Twi-hards as he begins production on the Australian Outback drama The Rover and military drama Mission: Blacklist.
At least his younger fans still get to watch Breaking Dawn - Part 2 before they lose him to art house cinema for good!
