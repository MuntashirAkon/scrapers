Angelina Jolie Signs Up For Another New Flick!/n

Oh, nice!  This is going to be QUITE the pairing!
Angelina Jolie may be moving into behind-the-camera work, but she has reportedly in talks to go back to acting for a currently untitled, big-scale movie by Transporter and Taken director Luc Besson!
According to sources, the project is a dramatic thriller rooted in true scientific elements, and the actress will begin production on it in the spring if all goes as planned!
Between this and Gertrude Bell - on which she'll reportedly begin work upon the Besson project's completion - she's certainly keeping herself busy!
Not that we're complaining!
We love our Angie on the big screen!
