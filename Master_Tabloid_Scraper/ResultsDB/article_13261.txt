Chef to Don King -- You Burned Me!/nAnd in this corner, boxing's horrible-haired pimptrepreneur, Don King, who may have boxed himself into some trouble with Florida labor laws -- and now his former cook has served him up a big fat lawsuit! Kevin Barnes was hired last year by Henrietta and Don King to prepare fancy chow at their $10 million Palm Beach mansion. Barnes and his fellow workers say they worked all kinds of overtime at the Kings' palace, but never got paid for it -- a recipe for a delicious court case. Amazingly, King had no comment./n
