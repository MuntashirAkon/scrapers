Teen Mom Setting Baby Naming Trends??/n

Really?? Are people looking to Teen Mom for baby names?
Apparently so. According to the Social Security Administration's annual top and trending names lists, that is. 
There IS a difference between top and trending, though, meaning that trending represents the largest growth burst â€” not necessarily making them the most popular and earning a place on the "top" portion of the list.
On the trending lists, the top names for both a girl and a boy seem to have come from the show: Maci and Bentley. Don't blame us, but we aren't a huge fan of either.
For boys, it also looks like Twilight's "Kellen" made the list, along with Brangelina's "Knox" and we don't quite understand either of those too. Why are people looking to these sources for names?? 
Whatever happened to Theodore or Burt or Kevin?? Gertrude, Hilda, Peaches?? LOLz! 
Oh well, to each their own! Check out the rest of the list after the jump!
