Twitter Is Understandably INFURIATED That The Live Action Mulan Will Not Have Songs OR The Character Li Shang!/n

What. The. Fuck.
Let's get down to business‚Ä¶ to discuss how Disney is reportedly planning to ditch the music in the upcoming live action remake of Mulan! This is an OUTRAGE!
During an interview with Moviefone, director Niki Caro described the film as a "big, girly martial arts epic" that will be "extremely muscular and thrilling and entertaining and moving" ‚Äî but confirmed it will NOT be a musical, saying:
"From what I understand, no songs right now, much to the horror of my children."
But‚Ä¶ but‚Ä¶ what about I'll Make A Man Out Of You? Reflection? Honor To Us All??

And if that wasn't enough ‚Äî it's also reported that Li Shang (Mulan's seemingly bi-sexual love interest) won't be in the movie, either, as he's supposedly replaced by a new character who rivals the heroine. WAHHHH.
Needless to say, Twitter is understandably infuriated: 

Wait a hot second, why is Captain Li Shang being replaced by this dude in the new #Mulan. First no music, now this. Grrr pic.twitter.com/tE17hM1G7p

Cinderella: same story w/ real ppl
Beauty and the beast: same story w/ real people
Mulan (a movie we begged for): let's fuck it up for fun

no songs in live action Mulan = no I'll Make A Man Out of You scene = no shirtless Li Shang = cancel the movie = what's the point
