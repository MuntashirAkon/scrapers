Zac Efron & His Oympic Twin Meeting May Be Too Much Hotness For One Photo!/n

Is it hot in here, or is that just them?!
I turns out Zac Efron has an Olympic doppelg√§nger, which means everyone's wildest dreams have officially come true. Because, honestly, the only thing hotter than Zac Efron is TWO Zac Efrons!
For those of you who are unfamiliar, meet Michael Hixon (above, right). He's a diver from Team USA, he's 22 years old, and he's the spitting image of Zac FREAKING Efron!

TBH, he's giving us serious High School Musical vibes in this picture (below)! 




2 years ago I made the best decision of my life, to come dive for this man. Just finished up my Olympic experience, and although not the final we had hoped for, I'm grateful to have had the opportunity to be in the fight. Thank you for everything you've done for me. This is only the beginning. #hoosiers #teamusaA photo posted by Michael Hixon (@hixon4) on Aug 16, 2016 at 6:02pm PDT


And since the Baywatch star watching the 2016 Games and living it up in Rio, he couldn't pass up the opportunity to meet his sports star twin!
The brunette babe posed alongside the silver medalist, and shared the picture proof on Instagram Thursday probably just so he could make us all drool!
Ch-ch-check it out (below)!

But uncanny facial similarities aside, there is a very good chance these two could have actually been separated at birth. How ELSE do you explain the 28-year-old's natural ability to pull off a standing backflip into the open ocean:
