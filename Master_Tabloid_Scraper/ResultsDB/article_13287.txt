ICYMI, The Rock publicly slammed one of his unnamed male costars, calling the anonymous actor a "candy ass" and "chicken sh*t" in a social media rant.
Sources later revealed that the 49-year-old was the target of the tirade.
And now, it seems as though the XXX star is letting bygones be bygones in a new IG post. The California native shared a sweet snap of his daughter, Pauline, and had nothing but positive things to say about "every single one" of his costars.
Ch-ch-check it out (below)! 




Came home from filming with my fair share of stunt related injuries. You know I will always push and put myself on the line to make something immortal and worthy. Waiting for me was an incredible family filled weekend. I am proud of the entire team for making Fast 8 a reality. Though intense at times, I am grateful to the entire castâ€¦ Every single one of them we brought on has shined because of their talent and commitment. Always count your blessings. #peoplefeeltruth #allloveA photo posted by Vin Diesel (@vindiesel) on Aug 15, 2016 at 2:14pm PDT
