That's because one of the cyclists looks almost identical to Prince William's lady love!
Seriously. Kate and Pauline Ferrand-Prevot could have totally been separated at birth! Sure, the acclaimed athlete is blonde and the British royal is brunette… but when that helmet is on can you even tell??
And yeah, Pauline is French and Miz Middleton is from the UK. But while their hair hues are different, that bone structure is SO similar!
They even have dimples in the exact same spot!
Do U see the resemblance?!
