Pills May Have Contributed To Former WWE Star's Death/n

So terrible.
Former WWW star Gertrude "Luna" Vachon was found dead in her Florida home on Friday morning.
Police found crushed Oxycodone pills and a snorting straw in her kitchen.  There were also "multiple prescription bottles and miscellaneous unsecured pills" in the master bedroom.
Luna's mother found her body and she says that her daughter "often appeared 'medicated' as she suffered from several wrestling injuries."
Sad, sad.
