Vin Diesel recently became a father for the third time, welcoming a daughter with his girlfriend earlier this month. On Monday, the action star revealed on The Today Show the special name he gave his baby girl.

“While I was in the hospital, the name that I will give you, is, I named her Pauline,” Diesel, 47, told Natalie Morales. The actor and Mexican model Paloma Jimenez are already proud parents to daughter Hania, 6, and son Vincent, 4.
“There’s no other person that I was thinking about as I was cutting this umbilical cord. I just thought, I knew he was there. And it felt like, you know, a way to keep his memory a part of my family and a part of my world.”
