Now, these ladies each get to traveling to NYC to record an Avon Voices anthem written by acclaimed song writer Diane Warren! The songs will make their debut at the Avon Foundation for Women Annual Gala on November 2, where the winner of Avon Voices will be announced!
Joe Billone, Vice President, Global Representative Branding & Communications, Avon Products, Inc. mentioned:
“We are so proud of the 10 Finalists who truly embody women’s empowerment and while there will only be two official winners of the talent search, all of our global Contenders have felt as though they’ve already won, having been on this once-in-a-lifetime journey with Avon Voices.”
