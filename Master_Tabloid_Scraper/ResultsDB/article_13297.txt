No, You Didn't See Princess Kate in Rio – She Just Has an Olympic Twin!/n
Did this past weekend’s women’s road race have you wondering if Princess Kate leads a double life as an Olympic cyclist?
There’s a reason why. 
No, she’s not in Rio herself, but Kate does have a separated-at-birth doppelganger competing in the Olympics for the French cycling team: Pauline Ferrand-Prevot.

And although she’s a decade younger than the royal, the facial similarity between Ferrand-Prevot, 24, and Kate, 34, is uncanny. 
Both have the same dimples, the same lynx-like eyes perched regally above perfect smiles from pristine teeth – okay, the French biker is a dirty blonde and Kate, as we know, is a brunette. But hair colors aside, that scary-similar bone structure can’t be denied.

Pauline Ferrand-Prevot in Rio
Though Kate is typically the one making headlines, Ferrand-Prevot has already made quite a name for herself  in her sport. She’s the first person ever in the history of cycling to hold the World Road title, World Cyclo-Cross title and World Mountain Bike title at the same time.
And regardless of how the French cyclist fares on two wheels down in Rio, if there’s ever to be a Olympic event for athletes with a royal resemblance, we’d bet Ferrand-Prevot would prove to be a gold medal winner.
