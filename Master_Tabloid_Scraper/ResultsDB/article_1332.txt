Jennifer Lawrence to the rescue!
While in New York City doing press for The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1, Lawrence found Katherine Heigl’s dog in the hallway of her hotel. Heigl was on The Today Show this morning and she talked about the incident that happened just yesterday! Check out the video to hear Heigl tell the story!
Heigl is currently in NYC doing press for her new NBC show, State of Affairs. Both Lawrence and Heigl were staying in the same hotel when one of Heigl’s dogs, Gertrude, got out into the hallway.
She revealed on The Today Show, “Oh my gosh this is so embarrassing. Okay well, I had to use the facilities, so I went to my mom’s room, because a lot of people were in my room. And I guess when I got out, (Gertrude) gets really upset and nervous if she can’t see me or hear me. So she must’ve snuck out of my room, and suddenly we just hear this voice in the hallway like, ‘Whose dog is this? Somebody lost their dog!’ And I’m like, ‘Mom, it’s probably Gertrude!’ So my mom goes out and it’s Jennifer Lawrence, has my dog.”
Did Heigl get to thank Lawrence for finding her dog? Unfortunately, she didn’t get a chance! Heigl explained, “I was so mad because I was like, ‘Wait, I love her and I didn’t get to meet her!'”
You can hear all of the details in the video above! Skip ahead to 4:00 for the story! Did Lawrence save the day or what? It’s too bad Heigl didn’t get to meet her!
Plus, you can see The Hunger Games: Mockingjay when it hits theaters on Nov. 21. You can see Heigl in State of Affairs when it premieres on Nov. 17!
