Lee Garrett, one of the many men vying for Rachel Lindsay’s affections on this season of The Bachelorette, is under fire after after racist and offensive tweets from 2015 and 2016 were uncovered on his personal Twitter account.

“What’s the difference between the NAACP and the KKK? Wait for it…One has the sense of shame to cover their racist a** faces,” the 30-year-old singer/songwriter allegedly wrote.
He also tweeted link to a story titled, “thousands sign petition to recognize #BlackLivesMatter as terrorist group after Dallas.”

In several screenshots captured by fans, Garrett also took aim at women and lashed out at feminists. “When is the last time you actually saw a pretty feminist? There is a reason for this,” one tweet read.
“Sorry ladies, I can’t make the world not exist to fulfill you needs in the self appreciation/self worth department. #guyissues,” he tweeted. The Nashville native also claimed he found his “calling” when he discovered meninists, a group of people who are against feminism.
