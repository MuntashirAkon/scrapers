 Who knew Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher were such big fans of The Bachelorette?  The married couple appeared on Monday night’s episode (May 29, 2017) to help Rachel Lindsay narrow the field in her search for a husband. Surprisingly the competing men, the parents-of-two challenged the suitors to complete an obstacle course in “husbandry” — which included tasks like diaper-changing, place-setting, and vacuuming — to see if they’re hubby material. “We came on because we love Rachel,” Kunis, 33, said. “When we found out that she was gonna be the bachelorette we freaked out and called the producers and asked if we could help her find a husband.”

Kutcher, 39, added the show became his “guilty pleasure” after discovering his striking resemblance to Jared Haibon from Kailtyn Bristowe’s season. He quipped, “Ever since there was some guy named Jared, who apparently looked like me, we’ve been watching the show.” “I don’t think Rachel’s guy is in this group,” he teased, before gushing about his own wife. “Someone’s definitely getting laid tonight!” Kunis responded.
“You’ve gotta plug in your vacuum!” Mila Kunis literally ROTFL! (If the ground is an acceptable substitute for “floor.”)#TheBachelorette pic.twitter.com/WQBuK5JPKp — The Bachelorette (@BacheloretteABC) May 30, 2017
