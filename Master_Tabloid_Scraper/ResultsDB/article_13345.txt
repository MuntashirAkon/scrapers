The actor also shared the happy news on Instagram, writing, “Our #MorrisonAdventures have been so epic together, but they have only just begun!! We will have a new addition to the family and I’m blown away by the unconditional love that I already possess for this child. I have such a clear vision of the Father that I want to be, but the perfection lies in the balance and teamwork that Renee and I have cultivated. Now, we simply wait with open arms….”
