Hear that noise? That’s the sound of Nick Viall kicking himself after he saw this new Bachelorette promo starring this season’s leading woman, Rachel Lindsay.

The clip begins with Lindsay strutting her way through rose petals in strappy black stilettos. She wears a red, flowing Randi Rahm gown with a bustling train that resembles the signature flower of the series and twirls as more petals fall from the ceiling. When Lindsay is handed a rose, she throws it down in disgust and it shatters into a million piece on the floor. To this, we say, “That’s our girl!”
