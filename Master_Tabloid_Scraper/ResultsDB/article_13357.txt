Here comes the (almost) bride! The Bachelorette's Rachel Lindsay accepted a proposal—from contestant Bryan Abasolo—and is now wearing white. Go figure.The reality star's LWD (little white dress) has some pretty sweet details like a small frayed trim outlining the waist, neckline and skirt of the Cinq à Sept number. More exciting than its femme features?
