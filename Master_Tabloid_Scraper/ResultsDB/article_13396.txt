Ex-'Big Brother' Stars Downplay Butt Poking Among Roommates/nRachel Reilly and Meg Maley ﻿are walking contradictions -- on the one hand, they say a man pulling unwanted butt poking's a big deal ... but a woman doing it just ain't. We got the ex- "Big Brother " stars Wednesday in WeHo and asked about Jessica Graf going around and checking her roommates' oil by sneak poking their buttholes and vaginas ... what some consider sexual assault.  Rachel -- who won season 13 of 'BB' -- doles out some twisted logic ... it's no big deal since they're roommates and it's just a game. But she has a qualifier ... if a man does it to a woman it's a whole different Oprah.  We also got CBS honcho Les Moonves out at Craig's Wednesday night, and he pled ignorance ... which puts him in the doghouse with wife Julie Chen!/n
