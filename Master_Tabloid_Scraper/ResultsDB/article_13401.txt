'Bachelorette' Rachel Lindsay Has a 187-Foot Make Out Session While Rappelling/nRachel Lindsay is putting herself out there for love on  "The Bachelorette " -- literally, she's hanging 187 feet in the air for it ... where make out sessions are NOT off limits. Rachel went rappelling off a super high structure in Oslo, Norway with suave contestant Bryan Abasolo during Monday night's episode -- and on the way down, they took a break to suck a little face ... very, very loudly. Bryan's built a rep this season as one to smack his lips while kissing Rachel ... but as you can see, she's pretty into it. And into him, for that matter./n
