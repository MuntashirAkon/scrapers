DeMario Jackson Wouldn't Have Hooked Up with Corinne If He Knew She Had a Boyfriend/nDeMario Jackson says he wouldn't have hooked up with Corinne Olympios if he knew she had a BF ... this from the guy who got kicked off  "The Bachelorette " for having a GF. DeMario was out Sunday in L.A. when a pap asked if he would have done what he did in the pool with Corinne if he'd known? DeMario says absolutely not. It's interesting though -- DeMario was booted from Rachel Lindsay's 'Bachelorette' season and got made into a villain after he was caught lying about his then-girlfriend ... who isn't a big fan of his to this day. DeMario's aware of the irony here ... or at least he seems to be./n
