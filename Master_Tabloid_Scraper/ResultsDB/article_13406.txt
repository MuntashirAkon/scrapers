DeMario Jackson's Ex-Girlfriend Hates Him But Swears He'd Never Take Advantage of Drunk Corinne/nDeMario Jackson's ex-gf -- the woman who exposed him as a villain on national TV -- is actually coming to his defense in the Corinne Olympios scandal ... but she has a strange way of doing it. Lexi Thexton claims DeMario is nothing more than a  "30-year-old man child " who parties way too much -- but also says there's no way the  "Bachelor in Paradise " star would knowingly take advantage of a drunk woman ... as Corinne insinuated when she declared she's a victim. For Lexi to say anything supportive about her ex is a big deal. Mind you, she also called him a  "sh***y guy " who's completely self-absorbed ... among a list of other insults. She did offer a theory about what really happened with Corinne -- and strongly believes it's more about 2 people getting too drunk. For non-'Bachelorette' viewers ... Lexi made a surprise appearance on the show, calling out DeMario for trying to woo Rachel Lindsay﻿ while still dating her. He got booted off the show that very same episode./n
