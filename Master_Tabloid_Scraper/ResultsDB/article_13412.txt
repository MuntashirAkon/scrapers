Girl Who Survived One Month In Woods Reportedly Found Naked In Dirt, High On Meth/n
The woman who survived one month in the woods was reportedly found naked, scratched and bruised near in a wooded area in Alabama, 25 days after she last spoke to her parents, RadarOnline.com has learned.
Lisa Theris, 25, who claimed she survived her time in the woods by eating nothing but mushrooms, berries and muddy water, was likely just high on meth when she went missing, authorities have said to DailyMail.com. The two men – Manley Davis and Randall Oswald – who were with her were so “geeked out” that they believed she was dead, and actually blamed each other for her murder. One of them even claimed the other shot her in the head and buried her in the wooded area!

After the claim “We did a lot of ghost-hunting,” Bullock County Sheriff Raymond Rodgers exclusively told DailyMail.
Divers and cadaver dogs were reportedly sent out to search for bodies.
The two men – who clearly lied about the murder, since Theris is alive – are both being held on separate burglary charges. Theris allegedly refused to participate in a robbery with them the day of her disappearance. She too, however, had a stint in jail before the incident.

Theris is currently recovering from the bizarre incident back home with her family in Louisville.
