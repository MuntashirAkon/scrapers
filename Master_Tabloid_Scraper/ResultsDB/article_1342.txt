Nicole Kidman underestimates Robert Pattinson's rabid Twilight fan base.If you haven't heard by now, the Oscar winner is likely replacing her bestie Naomi Watts to star opposite Pattinson in Queen of the Desert, a period piece about British writer, traveler, archeologist and spy Gertrude Bell."That's OK, I'll be ready," Kidman told me about the Twi-fans when I caught up with her Variety's Power of Women event on Friday. "I think they'll have a tough time finding us over there in Morocco, won't they?"Kidman did admit she still isn't officially attached to the project. "It's not all signed, sealed and delivered," she said. "Butâ€¦it's certainly in rapid sort of motion."

E! News was the first to tell you that Watts was stepping away from the Werner Herzog-directed film."It's still a way's off," she told us back in January 2012 at the Sundance Film Festival. "I don't know yet. Hopefully, it will happen. I just can't travel again right now because I did a lot of traveling last year. It's been a big year and it's time for me to be home with the kids."Pattinson is to play British Army officer T.A. Lawrence. Earlier this year, James Franco replaced Jude Law as the male led of the movie, British diplomat Henry Cadogan.

Kidman was honored by Variety for her work with the United Nations on women's rights.She said her mom first introduced her to fighting for women's equality."I've traveled all over the world and I feel I never do enough," Kidman said. "So I'm always pushing myself to do more, because it truly is something that can be changed."Check out more of our chat with Nicole in the video below.
