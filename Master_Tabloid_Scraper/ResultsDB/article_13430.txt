A source that was in attendance of the services yesterday in Riverside, Calif., tells Radar, “The funeral was more of a celebration of his life than it was a sad event.”
Among the 200 guests that were there to pay their respects were “several cast members from Everybody Love Raymond,” the source adds, referring to the hit sitcom that Sawyer, along with his twin brother Sullivan, and sister Madilyn, starred in from 1996 through 2005.
“No one spoke of the tragedy itself, but instead, shared stories from his miraculous life.”
According to People Sweeten’s mother, Elizabeth Gini, delivered an emotional eulogy that included, “Tell God, ‘Thank you’ for me.” /n
