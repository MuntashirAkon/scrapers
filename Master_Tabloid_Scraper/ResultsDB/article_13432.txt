Brandi Glanville Apologizes To Joanna Krupa As Their Smelly Vagina Feud Comes To An Official End!/n

It's all water under the, errr, vagina!
As we previously reported, Real Housewives vets Brandi Glanville and Joanna Krupa have officially buried their long-running feud as they've settled that pesky "smelly vagina" lawsuit. In case you need a refresher, Eddie Cibrian's ex (on more than one occasion) shared gossip that accused the 38-year-old model of having foul smelling lady bits. Understandably, Miz Krupa was pissed AF about the claims and hit the RHOBH alum with a defamation lawsuit.

Thankfully, this ridiculous drama is now over as the RHOM star withdrew her suit AND the Famously Single personality apologized to her former nemesis. Brandi APOLOGIZED?? Hell must've frozen over.
In a statement released by Krupa's attorney, Raymond J. Rafool, Brandi expressed: 
"I want to apologize to Joanna Krupa for the statements I have made about her. I regret ever making such statements about Joanna Krupa; I also certainly never intended my statements to be taken so seriously and out of proportion. I apologize as I never wanted my statements to affect Joanna Krupa's reputation and I wish her nothing but continued success in life."
That couldn't have been easy for Brandi. As for Joanna, she's clearly ready to move on with her life as she added in her own statement:
"I am moving on with my life considering all the changes that are happening to me this year. I am very happy with the settlement and have no regrets. I hope I inspired others to always speak up when they believe they are wronged and not allow it."
While we'd love more deets on the twosome's settlement, it's said those specifics are "confidential." Bummer.
Nonetheless, we're just happy this particular feud is O-V-E-R!
