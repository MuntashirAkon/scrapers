Usher Sued In NEW Lawsuit Claiming He Exposed ANOTHER Woman To Herpes!/n

WTF is going on with Usher's penis??
As we reported, in 2012, the singer allegedly paid $1.1 million to settle a lawsuit for spreading herpes to his former flame without disclosing his health status. The woman — a celebrity stylist — feels "that her health and body have been ruined" and "has suffered severe emotional distress and has been extremely depressed" as a result of the STD.

Fast forward to Friday, the 38-year-old is involved in ANOTHER lawsuit where the victim claims he recklessly exposed her to the virus!
According to TMZ, the new woman — identified as Jane Doe — says she had protected sex with the Love in This Club musician on April 16, 2017 at her home in Atlanta.
However, 12 days later, they hooked up again in a New Orleans hotel where they did NOT use protection. 
This month, after reading the aforementioned report, the mystery lady absolutely lost her shit! She is suing "U.R. IV" — Usher Raymond IV — for negligence, battery, and emotional distress, and is seeking at least $10 million.
It's important to note that she does not say she is infected, but feels she was "exposed" to the STD, and would not have hooked up with The Voice judge if she knew about his sexual history.
Usher has yet to comment.
