Usher Allegedly Paid Over $1 Million To Settle Lawsuit About Spreading Herpes!/n

This is a surprising allegation!
Radar Online is reporting they uncovered Usher was at the center of a herpes lawsuit — which he allegedly settled — after it was claimed he spread the virus to his partner at the time.
Per the legal documents, it's said the singer didn't disclose his STD to his celebrity stylist flame, but continued to engage in unprotected sex with her!

Usher reportedly paid $1.1 million when he settled with her in court back in 2012.
The "ruined" victim, who remains unnamed, expressed concern after a "greenish discharge" was discovered from him. She explained in docs she did ask the star about any diseases, but was apparently told he tested negative: 

"Believing Raymond's statements that it had been nothing and cleared up, [she] continued her relationship."
Usher is said to have later admitted he was infected with herpes as the settlement expressed:

"In a series of telephone conversations and online chat sessions, [Usher] has apologized for infecting [her] and told her he would take care of things."
Yikes! Sadly for his partner, she felt "that her health and body have been ruined," and "has suffered severe emotional distress and has been extremely depressed … knowing there is no cure."
The stylist suffered a "fever of 100 degrees, chills, headache, and aches and pains" when she first had symptoms. Additionally, she "also developed lesions and blisters in her vagina." A doctor diagnosed her with herpes.
Still, there is no confirmation on whether the performer was at the center of this lawsuit.
It's horrifying if true though!
