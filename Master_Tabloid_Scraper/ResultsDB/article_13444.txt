The Game claims to have slept with all three Kardashians.
The rapper released a new song called “Sauce” on Saturday (Aug. 13, 2016) in which he crudely boasts about having “f–ked three Kardashians.” Teaming up with DJ Khaled, Game raps, “I used to f**k bitches that Usher Raymond passed off/ Then I f–ked three Kardashians, hold that thought.”
Even though it seems like the lyrics are just lyrics, Game was previously linked to Khloé Kardashian following her split from ex-husband Lamar Odom. However, he later denied they were ever romantically involved, while revealing that he has dated Kim. “Those are just rumors,” he said at the time. “It’s funny man ’cause me and Khloé we’re cool.”
