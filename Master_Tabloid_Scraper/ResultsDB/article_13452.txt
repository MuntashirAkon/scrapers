The tofu turkey lives on!
Stopping by PEOPLE Now, Patricia Heaton, 58, took a look back at one of the greatest Thanksgiving scenes on the former hit show Everybody Loves Raymond.
“Fortunately we had four days of rehearsal where we could get all the giggles out,” she admitted of the hilarious holiday scene.
“But you know what, it’s so easy to hold your laugh because you’re enjoying the audience’s response and you know whats coming and you go, ‘Oh, the audience is going to love this when it comes.’ So, it’s in your best interest to hold your laugh back,” she added.

The former TV mom went on to add that she does keep in touch with the old cast, specially her former TV husband, Ray Romano, 58.
“I just had coffee with Ray and Anna [Romano] a couple weeks ago,” Heaton said. “Ray has a great Labor Day party every year that we all go to. Unfortunately for the occasion, we all got together when Doris [Roberts] passed away, everybody had dinner together.”

She continued to say, “But it’s a great group of people.”
