Brad Garrett: Everybody Loves Raymond Costar Sawyer Sweeten's Suicide Was 'Devastating'/n
Sawyer Sweeten’s loved ones came together at his funeral over the weekend, saying goodbye to the 19-year-old who took his own life in April.   
 Now, his TV uncle is speaking out about the tragedy.  
 “The Sweeten family is obviously our family. This was devastating news,” Brad Garrett, who played Robert on Everybody Loves Raymond, said Tuesday on The View. “We grew up with these children on the set. It’s been hard. They’re an amazing family, and our love goes out to them, of course. The loss of a child – nothing worse.” 
Sweeten’s twin brother and older sister starred with him on the CBS sitcom.   
In an open letter shared with PEOPLE, their mother, Elizabeth, paid tribute to her late son’s “room-lighting smile” and “amazing heart.”
