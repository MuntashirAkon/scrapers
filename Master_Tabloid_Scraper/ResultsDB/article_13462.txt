Garrett's "Raymond" Redux?/n
     Brad Garrett may find out how many viewers love Robert.          The Everybody Loves Raymond costar told the Emmy press corps on Sunday night that talks were on for a spinoff series to star his sad-sack character.           CBS, the network home to Raymond, confirmed discussions, but not a deal, to various media outlets on Monday.          To the New York Times, Garrett said the proposed show would reunite him with his TV wife, Monica Horan, and prime-time in-laws, Fred Willard, Georgia Engel and Chris Elliott.          The storyline would find Garrett's character, New York City cop Robert Barone, faced with "major logistical, geographical changes--he will be leaving the state," the actor told the newspaper.          Behind the scenes, Raymond creator and executive producer Phil Rosenthal would be in charge of the spinoff, the Hollywood trades reported. Rosenthal is the real-life husband of Horan.          If a deal is struck, the new show could premiere as early as next fall, reports said. Raymond ended its nine-season run in May.           Garrett and Raymond were big winners at the 57th Annual Emmy Awards--the former stand-up took his third Outstanding Supporting Comedy Actor trophy; the sitcom, its second for Outstanding Comedy Series.          Backstage at the awards show, Raymond star Ray Romano joked with Garrett about the proposed spinoff.          "By the way, good luck, and if that does happen and you need the brother to make a guest appearance, I'm more than happy to help," Romano said, per the Times.           "Yeah," Garrett deadpanned. "We're going to recast that."         Two years ago, Garrett was not recast but outright eliminated from the premiere episode of Raymond's eighth-season opener. At the time, the actor was engaged in a contract holdout with CBS. In the end, the sides kissed and made up, and the network paid up, giving Garrett what was described as a "substantial pay hike."         Should he rate a new Robert Barone payday, Garrett, 45, would be following in the footsteps of Kelsey Grammer, Matt LeBlanc and Jamie Farr, to name three sitcom stars who transplanted their alter egos to all-new shows.          The move worked out well for Grammer, who enjoyed even greater success as Dr. Frasier Crane on Frasier than he did on Cheers. The move has not worked out that well for LeBlanc, whose Joey Tribiani seems to be slumming on Joey compared to the high-rent days of Friends.          And as far Farr? Suffice to say, After M.A.S.H. was not kind to his Klinger.
