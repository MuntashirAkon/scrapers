"Raymond": Show Me the Love/n
     Want more Raymond? Shell out more Benjamins.          Ray Romano and Everybody Loves Raymond creator Phil Rosenthal are reportedly close to inking a ninth season deal with CBS if the price is right.          The pair had previously expressed concern about running out of good material.           Artistic integrity, schmegrity.          According to Industry buzz, Romano and Rosenthal have agreed to stick around for another season, albeit shorter than the standard 22-episode schedule.          The duo are looking for a swan song deal similar to that of the cast of Friends but are allegedly waiting to see if the Eye network will pony up more money for fewer episodes.          The odds look good. Raymond is the network's top-rated laffer and the cornerstone of its Monday night lineup.          Speaking to reporters Tuesday, CBS head honcho Les Moonves described himself as "very guardedly optimistic."           "We need Raymond," Moonves said. "We want it back."          A decision is due in the next few days. The show has only three episodes left to tape and a series finale script has been written in case negotiations fall through.          There's also talk of a Brad Garrett spinoff, but no decision will be made until Raymond's fate is determined, according to Moonves.          Indeed, all involved are eager to give Raymond a proper sendoff that's not overshadowed by this season's fanfare farewells to Friends, Frasier and the recently departed Sex and the City.          The only sticking point seems to be money. Both Rosenthal and Romano are reportedly looking to boost their paychecks. But will CBS bite? Already, the actor is the highest paid TV star around, inking a $50 million deal for the current season.          And don't rule out the family's reaction. Costars Garrett, Patricia Heaton, Doris Roberts and Peter Boyle have already protested about being underpaid.           If word gets out that there's more money to be made, CBS may be forced to confront one angry clan.
