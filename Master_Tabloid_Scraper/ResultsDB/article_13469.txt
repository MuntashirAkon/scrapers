CBS Renews "Raymond," "Amy"/n
It would appear that everybody does love Raymond, or at least the people that really count--the top brass at CBS.        Everybody Loves Raymond was one of eight series CBS picked up for the 2000-01 season, the network announced yesterday.      Raymond will be coming back along with sitcoms The King of Queens and Becker, established dramas JAG (which has held its ground against Who Wants to Be a Millionaire), Touched by an Angel, Nash Bridges and Walker, Texas Ranger, as well as the net's top-rated rookie drama Judging Amy.        Amy--so far the only first-year CBS show to get picked up for another full season--is the network's only hit among shows introduced this season.          CBS executives have yet to pass judgment on the critically acclaimed new drama Now and Again, but the Hollywood Reporter says the show is likely to be renewed, as is another first-year drama Family Law and old-timer Diagnosis Murder.             CBS is reportedly on the fence with freshman series Ladies Man and the Saturday-night dramas Martial Law and Early Edition.            Meanwhile, the fate of struggling dramas City of Angels and Chicago Hope will probably depend on their performance in the May sweeps, along with Bill Cosby's Kids Say the Darndest Things.  The one show that likely won't make the cut: ratings-starved mobster drama Falcone.            So far this season, CBS is almost head to head with NBC for second place behind Millionaire-powered ABC in household ratings, with NBC just barely inching ahead. The full 2000-01 schedule for CBS, NBC, ABC, et al. will be announced in May.
