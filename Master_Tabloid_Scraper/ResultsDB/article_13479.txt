Â Turns out ... a sex tape featuring Usher and ex-wife Tameka Raymond was on one of the laptops.Someone tried selling the tape shortly thereafter but no one would touch it. But in the last few days the tape has resurfaced and someone is trying to hawk it.Whoever's trying to sell it is not going to adult film companies ... there's no way they would touch it because they would never get a sign-off from Usher.
