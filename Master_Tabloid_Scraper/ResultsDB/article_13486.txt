Raymond Felton Divorce -- HE CHEATED ON ME ... NBA Star's Wife Alleges/nNew York Knicks player Raymond Felton committed ADULTERY during his marriage ... so says his estranged wife in divorce docs obtained by TMZ Sports. Ariane Raymondo Felton -- the same woman who ratted Raymond out to the cops about his illegal firearm -- filed docs last month in a New York court seeking to end their 18-month marriage. But in the docs, Ariane penciled in that she's divorcing Felton because of  "adultery. " Ariane doesn't go into detail about the adultery allegations ... but in the docs, she does request the judge throw out their pre-nup. It seems she wants the prenup tossed out on the count of the alleged cheating, but she doesn't explain why. Ariane is seeking  "maintenance " -- which is essentially alimony. She also wants Raymond to finish paying for the last two years of her law school education at Fordham University./n
