Steve Aoki: Fan Sues for Eating It On Piece of Cake/nSteve Aoki's signature cake-in-the-face toss just got him sued by a Las Vegas clubgoer, who didn't get nailed by a cake ... but says it still took him out. Raymond Collins says Aoki's flying pastry during a March set at Hakkasan made him bite it so hard he sustained a serious head injury. In the suit, he says he literally did a slip and fall on the cake after it landed on the ground.   Normally, it's an EDM badge of honor to get nailed by Steve, but Collins says the cake turned into a disaster for him. He claims he's lost income, and wants damages for mental suffering, loss of enjoyment of life, and more.   We've reached out to Steve's reps for his side of things. So much for just desserts. /n
