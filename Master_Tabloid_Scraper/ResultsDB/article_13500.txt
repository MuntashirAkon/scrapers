Who’s The Baby Daddy? Vienna Girardi’s Ex Admits They Had Sex Around Conception/n
Vienna Girardi announced that she’s pregnant with twins earlier this month, but who’s the father of her new additions? The former Bachelor star’s ex-boyfriend revealed if he believes he’s the father exclusively to RadarOnline.com.
Girardi, 31, dated ex-boyfriend Todd Allen for three years before they split in November. Although they reunited in March for the hookup, he claims he is not the father of her twins.
“I think it’s ridiculous that she’s telling people it’s mine,” Allen told Radar. “Her and I hooked up a few nights prior to her doctor’s estimated date of conception range.”

But a source close to Girardi insists the twins are his.
Girardi was engaged to The Bachelor’s Jake Pavelka in March 2010. They called off their engagement in June of that year.
She then went on to date Bachelorette contestant Kasey Kahl while appearing on Bachelor Pad. They ended their romance in 2011.

Girardi has remained out of the spotlight since the split.
“Truthfully, I don’t watch reality TV because I understand now that reality TV isn’t reality,” she told Radar in 2013. “Reality TV stars have a very short television life, so make sure you have a back up and know when to step away from the spotlight and have a normal life.”
