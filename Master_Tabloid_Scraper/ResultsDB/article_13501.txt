Bachelor villain Vienna Girardi announced that she’s going to be a mom – of twins!
Jake Pavelka’s ex-fiancée, who also romanced Kasey Kahl on Bachelor in Paradise 2, posted a sonogram picture with two tiny babies with the message “Twice the blessing. Twice the fun,” and a note for Twin A and Twin B.
She and Pavelka got engaged on the ABC show but broke up a mere three months later.

Girardi and her boyfriend, Todd Allen, got engaged in summer 2016, after they had been dating for three years.
She shunned her television past in an exclusive interview with RadarOnline.com, saying “Truthfully, I don’t watch reality TV because I understand now that reality TV isn’t reality.”
“Don’t take anything to heart,” she said. “No one really knows who you are and you have to understand that isn’t just a TV show. It’s entertainment. Make the most of the experience then move on.”
