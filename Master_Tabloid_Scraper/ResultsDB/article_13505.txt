Omarosa Manigault Glows In Gorgeous Wedding Gown/n
President Donald Trump’s most famous “Apprentice” protégé, Omarosa Manigault, is now an honest woman!
Omarosa tied the knot with Florida preacher John Allen Newman at – where else? –
the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., on April 8.
The bride — who rose to fame playing a villainess on “The Apprentice” in 2008 and is now a White House aide —
glowed in a $25,000 crystal- and sequin-embellished pink wedding gown and matching veil with a 14-foot train.
She also wore a necklace borrowed from wealthy Trump donor Kelly Day of California.
Afterwards, guests gathered in the hotel lobby for a Champagne reception that featured –
again, what else? – Trump Sparkling Wine.
Bridegroom John gushed: “I am speechless.”
And the ecstatic bride exclaimed: “It was fantastic! We are blessed by God and thank Him for this gift.” /n
