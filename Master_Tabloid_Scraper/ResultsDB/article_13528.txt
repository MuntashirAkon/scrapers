Kourtney Kardashian is fine with Scott Disick galavanting around town with a different woman every night.

Amid rumors Scott has fallen off the wagon again after a whirlwind trip to Cannes, sources close to the couple claim Kourtney is tired of worrying about her ex and chosen to stay out of his business — especially when it comes to his multiple flings with Ella Ross, Bella Thorne, and Chloe Bartoli.
“There’s no malice between them,” an insider tells Entertainment Tonight of Disick and Kardashian’s relationship. “They’re not together. Kourtney is not losing any sleep over Scott’s behavior.”
“The endless amount of blonde women coming through the door isn’t anything new,” the source adds. “None of it is Kourtney’s business.”

Those familiar with the situation also say Scott is trying his best to be a co-parent to his kids: Mason, 7, Penelope, 4, and Reign, 2.
“Kourtney would never forbid him from seeing the kids,” an insider shares. “If Scott wants to go on a two-week bender, that’s all his business. Whatever he wants to do, he can do.”
