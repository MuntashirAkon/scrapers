Kendall Jenner may be a catwalk pro, but don’t expect her to be an expert on a bike.

The 21-year-old model was cruising around in a vineyard with a film crew when she wiped out hard on her bicycle.
In a video shared by Khloé Kardashian, Jenner — outfitted with a large pink fur coat — was riding along a dust path before attempting to break with her feet. When she slipped on the gravel, she toppled over to the side and face-planted in the dirt.
A cameraman, presumably capturing footage for Keeping Up with the Kardashians, even ran over to assist the fallen starlet. (Not before capturing the whole thing on film, of course.)

Like a professional, Jenner laughed off her tumble as she laid on the floor.
“My work here is done,” big sis Kardashian wrote on Instagram. Savage!
