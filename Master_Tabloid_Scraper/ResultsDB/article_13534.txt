Khloé Kardashian’s latest ad campaign with Protein World is receiving some heat.

The advert — which features the reality star in a skimpy swimsuit with the texts “Can You Keep Up With A KARDASHIAN?” — has been accused of body-shaming women and promoting an unhealthy lifestyle. According to U.K.’s Advertising Standards Authority, 14 people have submitted complaints to the watchdog group claiming the ad was “socially irresponsible” and encouraged “an unhealthy and competitive approach to dieting.”

Ladies! Make sure you keep your self-esteem low by comparing yourself to women who have been massively Photoshopped! Thanks @ProteinWorld 😷 pic.twitter.com/4p5dyJArSO

However, despite the numerous complaints, the ASA has cleared the campaign and found the images to be “desirable and aspirational.”
“We did not consider that she appeared to be out of proportion or unhealthy,” a statement from the organization reads.
A day after the ad escaped a ban, Kardashian was seen catching a flight at the Los Angeles International Airport. Clad in a camouflage patterned jumpsuit, the Revenge Body host looked to be unfazed by the complaints as she made her way through the terminal.

In the past, Kardashian promoted Protein World using so-called candid photos of her sipping the company’s shakes from a branded tumbler. At the time, many fans pointed out the postings lacked Federal Trade Commission’s recommended #ad or #sponsor hashtags.
