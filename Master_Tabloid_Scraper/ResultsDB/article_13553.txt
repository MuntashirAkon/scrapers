Lily Allen Snaps Back/n
Don't expect Lily Allen to smile for the cameras.The Brit pop brat was formally arrested Thursday for allegedly attacking a paparazzo that got too close as she left a nightclub back in March.Allen, 22, visited a London police station with her lawyer, where she posed for mug shots and provided fingerprints and a DNA sample.She was released on bail and ordered to return for questioning in late July, a police spokesperson said (though, per policy, the singer was notÂ identified by name).Allen's troubles reportedly began as she and her boyfriend exited the Wardour Club in London's West End at around 1:30 a.m. on Mar. 13.The feisty chanteuse was apparently unhappy about all the flashbulbs aimed in her direction and reportedly aimed a karate kick at one shutterbug and punched another photog in the face.Police were called, but by the time they arrived on the scene, Allen had already left.Photographer Kevin Rush, 43, complained to police that Allen "went berserk," according to reports in the British press.He claimed to have suffered a cut on his nose as a result of the alleged attack, though he did not require any medical treatment.Ever since she arrived on the international music scene in a big way last year, Allen has made it clear that she's not interested in the kind of fame enjoyed by the Paris-Lindsay-Britney set."I don't want to be a celebrity, I am a singer, I write songs, that's it," she wrote on her MySpace page earlier this month.To that end, she claims that she tries to avoid places popular with the famous folk with the hope of preserving her privacy."I don't sleep and take drugs with famous people (I have a boyfriend I've been with for nearly 3 years), I don't go to film premieres. I don't go shopping in the paparazzi hotspots, so please leave me alone," she wrote on her MySpace page.As at least one paparazzo has learned, disobeying her wishes can prove hazardous to one's health.
