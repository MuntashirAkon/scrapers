Lily Allen Clams Up/n
Lily Allen has made the uncharacteristic decision to hold her tongue.The "Smile" singer confirmed on her MySpace page that she has canceled the bulk of her upcoming U.S. tour dates in May and June, stating that she has been disappointed with the caliber of her recent live performances."I am tired, but more than that I don't think I have been giving my best performances recently," Allen wrote. "I have been getting really drunk because I've been so nervous about doing bad shows, and I don't want people spending money on going to see a show that isn't the best it could be."Allen will still play Coachella on Apr. 29 and Bonnaroo on June 15, as well as dates in New York and Los Angeles. She is also slated to perform on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno on Tuesday and the Ellen DeGeneres Show on Wednesday.The 21-year-old singer categorically denied that she was suffering from any of the malaises commonly known to affect young starlets."I am not falling apart at the seems [sic], I am not suffering with exhaustion, I am not pregnant, and I am not going to rehab," she clarified.However, after touring in support of her hit debut album, Alright, Still, for a year, Allen has apparently had enough of life on the road.Concerts in cities including Boston, Denver, Chicago, Detroit and Dallas were axed from her agenda, but will be rescheduled later in the year, her rep said.Allen plans to use her newfound free time to work on her second album, which she claimed to be "beyond excited about.""I am itching to get back in the studio to start recording these great new songs, to keep things fresh for the audience and for myself," she said in a statement.It's safe to say that being fresh is one of the defining characteristics of Allen's personality.Since making her debut on the music scene last year, the cheeky British pop import has become known for her willingness to speak her mind about her famous peers, usually in a less than complimentary fashion.Among those who have been the subject of an Allen tongue-lashing are Paris Hilton, Sienna Miller, David and Victoria Beckham and Bob Geldof, to name a few. She once referred to Madonna as "the most overrated person in pop history," and has suggested that troubled Babyshambles frontman Pete Doherty should "be exterminated."However, Allen has claimed that she does not actually mean any harm with her barbed remarks. "I just can't keep my mouth shut," she told the New York Times last August. "I don’t really mean to offend anyone. I think I say things that, if I weren't in the public eye, no one would bat an eyelash at."
