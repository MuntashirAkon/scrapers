Post Malone on Iverson: BIG3 Knew What It Signed Up For/nAllen Iverson's never been a choir boy -- and that's why Ice Cube and the BIG3 shouldn't have been shocked when he blew off a game last month in Dallas, so says Post Malone.  Of course, Post is the rapper behind  "White Iverson " -- and has said A.I. was one of his heroes growing up. He also knows Iverson has a history of doing whatever the hell he wants, whenever he wants.   "He's a wild boy, " Malone says ...  "You can never stop him. " The BIG3 suspended Iverson 1 game for the no-show -- but does anyone really think it'll detour Allen from doing it again?  /n
