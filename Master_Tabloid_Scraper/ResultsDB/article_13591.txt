“Everyone is surprised over this because they were such close friends, but Jen knew that it had to be someone really close to her that was talking — and found out it was Chelsea!”
Though Aniston seems like everyone’s best friend, she can turn nasty, the source added.
According to the insider, “When Jennifer found out, she flipped!”
As Radar previously reported, the 48-year-old former Friends star even ordered her longtime publicist, Stephen Huvane, to drop Handler after the feud.
