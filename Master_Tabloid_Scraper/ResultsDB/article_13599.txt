Did Mel B’s Hubby Get The Nanny PREGNANT?/n
Just like real life, Mel B ’s divorce battle with Stephen Belafonte has become a threesome.
The “America’s Got Talent” judge is being sued by former nanny Lorraine Gilles,
who Mel B claims had an affair with Belafonte, got pregnant,
had an abortion and has control over sex tapes involving the former Spice Girl.
Mel B admits she, her hubby and the nanny engaged in threesomes,
but the others crossed the line by having twosome sex without her.
Stay tuned… /n
