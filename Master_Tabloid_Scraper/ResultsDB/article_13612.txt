She may only be 13 months old, but Luna Stephens is already hanging out with some heavy-hitters.

The daughter of Chrissy Teigen and John Legend was given the honor of throwing out the first pitch at the Seattle Mariners game in Safeco Field on Tuesday (June 6, 2017).
Clad in a baseball jersey customized with her very own name, the tiny tot looked absolutely adorable as she joined her parents on the home plate. (Come on, did you really think she could throw from the mound?)

“Proud papa #LunasFirstTour,” John — who is currently on the road with his family to support his fifth studio album, Darkness and Light — wrote on Instagram.
The “Love Me Now” crooner later joined his wife and baby girl in the dugout, where Luna tried to snack on some gum like a true baseball player.
“Mommy and daddy posing. Luna stealing the Mariners’ bubble gum,” he captioned the sweet pic.

Little Luna celebrated her first birthday in April with a special set visit to Chrissy’s Lip Sync Battle set. The happy trio took adorable family portraits together, before heading home to celebrate with a special cake decorated by the two proud parents.
“You are all the best parts of the both of us and I cannot believe how much has happened in you first 12 months of life,” Chrissy wrote about her daughter on Instagram. “We love you to the luna and back.”
