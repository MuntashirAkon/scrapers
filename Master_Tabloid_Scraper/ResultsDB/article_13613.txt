What does Hailey Baldwin have in common with Katy Perry, Taylor Swift, Miley Cyrus, Jessica Simpson and Jessica Alba? They’ve all held the top spot on Maxim’s annual Hot 100 list.

The 20-year-old, who was seen galavanting around France with pal Kendall Jenner this week, has just been named the publication’s sexiest woman of 2017.

While Baldwin is grateful for the honor, she tells the magazine, “At the end of the day, I don’t need people’s approval.”
“I honestly always feel like it was a little bit inevitable for me,” the blonde beauty, who is the daughter of actor Stephen Baldwin, says. “I was always the entertainer in my family. Everyone said, ‘That’s the one you got to watch out for.'”

Once known as the girl who was maybe, probably dating Justin Bieber, Baldwin eventually broken free from the label and since became a successful model with over 10 million Instagram followers and counting. Though she no longer wishes to be known as just some A-lister’s other half, she admits dating a celebrity is “definitely easier.”
“You’re never worried, ‘Are they only hanging out with me because they want to get attention or be seen?’ It can be weird for somebody who’s never been in this world before to be sucked into it,” she explains. “Dating is weird, but it’s so fun.”
