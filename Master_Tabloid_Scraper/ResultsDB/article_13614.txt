Mel B secured five nanny-free years with a new restraining order that will keep her at a distance.

Mel B’s lawyer was in court on Wednesday, armed with a declaration from the singer stating that her former nanny Lorraine Gilles has harassed her.
TMZ reports:
“She’s the nanny whom Mel claims had an affair with husband Stephen Belafonte and even got pregnant by him. Mel B also claims Gilles is holding her sex tapes hostage.
Mel claims Gilles has been verbally abusive toward her, disrespecting her and rolling her eyes during conversations.”
