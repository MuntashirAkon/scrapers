Mel B is back to the grind on America’s Got Talent with Heidi Klum and Tyra Banks.

Brown’s return to the set arrives just one day after her estranged husband, Stephen Belafonte, was granted supervised visitation with their biological daughter Madison.
According to People, Belafonte will get two, four-hour sessions each week at the Ness Counseling Center in Los Angeles. His request for visitation with Angel, Brown’s daughter with Eddie Murphy, was denied, and Brown’s temporary restraining order against him will remain in effect until their divorce hearing comes to an end.
Klum shared posts from their day of production, including this Boomerang of the three female costars strutting their stuff.

“Mel was back on set today,” a source told People on Monday (Apr. 24, 2017). “She was upbeat and all smiles.”
Brown and Belafonte’s former nanny, Lorraine Gilles, now alleges that she and Brown had an intimate relationship during her marriage to Belafonte. Gilles submitted photos of her and Brown paddleboarding together and posing with Belafonte for a close selfie as evidence in a defamation suit that she filed against Brown on Friday.
She states that Brown “seduced a naïve and a curious 18-year-old foreign exchange student … with alcohol, fame, and casual sex” while employing her as a nanny for her children.
