Nelsan Ellis was "original, funny, sardonic, risqué and brilliant," his former True Blood co-star Stephen Moyer says in a touching new tribute to the late star.Ellis' rep announced Saturday that the actor had died at age 39 after complications of heart failure. His death sent shockwaves on social media, especially since his True Blood character, the cook Lafayette, was so beloved.Many of his former co-stars, including Moyer, who played main vampire Bill on the HBO show, posted messages of condolence and online tributes to him. Moyer shared a longer one on Facebook early Sunday, describing one of his earliest memories of him.

Moyer said that in real life, "Nelsan was quiet, smart, thoughtful, warm and kind. A published playwright himself.""I think it would be fair to say that he taught all of us that intent and courage and fearlessness and freedom are the aspects of playing make-believe that spark the corners of the room where the dark is most impenetrable; to shine a light on those corners within ourselves is the very reason we go back time and again to Movies, TV shows and Theatre. To see that spark ignited," Moyer said. "Nelsan had that electricity in an abundance I have rarely seen. I can't believe he's gone. #nelsanellis."
