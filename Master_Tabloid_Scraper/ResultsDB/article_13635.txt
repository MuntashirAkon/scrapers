Stephen Colbert is saying goodbye—to Bill O'Reilly, that is. After an announcement Wednesday confirmed the longtime former Fox News host will not return to his post at the network after continued allegations of sexual harassment, Colbert appeared before his evening audience with a special video message from O'Reilly's "biggest fan," his conservative alter-ego "Stephen Colbert.""I owe a lot to Bill O'Reilly," the comedian told his audience. "I spent over nine years playing a character based largely on him and then 12 months in therapy to de-bloviate myself."

"Stay strong, Papa Bear! Oh, God—is this really happening?"
