Steph Curry Mocks Klay Thompson with Botched 360 Dunk in China/nKlay Thompson's back in the States ... but the legend of #ChinaKlay lives on!! Here's video of Steph Curry ﻿mocking his Splash Brother with a hilarious intentional dunk fail in Chengdu -- one of the stops on Steph's Asia tour. Remember ... the #ChinaKlay phenomenon started when Thompson was unintentionally REJECTED by the rim on his Chinese shoe tour last month. Now we have this gem from Curry -- who killed it on his best (worst) 360 attempt.  Klay lit China on fire with his dance moves too, but #ChinaSteph is giving him a run for his money.  The day before, S.C. busted out some push-ups on a clear glass panel in a Beijing skyscraper ... and got paralyzed by his fear of heights.  No days off in Beijing. #SC30AsiaTour pic.twitter.com /sGLSrYCYAL — Stephen Curry (@StephenCurry30) July 22, 2017/n
