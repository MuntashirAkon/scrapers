 George Clooney Snubs Pals Brad Pitt, Rande Gerber and Matt Damon After Twins’ Birth.../n
George Clooney is too slammed for his friends this summer!
The doting new dad is preoccupied after his wife Amal gave birth to twins  — but now he’s too busy for even his famous best friends!
The actor, 56, who’s leading a much more domestic life in the U.K. at the couple’s Aberlash Estate, is blowing off his pals with “lame excuses,” a source told RadarOnline.com exclusively.

“George is making these lame excuses because he’s gotten snobby and anti-social since moving to England,” the source revealed. “All of a sudden he’s stopped returning calls from Rande Gerber, Bill Murray, Matt Damon…even Richard Kind, who’s been very much his best buddy for years.”
Newly divorced — and sober — Pitt wanted to see Clooney when he was at the Glastonbury Music Festival in Britain recently, but he was also told a get-together wasn’t possible.
Fortunately for Clooney, the pals are being “patient” with their no-show friend.

“For now they’re being patient and not taking it personally, but unless he changes his attitude he’ll drive them all away,” the source added.
Cooney married his 39-year-old lawyer wife in Venice last September with many of his friends present at the lavish wedding, and the couple welcomed twins Ella and Alexander on June 6.
