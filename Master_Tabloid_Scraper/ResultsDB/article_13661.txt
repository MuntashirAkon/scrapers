Stephen Belafonte Shut Down On Child Custody Change/nStephen Belafonte bitched photogs were getting shots of his daughter during his monitored visits, but his plea to change the location for those visits was shot down. The judge decided to keep things status quo after Mel B's estranged husband pointed out photos of their 5-year-old daughter, Madison, hiding her face. Belafonte's attorney said the pics were taken outside the building where he meets Madison. The judge felt the pics weren't enough evidence the child was being harmed, and added ... if there was a throng of paps things could be different. Later this month, another hearing is set where Belafonte will try to convince the judge he needs emergency spousal support. As we reported, he claims he's broke and couch surfing with friends./n
