Warriors Fans Dance on Light Poles, In the Streets to Celebrate NBA Title/nThe fans went absolutely CRAZY in downtown Oakland Monday night ... dancing in the streets and climbing light poles to celebrate the Warriors' huge win over the Cavs!! Dub Nation flocked the streets shortly after Kevin Durant and Steph Curry finished off the Cavs in Game 5 of the NBA Finals ... and they're clearly excited the Larry O'Brien trophy is back in the Bay Area.  Oakland right now @selfloveBartier pic.twitter.com /JHdyf4NkT2 â€” JINCHUURITTY (@METALTEARSOLID) June 13, 2017  One passionate fan even decided to climb up on a street sign and get his groove on while a group of fans rocked out to  "Before I Let Go " by Frankie Beverly and Maze. Doesn't look like this party is stopping anytime soon./n
