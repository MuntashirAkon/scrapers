Psychic Vs. Psychic! Tyler Henry SLAMS 'Long Island Medium'/n
Sorry, Teresa Caputo! Hollywood Medium with Tyler Henry is heading into season three and RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned that he’s ready to prove he’s the only real deal reality TV psychic!
Caputo launched the psychic show genre on TLC in 2011, as the Long Island Medium. Six years later, Henry doesn’t think of her as his competition, the source said.
According to a source close to Henry, “He is not at all bothered by her!”
“Tyler isn’t worried about her stealing his spotlight at all.”
In fact, Henry previously claimed in his memoir, Between Two Worlds: Lessons From the Other Side, that Caputo may have ripped off his own TV show idea!
“We all sat around a table to discuss some ideas for growing my business, including pitching a possible TV show,” he wrote in his book, which was released on Nov. 1, 2016.

Season 3 of Hollywood Medium with Tyler Henry premieres in May on E!
