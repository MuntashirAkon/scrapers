Sweaty Halle Berry Inspires Revolutionary Dandi Patch Sweat Pads/n
Halle Berry won’t be sweating for much longer with the help of Dandi Patch, RadarOnline.com can exclusively reveal!
CEO Theresa Pope told Radar that she was inspired to create the product about six or seven years ago after seeing the actress on television.
“We were watching an episode of the Ellen show and Halle Berry was on and she was really suffering [from underarm sweat],” Pope said. “It made us realize that if someone with Halle Berry’s resources available still couldn’t find a solution and had to go through that on live TV, then there was obviously a need for something.”
The ladies also suffered from the “embarrassment” of sweating, and decided to make a product to fix their problem instead of looking for one already on the market.
The women began developing the underarm patch to help people with the “unspoken problem,” and had a soft launch in 2015.
Now, the Dandi Patch is now available online [https://www.dandipatch.com/shop].
“It was quite a feat,” Pope said. /n
