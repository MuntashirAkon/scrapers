As RadarOnline.com previously reported, Caputo suddenly ended her long-running live reading tour after completing dates in December. At one of her final shows, the Long Island Press called her “not to be believed.”
“This is very unusual. She is always on tour around this time,” a source close to the reality queen told Radar in January. “Something is definitely up.”
However, after some time off, Caputo announced that she will make stops in 10 U.S. cities and 3 Canadian cities in April for her Spring 2015 tour.
The star has brushed off claims she’s a phony, announcing “I don’t let negativity and negative people affect me.” /n
