What Scandal? Defiant Teresa Caputo Announces New Tour Dates/n
Long Island Medium Theresa Caputo is going back on the road, with 13 new tour dates announced, as the TV star faces a scandal threatening her credibility.
Beginning in April, the You Can’t Make This Stuff Up! author will take her act through the Southeast with dates in Florida, Georgia and Alabama; onto the Midwest through Indiana, Ohio and Michigan; and north of the border for three dates in Ontario, Canada.
