Piers Morgan Tries To Spoil J.K. Rowling's Fun On Harry Potter's 20th Anniversary!/n

We knew such a splendid day would be ruined by He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named!
For those living in a cupboard under the stairs, it's the 20th anniversary of the first Harry Potter book being published.
J.K. Rowling already took to Twitter to mark the momentous occasion with a sweet message to all those whose lives have been touched by her Wizarding World.

But even after keeping him out of our thoughts, Piers Morgan managed to manifest like Lord Voldemort himself and attempt to rain on Rowling's parade with his trollery.
The social media slimeball took aim at the author on Monday, making it clear he thinks her beloved novels are nothing more than "hogwartwash," sharing: 

20 years of conning the easily mesmerised masses with execrable literary hogwartwash. Congrats. ðŸ¤¢ðŸ‘Ž https://t.co/x2493DvvJK

Ugh, this guy makes Dolores Umbridge look like Mrs. Weasley.
Rowling's may slay many beasts in her books, but we fear there's one repugnant troll that will never go away.
Go back to your bridge, Piers. That's enough for today.
