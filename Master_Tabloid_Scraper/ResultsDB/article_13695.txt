Out of defiance or sheer apathy, one of Katy Perry’s dancing white houses excused itself from the stage during the 2017 Brit Awards on Wednesday night (Feb. 22, 2017).

Recall the not-so-distant past when Perry performed her new single “Chained to the Rhythm” with Skip Marley at the 2017 Grammy Awards. At the center of the stage was one large house that spun around and around as Perry did laps and sang on its periphery. It eventually exploded into several clean razor-sharp pieces that whooshed around like windmills. The final image was one of Perry and Marey holding their hands up together in front of the U.S. Constitution.
Cut to the 2017 Brit Awards last night. Perry performed the same song with several tiny white houses and two large skeletons that closely resembled President Donald Trump and U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May. One of the houses decided that they had had enough of current events or remembered that it was only Wednesday after thinking that it had been Thursday the entire afternoon. Could it be that they just misjudged the end of the stage? Possibly, but take into account how long it lies there in the crowd.
