Blake Lively’s signature blonde locks are no more.
She’s gone “bronde.”

Never heard of it? Well, it’s a cross between brunette and blonde, hence the hybrid name. Huffington Post also referred to it as “tortoiseshell hair.”
Lively showed off her beautiful honey brown hair in two new Instagram photos.

The Gossip Girl star may have dyed her hair for a new project, like she did in 2011 for The Green Lantern (in which she starred opposite now-hubby Ryan Reynolds).
Reynolds recently addressed the controversy surrounded the way he was photographed holding baby James in Lively’s Instagram post for Father’s Day a couple weekends back. While on the Today Show, he said, “The baby is not properly secured in the vessel that I’m wearing there. And, you know, I’m a first time dad. And that is not the first mistake I’ve made. And I can guarantee it won’t be the last…
He added, “I had never used that particular carrier before so every other time it’s been perfect.”
