Lots of celebrities donned (what we’re hoping were) faux fur coats, leather and many layers to keep warm in the low temperatures. In fact, Chris Brown and girlfriend Karrueche Tran were plucked out of the group of fur-wearing celebrities and harshly scrutinized by PETA for it.
Chrissy Teigen, on the other hand, was not mentioned at all in their rant though she showed off a luxurious $20K fur coat while out in NYC with her hubby John Legend on the very same day.
Either way, we say go for faux, which is why we’re showing you how to get Teigen’s winter street style for much less, but more importantly, without the cost of your animal-loving morals. Check it out:
