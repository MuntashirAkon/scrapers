From High-End to Low-End: Get Kylie Jenner’s AMA Look for Less/n
Kylie Jenner was ahead of the fashion-times at the American Music Awards last month, wearing what’s become Pantone’s 2015  color of the year “marsala” and the No. 1 hue on our wish lists for holiday dresses!
The 17-year-old’s gorgeous Alexandre Vauthier gown featured a plunging neckline and a high-cut slit, which gave the classy color a super sexy appeal.  She rocked just the right amount of accessories, adding a body chain and pair of edgy heels to give the ensemble her go-to rebellious touch.

Not only was Kylie’s style the perfect look on the AMA red carpet, but it’s also a fabulous outfit to rock to a fancy holiday party this season… But I know we can’t all be dropping six G’s on outfits, so for today’s edition of High-End/Low-End, I’ll show you hot to match her look for much less:
