George Clooney Skips Own Gala As Amal Prepares For Twins' Arrival/n
Dad-to-be George Clooney has been put on the no-fly list…by his own wife!
The bachelor turned doting daddy-to-be, 56, and Amal, 39, are due to be new parents of twins any day now, so he’s staying put in their U.K. mansion.
George was notably absent from his own event, the Aurora Prize for Awakening Humanity ceremony in Yerevan, Armenia. Instead, he sent a video message to attendees.

“I really would have been there,” he said. “But if I came and my wife had twins while I was away I could never come home.”
As Radar has reported, the couple is happily hiding out in their lavish British estate while they await the double arrival.
“George isn’t planning on traveling anywhere now that the due date is so close,” a source told Radar. “Amal could give birth early. George doesn’t want to miss anything.”

And the expectant parents are sparing no expense to ensure they have a healthy delivery, dropping over a million dollars to provide the best doctors and experience possible.
That includes reserving an entire hospital wing, flying in a masseuse from Italy and even booking the British royals’ baby nurse!
