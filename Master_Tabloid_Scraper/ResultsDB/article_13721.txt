Black Widow is back!The 1987 thriller about a Department of Justice agent (Debra Winger) on the hunt for a woman (Theresa Russell) who marries men and then murders them for their money is being remade...

Michael Sucsy, director of HBO's award-winning Grey Gardens, tells me he just signed on to write the script. He will also direct."It's going to be set in Europe, and I think it can be really very sexy," Sucsy said today while promoting The Vow, his Valentine's Day romantic drama starring Channing Tatum and Rachel McAdams. "This was a really fun, guilty-pleasure kind of movie, and I think that this is the kind of movie you can redo."Casting is yet to begin, but here's hoping Winger makes an appearance.
