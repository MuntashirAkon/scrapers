We love when Kate Middleton goes into mommy mode.While some may argue she never technically turns that side of her off, it's still pleasant to see the Duchess of Cambridge's eyes light up when talking about her precious heirs to the throne, Prince George and Princess Charlotte. And that's exactly what happened on Tuesday during a special Buckingham Palace reception in honor of the nation's leading athletes.While admiring the men and women who earned medals at the Rio Games, Middleton shared that her 17-month old daughter has grown a love for horses while Prince George was a fan of swimming.

"I asked her how are the children, and she said George really enjoyed the fencing and Charlotte really enjoyed her riding. It obviously got to her and maybe she will be here in a few years time," equestrian gold medalist Natasha Baker said about her chat with the royal."She emphasized that Charlotte has this passion about horses, and although she doesn't echo it, she'll do her best to champion and encourage it."As a supporting and loving mother does.The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh hosted the celebratory evening and were joined by Middleton, Prince William, Prince Harry, the Duke of York and the Princess Royal, all of whom welcomed 240 guests including Prime Minister Theresa May.

Guests included gold medal-winning boxer Nicola Adams, Paralympian swimmer Ellie Simmonds, who claimed her fifth gold medal after winning the 200m medley, and equestrian Lee Pearson, who won a gold and silver in Brazil.And while fashion is not an Olympic event, Kate took the gold yet again when it came to her style, donning a beautiful floral frock by none other than Alexander McQueen.
