Roger Clemens -- ROCKET HITS THE RUNWAY ... At Houston Fashion Event/nCan you spot the male model in this pic?  Trick question ... there are two!  MLB legend Roger Clemens threw on his finest aqua bow tie and hit the runway at Theresa Roemer's Fashion Woodlands in Houston last week.  The Rocket -- along with stars like Adrian Peterson and  "Real Housewives " star Porsha Williams -- helped raise money and awareness for The Greater Woodlands Public Art Foundation.  We're told the charity event raised more than $100k ... and side note -- we're also told Adrian Peterson got a standing ovation from the crowd when Roger gave him a shout out from the stage. /n
