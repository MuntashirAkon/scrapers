Former Soap Star Alicia Arden -- Wet, Stripping Down ... And Extremely Thirsty/nB-actress Alicia Arden is literally betting her ass, that a hot DIY car wash will get Hollywood's attention. Arden -- who was Theresa Carter on  "General Hospital " back in the early 2000s -- is still soaping it up as evidenced by her public strip down to a bikini -- at a West Hollywood car wash. Check it out ... it's at least the 3rd time Arden's displayed her blatant thirst for camera attention while cleaning her whip. Gotta say though, for a chick turning 46 in two days ... she's still bangin'. Nice headlights./n
