Estella Warren Leaving Rehab For Charity Event/n
By Alexis Tereszcuk – Radar Senior Reporter
Actress Estella Warren has been in a rehab treatment center since May following her arrest for DUI and her subsequent crazy antics in jail and RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned that she is getting a weekend pass to attend a charity event out of the country.
“Estella is getting a short pass to leave her treatment center and she is being escorted to the event by a sober companion from the offices of the treatment facility,” her lawyer Darren Kavinoky exclusively told RadarOnline.com.
Estella is a celebrity sponsor for the Rally for Kids with Cancer being held this weekend in Toronto, Canada.

The Planet of the Apes actress escaped jail time from her case, but was placed on 60 months probation and must attend an alcohol program for 18 months.
As RadarOnline.com previously reported Warren drove her Prius into three parked cars on May 24 and was arrested after driving away from the scene, only to later somehow wiggle out of her handcuffs while in custody and escape the police station, where she was then apprehended by police again.

Kavinoky told RadarOnline.com that Warren will be finishing her treatment by the end of September.
“She’s doing fantastic,” he said.  “Her attitude has been stellar.”

But, thankfully: “She will not be driving to the event,” Kavinoky confirmed.
