Julia Roberts Jets Off To Africa With Heartthrob Bear Grylls/n
Screen beauty Julia Roberts is Running Wild with Bear Grylls — and her estranged hubby,
Danny Moder, is at his wit’s end, say sources.
The Pretty Woman is teaming up with the hunky survivalist for children’s charity Red Nose Day.
While cameras roll, the pair race across rugged Kenya to deliver vaccines for impoverished African kids.
“While that sounds like a great charity event, it’s also a perfect time and place for a sizzling romance
to explode between the pair — and Danny knows it,” a spy says. Also, Julia and Danny’s marriage has been shredding.
He’s reportedly moved out of the house they shared with twins Finn and Hazel and Henry, to a smaller one nearby.
While Bear has been wed to Shara, mom of his three sons, since 2000,
“anything can happen during those romantic African nights in the wild — especially to an actress who’s aging,
and with marriage problems,” says the source.
“No wonder Danny didn’t want her to go. This could be the final nail in the coffin of their marriage.” /n
