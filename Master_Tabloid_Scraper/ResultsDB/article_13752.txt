The Planet of the Apes actress was involved in a bizarre late-night run-in with cops after having had too much to drink, she hit three parked cars and kept driving.
After kicking a police officer and being handcuffed and taken into custody, Warren somehow managed to wiggle her way out of the handcuffs and make a swift exit out the back door of the police station, where she was then apprehended by police, again.
