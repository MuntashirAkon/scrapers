The Bachelor's Bob Guiney Reveals He's Been Secretly Engaged! Get The Deets On His Bride-To-Be HERE!/n

Congrats to Bob Guiney!
From divorc√©, to Bachelorette contestant, to The Bachelor, to divorc√© again, and now engaged to be married to Jessica Canyon! The 44-year-old TV host/musician made a surprise announcement on Tuesday during the Today show with Kathie Lee and Hoda.

During the Guys Tell All segment, he nonchalantly mentioned:
"I'm actually engaged now."
Ummm.. Excuse us, what??
Guiney popped the question over Labor Day weekend, but no mention was made other than a snap posted to his bride-to-be's Instagram page over four weeks ago.
See the pic of the happy couple (below)!

How great!
Kathie Lee commented that she doesn't want Bob to "lose his charm" now that he's taken, to which he quipped:
"I've been engaged a lot."
He's not lying!
Although he never tied the knot with either Trista Rehn Sutter or Estella Gardinier from the Bachelor franchise, this will be Bob's third marriage.
Third times a charm, right??
Good for you, Bob!
