Jaime Pressly 'Blinded & Shocked' Estella Warren With Phone Thievery Allegations & Vicious Attack!/n

Drugs! Accusations! Larceny! Lies!
This is better than daytime dramz!!
Jaime Pressly accused Estella Warren of stealing her assistant's iPhone over the weekend, but, according to the accused, that is NOT what happened!
Estella admits to taking the assistant's purse without permission, but she SWEARS it wasn't stealing — the Canadian actress promises she just picked up the wrong black clutch by accident!!
Uhh… is Estella really saying all black clutches look alike?! Pfft, total stereotype, LOLz!!
When the star of My Name is Earl tracked her down with bloodhounds an anti-theiving app, Estella says she was "blinded and shocked by [Jaime's] allegations" and subsequent attack!
An accidental switcheroo seems like an honest enough mistake, but it's hard to believe Estella never noticed!!
Wouldn't she go into her purse to send a text message or to pull out her ID?!
We don't know who to believe!!! This sounds like a case for Encyclopedia Brown! Ha!!
