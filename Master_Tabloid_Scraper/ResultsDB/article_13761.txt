Jaime Pressly & Estella Warren Brawl Over A Handbag!/n

CAT FIGHT! 
When it comes to protecting stylish accessories, Jaime Pressly's claws WILL come out! 
Jaime has accused Planet of the Apes actress Estella Warren of STEALING her assistant's purse and she will do whatever it takes to get it back.
The gutsy My Name Is Earl star went so far as to use a tracking device that led her to Estella at Bootsy Bellows after they both attended a birthday party for publicist Gary Mantoosh on Friday.
An eyewitness spilled: 
“Jaime used the Find My iPhone app – which is like GPS – and saw that her assistant’s phone was at a club in West Hollywood called Bootsy Bellows. So she immediately left the party with her friends to find out who had it. Estella was adamant it was hers, but when Pressly told her to unlock it, she couldn’t. So she took it, along with the handbag, peered inside and claimed a number of items in there belonged to her assistant.”
Once Jaime got to the club, all hell broke loose!!! 
Thankfully, no punches were thrown, but Jaime and her assistant had no problem confronting the Canadian beauty about the alleged theft. 
And even though Estella INSISTED the bag was hers, Jaime brought in the help of the LAPD.
While the po-po didn't solve the case, they did find drugs in Estella's bag.
So who was the owner of the bag and its illegal candy??! 
NO ONE KNOWS, especially since BOTH ladies have a history with substance abuse. 
We'll keep you updated as the police investigation continues!!! 
Jaime in particular has NOT been having an easy time lately, though. 
Hopefully she isn't just trying to create dramz to distract herself from her divorce and DUI bust.
For right now, we're just happy she isn't going back to her old peeing ways!! LOLz.
