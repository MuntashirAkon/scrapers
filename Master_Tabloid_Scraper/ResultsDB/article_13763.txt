Oh Mrs. Havisham,  you manipulator of hearts!
An international trailer for Mike Newell's (Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire) rendition of Charles Dickens' FAMED tragic love story Great Expectations is making us ache with anticipation!  
Check out the emotional, dark and twisted trailer (above)! 
Helena Bonham Carter plays the love-scorned Mrs Havisham, who eases her relentless heartbreak through the subtle control of others - mainly an orphan boy named Pip and the young and beautiful Estella.
Ohhh we can't wait till this re-imagining of one of our FAVE Dickens novels makes it over stateside!  For now it is slated to debut at the Toronto International Film Festival in September, and will slip onto screens in the UK this November 30th.
Massive expectationsâ€¦ just, GYNORMOUS.
