Estella Warren Pleads No Contest To DUI/n

Remember that whole Estella Warren DUI debacle?
To refresh your memory, the actress was charged with four misdemeanors after she crashed her Prius while driving under the influence, kicked the cops when they tried to arrest her, and then FLED when she was finally put in handcuffs.
Luckily for her, she will not be charged with hitting the cops and fleeing from the scene, but she has been given a DUI charge where she plead no contest to while in court on Friday.
A judge ordered her to a residential rehab facility for 6 months and she'll have to serve five years of informal probation.  Another hearing on Oct. 7 will determine if she must pay any restitution.   
Her rep provided this statement:
"I take my actions and their consequences very seriously. I can't express enough how grateful I am that no one was injured or hurt. Moving forward I am focusing all my efforts on my career, my family and being a good influence [on] others." 
Yes, THANKFULLY, no one was injured.  She got away pretty easy, if you ask us.  Rehab will be beneficial for her though.  
We have faith in your sobriety, Estella.  Get better.
