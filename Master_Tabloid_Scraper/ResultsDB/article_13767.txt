Beyoncé and Kelly Rowland made a surprise appearance at the 30th Annual Steller Gospel Music Awards last night (March 28, 2015) in Las Vegas, showing up alongside Michelle Williams.
You know what that means: Destiny’s Child had an amazing (albeit one-song long!) reunion.

Rowland, Williams and Beyonce (matching in all-white ensembles) got the crowd going with a fierce performance of Williams’s gospel song, “Say Yes”:





The trio haven’t reunited since the 2013 Super Bowl XLVII. Like the rest of you, we’re sorely still in mourning over the fact that they’re no longer singing “Say My Name” together.
“Say Yes” was released last May and features Beyoncé and Rowland in the music video as well.

The ceremony will air on April 5th.
Until then, enjoy this video of this Destiny’s Child mini-reunion. Soon it’ll be exactly a decade since they announced they were disbanding (in June of 2005) , so reminisce on the old days when the ladies were still Destiny’s Child (*sob*).



Thank you to each and every one of you that voted for #SayYes and a very special THANK YOU to @matthewacherry for directing this incredible video. And of course to my ladies to @beyonce and @kellyrowland for blessing the song. #StellarAwards
