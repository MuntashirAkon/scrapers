Estella Warren Pleads No Contest to DUI/n
Estella Warren entered a no-contest plea in her drunken driving case on Friday and was ordered to a residential rehab facility for four months.  
Los Angeles city attorney’s spokesman Frank Mateljan says Warren will also serve five years of informal probation and that an Oct. 7 hearing will determine if she must pay any restitution, reports the Associated Press.  
In a statement provided to PEOPLE by her rep, Warren, 32, said: “I take my actions and their consequences very seriously. I can’t express enough how grateful I am that no one was injured or hurt. Moving forward I am focusing all my efforts on my career, my family and being a good influence [on] others.” 
Warren, who costarred with Mark Wahlberg in Tim Burton’s 2001 Planet of the Apes and was Maxim magazine’s hottest woman in 2000, crashed her Prius into three parked cars when she was arrested in May. She was also charged with hitting an officer.  
“She was uncooperative and demanding,” a rep for the L.A. Sheriff’s Department told PEOPLE at the time. “She removed her handcuffs and fled the police station. She was captured and transported back.”   
Warren’s previous conviction for drunken driving was in 2007.
