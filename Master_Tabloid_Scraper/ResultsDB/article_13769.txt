Estella Warren Goes to Treatment Facility After DUI Arrest/n
Estella Warren, who was charged with DUI, hit-and-run and other offenses, has entered a residential treatment facility and is wearing an alcohol-detecting SCRAM bracelet, her lawyer tells PEOPLE.  
“She wants to prove she isn’t drinking,” attorney Darren Kavinoky told PEOPLE on Friday.   
The former Planet of the Apes star, 32, faces up to six months in jail on four misdemeanor charges that also include battery on a police officer and resisting an officer.  
“She’s committed to making the situation right and moving on in a way that’s appropriate,” says Kavinoky.  
Warren crashed her Prius into three other cars last month and hit an officer who tried to arrest her when she fled, according to authorities. She entered the treatment center shortly after making bail and has been wearing the bracelet for about 10 days.   
“This scenario can be the catalyst for significant change,” Kavinoky says. “Estella’s attitude towards this whole thing is awesome. She’s more than accepting. She’s embracing the personal opportunities that have come from this.”
