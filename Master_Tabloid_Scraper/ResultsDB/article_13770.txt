Estella Warren Charged with DUI, Battery on Officer/n
Estella Warren faces four misdemeanor charges for her bizarre, allegedly intoxicated antics that led to her May 23 arrest in Los Angeles.   
The actress and former Maxim hottest woman, 32, was charged Thursday with DUI, hit-and-run, battery on a police officer and resisting a police officer. Warren also allegedly refused to submit to a chemical test the night she was arrested.  
The Planet of the Apes star is scheduled for arraignment on June 17 for the four misdemeanors. She could face a maximum of six months in jail.    
Issues with driving under the influence are not new for Warren, who was convicted of the crime in 2007.  
On the night of Warren’s most recent arrest, a rep for the L.A. Sheriff’s Department told PEOPLE, “She was uncooperative and demanding,” adding that she broke out of her handcuffs and attempted to flee the police station.
