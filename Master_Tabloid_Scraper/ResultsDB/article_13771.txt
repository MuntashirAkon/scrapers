Estella Warren Arrested for DUI, Tries to Escape/n
Estella Warren, who starred in Planet of the Apes and was Maxim‘s hottest woman in 2000, was arrested on Monday night before wiggling out of her handcuffs and trying to escape.  
“Warren hit three parked cars in what was considered three separate collisions,” a rep for the L.A. Sheriff’s Department tells PEOPLE. “Someone local heard the noise and called the police.”  
The actress, who failed to stop for police when they tried to pull her over near her L.A. home, was then followed by area citizens. When the police finally got to her, they determined she was under the influence of alcohol. She physically assaulted an officer, and was then transported to a local women’s police station for processing. 
“She was uncooperative and demanding,” the rep says. “She removed her handcuffs and fled the police station. She was captured and transported back.”  
Warren, 32, was booked on a $100,000 bail following her arrest for hit and run, felony escape and DUI.  
A rep for the actress has not yet commented.
