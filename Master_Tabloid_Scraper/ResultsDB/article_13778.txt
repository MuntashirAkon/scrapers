What's up with Estella Warren heading to Toronto this weekend?She's Canadian, sure, but she's supposed to be living in a treatment center in Los Angeles for another couple months, as part of her sentence for driving under the influence.Actually, Warren has a really good reason for heading east (and north), something that even a judge would have to be in agreement with!

Warren has secured a weekend pass from rehab to attend the Rally for Kids With Cancer as a celebrity sponsor, an event organizer confirmed to E! News.According to Warren's lawyer, she will make the trip to Toronto with a sober companion from the treatment facility.No word on whether the former Victoria's Secret model will be attending the Celebrity Draft Party cocktail reception before the race, which benefits the SickKids Foundation and the Hospital for Sick Children.But there are plenty of other events scheduled over the weekend, including a brunch and meetings with the kids, that sound pretty safe for a celeb on leave from rehab to participate in.Determined to "make it all right, " according to her lawyer, Warren voluntarily checked into rehab and strapped herself into a SCRAM ankle bracelet following one of her lesser moments: her May 23 arrest on suspicion of DUI, hit-and-run, resisting arrest and battery on a peace officer.She was sentenced to four months in residential rehab and five years of informal probation after she pleaded no contest to DUI in August. The other charges were dismissed as part of the deal.
