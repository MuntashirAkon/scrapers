Estella Warren says she's serious about getting clean and has found the perfect accessory to prove it.The recently arrested starlet, who's facing several DUI-related charges, has checked herself into a residential treatment program and volunteered to wear the alcohol-monitoring anklet known as a SCRAM, her attorney tells E! News.Who says Lindsay Lohan isn't an inspiration anymore?

"She is wearing it as a gesture of good faith, and what better way to show sincerity?" says lawyer Darren Kavinoky."Estella is committed to making it all right. She is not doing it begrudgingly. She is a great lady and she really wants to get this situation resolved and behind her.""This situation" stems from Warren getting busted May 23 after allegedly plowing into several cars and then attempting to drive away from the scene. She was initially collared on suspicion of DUI, during the process of which she allegedly kicked a cop, but then added more insult to injury by somehow slipping out of her cuffs at the station.The Planet of the Apes star managed to duck an attempted-escape rap, but she's still due in court July 15 (continued from today) to face misdemeanor charges of driving under the influence, hit-and-run, battery on a law-enforcement officer and resisting arrest.May Warren's time spent wearing her SCRAM prove less eventful than Lindsay Lohan's.
