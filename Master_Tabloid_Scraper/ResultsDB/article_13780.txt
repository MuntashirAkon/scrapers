Estella Warren admits that she ended up taking a handbag belonging to Jaime Pressly's assistant to a club with her after they had all attended the same party in Los Angeles.But the Planet of the Apes actress insists that it was a complete accident."The purse Estella picked up at the party they had attended earlier that night, was identical to her purse that she carries in her bag for nights out like this," a rep for Warren told E! News Tuesday. "As soon as it was discovered that Ms. Pressly's assistant's belongings were in the purse, Estella immediately apologized and the purse was returned.

E! News previously confirmed that West Hollywood Sheriff's deputies responded to an incident at nightclub Bootsy Bellows on Saturday, when the confrontation between the two actresses went down. A source said that the conversation got pretty heated once Pressly and her assistant tracked down the staffer's missing iPhone and showed up to find it in Warren's hand, but no arrests were made and no further legal fallout has been reported.Pressly's rep has not responded to a request for comment."This incident was simple case of misunderstanding that was blown way out of proportion and should never have involved police or violence," Warren's rep also said. —Additional reporting by Marc Malkin and Marcus Mulick
