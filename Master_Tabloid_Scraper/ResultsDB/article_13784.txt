Planet of the Apes star Estella Warren probably wishes she were on another planet about now. Or at least anywhere but here.The model-actress was charged today with DUI, hit-and-run driving, battery on a law enforcement officer and resisting arrest stemming from her alleged drunk-driving adventure last month, which ended with a bizarre attempt to flee from police custody.The charges, all of which are misdemeanors, were filed today by the Los Angeles City Attorney's Office. The next date in the case is set for June 17, though the 40-year-old Warren is not required to attend the hearing.

The Sports Illustrated hottie got into this mess when she allegedly smashed her Toyota Prius into three cars in Los Angeles just past midnight on May 23, then left the scene of the accident.After cops caught up with her, she initially put up a fight, kicking her arresting officer. When they dragged her into a nearby station, Warren, who had already flunked a field sobriety test at that point, somehow managed to slink out of her handcuffs and allegedly tried to make a run for the back door, though she didn't far before she was nabbed again.Things could have been a lot worse however for the steering-challenged beauty. Because she hadn't yet been booked, authorities technically were unable to charge her with one felony count of escape, which would have been an even more serious charge than her DUI and could have resulted in much more jail time if she were found guilty.Either way, Estella, who's out on $100,000 bail, still faces up to two and a half years in prison if she's convicted.
