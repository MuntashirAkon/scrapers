Pippa Middleton Helps Stop Human Trafficking/n
By Alexis TereszcukSenior Radar Reporter
Pippa Middleton is beautiful in blue — and charitable to boot!
Her Royal Hotness looked lovely in the blue jacket and stylish scarf she wore on Wednesday, and RadarOnline.com has learned that her outfit is actually helping to stop human trafficking.
The Beulah Blue Heart Scarf is part of the United Nations Blue Heart Campaign, and for every scarf that is sold a portion of the proceeds being donated to help stop human trafficking.

Pippa is in good charitable company. Celebrities Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore launched the DNA (Demi and Ashton) Foundation to end human trafficking as well.
The 28-year-old younger sister of Kate Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge, paired her skinny black jeans with Kate Kuba boots and a pair of Bulgari sunglasses with a blue gem that matched her outfit.
Pippa’s wardrobe choices have caused fashion frenzies, with her outfits flying off the shelves so hopefully wearing the Beulah Blue Heart Scarf will raise money for a very worthy cause!
