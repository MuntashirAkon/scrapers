Julia Michaels Brings Major Mermaid Vibes To The MTV VMAs Red Carpet/n

We don't see any issues here!
Julia Michaels was a fashion hit at the MTV VMAs in her blue ombre Christian Dior dress that made her look like she'd just emerged from the waves. Mermaid vibes!!!
The soft movement in her skirt made it even more like a sea-riously oceanic ensemble with the glitter also evoking light reflecting off the water.
We're really feeling this aquatic look!
