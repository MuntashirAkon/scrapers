Prince William And Kate Middleton Bring Precious Cargo To NYC! The Baby Bump Is Bigger!/n

They're heeeeeeere!
The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, that is, and not the ghosts from Poltergeist.
Thankfully!
Prince William and Kate Middleton flew across the pond and landed at JFK airport on Sunday, sadly sans Prince George.
We'll just have to make do without the baby prince by focusing on his parents' outfits!
And Kate's bump, of course — it's grown quite a bit!

The two  looked very fresh upon arrival at the Carlyle Hotel soon after landing. We have to wonder if they traveled in those clothes or did a quick change in the airplane.
Obviously they don't fly coach!
To greet the plebes of Manhattan, Kate chose another of her favorite coat dresses — a burgundy tweed one with black piping by Seraphine – while her husband donned one of his tried-and-true blue suits.
About an hour later, Kate changed into a black lace Beulah London dress to attend a private dinner with the American Friends of the Royal Foundation at British media and marketing mogul Sir Martin Sorrell's home.

Sounds rather posh!
Prince William stayed in his blue suit because, well, nobody really cares what he wears. You know?
Anyway, we're so excited they're here! EEEEK!
