50 Cent's Grandma Disliked All Of His Songs Except THIS One! Think You Know Which It Is???/n

Aww! She sounds so sweet!
50 Cent's lyrics may not be the most wholesome things in the world, and he's mentioned before that his late grandma Beulah Jackson wasn't a fan of them as a result!
Well, the rapper recently revealed on Revolt TV that there was actually one tune in particular Mis Jackson actually really liked! He explained: 

"The first song that I wrote for The Massacre was God Gave Me Style, because if you asked me to make one wish, it would be for that record to be a success. And you know what happens? When I make the song, I go to my grandma house and I play the record for her. And she's like, â€˜Wow you got one for me.'"

How cute! And even though Fiddy's grandma, who passed away this month, didn't love his rhymes, she still supported the heck out of him:

"Look, she's bought every record that I ever [sold] commercial and [they] still got the plastic on 'em. She don't listen to 50 Cent, that ain't her vibe."

We get it! 50 Cent isn't everyone's cup of tea, but it's good to know that his grandma supported him no matter what!/n
