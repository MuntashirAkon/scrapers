Pippa Middleton Dines With An Eligible Bachelor In London/n

If you had to choose, would you rather be Kate Middleton or Pippa Middleton?
On the one hand, Kate is a flawless freaking Disney princess. On the other hand, Pippa gets to run around London doing whatever she wants and nobody can say anything.
It's truly a tough call.
Pips and her "good friend" Tom Kingston dined at Le Caprice in London on Wednesday with the 29-year-old looking demurely seksi in a navy Beulah satin blazer and skinny jeans.
Of course, this being Pippa, she matched her croc-print clutch and suede pumps to her blazer.
It's still a cute look though!  Now, hurry up and get hitched!
