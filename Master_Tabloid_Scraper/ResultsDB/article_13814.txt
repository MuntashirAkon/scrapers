Instead of her usual big name designer frocks, the pregnant Duchess stepped out in a pretty polka dot dress by ASOS, which retails for approximately $65 USD. Middleton, who spent the morning meeting families aided by the charity Home-Start, finished off her chic casual look with black pumps, a matching clutch and black jacket.
According to the Daily Mail, a charity volunteer spoke with the Duchess about her due date next month.
“I’m due mid-April, to the end of April,” the pregnant royal said. “Not long to go now.”
This is the first time Middleton has spoken about her due date in public since Kensington Palace issued an official statement on her pregnancy last October.
This will be the second child for the Duchess and her husband, the Duke of Cambridge (Prince William). The Cambridges are already proud parents to Prince George, who will turn 2 years old this July.
