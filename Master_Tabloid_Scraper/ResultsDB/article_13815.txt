When you’re Kate Middleton, you can wear something other than green — and get away with it — on St. Patrick’s Day.

On Tuesday, the Duchess of Cambridge, who is about eight months pregnant with her second child, joined her husband, Prince William, at the annual St. Patrick’s Day parade at Mons Barracks in Aldershot, England.

Middleton, 33, stepped out in a sleek brown coat by British designer, Catherine Walker. The Duchess finished off her look with matching brown pumps, gloves and a fascinator.
According to the Daily Mail, the pregnant royal conducted a shamrock presentation ceremony for the third year in a row. She also met the Irish wolfhound Domhnall, the Irish Guards’ official mascot.
The Duchess’ latest public engagement comes off the heels of a packed week that included a visit to the Downton Abbey studios and a commemoration service for British troops stationed in Afghanistan.
