Caption It: 7 Adorable Photos Of Kate Middleton And Kids In Scotland/n
The Duchess of Cambridge completed her two-day royal tour up in Scotland alongside the Duke on Friday, and we couldn’t help but get carried away with photos of Catherine interacting with the children who came out to meet her.
Given that she’s due to give birth this July, everyone’s been focused on how the Duchess greets the young whipper snappers during walkabouts and engagements since day one.
Even before she became pregnant, Catherine showed her natural ability to greet kids warmly, from hugging cancer patient Diamond Marshall in Canada in 2011, to bending down to talk to a little girl in Grimsby, England who dressed up as a princess just for the Duchess.

Catherine’s next engagement is on April 21st at Windsor Castle, where she will attend the National Review of Queen’s Scouts.  Her Royal Highness will spend time talking with some of the 400-plus Queen’s Scouts from around the UK and the Commonwealth and meet those who have achieved the Queen’s Scout award, according to St. James’s Palace.
Later on, the Duchess will attend the National Scout Service at St George’s Chapel, Windsor.
Catherine is both a patron of and a volunteer with the Scout Association.
