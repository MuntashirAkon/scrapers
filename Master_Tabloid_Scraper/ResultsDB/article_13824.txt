While pregnant Kate Middleton is fighting off morning sickness, little sis Pippa is still showing off her enviable figure. The younger sibling to the Duchess of Cambrige was all smiles at her book launch party for Celebrate: A Year of Festivities for Family and Friends in Haarlem, Netherlands, today. The 29-year-old stunner wore a silk Beulah London peplum dress in an electric purple hue for the event. She paired the vibrant look with lavender suede pumps and styled her elegantly curled hair in a half-up, half-down 'do. 

Although the fashionista's ensemble is neither subtle nor recycled (hmmm...wonder what Kate would say?), it certainly kept the spotlight on the brunette beauty as she promoted her highly publicized party-planning guide. Despite the heavily hyped promo blitz, the sales for Pippa's book have been less than stellar. Perhaps she should pen a guide to the perfect baby shower? We have a strong feeling that would fly off the shelves.
