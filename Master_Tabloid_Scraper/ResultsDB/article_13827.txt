Kate Middleton went from Duchess of Drab to Duchess of Fab in the course of a week!During her royal tour of India and Bhutan, Kate officially shook off her old nickname and instead wowed her critics with one perfect East-meets-West ensemble after another.But dressing like the Duchess of Cambridge doesn't come cheap. According to our calculations, her latest tour wardrobe rings up to almost $50,000!On the trip Kate changed outfits 18 times, including for today's special visit to the Taj Mahal, and wore pieces by 40 different designers or brands. She donned four different looks on one day alone: one dress to board their flight to Bhutan, another dress when she and Prince William deplaned at their destination, another to wield a bow and arrow and then yet another, this time for a double date with the King and Queen of Bhutan. 

Bright native fabrics and Jaipur-inspired patterns replaced her usual block colors. She thoughtfully mixed looks from her favorite designers such as Alice Temperley and Jenny Packham with new pieces to pay homage to the host countries. While, disappointingly, Kate didn't wear a sari, she got to show off her fashion chops when she donned a traditional Bhutanese kira (it took two months and five people to make the fabric!) and mixed it with a hot-off-the-runway Paul & Joe cape top—genius!

Also packed in what must have been a number of suitcases (we're betting the duchess wasn't limited by stingy carry-on restrictions) were old favorites such as her trusty nude LK Bennett Fern pumps—and then there were those boots she went hiking in on Thursday. She's owned them for over a decade and we first spotted her wearing them in 2004!Excuse us as we fall in love with the duchess all over again…

But turning her fashion cred up a notch might not have been all Kate's doing. Rumor has it her assistant Natasha Archer is her new secret weapon and the real reason a little bit more spice has been added into her closet (by adding modesty linings and chaining up hemlines).So it takes a team and a year's salary to look like Kate Middleton for just one week, but we're not complaining. The future queen looked utterly fabulous.And even though we'll be off in search of chic substitutes on the cheap, here's our breakdown of her stunning tour wardrobe:
