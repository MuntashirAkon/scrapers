The Justice Department announced Monday that an intelligence contractor has been charged with leaking a classified report on Russia’s interference in the 2016 election to the press.
Reality Leigh Winner, 25, is accused of “removing classified material from a government facility and mailing it to a news outlet,” according to a federal complaint, CNN reports.
