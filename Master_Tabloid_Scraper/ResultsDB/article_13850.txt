By Debbie Emery – Radar Reporter
Hot on the heels of his impressive victory in the Masters on Sunday, golf champion Bubba Watson has put his North Carolina lake house on the market for $1.45 million, and RadarOnline.com has photos inside the stunning Southern home.
No doubt still wearing his prestigious green jacket, Gerry Lester “Bubba” Watson, Jr. listed the High Rock Lake pad for almost the identical amount that he won in prize money for beating out Louis Oosthuizen in Augusta, Georgia on the final day of the prestigious tournament, reported Realtor.com.

The 6,500-square-foot house is located on a waterfront lot and spreads across three stories featuring two indoor kitchens, a den and a master suite with a sizeable walk-in closet.
To the rear, a custom slate stairway leads to an outdoor entertaining area that boasts a full kitchen, exterior fireplace, salt water pool and a hot tub. Adjacent to the patio area is a boat house and slip that offers covered storage, a sea-do dock and an aluminum floating pier.

Aspiring golfers will relish in the house’s convenient location to the Lexington Golf Club, which is just 10 miles away.
The sudden move could be caused by Watson’s expanding family after he and his wife, 6’4” former basketball player, Angie, adopted a baby boy named Caleb last month and are currently renting a house in Orlando, Florida.
