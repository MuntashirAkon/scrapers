Chris Brown Just Teased A Collaboration With Zayn Malik & The Internet Is NOT Okay!/n

Is Chris Brown's wish finally coming true?!
Last year, the soulful singer revealed that he would LOVE to collaborate with Zayn Malik! Well now it looks like that might've happened!
On Friday, the 26-year-old took to Instagram to share a snippet of a new song, and we think that the former One Direction heartthrob might be on the hot track!

The famous father posted a vid of himself bobbing his head to a new tune, and it seems like this one is a star-studded collaboration, because he captioned the clip:

"#TURBS the ultimate R&B song @howuseeit @zayn round 1!! @miguel @augustalsina @brysontiller round 2!round 3 @tyrese @therealtank"
Alright, well we don't know much about the jam, but let's use some context clues, shall we?
Based on the people CB has tagged, it seems safe to say that in addition to the 1D alum, the song could also feature Usher, Miguel, and Tyrese! DAMN!
Also, it looks like he's calling the track TURBS. Hmmmm. Inneresting.
Now take a listen (below)!
