August Alsina Called Out For Sexual Harassment After Groping A Fan's Breasts During A Concert! Watch The Uncomfortable Moment HERE!/n

This is really gross!
August Alsina is getting a lot of heat after initiating a very handsy moment on stage with a female fan during his Baton Rouge performance on Friday.
The No Love crooner was playing at the Freebandz Music Fest when he brought a woman on stage and seated her before the crowd.
But things got a little too intimate when the R&B singer felt up the audience member's breasts!

The female fan clearly looked uncomfortable â€” she even strategically shielded her chest with her own hand to prevent Alsina from copping another feel!
Unsurprisingly, the grabby moment has sparked a ton of outrage on social media, with Twitter users calling the singer out for sexual harassment!
While the fan kept somewhat of a smile on throughout the groping, it's pretty obvious that she just wanted that moment to end.
Do YOU think the singer went too far? Take a look at the video (below) and decide for yourself!
