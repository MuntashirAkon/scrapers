Ah, there's no place like home for a fun family reunion â€” and for George Clooney, that's in Augusta, Kentucky!

The duo stopped by one of Georgie's favorite places in town: Magee's Bakery!
Co-owner Russell Dickson dished about the loving newlyweds and said:
"They were fun as a couple! They ordered the transparent, that's his thing, he loves the transparent."
From what we understand, the transparent is the name of these little pie-like pastries the bakery is known for! How presh!
Russell went on to give the world a little history lesson, recalling:
"His family has been a customer for years, so I kind of half grew up with him always hanging around the bakery. He stops in maybe once a year or so."
The transparent pastries weren't the only thing the lovebirds munched on! They apparently also had some pudding from the popular local spot!
Later on, George took his wife out to dinner at Caproni's on the River! Sounds like a great end to a wonderful day!
Sigh, imagine being shown around George Clooney's hometown by George himself!
