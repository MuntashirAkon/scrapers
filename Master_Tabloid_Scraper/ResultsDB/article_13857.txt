Maybe Niall Horan will follow suit like his former bandmate Zayn Malik and hang up his microphone for a bag of golf clubs!
Sike! We're totally kidding, he's 100% committed to One Direction, remember??

Although he's currently on a break from the group's On the Road Again tour, the faux blonde cutie decided to take a step down from his super stardom to caddie for golfer Rory McIlroy at the 2015 Masters Tournament on Wednesday afternoon in Augusta, Georgia!
Look how adorable they are!
At one point during the tournament, the Northern Ireland golfer allowed the 21-year-old to take a shot on the course!
Nialler took to Twitter to express his nervousness: 
Also , can't say I've ever been so nervous in my life than when Rory handed me that golf club, horrendous shot!

Shortly after that swing, Niall took a little tumble in the middle of one of Rory's interviews and quickly got back up on his feet!
He tweeted after his misstep on the slippery pines!

Don't worry ladies, he'll be just fine! Besides, aside from that fail fall, he got to take a free swing during the tournament! LOLz!
See how the Irish crooner fared from his followthrough and his unfortunate fall (below)!
