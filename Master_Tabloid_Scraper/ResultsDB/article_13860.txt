Kylie Jenner’s makeup company, Kylie Cosmetics, is in hot water with its customers again after fans noticed that some of the reality star-turned-mogul’s limited edition products look exactly the same as some of her pre-existing lip kits.

People have been taking to social media to show that Jenner’s Blitzen, a liquid lipstick that comes in her exclusive $45 holiday gift set, looks remarkably similar to Spice, a plum-colored lip kit that’s available all year around for $29. Many have even compared swatches of the two shades against one another, only to find that they look almost identical.

the description for spice is a deepened raspberry-plum, and Blitzen is apparently a warmer version of that @KylieJenner please explain HOW pic.twitter.com/NUEoqlC7SD

In fact, some customers have noticed that several of Jenner’s signature colors have been seemingly recycled and resold as so-called “new” shades. This includes a classic like Candy K — one of the three original lip kits from Kylie Cosmetics — allegedly being rebranded as Khlo$ from the Koko Collection, a special edition set that was sold for $40.

This wasn’t the first time Jenner was accused of repackaging products, either. Last summer, some people claimed Jenner copied YouTube star and beauty vlogger Shannon Harris’ eyeshadow palette with BH Cosmetics. As Harris released her product three months before Jenner even announced she was expanding her makeup empire, many thought the 19-year-old stole the idea and ripped off Harris’ design by featuring nine similar-looking shades of eyeshadow in a white square box.

The copycat allegations came after beauty blogger Stephanie Nicole outed Kylie Cosmetics for using the exact same ingredients as ColourPop in their lip kits. ColourPop’s founders later confirmed that their products and Jenner’s liquid lipsticks are made in the same lab.
