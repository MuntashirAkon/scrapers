The brand also took to Instagram to share the awesome news, thanking Selena’s fans for also being a huge inspiration in this project.

“I am so excited that MAC Cosmetics will be releasing a collection in honor of my sister Selena,” Quintanilla shared. “Helping to create this collection brings me back to all those late night conversations on our tour bus when she spoke of having her own makeup line one day. If Selena were here she would be beyond ecstatic to have this happening. History is being made.”
Selena dominated the music scene in the late 80s and early 90s and was known for her stunning looks and immense talent.
