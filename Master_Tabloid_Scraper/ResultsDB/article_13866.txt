Taylor Swift’s BFF Ed Sheeran is a Vibe Magazine Cover Boy/n
Singer Ed Sheeran graces the latest cover of Vibe magazine along with R&B crooners Mack Wilds and August Alsina.
Vibe‘s Music Editor, John Kennedy, states that Ed and his fellow cover buddies “represent for the future of R&B.” That is one hefty statement!

Ed posted his elation regarding his Vibe magazine cover on Instagram, “Happy to be he first British dude on the cover of Vibe magazine. Issue out next week.”
Ed Sheeran is in the midst of promoting his second studio album, x (pronounced “multiply”), and his lead smash single “Sing.”

Ed wants you to know that he’s just not about love songs. He says, “Just because I’m a man with an acoustic guitar doesn’t mean I have to play love songs. I want to straddle all worlds at once. I want to do my acoustic stuff, write for the biggest pop acts in the world, and also work with all the rappers I like, underground or not.”
Ed has a big fan in The Game (Sheeran is partnering with The Game on a full-length project), who “Everything Ed does—even scraps or demo things—all sounds amazing,” Game says. “Ed’s voice is just soothing.”
