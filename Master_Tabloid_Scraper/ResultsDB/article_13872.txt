Picks and Pans Review: Augusta, Gone/n
by Martha Tod Dudman
As a teenager in the ’60s, Martha Dudman sneaked out of her parents’ house to drop acid, smoke pot, hitchhike and otherwise shock her mother, who was devastated when the girl was barred from her own high school graduation ceremony.
Fast-forward 30 years. Dudman’s 15-year-old daughter Augusta leaves home for days at a time to drop acid, snort cocaine and hitchhike. She cuts herself and threatens her mother with a knife. Dealing with her daughter, writes Dudman, a former radio executive, is “like sticking my hand in the garbage disposal.” Mother and daughter enter a grim subculture of parents who lock their children in restrictive schools or track them down using bounty hunter-like “escorts.” Dudman’s searing honesty speaks eloquently to our most fragile selves, whether wounded child or frantic parent, in a stunner of a book.
