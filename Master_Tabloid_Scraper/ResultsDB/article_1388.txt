Kate Middleton and Prince William brought along their adorable kids, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, when they touched down in Warsaw Monday (July 17th). Kicking off their five-day tour of Poland and Germany, the royal couple were all smiles as they greeted fans and held hands with their children on the tarmac.

Later that day, Kate joked about expanding the clan again when she was presented with gifts for her children. “We will just have to have more babies,” she was overheard telling William, according to the Daily Mail.
“We gave the Duchess some presents for Prince George and Princess Charlotte,” Polish fashion house founder Julia Sielicka-Jastrzebska told the publication. “She said they should have more babies, and they laughed.”
