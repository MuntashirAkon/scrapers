It's The Bachelorette's version of Christmas and Bachelor Nation is getting 31 presents this year.Rachel Lindsay's season kicks off on Monday, May 22, and ABC has finally unveiled the Dallas lawyer's line-up of suitors, including their photos and the now-infamous job descriptions. And season 13's crop of men's occupations definitely do not disappoint, as we have a tickle monster AND a "whaboom."What is a "whaboom" you ask? Well, it's either a World of Warcraft reference or, per Urban Dictionary, the man is the human embodiment of  the "word to be used when just a simple 'Bam' would not provide the desired effect. A word used to convey the huge ramifications of several actions that lead the subject down a road to inevitable demise."

Oh, this season is going to be fun.On the first night, viewers can expect to see one guy, Matt, show up in a penguin costume (clearly stealing a page from Alexis' "Is she a shark or a dolphin?" playbook during Nick Viall's season), another to be accompanied by a marching band (Blake E.), and one to actually be a secret admirer from Rachel's elementary school days (Fred). Creepy or romantic? You decide during the premiere.Here is the full line-up of Rachel's men, all 31 of them.

The Bachelorette premieres Monday, May 22 at 9 p.m. on ABC.
