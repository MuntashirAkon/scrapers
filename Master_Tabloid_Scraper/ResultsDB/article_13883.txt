The 39-year-old continued, "I've worked a lot on my game and I'm looking forward to competing. I'm excited to get to Augusta and I appreciate everyone's support."The tournament is slated to continue until the 12th of April and has garnered tons of attention for Woods' big return.A few days before admitting that he was planning on competing, Woods was seen playing on the Augusta course by Webb Simpson of 120 Sports.And despite Woods having to back out of several sporting events due to a back injury, Simpson reported that the golf prodigy looked ready for the Masters."I knew if he had back trouble or if anything was bothering him he would have had a cart because they let you ride out there if you need a cart. And Augusta's tough to walk, and he was right there with his guys every hole," Simpson said."I think he's hungry for it, and he's ready to get back."
