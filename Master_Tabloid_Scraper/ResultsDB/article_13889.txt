Tiger Woods landed in Augusta today to prepare for his golf comeback at the Masters...sans any kind of family cheering section.His wife, Elin Nordegren, and their children were nowhere to be seen and are not expected to join the gallery when the tournament tees off this week. She was last seen in public late last week, heading to Key Biscayne without Woods to check out tennis at the Sony Ericsson Open.The newly goateed Woods is making his first public golf outing since his cheating scandal broke over Thanksgiving weekend.

The 34-year-old golf pro was seen joking with a fellow golf player and even greeted a couple of reporters as he headed to a practice facility.On Monday, Woods will hold a press conference. While he recently gave exclusive one-on-one interviews to the Golf Channel and ESPN, the presser will mark the first time he has fielded questions from several media outlets since his November car crash.Woods will be gunning for his fifth Masters win. The tournament begins Thursday.
