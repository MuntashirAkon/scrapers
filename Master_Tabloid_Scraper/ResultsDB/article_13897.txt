Lindsey Pelas Says She's Gonna Be A Sexy Caddie At Masters (VIDEO)/nHere's busty model Lindsey Pelas and her cleavage leaving The Nice Guy in Los Angeles and telling us exactly how she's gonna make the Masters hot this year ... as a caddie. PGA rookie Grayson Murray asked Lindsay to caddie for him at Augusta via Twitter, she accepted, and when we got her out in L.A. she told us what's in store for the biggest event in golf. Murray still has to qualify for the tourney, meaning he needs a good showing at this week's Houston Open, but let's be honest, we all want to see him get it done now. Especially Tiger Woods./n
