An angry fan fired back in the comments saying: “The level of disrespect is indescribable,” Owalt “has an army of loyal fans and people who idolize hi,. So this says more abt u than him.”
Funnyman Oswalt replied with sarcasm in defense of his fiancée, saying:
“I agree” Meredith, “I expect to be treated with this level of deference in our marriage.”
To that Salenger replied: “You s***head.”

As Radar has reported, Oswalt, 48, and Salenger, 47, went public with their sweet romance just last month when they arrived together at the Los Angeles premiere of Baby Driver.
The outing came just months after the comedian’s wife Michelle McNamara – with whom he shares daughter Alice Rigney, 8 – died unexpectedly in her sleep after sources suspected she suffered a violent drug overdose.

While the sitcom star was open about his grief after the horrifying incident, his unlikely relationship with Salenger pulled him out of depression and into her arms.
“They’re very happy,” said a source close to the couple.
The famous duo – who met through their mutual friend Martha Plimpton – has displayed their love on social media more since their flame began a couple months back, and it seems that their connection has reached a new level now that they’ve confirmed they will be tying the knot!
