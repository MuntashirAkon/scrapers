Tiger Woods Aerial Assault -- More on the Way/nTiger Woods is still in the crosshairs of an aerial prankster -- who plans to strike again ... by flying a third scandal-inspired banner across the sky today during the Masters in Augusta.  TMZ has learned today's banner will read:  "You knew, Stevie...You knew " -- a reference towards Tiger's caddy Steve Williams, who has vehemently denied any knowledge of Tiger's multiple affairs.Still no word on who is financing the aerial pranks, but one thing is certain: the banners certainly didn't knock Tiger off his game ... yesterday, dude posted his best first round scores since he began playing in Augusta. UPDATE: Our boy at SportsByBrooks is reporting that there are three more banners set to fly.
