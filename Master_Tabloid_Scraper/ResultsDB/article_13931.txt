This isn’t the first time Rihanna has been hit with a tour tragedy. Last year, the singer’s roadie, De’Von Pickett, was stabbed to death at a bar in Philadelphia.
According to reports, Quigley was last seen getting on a bus at the Port Authority Bus Terminal in New York City around 1 a.m. on Sunday.
The NYPD located Quigley’s car outside of a Hertz car rental store at 126 West 55th Street in Manhattan, while her phone was found in a Chelsea bridal store, Heavy reports.
Quigley’s father told NBC New York that she recently told a friend, “Get ready, it’s about to happen and I’m going to need you to sub for me.” According to police, he found the comment “strange,” especially since she had been behaving in a “euphoric” manner in recent weeks.
