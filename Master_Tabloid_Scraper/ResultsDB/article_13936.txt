Indeed, back in season 6, the divorced mother of two was demoted to a “friend” of the Housewives following her break up from French businessman boyfriend Jacques Azoulay.
Back in July, Radar was first to report that Frankel caught D’Agostino making out with another woman on camera days before the couple’s engagement party.
“LuAnn was shocked and heartbroken,” a source said. “But she decided to stay with him.”
