“There was a time not too long ago that she thought they’d never get back to this place again,” said the insider, “but they’ve worked through all their skeletons and there’s still real love there.”
“Beyonce knows Jay wants them to move forward and get their lives together back on track — and this is the best way to do it,” continued the insider.
While it remains to be seen if 34-year-old Beyonce will be successful in fulfilling her wish to become a mom again, “she’s trying to time everything so she can surprise him in December, which means planning a lot of one-on-one time together at the end of September, October,” said the insider.
