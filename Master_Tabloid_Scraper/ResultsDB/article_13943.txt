How You Can Help Hurricane Harvey Victims/n

Thousands of residents are stranded and in need of help after Hurricane Harvey brought unprecedented flooding to Southeastern Texas this weekend.
Thankfully, assisting those affected by the natural disaster is just a click away — and there are so many great organizations to choose from.
The American Red Cross is seeking donations to help Harvey victims by opening shelters and distributing supplies all across the Gulf coast.

Celebs and politicians like Barack Obama and Ellen DeGeneres urged their Twitter followers to call 1-800-RED CROSS or text HARVEY to 90999 to make a $10 donation for those in need.
Of course, there are plenty of other organizations currently taking donations for Harvey relief — including Salvation Army Emergency Disaster Services, the South Texas Blood and Tissue Center, and Catholic Charities USA.
See which charities people are talking about (below) so you can give your donations where you see best fit.
