Today we learned Selena Gomez is a “Bad Liar” after days of waiting to see what her new single and music video are all about.

Gomez released the new single for the summer on Thursday (May 18) with a video to match, which is currently a Spotify exclusive. Over the past week, Gomez shared clips and lyrics on her social media accounts leading up to this fateful day when we’d be introduced to the new era of Selena.
“Bad Liar” was co-written with Julia Michaels, the artist behind “Issues,” and Justin Tranter who assisted Gomez on other hits including “Hands to Myself” and “Good for You.”

Gomez samples the Talking Heads’ 1977 song “Psycho Killer” because she and Michaels are both “Talking Heads-obsessed,” according to an interview with Tranter for Variety. Tranter told the publication that Talking Heads frontman David Byrne heard “Bad Liar” prior to its release.
“He heard it, loved it and approved it, which was a pretty crazy moment for us,” Tranter said. “To have David Byrne listed next to our names is just so cool.”
Check out the two songs side-by-side below and watch the music video on Spotify.
