Quick! Sephora's Best Beauty Products Are Up to 50 Percent Off Right Now
/n

Get excited, beauty lovers. Sephora is having a drop-everything-right-now-because-you-can’t-afford-to-miss-this sale with some of the best products marked down at up to 50 percent off. Yeah, we know. This is rare. That’s why things are already starting to sell out. The online-only event has a limited quantity of each of the items. So once they are gone, that’s it—the deal is over.
But it’s definitely worth taking a break from whatever you’re up to because the sale includes some of the goodies that we’ve been eying. Luxury skin-care tools—like the Clarisonic and the Tria—are included in the special event. And there are also amazing fragrances and candles in the mix, too.
You definitely won’t be able to forgive yourself if you miss out on this one. Keep scrolling to see what we’ve already added to our carts.
