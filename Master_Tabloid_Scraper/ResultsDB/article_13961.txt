Real Housewives of Orange County Tamra Judge is showing off her “newly revamped” real house!
The Bravo vet recently updated the kitchen and great room of the California home she shares with husband Eddie. Now, the space is ready for its close up, and is appearing on this week’s episode of Open House.
“This place used to be so dark,” Judge says of the free-flowing living area. “So recently I brightened it up with fresh paint, white cabinets and quartz countertops.”

The entryway boasts a piano “where my daughter loves to play for us,” but her favorite spots are the refreshed sections.
“What I really love about it is this huge island,” say Judge, who is mom to Ryan, 31, Sidney, 18, Spencer, 17 and Sophia, 11. “The kids can sit around it, I can make dinner, they can do their homework or even watch TV. It also opens up to this relaxing family room which is filled with natural light.”

Just outside sits the “Italian-inspired courtyard,” complete with a fire pit, built-in bar and Judge’s own grape vine.
“This year we finally have grapes!” she says. “We have it all out here.”
