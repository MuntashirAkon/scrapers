We've said it before and we'll say it again (and again, and again), denim will never go out of style—mainly becaise there's never a shortage of new kinds.Which brings us to Rita Ora in this edgy Death by Dolls skirt.You're used to keeping lace-up details on top (in T-shirt form, on bodysuits, etc.) and even your footwear, so why not try it on the bottom? This fresh way to wear criss-crossed style is something to pay attention to (think: it'll add instant cool-girl factor to any outfit).

One thing to keep in mind is because of the skirt's sultry nature (and skin-baring ways), you may want to keep what's up top a little more on the reserved side. Throw on a fitted, long-sleeved shirt for a complete day-to-nighttime look.If you're feeling the occasion calls for a dressier vibe, wear heels like Rita! But if it's more of a casual thing the denim staple will be perfect with your go-to sneakers.

No more lace-ups on top.

Well, at least for now.
