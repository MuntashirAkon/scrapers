Iggy Azalea & Rita Ora -- Anemic Vegas Offer to Perform/nIggy Azalea and Rita Ora ﻿are huge stars, but based on a new Vegas offer they're not getting their due respect.The  "Black Widow " singers have been courted to perform 2 shows at Planet Hollywood ... for $200K per show, and that's for both.Taking home $100K apiece doesn't sound bad for a night's work, but compared to what Britney and Celine Dion pull in -- around $475K each --  it's chump change. We're told Iggy and Rita said thanks, but no thanks./n
