Beyonce Clears Rita Ora from the 'Becky' List /nJudge BeyonceÂ has made her ruling and it appears Rita Ora has been acquitted in the mysterious  "Who the hell is Becky? " case. The singers were smiling and hanging together inside the Met Gala -- perhaps putting an end to rumors Rita is the  "Becky with the good hair " that Bey refers to in  "Sorry. " Rita posted a Snapchat and included the  "Family " caption. For good measure, she slapped on a  "Not Becky " name tag at an after-party. Okay, okay ... we get it, Rita! Case closed./n
