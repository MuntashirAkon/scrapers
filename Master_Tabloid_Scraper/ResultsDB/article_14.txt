Amber Rose Disses Kardashians Behind The Scenes On 'Fashion Police'/n
Amber Rose‘s long standing feud with the Keeping up with the Kardashians clan had seemingly come to an end months ago when the bald-headed stripper made amends and buried the ratchet hatchet. But while filming last night’s episode of E!’s Fashion Police, Rose proved that old frenemies die hard! An on-set source tells RadarOnline.com she dissed the reality family behind the scenes.
When Melissa Rivers, 47, asked the other panelists – Giuliana Rancic, 41, Margaret Cho, 46, and Brad Goreski, 38 – their opinions of Kendall and Kylie Jenner‘s AMAs outfits, the source said the panel purposely skipped over Rose.
“Amber told the producers and Melissa beforehand that she refused to say a word about any of the Kardashians,” a production insider said.

And the audience took notice, as one fan on Twitter wrote, “Crying @ them skipping Amber Rose when talking about Kendall.”

“Amber is done talking about all of those girls,” said source. “She knows that silence is the best shade of all.”
As Radar previously reported, Rose’s feud with the Kardashian clan began after Kim Kardashian, 35, allegedly stole 38-year-old Kanye West from Rose.
The war of the Rose continued when she got into another online altercation with 31-year-old Khloe Kardashian over her views on Khloe’s younger sister Kylie dating her BFF Blac Chyna‘s baby-daddy Tyga, 26.
