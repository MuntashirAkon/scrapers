“I know Kendra has a relationship with our dad but growing up he was never around in our lives, so if I never saw him again in my life I really don’t care,” Colin shared in an interview.
But Colin’s frustrations grow deeper when Kendra tells him their dad will be coming with his new wife, Amy, whom Kendra calls their “stepmom.”
“So he’s remarried again for how many times that is?!” Colin asks while Kendra quips, “I think it’s the fourth or something. She’s fun, she’s crazy, she’s our stepmom…whether you like it or not, she’s our stepmom.”

But Colin disagrees, telling the cameras, “She’s not my stepmom, he was never a father to me so she cannot possibly be my stepmom.”
I have no interest in talking to him at all or having any kind of interaction with him,” Colin continues, “I don’t want to see him. I have nothing to say to him.”
Do you think Colin should forgive his father? Sound off in the comments!
