Click through these slides to find out what went down between the family!2 of 9    I am so sad this weekend is coming to a close. It seems like we've waited forever for the day to arrive that molly jo and joel would get married, and now it's already over! I have been so emotional this week. I love Jo so much and I am so happy for her.  She is the sister I never had and to watch her be so unbelievably happy has made my heart swell with happiness. Weddings are such a beautiful reminder of love between family and friends. I don't mean sound annoying but I feel like my heart might burst from the love I feel. Love for my husband. Love for my son. Love for my seestor. Love for my family. Love for my friends. I have cried so many tears of joy as I was reminded just how important these things are. ‚ù§Ô∏è #zandtpartyofthree #storyofzachandtori #seestorsfolyfe A post shared by Tori Roloff (@toriroloff) on Aug 6, 2017 at 9:03pm PDT

7 of 9    Well ... we gave away our Amazing Molly jo ...the most gorgeous bride ever!  To her New husband Joel today.  Molly  is the apple of her  mother and MY eyes ...Amy and I are gushing with pride of her character, faith, heart for God, wisdom and judgment... especially her choice in picking her life mate.  molly lives her life straight ahead (we daddy daughtered danced that song from Amy Grant tonight). Her guest strolled through a stunning wildflower patch that had been rolled down a path in the minutes before the ceremony so the guest could make the walk as if they were floating on a rainbow of Colors  As they walked to the ceremony area... set deep in a grove under several 100 yr old oak trees that molly played on as a little girl.  The guest sat on custom made rustic bences specifically designed and build on roloff farm to match the intimate setting... molly and I were able to spend 20 minutes of quality time visiting and sharing our love as father and daughter As we pulled up to the ceremony in one of our special roloff farm all terrain rigs.  I then escorted my dear molly down a rustic wood chip path to  hand her off to Joel. Waiting patiently to take her hand in marriage.  After several biblical scriptures were read they exchanged private vows and commitments to each other.  They kissed and we all erupted in celebration and joy.  It was an amazing wedding day that went off without a single hitch. It was a magical ferry-tail wedding for 2 incredible people that we all love very much.
