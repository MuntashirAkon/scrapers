Like all of us, Harry Styles finds Ryan Gosling to be quite attractive.

During a recent appearance on Nick Grimshaw’s BBC Radio 1 show, the “Sign of the Times” crooner was hooked up to a heart monitor as he was shown several images of famous celebrities, including a photo of a shirtless Gosling. The One Direction singer’s heart jumped when he saw the steamy picture as he complimented the Canadian actor for “looking very handsome” in what he described as “a good scene.”
While promoting Blade Runner 2049 at the San Diego Comic-Con this weekend, the father-of-two took the time to respond to the heart-racing episode.

“I’m more concerned he might have a heart condition. It’s less about me and more about something more serious,” he told Extra. “My prayers are with him and I hope he has a safe and swift recovery.”
Be still our hearts!
