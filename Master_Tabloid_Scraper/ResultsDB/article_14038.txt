Britney Spears can’t get enough of her boyfriend!

Not only did she have Sam Asghari join her on the Asia leg of her world tour, but the singer also recently incorporated her hunky beau in her act. While playing in Taipei, Taiwan this Tuesday (June 13, 2017), Britney invited the model on stage to for an impromptu performance.
During “Freakshow,” the 35-year-old slapped a dog harness on her man before walking him on a leash. Like a good boyfriend, Sam happily obliged.
“Everybody give it up for my boyfriend Sam!” Britney told the crowd after giving the 23-year-old a playful spanking.
The couple, who met on the set of 2016’s “Slumber Party” music video, then shared a steamy kiss as fans cheered.

Earlier this year, the “Make Me Ooh” songstress revealed she was the first one to make a move. Explaining how she had “no idea who the hell he [was]” when they were co-stars, Britney said she eventually asked him out when she found his phone number in her purse.
“I kept his number, and it was so weird because it was like five months later that I found his number in my bag. I was like ‘He was really cute. This guy was really cute!’ so then I called him,” she told AMP 103.7’s Fast in the Morning show. “He is just a really fun, funny person.”
