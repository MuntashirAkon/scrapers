Naturally, Lindsay couldn’t help but to document the weekend on her Instagram Story. The star shared a photo of herself and Abasolo cuddling close.
Later that night, the love birds swapped their swimming gear for some classy duds. They headed to a soirée where they met up with a few Bachelorette contestants that Lindsay sent packing.
“When you get along with your exes,” she wrote on a photo of herself and Abasolo posing with Josiah, Will and Matt.
