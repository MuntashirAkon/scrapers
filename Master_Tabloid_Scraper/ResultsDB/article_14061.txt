Amy Schumer Visits Ex Co-Workers at Michael Jordan's Joint/nAmy Schumer's gladly hanging on to her past, and to a couple old co-workers from back in her days waiting tables at Michael Jordan's famous restaurant. Amy went back to Jordan's The Steak House Thursday in NYC ... where she used to be a server back in '04. These days Amy's hauling in a little more than she did then -- $37.5 mil in 2017, according to Forbes. But she was still down to reminisce with Milton and Edgar -- who she worked with back then. Amy also posed with Eddie, who's now a service manager. We're told Amy called in advance to order and pay for her meal -- filet mignon with a side of creamed spinach. Eddie hooked up Amy in MJ's private dining room. And yeah, Amy paid it forward ... leaving an $80 cash tip on her $67 lunch tab./n
