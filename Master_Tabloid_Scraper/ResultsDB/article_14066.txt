Kathy Hilton Can't Tell If She Doesn't Like Amy Adams or Isla Fisher/nKathy Hilton does NOT appreciate A-list actresses allegedly snubbing her or fans --- even if it is Amy Adams ... or Isla Fisher ... or whoever just walked by.  We got the Hilton family Saturday night at Craig's where they were talking about a possible wedding between Paris Hilton and BF Chris Zylka ... when all of a sudden a female star walked by and hijacked the moment with paps. Our camera guy wrongly ID'd the celeb -- it was actually Amy, not Isla. Either way ... Kathy isn't a fan. As far as we can tell, Kathy says the star wouldn't take a pic inside the restaurant with a fan, and on top of that didn't thank Ms. Hilton for a compliment about her dress.  New beef?/n
