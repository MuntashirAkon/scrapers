Kim Kardashian is “furious” over RadarOnline.com’s recent videos showing the KUWTK beauty partying hard, RadarOnline.com can reveal.
“Kim feels incredibly humiliated by everything that has come out about her in these past couple of weeks,” a source close to the 36-year-old wife of Kanye West, 39, said. “She’s in crisis mode.”

“They are trying to come up with a serious damage control plan that will include Kim doing work for more charitable causes, as well as speaking out against drugs and alcohol in an attempt to keep her image classy,” said the insider.
As Radar previously reported, last week fans accused Kardashian of doing drugs when she posted a photo on Instagram showing two lines of a suspicious white powder in the background. She vehemently denied the claims, saying the powder was just candy.
That same week, Radar revealed vintage videos of Kardashian smoking what looked like marijuana with ex-boyfriend Ray J and partying all over Mexico.

“Kim’s biggest fear was that she was going to have to relive the Ray J drama, and now she is,” the insider told Radar. “She knows that people can see through her now, and she is just devastated!”
