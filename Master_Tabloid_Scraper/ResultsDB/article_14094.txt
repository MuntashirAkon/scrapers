That's Rich! Out-Of-Touch Kim Caught On Camera Bragging About Charity/n
Kim Kardashian claims she actively gives to charity, but in an exclusive home movie uncovered by RadarOnline.com, the poor little rich girl brags she almost gave a poor street vendor $20 just to leave her alone!
Kardashian and then-boyfriend Ray J videotaped each other enjoying a beach day during an October 2003 trip to Cabo San Lucas for Kardashian’s 23rd birthday – the same trip during which they filmed their infamous sex tape, Kim Kardashian Superstar.
Drinking and taking in the picture-perfect scene, they couldn’t help but comment on just how different their jet setting lives looked from those of the less-fortunate locals around them.

As a young girl walked by their table carrying a purse, Ray can be heard saying, “Hustling at a young age, gotta get that money!”
Kardashian makes sympathetic noises over her beer, and Ray turns the camera on her, saying, “It breaks your heart? Why don’t you give a speech about it?”

“That other lady who was pressuring me to buy something, I almost wanna just give her like $20,” she rants. “You know that would like make her whole day. That would probably make someone’s whole week. It’s so sad to me.”
“You gave her $200 it would make her whole day,” Ray cautions.
Kardashian laughs, “It would make like her whole year!” before taking a drink of her beer.
