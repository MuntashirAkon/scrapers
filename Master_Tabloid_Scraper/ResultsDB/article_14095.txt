Kim Gone Wild! Never-Before-Seen Video Of Her Craziest Party Ever/n
Boozed up and getting down! Kim Kardashian was a typical tourist party girl during her 23rd birthday trip to Mexico, and RadarOnline.com has the incredible never-before-seen video.
Stumbling around a dark club’s dance floor holding a bottle of beer, Kardashian looks like an extra from Girls Gone Wild in the gritty clip.
“Woohoo Cabo!” she screams before giggling and sucking face with then-boyfriend Ray J.

The couple put on such a steamy show that a random bystander approached and told Kardashian’s future sex tape partner, “I don’t know you, but you the man … Nice girl.”
Indeed, Ray seemed intent on treating his girlfriend like a queen during the October 2003 birthday trip.
After flying in on a private jet, they holed up in a luxury suite for several days for fun in the sun – and late-night activities.

Ray J even serenaded her at the club, rapping to 50 Cent’s “In Da Club,” “Go Kim, Go Kim, it’s your birthday!”
As Radar reported, the couple would film their infamous sex tape, Kim Kardashian Superstar on that trip.
When it was released four years later in 2007 – without Kardashian’s involvement, she’s claimed – the XXX-rated tape made them both stars.
