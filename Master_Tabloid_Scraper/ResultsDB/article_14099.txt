No Photoshop Here! Boozed-Up Kim’s Bikini Beach Day Caught On Camera/n
Kim Kardashian claims she “can’t stand” the taste of alcohol, but she happily slurped down a tropical drink in this never-before-seen home video!
RadarOnline.com has exclusively uncovered a treasure trove of home movies from Kardashian’s 23rd birthday trip to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, with then-boyfriend Ray J. And the jaw-dropping clips reveal a side of Kardashian that she might not want the world to see!
Smoking, groping her boyfriend in public, and sucking on a suspicious pipe, Kardashian is the consummate party girl in the explosive footage.

In the clip seen here, she and her future sex tape partner take their party to the beach after a smoked-up jet-ski session.
Giggling uncontrollably and sipping on a tropical drink nearly the size of her head, Kardashian is a far cry from the tightly controlled image she presents to the world today.
She even happily sits on a plastic chair, and wears cheap orange gym shorts and a white tank top for the outing.
Of course, the curves underneath those clothes are clearly from a different era, too.

Kardashian made waves recently when eye-watering photos of her giant, dimpled beach booty leaked – photos which she insisted were photoshopped.
There’s certainly no image alteration in the home movie obtained by Radar, but her butt seems like that of another woman.
Kardashian has admitted to having butt injections in the years since, but insists it’s just a treatment for her psoriasis.
