Revenge Romance! Naomi Going For 'Beefy' Hunk After Liev Caught With Model/n
Liev Schreiber and Naomi Watts are breaking the rules they laid down to get through their split after 11 years together!
When Schreiber, 49, and Watts, 48, announced their separation last September, they promised not to be seen on public dates with other people for an entire year.

But when RadarOnline caught the Ray Donovan star in some serious PDAs with former model and Gerard Butler‘s ex, Morgan Brown, 41, Watts was far from happy — and our sources say she’s now seeking revenge with a little side loving of her own!
“Naomi didn’t think that was cool of Liev,” a source told Radar. “After years of living together and two kids,” Sasha, 9, and Samuel, 8, “she felt Liev could’ve been a lot more discreet and used some tact.”
But he didn’t, and Watts is ready to rip up their failed agreement.

“Now she knows she can do the same thing — and she will,” said the source.
No word yet on who the Oscar-nominated star will link up with, but the source would not be surprised “if it’s another beefy, leading-man type.”
