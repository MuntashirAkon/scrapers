Gigi Hadid WILL Return To The Victoria's Secret Fashion Show With Sister Bella!/n

The lingerie gods have answered your prayers!
In the past few days, models have taken to social media to confirm (or deny) their appearance in the upcoming Victoria's Secret Fashion Show!
Photos: The Most Insane VS Fails!
While regulars like Adriana Lima, Alessandra Ambrosio, and more have officially been confirmed, Gigi Hadid was totally silent, leading many to believe she wasn't going to walk this year's big show.
Fortunately for her fans, she 100% is!
On Monday, Miz Hadid announced she will strut her stuff on the VS catwalk for her third straight year! She posted the exciting news on Instagram: 




Forever and ever and ever a dream come true to be asked back to the VS Show !!! 🙌🏼 Thank you my friends @ed_razek @10magazine @johndavidpfeiffer @monica.mitro for another unforgettable opportunity; every aspect makes me feel like a dreaming kid again 🕊🕊🖤 (as shown here at last year's fitting, by @jeromeduran)! ☁️ @victoriassecret #VSFS2017A post shared by Gigi Hadid (@gigihadid) on Aug 28, 2017 at 12:05pm PDT


Sister Bella Hadid is returning for her second year as well.
