Kesha Looks Rough In Ruffles On The MTV VMAs Red Carpet/n

Send help, ruffles are swallowing up Kesha!
The Praying singer looked overwhelmed in a nude Monsoori ball gown with tiered ruffle skirt at the MTV VMAs in LA Sunday. The sleeves were out of control, and we feel like the color also washed her out a bit.
A fishtail braid and smokey eye completed the look, which unfortunately wasn't her best endeavor.
How do U feel about this ensem???
