Chris Brown gave a graphic blow-by-blow about his assault on Rihanna in 2009.

In his new documentary, Chris Brown: Welcome to My Life, the “Loyal” crooner revealed there were multiple violent incidents during his relationship with the singer. According to him, the most frightening was the one that occurred on Feb. 8, 2009 — when he attacked her in a car following a Grammys party.
Via TMZ:
Brown says it all started when she was going through text messages on his phone and she found something she didn’t like.
Brown says Rihanna was upset — and things escalated quickly.
“I remember she tried to kick me, but then I really hit her, with a closed fist, I punched her.”
“I busted her lip. When I saw it, I was in shock. I was like, ‘F*ck, why the hell did I hit her?'”
“From there she just spit in my face … spit blood in my face and it enraged me even more.”
Brown says Rihanna got out of the car and began to scream for help — saying, “He’s trying to kill me.”
