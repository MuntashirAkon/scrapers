The Kardashians aren’t happy with Caitlyn Jenner’s latest stunt.

The family is said to be furious at the Olympian after she was photographed riding around town wearing President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” red cap. A source claims the I Am Cait star purposefully wore the hat to please Republicans party amid backlash against plans to ban transgender people from the U.S. military, saying “Caitlyn has always been about Caitlyn.”
Via TMZ:
The Kardashian family believes Caitlyn Jenner has betrayed the transgender community by sticking with Donald Trump after the President vowed to ban transgender soldiers from the military.
Sources with first-hand knowledge tell us, Caitlyn’s latest stunt — parading around Malibu wearing a “Make America Great Again” cap is an affront to the community she claims to champion. The family believes Caitlyn promotes transgender rights in a very selective way — when it helps her.
