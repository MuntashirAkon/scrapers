Ariel Winter is feeling cheeky these days.

The Modern Family star took to her Snapchat Sunday to show off her tatted up butt. Situated on the side of her right cheek, the delicate design read: “Love risks everything and asks for nothing.”

Last month, the 19-year-old expanded her body art collection by getting not one, but two matching tats with boyfriend Levi Meaden. As reported, the two — who started dating last year — each got half of a red heart along with finger tattoos of a piece of cheese and a peanut butter jar.
“Peanut butter and cheese with my love,” the actress wrote on Snapchat at the time.
Ariel also has a snake tattoo just above the Roman numerals — a design she shares with sister Shanelle Gray — on her forearm. Other tats on her body include a spade on her inner right wrist, the tiger on her upper back, and the initials of her five nieces and nephews on her ribcage.
