We'll never forget Miley Cyrus' controversial MTV VMAs performance, and neither will be. And neither will her father.Hours before her return to the award show's stage, the 24-year-old pop star posted on her Instagram page a popular meme of her 2013 VMAs performance, showing her twerking on co-performer Robin Thicke, with an image of a stern-looking Billy Ray Cyrus pasted in the background."Sorry Dad.... I'll be good tonight I promise ... @vmas," she wrote.Miley's infamous performance marked one of the most controversial ones ever seen at the VMAs and came at a time when she started to project a sexier image after years of starring on the Disney Channel's Hannah Montana. She has since revamped her image again.

Miley returned to the VMAs stage in 2014 and 2015, when she hosted the ceremony.She is set to perform at the 2017 MTV VMAs, which air live from the Forum in Los Angeles on MTV Sunday at 8 p.m. ET.
