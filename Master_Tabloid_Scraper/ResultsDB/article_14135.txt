Thanks to dear old dad and late-night TV, one of Ray Romano's son finally found a date.Earlier this week on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, the actor introduced his 24-year-old son Matt Romano, who works on the talk show, saying, "Ladies, he's a good kid, good listener. He keeps his room clean. He's had all of his shots...You still have a car. Jimmy Kimmel is his uncle."On The Late Late Show With James Corden Thursday night, host James Corden talked about the attempt to get Matt a date and noted that his twin brother Greg Romano works on his own talk show, so it would only be fair to help him get a date as well.

Ray then fired off a few more questions, including "Seinfeld or Everybody Loves Raymond?"Eventually, Julia got to pick the winner and the lucky audience member was summoned to the stage, where James told her that she and Greg would be sent to go on a real date...that very moment.Of course, there were hidden cameras allowing the audience and dear old dad to peek in, and Ray was unimpressed with his son's rather dull conversational skills."What kind of date is this?" he joked.
