She also shared several other photos with her dad from inside the event."Had the best date in the whole damn place tonight!!" she captioned one photo, snuggling up for a close-up with Billy while wearing a Baja East jacket and pants. "love ya pops youre a badass! @billyraycyrus."Of course, having her family's support is nothing new for Noah who is constantly uplifted by love from her parents, including Tish Cyrus, and her sister, Miley Cyrus.For example, when she performed her single "Make Me (Cry)" at the 2017 iHeartRadio Music Awards, her whole family was there to show their support. Not only did Miley introduce her, the proud big sis even held up an "I love Noah Cyrus" sign throughout the performance."This next performer is, without a doubt, the coolest person I know. Her voice is amazing, her songwriting is beautiful and relatable," Miley shared while introducing Noah. "She's who I want to be when I grow up, and that's saying a lot, 'cause she's younger than me."

Speaking of Miley, Noah opened up to E! News at the press day for the MTV Movie & TV Awards and dished some details about her big sister's upcoming song "Malibu.""Yeah, I've heard 'Malibu!'" she told us. "It's so great. I mean Miley's super talented, and just like she supports me, I support her and her career and her music. I'm super excited for her."As for the question we've all been dying to know: Will the sisters collaborate in the future?

"Maybe! I mean, we're sisters, so we're going to know each other for a while," Noah laughed. "So there's definitely time for it!"
