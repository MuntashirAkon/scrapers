Billy Ray Cyrus has had a few crazy nights in his life—but he doesn't regret any of them."Well, I think all of them were fun so I don't want to take any of them back," he told E! News' Carissa Culiner while promoting his new CMT comedy, Still the King, in which he plays a washed up former country singer/current Elvis impersonator who discovers he has a daughter he didn't know about.One time in particular was memorable, considering it took him to jail. "One night in my senior year I got a little bit more than a little bit intoxicated and threw eggs all over my principal's house. Bad idea, and even worse getting caught," he confessed.But you know what happens when you mess up? You make amends and move on. "I had to go back and start picking things up, which kind of brings us to Vernon," he said. "In a way, Vernon is trying to fix his whole lifelong journey of messing some things up, in particular not even knowing that he had a 15-year-old daughter."

Despite being a screwup, Vernon is a good soul. "Vernon's really got a great heart—he really wants to do good, but he just can't help himself," Cyrus said. "It's easier to go downhill than it is up. Vernon, as hard as he tries, he tends to find a little bit of trouble."Press play on the video above to find out how Billy Ray could indirectly be responsible for Blake Shelton's success on The Voice (thanks to some sage advice on the set of Hannah Montana), and the disaster that occurred when he tried to flex his handyman muscles and build a treehouse for little Miley Cyrus.Still the King premieres Sunday, June 12 at 9 p.m. on CMT.
