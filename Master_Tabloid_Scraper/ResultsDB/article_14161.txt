Gregg Sulkin with and New Girl Post Bella Thorne /nGregg Sulkin has bounced back from Bella Thorne with lightening speed. Photogs got Gregg at Monday Bourgeois Pig in Hollywood with Instagram model Sahara Ray. Â They hung out for an hour, downed a little java and made of point of showing they've hooked up. The actor had been dating Bella for about a year and broke up shortly before she jetted off to Cannes with Scott Disick, bailed on him and then hooked up with Scott again when he returned to L.A. No skin off Gregg's teeth./n
