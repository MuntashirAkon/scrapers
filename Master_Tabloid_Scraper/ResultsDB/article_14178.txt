Arnold Schwarzenegger: 'I Still Hope For Reconciliation, I Still Love Maria’  /n
Arnold Schwarzenegger once famously proclaimed, “I’ll be back” – now, he’s hoping ex-wife Maria Shriver feels the same.
Arnold told Germany’s Bild newspaper he spent the holidays with his ex-wife and their kids, and continues to hold a good thought about the prospects of reuniting.

“We’re not fighting a war,” the former California governor told the paper. “I still hope for reconciliation… I still love Maria.”
The couple’s 25-year marriage ended in shocking fashion nearly two years ago, when news broke he’d had a love child with their former housekeeper, Mildred Baena. In his 2012 book Total Recall: My Unbelievably True Life Story, the 65-year-old recalled with regret how he broke the news to Maria during a therapy session.

“The minute we sat down, the therapist turned to me and said, ‘Maria wanted to come here today and to ask about a child – whether you fathered a child with your housekeeper Mildred,'” he wrote. “I told the therapist, ‘It’s true.'”
In his memoir, Arnold said he bedded Mildred in 1996 while Maria was away on vacation and he was in Southern California filming Batman & Robin.
