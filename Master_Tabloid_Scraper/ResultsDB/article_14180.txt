Whitney Houston Funeral Costs Outrage Newark Taxpayers/n
By Radar Staff
They lined the streets to pay their respects to a pop diva. Now Newark, New Jersey residents are outraged that $187,000 of their money will be used to pay for policing Whitney Houston’s funeral.
Nearly 200 cops were on hand to keep the crowds away from the singer’s glitzy ceremony on February 18. While celebrities like Kevin Costner and Alicia Keyes paid respect to the singer in New Hope Baptist Church, thousands of residents grieved in the cold outside.

Now CBS reports the city will foot the overtime bill for the cops that stood outside the church, the funeral home and the reception after the service.
One Newark resident, Quincy Ruffin, told CBS that the star’s family should pay. Another resident Minerva DelValle said: “I think it was a waste of time and then now we find out what happened and how she actually died, it makes you think twice saying: ‘Was it worth it or not?’”

As RadarOnline.com previously reported, cocaine was found in Whitney’s system and in the hotel bathroom where she died.
Newark Councilwoman Mildred Crump believes the police overtime was justified. She said: “If they had not been there someone may have been trampled, seriously hurt.”
