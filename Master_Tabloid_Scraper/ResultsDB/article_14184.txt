“Maria has absolutely no plans to reconcile with Arnold. He was pressuring her during the holidays to get back together. They did spend a lot of time together during that time, but it was for the children only. They get along very well, but Maria can’t ever trust him again. Arnold begged for his forgiveness, and she did forgive him. This relationship comes down to the utter betrayal of trust, and she just can’t forget that,” a source close to the situation tells us.
