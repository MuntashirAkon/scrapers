Arnold Schwarzenegger Celebrates His Son Joseph Baena's 19th Birthday With A Trip To Germany & A Rare Instagram Shout Out!/n

This melts our hearts.
Following years of estrangement, Arnold Schwarzenegger and son Joseph Baena are slowly developing a relationship.
As we previously reported, Arnold fathered Joseph with his former housekeeper and lover Mildred Baena around the same time his ex-wife Maria Shriver gave birth to son Christopher Schwarzenegger. The athlete then went on to quietly support Joseph and Mildred until the affair was exposed in 2011.

Unfortunately, Mr. Schwarzenegger missed out on a lot of important events in Baena's life including his graduation from high school. It's especially heartbreaking considering the teen graduated with honors.
Now that J.B. is a college student at Pepperdine University, it looks like the two have let bygones be bygones. The wrestler even went as far to whisk Joseph away to Germany for his 19th birthday on Sunday.
To make matters even sweeter, Arnie gifted Baena with an Instagram b-day shoutout. Considering we've never seen the college kid on the icon's IG before, this is a BIG deal!
Mr. Schwarzenegger captioned the cute shot (above)!
"Happy birthday, Joseph. Great student, great athlete. I'm proud of you and I love you!"
How sweet! We're glad Joseph is finally getting the love and attention he deserves.
Enjoy the rest of Oktoberfest, you guys!
