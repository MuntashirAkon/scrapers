First Trailer For Loving Shows The Fight For Interracial Marriage — Plus 9 Other Movies Already Getting Oscar Buzz!/n

Love wins… historically speaking.
Focus Features dropped the trailer for the upcoming film Loving on Tuesday, which tells the real-life story of an interracial couple's courage and commitment to live as a family.
Joel Edgerton and Ruth Negga star as Richard and Mildred Loving, a Virginia couple who were arrested in 1959 and sentenced to a year in prison for their interracial marriage.
The couple's nine-year fight for the right to marry led to their civil rights case (Loving v. Virginia) going all the way to the Supreme Court, which ultimately ended all race-based marriage restrictions in the U.S.
Taking Cannes by storm, the Jeff Nichols directed film is already getting major Oscar buzz — but this civil rights love story isn't the only film that could score a nomination from the Academy.
