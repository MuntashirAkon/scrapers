Kate is a pro at winning Golden Globes!
It was a tight race this year in the category for Best Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture â€” with stunning roles like Helen Mirren in Trumbo and Jennifer Jason Leigh's career comeback performance in The Hateful Eight!
But it was Kate Winslet who managed to win the trophy for her supporting role in Steve Jobs for playing the Apple guru's righthand woman Joanna Hofmann!
Kate also beat out Jane Fonda in Youth and Alicia Vikander in Ex Machina to mark her fourth win!
The 40-year-old previously took home Globes for her roles in The Reader, Revolutionary Road, and Mildred Pierce!
Watch the actress's sweet speech (above) like it's her first win ever!
