Australian Parliament Member Laughed So Hard At 'Veep' He Almost Died, For Real/nAustralian Parliament member Graham Perrett ﻿says the combination of sushi and HBO's  "Veep " almost killed him, and he has the scars to prove it. Perrett was sitting at home with his wife watching season 6, episode 1 when he laughed so hard at one of the jokes ... well, he tells the story better than us.  Check out the scene ... it's pretty damn funny. Julia Louis-Dreyfus was not a believer when she heard the story, but when you think about it ... it's high praise.  I mean, c'mon, I'm actually having a hard time believing it. But the real question is - what episode? https: / /t.co /sqGyRT8e0z — Julia Louis-Dreyfus (@OfficialJLD) May 3, 2017/n
