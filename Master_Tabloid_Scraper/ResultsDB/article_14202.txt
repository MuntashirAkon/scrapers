Arnold Schwarzenegger took his son Joseph Baena to Oktoberfest this year to celebrate Baena’s 19th birthday, and it looks like the two had a grand time.
In a photo shared on Instagram, Schwarzenegger and Baena wore traditional lederhosen and raise their steins at the beer festival in Munich, Germany.
“Happy birthday, Joseph,” the action star captioned the pic. “Great student, great athlete. I’m proud of you and I love you!”

Baena is Schwarzenegger’s son with his former housekeeper, Mildred Baena, and their affair is what led to the dissolution of his marriage to Maria Shriver in 2011 after 25 years.
The 69-year-old actor told Howard Stern (via People) he is proud of Joseph on how he has handled the “tough situation.”
“He’s terrific and he totally understands the situation,” said Schwarzenegger. “So, it all has worked out … It’s a very tough situation for him. It’s a very tough situation for my kids, very tough situation for my family. It was tough for everybody. But it has happened and now we have to figure it out, right?”
Schwarzenegger’s girlfriend, Heather Milligan, also joined them in Germany.
