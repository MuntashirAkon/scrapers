Big Sean just debuted his most personal music video yet for his collaboration with Kanye West and John Legend on “One Man Can Change the World.”
The song — the third single off his latest album Dark Sky Paradise — is a dedication to his late grandmother, Mildred V. Leonard. She was his hero (and an American hero at that), overcoming racism, sexism and poverty to become of the first black female captains to fight in World War II and one of the first black female women to become a police officer in Detroit, the rapper’s hometown. Leonard also spent a majority of her life serving the Detroit public school system as a teacher and a counselor.

The piece is emotional, raw and the perfect means to diving a little deeper into Sean’s life.
