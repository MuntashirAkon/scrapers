 Remember that famous Vanity Fair cover from back in July 2003? It featured some of the most popular females in Hollywood like Evan Rachel Wood, Amanda Bynes, Ashley Olsen, Mary-Kate Olsen, Mandy Moore, Hilary Duff, Alexis Bledel, Raven-Symoné, and Lindsay Lohan.
It seems like it would’ve been a blast to be a part of, but it turns out that wasn’t the case for at least one of the ladies. Wood just took to Twitter to comment on the shoot, saying she, “felt like meat.” Read on to see Wood’s tweets about the cover shoot!
It’s been 11 years since that cover was shot, and all of the ladies on the cover are currently at very different stages in their lives. Most went on to do great work, grow their empires, and start families. While others have faced some troubles over the years.
One of the ladies is now reflecting on the shoot, and speaking out about how it made her feel. We’ve always been in love with this cover, but we didn’t know what happened behind-the-scenes. Take a look at what Wood had to say about shooting the famous cover. After a fan tweeted the photo, Wood responded with a series of Tweets.

Side note , I have shot the cover of “vanity fair” since and had a much different experience. It was quite lovely.

I begged for pants. “@YouWonScience: @katiexwright I’m surprised any of you were allowed to wear pants, ridiculous”

I think when you are young and inexperienced and shy you can be bullied more. I learned to say no. @rachelm97x
