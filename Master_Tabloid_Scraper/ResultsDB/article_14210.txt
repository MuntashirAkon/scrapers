Kate Winslet turns 37 today, and Celebuzz is celebrating by taking a look back at the Oscar-winning beauty’s best moments on the red carpet.
After bursting onto the screen in the 1994 psychological drama Heavenly Creatures and the 1995 literary romantic comedy Sense and Sensibility, Winslet quickly became one of the most stylish women in Hollywood.
This was especially true at the 2002 Oscars, when she stole the show in a red floral dress by little-known designer Ben de Lisi.

From there, Winslet continued to wow on the red carpet, donning looks that defined her grace, elegance and style.

But it was in 2011 when Winslet truly knocked it out of the park, mixing looks that were both timeless and modern as she promoted the HBO miniseries Mildred Pierce.
