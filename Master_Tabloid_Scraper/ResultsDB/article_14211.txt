We can't blame Mildred Baena for being curious about what Arnold Schwarzenegger has to say.And Thursday at an outdoor café in Bakersfield, Calif., the housekeeper-turned-mistress delved into the ex-Governator's autobiography, Total Recall: My Unbelievably True Life Story.Although their infamous affair resulted in an illegitimate love child born during his marriage to Maria Shriver it was largely omitted from the 650-page memoir.

"Mildred had been working in our household for five years and all of the sudden we were alone in the guest house," he writes concisely in the book. "When Mildred gave birth the following August, she named the baby Joseph."Use your imagination to fill in the blanks!
