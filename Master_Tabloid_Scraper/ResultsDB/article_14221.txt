Another hour, another Arnold Schwarzenegger revelation.E! News has obtained the divorce documents filed by the Sperminator's housekeeper/assistant/mistress, Mildred Patricia Baena, and discovered she isn't acually divorced.Say what?!

We'll explain.According to her petition, Mildred married husband Rogelio on Nov. 14, 1987. She lists the date of their separation as Oct. 23, 1997—just 21 days after the birth of her son with Schwarzenegger. Curiously, the divorce documents list the couple as having no children, even though Rogelio is clearly listed as the father on the child's birth certificate.Not so curiously, the filing lists irreconcilable differences as the reason for the split.However, despite being separated for well over a decade, she didn't officially file for divorce until Feb. 13, 2008.But for some reason, the California-based Mildred didn't serve her husband (who currently resides 3,000 miles away from her in New York City) with the papers until last year, which means their divorce is still pending.And this whole mess keeps getting crazier.
