Arnold Schwarzenegger's Love Child -- I'M HUUUUUUUGE /nIf there was any doubt Arnold Schwarzenegger shtuped his former maid .... DOUBT NO MORE ... 'cause his love child is about to turn 16 -- and he looks just like his humungous father.Standing roughly 8'2 " and weighing an estimated 475 lbs (pure muscle) ... genetic jackpot winnerÂ  Joseph Baena strolled alongside his mother Mildred during a shopping excursion in Bakersfield, CA yesterday. Joseph was sporting a shirt from a swimming and diving competition -- it's unclear if he participated, but we're guessing if he did, he dominated ... based purely on his enormous physique. Fun Fact -- Arnold first began competitive bodybuilding around the age of 16 ... and eventually excelled in competitive adultery. Happy birthday Joe!/n
