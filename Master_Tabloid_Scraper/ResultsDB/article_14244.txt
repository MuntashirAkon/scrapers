Arnold Schwarzenegger Dropped $65,000 on Baby Mama Mildred Patricia Baena's House/nArnold Schwarzenegger made a $65,000 down payment on a house for his ex-housekeeper Mildred Patricia Baena -- less than a year before he admitted to fathering her child ... TMZ has learned.According to loan documents obtained by TMZ, Arnold made the  "gift " payments in two installments from his own personal bank account -- one for $5,000 in April 2010 ... and one for $60,000 in May 2010.According to the docs, the money was used to secure a loan for Patty's house in Bakersfield, CA -- where she currently lives with Arnold's 13-year-old love child.The purchase price of the house was $268,000 -- so Arnold's down payment covered nearly a quarter of the total cost.It's unclear if Maria was aware of the transaction at the time./n
