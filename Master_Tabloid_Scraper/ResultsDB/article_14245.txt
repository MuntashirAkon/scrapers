Arnold and Maria's Ex-Nanny: 'He Never Touched ME!'/nArnold Schwarzenegger was strictly a one household staffer type of guy -- this according to a former nanny who claims the governator had a wandering eye, but never got physical with her or any other female staffer.Â  The nanny -- who worked with Arnold and Maria Shriver during the Mildred  "Patty " Baena years -- tells TMZ Arnold  "was a flirt, but he never touched me inappropriately, or anyone else that I could tell. "The former staffer believes Patty must have aggressively pursued Arnold since -- as far as she could tell -- he was  "respectful " of all the other female staffers.The woman says many employees realized the resemblance between Patty's young son and Arnold -- but says Patty would only admit her husband was not the daddy.BTW, by all counts ... the ex-nanny was more, umm ... attractive than Patty back in the day. Whatever that's worth./n
