Desperate For Dates! Amber Rose Looking For Love Online/n
Amber Rose is looking for a new man after her split from Val Chmerkovskiy — and RadarOnline.com can exclusively reveal that the former stripper’s digitally trolling for dates!
As Radar reported, Rose, whose exes include Kanye West and babby daddy Whiz Khalifa, has been miserably single since she recently called it quits with Dancing With The Stars pro Chmerkovskiy after five months of dating.
To alleviate her pain, the tattooed beauty is now on the Raya dating app, which is also known as the “Illuminati Tinder” since it’s so exclusive and mainly for famous people.

Rose, revealed a source, is describing herself as a “talk show host and author” on Raya.
“Her profile is active and linked directly to her Instagram,” the source told Radar.
“Amber’s bio includes photos of her modeling in sexy outfits, a short clip of her flirting with the camera, and snaps of her son Sebastian.”

This isn’t the first time Rose, 33, has turned to the Internet to validate her romantic status.
She couldn’t stop gushing about her then-boyfriend Chmerkovskiy late last year, when she shared on Instagram a pic of the hunky 31 year old, writing: “When you said you were going to stay off social media until the New Year but Bae keeps posting hot ass pictures.”
Rose now joins the likes of Ruby Rose, John Mayer, and Cara Delevingne, who have all reportedly used Raya after a top-secret committee accepted the stars to the site.
