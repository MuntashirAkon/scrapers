Kim Kardashian Gave North West A Normal Ass Birthday Celebration & People Are Loving It!/n

What kid doesn't love a good ol' fashioned birthday at Chuck E. Cheese's?!
North West got the rare opportunity to live like any other toddler turning four years old on Thursday when her family celebrated the special day by going to none other than family-friendly venue full of pizza and games! A childhood staple, really!
On Thursday, Northie proved to be just a regular kid as she blew out the candles on her store-bought cake (with no custom writing, mind you), as documented on proud auntie Khloé Kardashian's Snapchat (above)!

Later, it seemed Kim Kardashian West, Kanye West, and the whole KarJenner gang threw on their finest sweats for an outing at Ruby's Diner — where North opened gifts, including a bicycle!
So Norman Rockwell! LOLz!
Ch-ch-check out the best reactions to the celeb kid's low-key celebrations (below)!! 

Y'all I can't tell you how happy I am that North is having her bday party at Chuck E Cheese like all that money but still doing it simple
