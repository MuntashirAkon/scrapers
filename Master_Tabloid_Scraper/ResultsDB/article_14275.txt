Katy Perry may want to end her feud with Taylor Swift, but it seems the universe has another idea.

When the singer hit the stage for an exclusive concert presented by YouTube Monday night (June 12, 2017) to end a four-day lifestream, she once again alluded to her ongoing beef with her nemesis by changing the lyrics to “Swish Swish,” a song many fans claim to be about Taylor.
Instead of singing “Don’t you come for me,” she crooned, “God bless you on your journey, oh baby girl.” The comment was similar to the one she made recently made about Tay, telling NBC’s Natalie Morales, “All I need to say to her is I love her and God bless her on her journey.”

However, karma works in mysterious ways. Soon after finishing the song, Katy suffered a wardrobe malfunction when she ripped her sequined jumpsuit.
“I just learned I have a hole in my pants,” she told the crowd. “It’s right near my hooha … but I’m wearing underwear, don’t you worry. So, I just want everyone who’s watching to brace themselves.”
“I was trying to be cool and I did that dance and now I realize I was not cool, especially when it comes out in pictures,” she quipped. “Well, we’re all human right? We all either got one or we don’t or we got both. I won’t let it take my power, how about that? Let’s do that.”
