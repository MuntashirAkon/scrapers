These days, everything President Donald Trump’s tweets becomes a headline.

However, the POTUS incited a whole new reaction when he tweeted a sentence fragment with a nonsensical word, reading, “Despite the constant negative press covfefe.” Though many deduced he was attempting to spell the word “coverage,” the typo sparked waves upon wave of hilarious jokes and memes.
Hollywood went in about “covfefe”:
I’m gonna try and go back to sleep now. Everyone stay #covfefe

In a covfefe conference on Tuesday (May 31, 2017), White House press secretary Sean Spicer explained of the made-up word, “The president and a small group of people know exactly what he meant.”
Since the viral response, Trump deleted the confusing note and played the whole thing off like he was in on the joke, tweeting, “Who can figure out the true meaning of ‘covfefe’ ??? Enjoy!”
