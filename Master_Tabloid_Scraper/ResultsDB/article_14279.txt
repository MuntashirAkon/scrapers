Though Kylie Jenner likes to dig into Cinnabon Roll Waffles in the morning, Kourtney Kardashian prefers a lighter breakfast.

The mom-of-three, who was hard at work filming scenes for Keeping Up with the Kardashians on Wednesday (March 29, 2017), recently took to her app to spill about her favorite morning treat. According to 37-year-old, she likes to start her day off with a grapefruit breakfast because they’re a “great source of vitamin C, fiber, potassium, antioxidants and other nutrients.”
“I eat half a grapefruit in the morning whenever I have them at my house. I add a sprinkle of sea salt—instead of sugar—to make it taste less tart,” she wrote. “My grandmother had a grapefruit tree at her house and she ate one every morning. I have one in my backyard too!”

Kardashian also said she eats likes the citrus fruit because it’s a delicious way to kick-start her metabolism in the morning.
“Studies have shown that people who eat half a fresh grapefruit every day lose more weight than people who do not,” she explained. “Be sure to eat the actual grapefruit—not just drink the juice—so you get the fiber from the fruit and avoid the refined sugar that is often added to fruit juice.”
For Kardashian, she enjoys the “ruby red and pink” varieties as “these colors have higher antioxidant levels.”
