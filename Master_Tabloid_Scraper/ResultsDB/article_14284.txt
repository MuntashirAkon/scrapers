Gigi Hadid recently opened up about some health issues she’s been dealing with the last few years.
Speaking with Elle magazine, Hadid said she has a thyroid condition. “My metabolism actually changed like crazy this year. I have Hashimoto’s disease. It’s a thyroid disease, and it’s now been two years since taking the medication for it, so for the [Victoria’s Secret] show I didn’t want to lose any more weight, I just want to have muscles in the right place, and if my butt can get a little perkier, then that’s good.”
To stay in shape, Hadid boxes. “What’s great about boxing is that I couldn’t come to New York and sign up for Equinox, and go running. It was not good. So, I knew I needed to find something that gave me a coach, gave me a family… so that when I walk in, it’s like my big brothers. They’re like ‘what up!’ They don’t care about who I am. That’s what I needed, and they don’t care about what my body looks like. They care that I give a good punch, and that’s how I want to be judged. That’s what makes me proud of myself.
