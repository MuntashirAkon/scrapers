Well good morning, The Veronicas!The pop rock sister duo hosted the 2016 ARIA Awards in Sydney, Australia Tuesday evening, kicking things off with an electric performance of "In My Blood." But aside from Lisa and Jess Origliasso's musical talent, their ensembles (or lack thereof) are what really had people talking. The Veronicas went completely naked from the waist up, instead rocking red glitter body paint across every inch of their waists and chests. According to multiple reports, the famous twins experienced a few technical difficulties that forced them to re-perform the track for the live audience, but if you ask Ruby Rose, the whole thing went off without a hitch.  

She also shared a snapshot of Jess captioned, "R.I.P. me," to which her leading lady replied in a comment on the post, "You are everything."Proud girlfriend moment for the win!
