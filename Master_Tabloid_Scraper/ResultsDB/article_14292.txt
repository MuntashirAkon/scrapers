They found love—again!Ruby Rose and The Veronicas' Jess Origliasso are back together. Rumors swirled that the former couple were back together after each shared a series of romantic photos, but the "Untouched" singer confirmed the news Monday when she told Australia's Nova FM's Kent 'Smallzy' Small that they fell back in love while filming the video for The Veronicas' new song "On Your Side.""It's me. Me and Ruby Rose. And it is our love story in this video," Jess said. "It's about the dynamic, the highs and the lows of people in love, in a relationship."

"Now we are quite protective of what we have, so obviously being able to be open enough but keeping a lot of it for ourselves is something that we're very conscious of and I think it just depends on the people what you're willing to share."But that doesn't mean they're not trying to change everything from their first relationship. In fact, Jess confessed that Ruby loves to talk trips down memory lane."She reminds me exactly how much last time definitely happened. She doesn't let me forget anything," Jess revealed. "I don't know, it's just a crazy thing when you care about someone for so long and then you have the chance to be able to reconnect, and we've grown up a lot, we met very early on and we were very different people."The video for "On Your Side" will be released later this week.
