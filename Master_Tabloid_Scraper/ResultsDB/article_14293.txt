"I'm very confident and in tune with my sexuality. I feel very blessed for that, because in different places around the world, people can't be," Rose tells Cosmo. "I'm lucky I can explore. I have a very healthy sex life, and there's something very empowering, strong, and feminist about being open and comfortable in that world.Rose, who's currently dating Jess Origliasso of the girl group The Veronicas, also gave her thoughts on getting married."According to the news, I've been engaged five times. For me, marriage is more about equal rights than the act of getting married," she said. "When you don't have equal rights, it trickles down to kids who think, ‘My aunt's gay so she can't get married,' or ‘I'm weird because I feel the same way.' So it's important to break down that barrier. I'm more interested in having a loving, healthy, long-term relationship with someone I might want to have kids with someday."

To see behind-the-scene footage from Rose's cover shoot with Cosmopolitan, watch the premiere episode of So Cosmo next Wednesday at 8 p.m., only on E!
