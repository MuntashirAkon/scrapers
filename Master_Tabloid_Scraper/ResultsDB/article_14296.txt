Ruby Rose is responding to those who questioned her recently cancelling tour dates. In an impassioned Twitter rant posted on Saturday morning, the actress-turned-DJ defended her decision to opt out of a couple shows after she reportedly came down with tonsillitis. After Rose shared a photo on Instagram initially explaining the sudden change in plans, fans took to social media to express their disappointment over her decision."Tonsilitis and unable to fly because of the pain it's causing my ears," the Orange is the New Black Star wrote. "means no more shows and I have to stay put before returning home sorry guys. I didn't even know you could get tonsillitis after like, 16."When a Twitter user questioned her lack of appearance at a U.K. pride festival, Rose clapped back with an explanation that alluded to her demanding schedule as the main reason for her illness.
