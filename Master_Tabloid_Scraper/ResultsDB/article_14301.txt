Ruby Rose -- Lighten Up! Blonde Hair and NO CLOTHES (PHOTO) /nRuby Rose wasn't always the short-haired brunette, perfect-faced beauty we know today -- she used to be a LONG-haired BLONDE, perfect-faced beauty ... and yes, she still looked AWESOME.  The new  "Orange Is the New Black " star posed for Maxim Australia back in 2011, but she's almost unrecognizable on the cover ... which is a totally nude shot. Tastefully done, of course.  Ruby was already tatted up back then, and apparently religious. If you're not ... we suspect holding her well-placed rosary beads will bring you closer to God.   The chick's a smoke show in or OUT of anything. Just sayin' ... /n
