NY Giants Linebacker -- TREAT. YO. SELF. ... $55k Jewelry Run/nNew York Giants linebacker J.T. Thomas believes in the  "Treat Yo Self " mentality ... because after he inked his new $12 MILLION contract ... he picked up $55k in brand new bling ... TMZ Sports has learned.  Thomas hit up Avianne and Co. in NYC -- and scored himself an 18 karat gold Cuban link chain for $35k.  And because he didn't want that chain to get lonely, he got a 2nd piece ... a 25 karat ruby, surrounded by diamonds ... which ran him another $20k.  Tom Haverford would be proud ... /n
