Birdman Gives Turkeys to Poor People ... Drives Off In $2.5 Million Bugatti/nBirdman knows how to make a poor person feel REALLY POOR -- 'cause the rap mogul gave out free turkeys to families in need Monday ... and then drove off in a $2.5 MILLION luxury car. The Cash Money prez rolled up to his turkey giveaway at Little Haiti Soccer Park in Miami yesterday in his ruby red Bugatti -- one of the most expensive cars in the world. Seems a bit flashy considering he was giving away food to people who can barely afford it -- dontcha think??? Still, gotta give the guy credit -- 'cause Bird, along with Ace Hood, DJ Khaled, Slim and Mack Maine are giving away a total of 3,000 free turkeys in cities across the country -- just like they did last year. â€‹Gobble gobble./n
