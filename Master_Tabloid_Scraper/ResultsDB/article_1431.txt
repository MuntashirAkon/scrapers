'Toddlers and Tiaras' -- Stop Sexualizing Little Kids!!/nA powerful parents group is BLASTING the people behind the TLC reality show  "Toddlers and Tiaras " -- after a parent dressed a 3-year-old girl as a prostitute for a beauty pageant. The show has been under fire over a promo spot, featuring a pint-size beauty queen dressed up like Julia Roberts in  "Pretty Woman " -- during her street-walking hooker phase. But the Parents Television Council is LIVID -- claiming,  "We have a serious problem when a network formerly known as The Learning Channel features a toddler,  who probably hasn't even learned to read, dressed as a prostitute  showing off her sexy strut. "  The PTC adds,  "There's no question, TV executives are complicit in robbing these small kids of their childhood. "  "For years we've seen adult sexuality being inappropriately and  aggressively foisted on innocent young children, but children today are  being sexualized at younger and younger ages. All available data  suggests they will suffer for it later in life. "/n
