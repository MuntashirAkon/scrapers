Wall-to-Wahlberg in Manhattan/nA winter chill blew through Manhattan last night, but one man, at least, was undeterred by it -- Mark Wahlberg.     var config = new Array();  config[ "videoId "] = 370423103;  config[ "videoRef "] = null;  config[ "lineupId "] = null;  config[ "playerTag "] = null;  config[ "autoStart "] = false;  config[ "preloadBackColor "] =  "#FFFFFF ";  config[ "width "] = 400;  config[ "height "] = 350;  config[ "playerId "] = 353549946;  createExperience(config, 8);  Marky did his natty thing at a sumptuous soiree for Hennessy Paradis at the Meatpacking District's clubby Gin Lane, then repaired to Butter for the later portion of the night. The sartorial theme of the evening was, apparently, diagonal black and white stripes -- if the attire of Kelis, hoopster Chris Webber and rapper Omarion is any indication. The best-dressed award went to rap royal Nas (who celebrated his birthday last night at Capitale) not just because he rocked a rather fetching dark-ruby dinner jacket, but because he had his adorable daughter at his side./n
