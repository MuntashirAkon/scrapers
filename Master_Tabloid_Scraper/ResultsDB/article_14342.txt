A source revealed: “He loved being on the show more than Luann does. He wanted to allow Bravo access to the wedding – they ultimately said “no” but did provide producers with footage.
“Tom loves being recognized on the street and especially in fancy bars by pretty ladies he walked the red carpet and enjoyed having his picture taken.
“It’s not true to say he hated the spotlight. Luann was going to leave the show before the current season and it was Tom that convinced her to stay on.”
