Though Lady Gaga is constantly changing up her look, some fans aren’t happy with the style chameleon’s latest move.

Soon after the “Million Reasons” singer debuted her hew ‘do —  a short haircut dyed in shades of green and orange — on Instagram, a few people accused Gaga of stealing the bold color pairing from Paramore frontwoman Hayley Williams, who rocked a similar style in 2014. A fan account even posted a side-by-side comparison, claiming the Mother Monster ripped off the bold hairstyle.
However, some Gaga fans came to the 31-year-old’s defense, citing the songstress had rainbow hair two years before Williams added blue to her signature fiery locks. “Gaga had those colors in 2012 but okay I guess,” one fan tweeted.

Regardless, it seemed Williams herself didn’t mind. The “That’s What You Get” singer settled the debate and weighed in on the matter, tweeting “lovin it” in response to a photo of Gaga’s newly colored tresses.

Gaga’s hair transformation came just days before the start of her Joanne World Tour. “12:19am Vancouver still going strong in #JOANNEworldtour rehearsal!” she wrote earlier Tuesday morning.
