Party like you’re in Pawnee!

Parks and Recreations’ Amy Poehler, Chris Pratt, and Retta had a small cast reunion Thursday night to support the premiere of castmate Aubrey Plaza’s new movie, Ingrid Goes West. The foursome held court inside their own booth during the after-party at Avenue Hollywood, sipping on SVEDKA Vodka cocktails as they mingled with VIP guests like Dan Stevens and Mae Whitman.
“They were having a really good time,” an onlooker told Celebuzz. “Amy was dancing at their table and Chris went to the bar a few times to get everyone drinks. They were definitely happy to see each other again.”
Though the rest of cast — including Aziz Ansari, Adam Scott, Nick Offerman, Rashida Jones, and Rob Lowe — were not present, other celebrities spotted partying alongside the gang included Darren Criss, R.J. Mitte, and The Office alum Kate Flannery.
Sorry, Jerry. Maybe you’ll get invited next time.
