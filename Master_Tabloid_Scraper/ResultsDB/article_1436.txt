Eva Gives Her Pie to Writers/nEva Longoria braved the picket line yesterday -- and momentarily distracted striking writers by giving them pizza. This was not the bigger piece of the pie writers were asking for, but they took it. Longoria -- who was filming a few final scenes for  "Desperate Housewives " before production shut down because of the WGA strike -- was attacked by the sign-holding bunch on Wisteria Lane. Eva later joined the line with other celebs like Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Wanda Sykes.  Related Articles      Eva Longoria Witnesses Beheading     Eva: I Don't Like Me in Underpants/n
