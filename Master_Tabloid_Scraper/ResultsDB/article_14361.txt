Bella Thorne may done a lot of outrageous things in the past, but filming herself masturbating in a car is not one of them. So when a video allegedly of that surfaced online, the Famous in Love star quickly took to social media to respond.

“Hahahahaha wait you guys think this is real? Hahahaha. I don’t even masterbate like that,” she tweeted. “Where’s the vibrator thooo.”
The video showed a woman alleged to be the 19-year-old pleasuring herself while moaning, “Oh finally, I really needed a father.” According to some fans, the clip was actually one of Bella’s Snapchat videos edited to pornography.
“The worst part of this video is them making fun of the fact that I lost my father,” Bella, whose dad died in a motorcycle accident in 2007, continued. “You’re right. Me being daddyless is sooooo funny.”

Earlier this month, the former Disney Channel star refuted claims she had slept with rumored fling Scott Disick. Though they are often seen partying together, Bella claimed she “was never with him sexually.”
“With any reality show … they want the drama,” she said of their budding relationship on Jenny McCarthy’s SiriusXM show. “It’s really unfortunate there’s always someone that people beat up on a little bit.”
