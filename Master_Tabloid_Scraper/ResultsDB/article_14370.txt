"She actually was a party girl and she always brought the fun and I think my baby did that too," Anne shared.In the sci-fi movie in theatres April 7, Anne's character discovers that severe catastrophic events are somehow connected to the mental breakdown from which she's suffering.Moviegoers will experience a mixture of comedy, action and even a fight that Anne was very careful with accomplishing. After all, she had a baby to protect.

"I'm usually a very gung-ho physical performer. I'm always so happy to just throw myself in there and if you get hit or bruised or anything, I never really care about that but with this one, it wasn't just me I was reaching out for so we broke the fight down very slowly," she explained. "We did it piece by piece and I just tried my best not to fall."Mission accomplished!Colossal, which also stars Dan Stevens and Jason Sudeikis hits theatres on April 7.
