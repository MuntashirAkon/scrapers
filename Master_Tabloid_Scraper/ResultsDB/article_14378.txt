Anne Hathaway Apologizes for Throwing "Unintended Shade" at the Kardashians/n
Anne Hathaway learned that messing with the Kardashian family could get you into trouble.The Alice Through the Looking Glass star shared a meme of costar Helena Bonham Carter that read, "In a world of Kardashians, be Helena Bonham Carter." Hathaway quickly deleted the post after she received some mean comments, but then posted an apology picture that had a message that said, "Post removed for unintended shade thrown."Hathaway further explained herself in the photo's caption. "It never occurred to me I was pitting anyone against each other. Not my style. Peace x," she wrote.She didn't harp on the social media faux pas for too long, though, as she had to attend the Hollywood premiere of her latest Disney film. The Oscar-winning actress and new mom looked stunning in a floral Christopher Kane dress. She's also caught up being a new mom to son Jonathan Rosebanks Shulman, so she has plenty on her plate, but she's learning to adapt. 

"One of the things that I love about the movie is you can't change the past. I think that it's kind of easy to fixate on the past and what you could have done differently—the coulda, woulda, shouldas—and that just doesn't really help you. The point of going through things—well, in many instances—is to fail upwards," the 33-year-old star told us. "You can't change the past but you can take the lesson with you, you know?"The lesson learned this time: don't mess with social media.
