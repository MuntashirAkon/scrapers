How Old Are These Girls?/nHollywood hotspot Les Deux was packed last night -- with little misses in teeny minis?!The teenage party girls were celebrating the birthdays of Disney stars Aly and AJ, who rolled in on motorcycles -- reminiscent of the teenaged Paris Hilton and Kim Stewart. Remember Kim flying off the bike? Classic! But these girls played it safe -- and left the driving to professionals. Aly and AJ (sisters Alyson 18, and Amanda 16), were not the only scantily clad teen stars on hand. Emma Roberts (niece of Julia),  "Hannah Montana " star Miley Cyrus (who is looking more like Angelina Jolie by the minute), and Robin Williams' daughter Zelda -- were all dressed more like women in their twenties than teens. Hotties in training!Move over Paris, Nicole, Lindsay, Britney, Cameron, Drew -- here come the girls!  Related Articles      Miley Cyrus, Avril n' Paris     Hannah Montana's Day of Deception/n
