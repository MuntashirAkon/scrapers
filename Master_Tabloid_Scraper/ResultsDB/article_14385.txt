Anne Hathaway -- We're Not Board/nWe gotta give Anne Hathaway credit ... the actress and her husband actually did something pretty funny Friday in NYC. The 31-year old and her hubby Adam Shulman took their dogs for a walk -- and they were clearly expecting paparazzi to go along for the ride.Anne pimped some of her favorite websites -- girleffect.org. feedingamerica.org and worldofchildren.org -- and Shulman wished everyone a happy 4th. They even gave Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone credit.Maybe she's not so annoying after all./n
