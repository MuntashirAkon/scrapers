Taylor Swift’s digs at Kanye West go further than just her scathing lyrics.

The singer — who recently released “Look What You Made Me Do,” a single that seemingly takes aim at the rapper and his wife, Kim Kardashian — will release her sixth studio album on a date that hits close to her nemesis’ heart. As fans have pointed out, November 10 holds a significant meaning in the Kardashian-West family as it marks the anniversary of the death of Kanye’s mother.

After all, he was raised by her as a single mother and the two were quite close. In fact, just last year, he had a breakdown that coincided with the death anniversary.
Find out why that date was specifically chosen over at Wet Paint…
