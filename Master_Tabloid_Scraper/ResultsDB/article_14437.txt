Rihanna’s annual Diamond Ball has become one of the most exclusive A-list events in recent years, but anyone can now attend the swanky, star-studded soirée for only $1.

Fans will have a chance to mingle with Dave Chappelle and party with the likes of Kendrick Lamar and Calvin Harris this year by simply donating a buck to those in need. You — yes, you — can win a trip to attend the Sept. 14 all-star celebration in New York for less than the cost of a cup of coffee.
Via Revolt TV:
With Rihanna’s new Dollar Campaign, fans who donate just $1 to the Foundation will be entered to win two tickets to the ball, airfare to New York, and one night in a hotel. According to the site, $1 can provide one brick to help build a school in Malawi.
