Blake Lively is ringing in her 30th year in sweet style.
The former Gossip Girl actress turned the big 3-0 on Friday, and celebrated over the weekend with her tribe that included fellow star Anna Kendrick and Lively’s BFF jewelry designers Lorraine Schwartz and Ofira Sandberg.
“Best bday surprise = my sisters from a different mama @lorraineschwartz @ofirajewelz 💕🎂💕Love you til I’m 40. But not a day longer,” Lively captioned a selfie of the stylish trio, holding up a sign reading “Happy Birthday Blake.”

On Sunday, Lively shared a group shot featuring Kendrick, 32, and others gathered around a table — and another, much larger cake. “My super sweet 16. …but like 14 years late,” she joked in the caption.

The sweet, celebratory social media posts follow the one Lively’s husband Ryan Reynolds shared on Friday, enlisting his signature silly humor to wish his wife a happy birthday.
“Happy Birthday to my amazing wife,” he captioned a red carpet shot of the couple, where the Deadpool 2 actor is featured prominently and only half of Lively’s face can be seen.
