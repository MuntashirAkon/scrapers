Carrie Ann Inaba is dancing on air after accepting Robb Derringer's proposal.The Dancing With the Stars judge, 48, and the Days of Our Lives actor, 49, got engaged Saturday, her rep tells E! News. Derringer proposed on a secluded beach cove along the California coast. "Saturdays are special to us, because our first date was on a Saturday and we have celebrated with a toast, a visit to a beach, special date, a motorcycle adventure, or a road trip on every Saturday since," Inaba told People. "So on Saturday, we returned to the place of our first date and got engaged at the same place we shared our spontaneous and magical first date."Derringer presented Inaba with a diamond ring designed by Jean Dousset, and couple celebrated alone on the beach with a bonfire and "a bottle of Aubert Chardonnay," Inaba said.

Naturally, Derringer was nervous to pop the question. "I'm a better writer than a speaker," he explained, "so I chose to share my thoughts with Carrie in a letter expressing how much she meant to me, how much she had changed me, how much she had taught me in our time together thus far and what my hopes and dreams and intentions were for our future together."To his delight, Inaba said "yes."

And according to Inaba, it was the perfect proposal. "The ocean mist created an ambiance that was magical, and I will always remember the way that sky looked as Robb got down on one knee and asked me to be his wife," the bride-to-be said. "All alone on that beautiful beach, it was as if time stood still and we were the only two people on earth. I will never forget it. It was perfect. Getting engaged where we had that perfect first date was really such poetic destiny."Inaba and Derringer have yet to set a wedding date.

For Inaba, Derringer is the beginning of her happily ever after—something she realized during their first date. According to Derringer, The feeling was mutual. "Everything about the evening felt so 'right.' There was an ease and an authentic familiarity," Inaba told People. "We talked about everything under the stars—even marriage. There was a strong sense of destiny that night. I think I knew then, deep in my heart, that he and I were going to be together forever."Inaba was previously engaged to Jesse Sloan, but the pair called it quits in the summer of 2012.
