Ann Curry Run Down by a Camera on Today!/n
Ann Curry probably could have done without the literal slap in the face.The Today show veteran had to deal with some good-natured ribbing from her colleagues this morning when a crowd-panning camera didn't put on the brakes in time and smushed right into Curry's face while she was greeting the cheering onlookers."Get the number of that truck!" Al Roker can be heard shouting as the offending lens went on its way."What was that?" exclaimed Natalie Morales. "When does that happen?!"

"We had a pedestrian accident here a second ago," Matt Lauer added as the camera finally made its way to him, Roker, Morales and, just a second late to the party, the shaken-but-composed-as-ever Curry."Your nose is OK," Morales assured Curry, while Roker noted that her dental work still looked great."That was reminiscent of the revolving door incident of years ago," Lauer added, referring to Curry's run-in in 2006 with a revolving door that left her with a broken nose.And yes, the Today crew did provide viewers at home with a replay in case they missed it the first time."Here we goâ€”boom!" Roker narrated."I'm Matt Lauer," Curry's cohost segued into the usual back-from-commercial introductions after the laughter had subsided, "along with Natalie Morales, Al Roker and ole flat-nose."
