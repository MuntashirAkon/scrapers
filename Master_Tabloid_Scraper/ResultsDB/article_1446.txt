Tori Spelling 'Worried Sick' Over Potentially Deadly Pregnancy Drama/n
Tori Spelling is thrilled to be expecting her fifth child with Dean McDermott, but an insider claims that the 43-year-old star is “worried sick” that the placenta previa that plagued her fourth pregnancy could return.
As Radar reported, just 20 weeks into her last pregnancy, Spelling awoke to blood dripping down her leg.
After the mom was rushed to the hospital, she learned she had the rare and potentially deadly condition placenta previa, which occurs when placenta covers the opening of the cervix, often leading to internal bleeding.
“It was surreal,” Spelling said. “I just remember thinking, ‘I can’t leave three children behind.'”

Unfortunately, Spelling and McDermott, who are parents to Liam, 9, Stella, 8, Hattie, 5, and 4-year-old Finn, have other pressing worries, as well.
“She and Dean now have to move again and are looking for a bigger place to house their expanding brood,” said the insider.
“The morning sickness, the constant money worries and now the move are stressing them out.” /n
