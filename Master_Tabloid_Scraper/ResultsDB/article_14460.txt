Just as her character did in The Artist, Penelope Ann Miller apparently got tired of the face looking back at her from the other side of the breakfast table every day.The veteran actress has filed for legal separation from her husband of nearly 12 years, James Huggins, citing irreconcilable differences and leaving the date of their split "to be determined," according to court documents obtained by E! News.

She is asking for physical and legal custody of their two children, 11-year-old Eloisa May and 2 1/2-year-old Maria Adele, with "reasonable visitation" allowed for their father.Miller, whose major films include Adventures in Babysitting, The Freshman, Carlito's Way and Kindergarten Cop, most recently starred on TNT's Men of a Certain Age, and she probably had a pretty grand time making the rounds with her fellow stars of The Artist during this past awards season.
