Tori Spelling‘s financial issues continue to worsen as her due date nears! After the pregnant actress was hit with an American Express lawsuit for over $87K this week, RadarOnline.com can exclusively reveal the status of her other debts.
In July 2016, Spelling, 43, was slapped with a $259,108.23 tax lien. The Los Angeles County Recorder/County Clerk exclusively told Radar that the lien has not been released.
