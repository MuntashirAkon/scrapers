NBA Legend John Salley -- I Won't Say I DON'T Have a Huge Penis/nPorn legend Lisa Ann -- famous for her lead role in the XXX movie  "Who's Nailin' Paylin? " -- wasn't lying when she said NBA legend John Salley might have THE biggest penis on the planet ... at least, Salley didn't correct her when we asked about it.FYI, Lisa -- who's seen plenty of penises in her lifetime -- went on Howard Stern last month, and said Salley's sausage DWARFED every other schlong she's ever seen.

"AND WE WOULD TOO. Great video./n
