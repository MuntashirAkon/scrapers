 Pregnant Tori Spelling & Dean McDermott Never Told His Jilted Ex-Wife About Baby #5.../n
Fame-hungry Tori Spelling and husband Dean McDermott were thrilled to announce they were expecting their fifth child in a splashy photo shoot and interview— but they failed to share the news with the mother of the actor’s oldest son.
McDermott’s ex-wife, Mary Jo Eustace, “had no idea Tori was pregnant again,” a family insider exclusively tells RadarOnline.com, adding that the Canadian chef, 54, found out through friends after the couple’s public reveal.

As True Tori fans know all too well, McDermott infamously left Eustace, the mother of his 17-year-old son, Jack, for the actress turned reality star, 43, following a sordid affair on the set of a TV movie in 2005. (Karma hit Spelling when her husband cheated again, this time on her, in 2013.)
Despite a previous truce, during which the two women even hugged at a Los Angeles grocery store in June, the bitter feelings appear to have returned.

Eustace “is disgusted by them and their wild spending,” the source reveals.
As Radar previously reported, McDermott, 49, owed a whopping $45,000 in child support to the Scared Wheatless author, which Spelling was attempting to pay off.
