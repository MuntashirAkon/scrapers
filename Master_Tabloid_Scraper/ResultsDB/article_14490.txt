'Breaking Amish' Star Calls The Cops After Wild Night Of Booze & Sex/n
The young stars of Breaking Amish have had a taste of the real world since leaving their conservative communities but a wild drunken night with raunchy sex is coming back to haunt all of them.
In this exclusive clip of the hit TLC series Iva reveals why she went to the police and filed a report against her Amish housemate Betsy.
“You know the night we were drinking?” she explains to Matt while they’re on a trip to Las Vegas, saying that Betsy accused her of taking advantage of her the night they got drunk and had a threesome.

“She tried to turn me in for sh*t that happened so I couldn’t tell on her,” Iva says.
Matt is shocked at Iva’s admission and explains why Iva took the drastic measure of going to the police.
“Iva was upset at Betsy for telling Andrew about the threesome. She was worried about her boyfriend Sam finding out.”

However, Iva says that it was Betsy who was in the wrong and “She lied to the cops about me,” so she vows to take revenge.
“I’m so pissed off I’m going to punch her I know that.”
Breaking Amish airs on TLC Sunday at 10/9c.
