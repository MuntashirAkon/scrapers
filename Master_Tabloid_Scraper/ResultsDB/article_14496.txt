Bros Before Beef! Drake Bell & Josh Peck Hug It Out At The 2017 MTV VMAs!/n

At least one beef was taken off the grill at this year's VMAs!
Months after their very public feud, Drake Bell and Josh Peck reunited at the MTV awards show on Sunday — and it was all hugs, brother!
The former Drake & Josh costars took to Instagram to post the same photo of themselves embracing at The Forum in L.A. (above), both captioning it, "Hug me…" Awww!

Earlier in the summer, it looked like the bitter end of the actors' friendship after Bell got VERY upset he wasn't invited to Peck's wedding and made his feelings known on Twitter.
The 31-year-old later admitted he was "just being cranky," and revealed he had made up with his on-screen step-bro in private.
Now, fans got the public reconciliation they deserve! So, how about that Drake & Josh revival, boys?
