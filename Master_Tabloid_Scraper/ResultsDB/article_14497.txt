Alessandra Ambrosio Is Laced To Perfection On The MTV VMAs Red Carpet/n

Leave the edgy sexiness to the Victoria's Secret supermodel!
Alessandra Ambrosio oozed sex appeal as per usual at the MTV VMAs in a richly embroidered long sleeved Balmain mini dress paired with some of the hottest lace-up boots we've ever seen. Diva!!!
The 36-year-old accessorized the look with a simple ponytail and very minimal makeup. That's okay, because the outfit was doing all the talking!
