Tori Spelling Pregnant With Fifth Child: 'It Was A Total Surprise'/n
Tori Spelling is pregnant again — and it wasn’t planned! After RadarOnline.com spotted the star sporting an extra 35 pounds this summer, she’s finally confirmed that there’s a baby on board.
“It was a total surprise,” the 43-year-old to PEOPLE magazine of her fifth child with husband Dean McDermott. “But we always wanted a big family. I’m really excited.”
The pair are no strangers to rearing children, as they’re already parents to Liam, 9, Stella, 8, Hattie, 5 and Finn, 4. Dean also has an 18-year-old son, Jack, from a previous marriage.

“Dean was saying, ‘We just got Finn out of diapers; I thought we were in the clear!'” Spelling laughed. “For the first time this year, they’re all in school. So it’s like, wow. We’re basically starting over.”
But can she afford another baby? As Radar previously reported, the 90210 actress was sued by American Express in January over nearly $40,000 in unpaid bills.
To make matters worse, the actress — who hasn’t been in good health the last several months — was also slapped with a hefty tax lien back in July.

But according to Spelling, their latest addition to the family had perfect timing.
“This baby happened at the best time,” says Spelling. “Nothing is ever perfect, but I’m so madly in love with my husband and with our kids. The idea of adding to that is such a blessing.”
