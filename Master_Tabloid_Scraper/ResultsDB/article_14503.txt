Prince may be gone, but Beyoncé remembers.

A year after the music icon’s passing, the “Hold Up” singer recently wrote an introduction for an upcoming book about Prince. Remembering the time they collaborated together, Queen Bey praised the late musician for his innovative ideas and sound.
Via Revolt TV:
Beyoncé has written the foreword to the upcoming book Prince: A Private View, a collection of many never-before-seen photographs, both candid and staged, shot by Afshin Shahidi. Shahidi was Prince’s friend for 20 years, photographer for 10, and was the only person to shoot his private ‘3121’ parties in Los Angeles.
According to Entertainment Weekly, a snippet of the words say:
“Truth be told, the word ‘icon’ only scratches the surface of what Prince was and what he remains to me.”
