Whitney Port’s just got a little bigger!

The Hills alum welcomed her first child with husband Tim Rosenman on Thursday. In a post on her website, the 32-year-old mom gushed about the new arrival, revealing she named her new baby boy Sonny Sanford Rosenman.
“No big deal, but I created another human being and then delivered him into the world at 12:30am Thursday morning. Timmy and I named the little man Sonny and I’m in love,” she wrote. “We’ve all heard mothers give the same speech about how life changing the love for your baby is, and it’s not like I didn’t believe it or anything, but I guess I couldn’t actually connect to those exact feelings until the doctor placed Sonny onto my chest.”

She continued, “I love him and feel protective over him, but more than anything, I’m just like obsessed. I can’t stop looking at him, or thinking about him when I am in another room. It’s a bit like getting a toy you really really wanted as a child.”
“I don’t care if this is sappy or trite and I don’t want to say that I love him more than anything ever because I love Timmy and my family,” she concluded. “It’s not about loving him more than something else I love. It’s just awesome.”
Port also shared a few photos of the newborn in the hospital. In an Instagram post, she shared “everyone is so happy and healthy and we are home now.”
