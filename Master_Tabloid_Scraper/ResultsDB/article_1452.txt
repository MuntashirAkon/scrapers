Ka-Ching! Tori Spelling Scores $200K Payday For Latest Money-Making Schemes/n
Tori Spelling is desperately trying to get out of debt and just scored a major payday for her efforts, RadarOnline.com has learned.
The 42-year-old reality star is returning to television with two new projects: Tori & Dean’s Spring Picnic, on the Cooking Channel, and David Tutera‘s CELEBrations on WE tv.
According to a source, “Tori was paid around $100,000 for each show, which is a ton of money for very little work!”

“She won’t be seeing much of it though,” the insider told Radar. “She has to pay her agent and manager a cut.”
She also owes American Express more than $38,000, according to a lawsuit recently filed against her by the company.
“Family members have also loaned Tori money, and those individuals need to be paid back too,” the source said.

Her mother, Candy Spelling, recently revealed that she has been at least partly supporting her daughter and the family. Said the source, “The entire situation is just very sad because Tori wants to be working, but there just isn’t a lot being offered to her.”
Meanwhile, Spelling is also suing Benihana restaurant, where she suffered burns on her right arm during a fall onto a hibachi grill last year. She has claimed financial losses in the form of lost work and hospital bills. That lawsuit is ongoing, despite her current work. /n
