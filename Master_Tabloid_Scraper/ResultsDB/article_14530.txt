Valentino is a red carpet staple for Hollywood’s hottest stars, so it isn’t surprising that the iconic brand’s Rodeo Drive flagship store opening attracted all the A-listers!
Kim Kardashian, Minka Kelly and Ciara were just a few of the stars who glammed up in Valentino for the swanky store opening soiree, which also feted the brand’s 50th anniversary.  From reality stars to big screen bombshells, RadarOnline.com has photos of all the glitz and glamour of Tuesday night’s hottest red carpet event!

Kim avoided another flour bombing incident, but also strangely stayed away from donning a dress from the designer-of-the-night’s collection! The almost-divorced reality star rocked a black and silver Lela Rose frock with Christian Louboutin heels.   Minka looked demure in a nude lace Valentino dress, while Molly Sims showed off her baby bump in a long, black lace Valentino number paired with bold turquoise earrings.
