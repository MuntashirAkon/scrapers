Police Arrest Machete-Wielding Man In Cardiff Ahead Of Justin Bieber's Concert/n

A machete-wielding man has been arrested outside Cardiff's Principality stadium ahead of Justin Bieber's concert there.
Merely three hours before the singer was due to the stage on Friday, police tackled the man to the ground, and confiscated his foot-long blade!

Justin's fans had already begun lining up the show, so this is especially scary!
As you surely remember, it was just last month when a bomb was set off after Ariana Grande's Manchester show.
A report claims two men were arrested with the one machete just yards away from the concert venue. As of now, it's being said there's no evidence to suggest it was an act of terrorism or even linked to the Purpose star.
The South Wales Police issued a statement: 
"South Wales Police were called to a dispute involving motorists on Saunders Road, Cardiff, at approximately 3.05pm. Two men, aged 19 and 27, were arrested nearby on Penarth Road. The 27-year-old has been arrested on suspicion of affray and the 19-year-old has been arrested on suspicion of using threatening behaviour. Both are currently in custody at Cardiff Bay Police Station. There are no reports of any injuries."
Reassuring concert goers, more comments were made:

There is NO #Machete incident in #Cardiff linked to #JustinBieber. This is a traffic dispute and arrests made. @BTP @WalesOnline @ArrivaTW https://t.co/dHP5e3dp5B
