"The shit women have to deal with, LOL! With swim season around the corner, it's time to get our hairy situations under control. Here's how I make sure my underarms, legs, bikini line and more are in check.
In addition to her bikini line and underarms, KoKo does laser hair removal for her long, sexy legs!

"I recently started lasering my legs too. It's so much easier than having to shave every single day. I go to my girl at a place called Sev Laser. Kylie [Jenner] goes here too and we loooove it!!! My girl Sev is dope and is my Armenian sister from another mister."
However, when it comes to her eyebrows, Tristan Thompson's girlfriend NEVER threads in fear of getting herpes (the oral kind)!
Confused?? Miz Kardashian explains:

"I always darken my brows because they are naturally light, but to shape them, I wax and never, ever thread. I heard the grossest story about threading! Someone had herpes on their mouth and then the client got it on their brows! I don't thread because someone's saliva might be going on my face!"
You learn something new everyday!
