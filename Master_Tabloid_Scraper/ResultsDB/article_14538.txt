Amy Adams & Mandy Moore Are Lovely Ladies Who Lunch At The AFI Awards/n

Pretty!
Amy Adams and Mandy Moore were pleasantly dressed for a fancy luncheon rather than for the AFI Awards in Beverly Hills Friday.

But perhaps gowns or more elaborate frocks wouldn't be so appropriate for an afternoon event. Okay, we'll give them a pass!
Truthfully, though, we're not crazy about Amy's blue Roland Mouret dress. There's something about the fit by her chest that just doesn't seem right.
Mandy, on the other hand, looked like a proper Southern belle in her tricolor Lela Rose number with triangular cut-out below the bust and Jennifer Meyer accents. We can just picture her sitting on the deck of a grand mansion and sipping some sweet tea in Louisiana or wherever!
Thoughts???
