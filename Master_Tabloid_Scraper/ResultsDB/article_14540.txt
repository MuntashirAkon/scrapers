The Duchess of Cambridge was absolutely lovely in a pale pink Lela Rose dress, while her husband put on a light blue blazer over a white shirt and dark blue pants that sort of looked like jeans.
It's casual-chic Wills!
Can you believe we're digging his look more than Kate's?
He just looks so suave!
Who do YOU prefer though, Perezcious readers???
