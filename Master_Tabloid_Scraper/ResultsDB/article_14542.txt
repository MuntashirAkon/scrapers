Princess Kate Is the 'Epitome of a Princess,' Says American Designer Lela Rose/n
Princess Kate was pretty in pink, touring Cornwall with Prince William as she poured pints and hit the beach in heels.
On day one of a two-day visit to the picturesque county in the U.K.’s southwest on Thursday, Kate showed off the last of a holiday tan, wearing a simple fit-and-flare pale pink dress by American designer Lela Rose.
“Her radiant smile is what gets me every time – it’s perfection!” the thrilled New York-based designer tells PEOPLE, adding: “The Duchess of Cambridge is the epitome of a princess.”
It’s not the first time that the royal has chosen the Texas-born designer for an official work engagement. While on tour in Australia in 2014, Kate wore a lace peplum cocktail dress by Lela Rose to a glamorous reception at Parliament House.

The design, both simple and feminine, is very much Kate’s go-to look for work events and worn with her Monsoon Fleur wedges, (recently reduced in the sale to less than $18) it was also a practical choice for the day’s events, which included everything from visiting a cathedral to pulling pints of cider and hitting the beach in Newquay.
How to Get Princess Kate’s Blowout

Kate, who travelled to Cornwall with her hairdresser, opted for a full bouncy blow out, while Prince William debuted a new hair cut. With his shortest style to date and a more relaxed dress code, the royal dad ditched the tie for an unbuttoned white shirt, navy trousers under a pale blue summer blazer.
