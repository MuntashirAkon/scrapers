Did you miss out on PEOPLE’s Real Beauties contest? Good news: It’s not too late to see your face in the magazine! PEOPLE is teaming up with Botox Cosmetic to sponsor a new contest, “Women Just Like You,” aimed at recognizing naturally beautiful women for their inner and outer beauty. Simply visit womenjustlikeyou.com, upload a photo and tell us why you (or a friend if you enter on her behalf) should be celebrated. Five winners will be chosen to fly to New York City, be styled by designer Lela Rose (left) and be photographed for an ad that will appear in PEOPLE this summer. Get your prettiest picture ready — the contest ends June 8.
