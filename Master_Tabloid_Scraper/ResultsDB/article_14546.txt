Pretty pumps, gorgeous spring dresses — tap shoes? Designer Lela Rose’s closet is full of fun surprises, as seen on the first episode of Rent the Runway’s “Closet Close-Ups,” a new series that features one-on-one interviews with some of the most popular designers around.
Rose chats with Rent the Runway fashion director Lucy Sykes, who asks the designer about her spring line (“Really inspired by Las Vegas and Coney Island,” she shares), gets her to share fashion tips (“As long as you have a chic-looking coat on, you always look great,” she insists) and even has her talking about her love of bike riding — and tap dancing (or at least tap shoes).

Rose, who designed Eva Amurri’s wedding dress, also discusses her love of affordable fashion — evidenced by her partnership with Rent the Runway and past collaborations she’s done for LOFT, Payless and Beauty.com. Watch the clip above to hear more from the designer — and to see her absolutely amazing closet.
