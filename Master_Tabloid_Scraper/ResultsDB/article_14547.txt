Lela Rose Joins Forces with LOFT/n

Lela Rose has embarked on yet another collaboration, this time, with LOFT! The designer and store teamed up to create four figure-friendly dresses in cotton, linen and jacquard ($98-$118) â€” just in time for summer. The chic collection of frocks (Emmy Rossum, Amy Smart, Kristin Cavallari are fans) were designed to be worn anywhere from the beach to work and are available in LOFT stores and on LOFT.com beginning today.
