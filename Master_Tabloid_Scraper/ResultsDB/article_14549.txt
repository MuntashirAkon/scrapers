What if you could pay Payless prices for a pair of designer heels? You could have money left over for a coordinating handbag! Thanks to Lela Rose, you might just be able to pull that off this season. Becoming the second guest designer in Payless history (Laura Poretzky for Abaete was the first last year) Lela Rose will introduce five shoe styles and a handbag to the mass retail chain. Her line pairs tweed materials with patent accents for her “classic with a twist” trademark style. Look out for two pump styles, a flat, a T-strap sandal, and an ankle-boot, from $25 to $40, currently available in all Payless stores. or shop the whole line at payless.com.
