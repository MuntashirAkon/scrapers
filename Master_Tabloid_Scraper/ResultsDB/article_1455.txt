Saving His Marriage! Tori Helps Dean Celebrate Sobriety Milestone/n
At last, Dean McDermott is showing Tori Spelling that he’s committed to saving their marriage. As new divorce rumors swirl, RadarOnline.com has learned that McDermott is showing he’s in it for the long haul by focusing on his sobriety. And he’s about to celebrate two years of it!
RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned that Spelling, 42, and McDermott, 49, visited L.A. recovery store My 12 Step Store in West Hollywood, Calif., over the weekend to shop for merchandise to commemorate his two years of sobriety.
According to an eyewitness who happened to be shopping in the store at the same time as the couple, “They said that Dean was coming up on his two years of sobriety and they were looking for a perfect gift to help him celebrate the milestone.”

The shop is a resource used by those in recovery to buy medallions, AA coins, books, AA jewelry, and the source said that Spelling bought her four-time baby daddy “a beautiful two year medallion that had fire flames on it.”
As Radar previously reported, the father of Spelling’s brood – Liam, 8, Stella, 7, Hattie, 4, and Finn, 3 – had decided to get sober after his cheating scandal was exposed in 2013.
In January of 2014, McDermott checked into rehab for substance abuse, alcoholism and sex addiction and, one year later, Spelling took her husband to the same recovery store that they visited this past weekend to celebrate his first year of sobriety.
