Under a dreamy canopy of hanging pink tulips, one could almost forget they were smack dab in the middle of the NYFW action—if it hadn't been for the swarms of photographers, editors and celebs filing into the Lela Rose show at the Skylight at Clarkson Square, of course.For our E! Style Collective fashion expert on the scene, Lindsay Albanese, the surrounding chaos served as white noise. As the show began, the celeb stylist found respite in a garden full of floral appliqué, sheer, fringe and pleated detailing and classic silhouettes.

"The collection is a beautiful balance of femininity and structure, which I feel is something that many women love," described Lindsay.

Although it would seem like a high-fashion collection for celebs with ladylike flair (think: Michelle Williams and Sienna Miller), there was an ease amongst the separate pieces, making this line a surprising option for those with edgier style."I'm always drawn to sharp tailoring and anything with an androgynous touch, so the standout pieces had to be the silver, metallic, tweed blazer with a fringed hem and the sheer (yes, sheer!), organza, tailored pants," noted Lindsay. "For most of the ready-to-wear separates, I would sport them in my everyday life. I would just style it with boots, flats and a crossbody bag for a more street-style look."There's no doubt that the collection was beautiful. Delicate dresses with button-up collars and sweetheart necklines would serve as perfect brunch or daytime wedding options. However, it's the possibility to style these pieces with attitude that make this collection truly appealing.Follow @LindsayAlbanese for more NYFW updates.
