Kerry Washington, Zoe Saldana, Ashley Greene and More Reject Lela Rose Fashion Show Invitation Sending an e-mail you don't mean to send happens to the best of us. And that's what transpired for one PR representative, according to P.../n
Sending an e-mail you don't mean to send happens to the best of us.And that's what transpired for one PR representative, according to Page Six.  Instead of e-mailing a tip sheet for designer Lela Rose's Fashion Week show, an internal list of all the celebrities declining the show was sent to the masses.Whoops.Details about why each celebrity could not attend were also revealed although many of them read "Declined: She will be filming."  Not very juicy responses.

So which VIP actresses are unable to attend the show on Sunday Sept. 8? Zoe Saldana, Kerry Washington, Emily Blunt, Ashley Greene and Mandy Moore to name a few.But the list wasn't all bad news. It did include the stars who will be attending, including Katie Cassidy and Brittany Snow.
