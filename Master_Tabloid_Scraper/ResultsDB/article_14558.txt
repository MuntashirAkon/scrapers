Here come the bridal gown sketches!Bridal Fashion Week is just around the corner, and we're seriously excited about the chic white confections set to be paraded down the runways in New York. The spring 2016 collections are sure to be stunning and, if these designer sketches are any indication, celeb wedding-ready too.No show puts forth more princess bride-worthy gowns than the catwalk at Marchesa, which is why we weren't surprised by the breathtaking sneak peek we got of the latest collection. One statement gown features floral embellishments that waft down the dress' tiered skirt. Also, that sheer overlay train? Everything.

Another sketch shows a more form-fitting frock with a ruffled train, waist-cinching belt and sweetheart neckline—pretty much the definition of bridal gown chic.




Lela Rose

Lela Rose's ready-to-wear collections are known for airy, head-turning frocks in statement hues (we were more than a little obsessed with the cascade of pastel confections sent down the brand's fall-winter 2015 runway). The wedding dress sketches prove to be in line with this aesthetic, like this sweeping mermaid gown with a plunging, sheer illusion back.



Lela Rose

We also fell for Lela Rose's embroidered wedding dress with a voluminous ball skirt, sheer neckline and short sleeves. Really, this is the kind of dress you get married to wear.Bridal Fashion Week begins in New York on April 15.—Additional reporting by Kathryn Eisman
