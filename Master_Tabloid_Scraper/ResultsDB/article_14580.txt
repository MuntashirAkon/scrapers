Hollie Or Skylar? The Shocking Elimination On American Idol!/n
By Radar Staff
In a shocking elimination, Skylar Laine is headed back to Brandon, Mississippi.
Despite two solid performances the night before singing Tina Turner‘s River Deep-Mountain High and Leona Lewis‘s Bleeding Love, the 18-year-old country singer was voted off the hit Fox talent competition Thursday night after receiving the fewest number of votes. (Host Ryan Seacrest said nearly 60 million votes were cast.) 
Laine found herself in the bottom two alongside perennial bottom dweller Hollie Cavanagh.

When Seacrest delivered the bad news to Laine, she hugged Cavanagh tightly and after composing herself, she sang Miranda Lambert‘s Gunpowder & Lead as the show closed.
With Laine now gone, Idol has its final four: Cavanagh, Joshua Ledet, Phillip Phillips and Jessica Sanchez.

 Another highlight of Thursday show was Coldplay performing two songs, Paradise and Every Teardrop Is a Waterfall, and fourth-season Idol winner Carrie Underwood performing Blown Away.
