After host Steve Jones announced her as the winner of the show’s first season in the states, the 19-year-old Florida native, who was born in the British Virgin Islands, could barely get any words out uttering, “Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God.”
Her coach Simon Cowell wasn’t at a loss for words however, telling the crowd, “I want to say, ‘America, thank you for giving this girl an opportunity.'”

Amaro defeated Wooster, Ohio soul singer Josh Krajcik (second-place) and Santa Cruz, California rapper Chris Rene (third-place) for the most viewer votes a night after she delivered a star-making rendition of Beyonce‘s Listen. 
Krajcik was a good sport in defeat, saying, “Melanie deserves it. She has a wonderful voice. I had such an incredible experience here. I got to be myself, sing what I want to sing, and I couldn’t be happier.”
