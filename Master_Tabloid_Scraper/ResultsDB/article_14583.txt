Blake Lively is used to scoring slots on best dressed lists, but even the most fabulous fashionistas experience a blunder every now and then!  The hot blonde skated herself onto the worst dressed list at the Gossip Girl Celebrates 100 Episodes bash, wearing a fringed and embroidered Marchesa dress – that was better suited for the Ice Capades!
As for wacky, always eccentric Helena Bonham Carter sassed up the streets of London, wearing a peasant dress with construction boots.
