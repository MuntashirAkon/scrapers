Prince, 14, Paris, 13, and Blanket, 9 all took to the stage to thank the audience. Paris was beaming while wearing a duplicate of her father’s famous red Thriller jacket.
While performers such as Christina Aguilera, Gladys Knight, Leona Lewis and Jamie Foxx performed their hit songs, many of the Jackson family members did not make an appearance.

Jermaine, Randy and Janet Jackson felt the tribute was not appropriate given the ongoing trial of Dr. Conrad Murray, who is facing manslaughter charges over the death of the King of Pop.
However, Michael’s siblings Marlon, Tito and Jackie did perform, billing themselves as the Jackson Brothers.
