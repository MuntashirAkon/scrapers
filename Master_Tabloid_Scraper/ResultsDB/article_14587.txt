 Bigscreen Bombshells And Brit Blunders!  The Best & Worst Dressed Stars Of The Day.../n
By Leah Ornstein – Radar Style & Beauty Editor
From the red carpet of the hottest movie premieres to the city streets, Hollywood’s biggest stars were dressed to rock and shock on Thursday – and RadarOnline.com has all the style winners and sinners in our daily photo feature.
If looking good is the best revenge, then Kate Bosworth is definitely playing the game well! PHOTOS: The Best & Worst Dressed Stars Of The Day
The skinny starlet hit the New York screening of her latest movie Straw Dogs, where she and her ex-BF Alexander Skarsgard shared the carpet – and boy did she look good.  Wearing a sexy, sparkling Antonio Berardi dress with Christian Louboutin ‘Super Vic’ heels and JewelMint Krishna Diamond Earrings, she definitely has her former flame regretting the break-up.
And they say, ‘birds of a feather flock together’ so it should come as no shock that Helena Bonham Carter has managed to find a pal who is just as fashionably challenged as she is.  The Brit thespian hit the streets of London in awful attire with a friend who sported totally tacky fashion as well.

Other haute hits included Victoria Beckham looking pretty in pink in one of her own dresses, Elisabeth Moss, who showed off her fab figure in an Herve Leger bandage dress, and Kate Moss, who rocked a vintage sweetheart strapless in London.
Other a la mode misses were experienced by Lacey Schwimmer, who stole Jessica Simpson’s granny jean style, and Uma Thurman, who was barely recognizable in NYC in sloppy street wear.
