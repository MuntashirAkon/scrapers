While watching her past vids with her assistant, Darnell Appling, the Spider-Man: Homecoming actress made no effort to hide the fact that her former self was cringeworthy AF. At one point during her commentary, the 20-year-old quipped: 

"What the fuck? I was trying to make this positive environment and trying to be this fucking ray of sunshine. This is the most annoying shit I have ever seen in my entire life. And the thing is, at the time I was like, 'Oh, the kids are going to love it. It'll be cool. Whatever.'"
Hey, at least she's being honest with herself! The triple threat continued:

"I seriously thought I was a fucking mogul, because I was like, 'Yo, this shit is so smart. I'm about to create this whole brand about positive, smiling shit—Disney's going to love this.'… I need to delete these, because it's so fake."
Oh, girl. Don't be too hard on yourself, we ALL do embarrassing things when we're younger.
Be sure to watch Zendaya roast herself for yourself (below). We promise, it's a good time!
