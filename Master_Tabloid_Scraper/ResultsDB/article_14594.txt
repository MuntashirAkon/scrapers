Leave it to Leonardo DiCaprio to arrange a mini Titanic reunion!
The A-lister threw an enormous, star-studded gala in the name of his foundation in St. Tropez, France on Wednesday night, and his costars Kate Winslet and Billy Zane were both in attendance!
So epic!

While Leo and Kate have remained friends since the film's release 20 years ago, we can't even think of the last time all three have been together since.
And the icing iceberg on top is that there's picture proof!
Billy (who played Cal, Rose's fianc√©) blessed us all with a snap he posted to Instagram, sharing:
