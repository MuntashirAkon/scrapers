Grindr users are getting an extra perk right now.It looks like songstress Leona Lewis has joined forces with the popular gay dating app to offer users a discounted price of her brand new album I Am. The news was announced through Grindr's Twitter, when they wrote, "@LeonaLewis returns with the new album #IAm. Get it for the #GRINDR special price, NOW!"Just how special is this special price? Pretty darn special. It's a steal for $3.99!While it may seem a little odd for some to hear about Lewis' partnership with the app, she's hardly the first artist to do so. Madonna previously gave Grindr users the chance to win a signed copy of her Rebel Heart album earlier in the year.

The new album comes shortly after Lewis opening up about her split from Simon Cowell's record label, Syco, after they opted to have her release a covers album as opposed to original music."A lot decisions had to be made by a lot of different people. Of course Simon [Cowell] being involvedâ€”there was a lot of decisions that had to go through him. So things got very delayed because he's a very busy person and taking control of things myself, things have got done a a lot quicker," the singer told BBC in June, and reassures there's no resentment between the two."There's no bad blood at all he sent me a really lovely note the other week saying they miss me at the label. There's nothing but love there. He knew I had to leave. He was upset about it but it was time for something new so I'm excited about moving on and doing something different."Leona Lewis signed a deal with Island Records which is also home to Florence + The Machine, Ariana Grande and Jessie J.
