Anyone else starting to seriously worry about Leona Lewis' well-being?Last year, Simon Cowell's homegrown protégé was both headbutted by a horse and suckerpunched by a fan. Cut to today, when she revealed that she recently—ready for this one?—fell down an elevator shaft.Those bodyguards of hers may want to reassess their targets—if there's anyone Leona needs protection from, it's herself.

The latest exercise in klutziness took place in Sheffield, England,  last Friday, while Lewis was performing onstage. As if it weren't going  to be embarrassing enough as it is.Luckily, she emerged unharmed in the incident, which occurred when  the elevator got stuck and she somehow fell down the remainder of the  shaft."We have been having problems with the lift," she explained. "It had  been going fine in rehearsals and then I had a bit of an accident and  fell down the lift shaft. It was quite scary."I was lucky not to get injured. Fortunately it happened during a  blackout on set and didn't affect the show and none of the audience saw  anything. I got a shock and had to be rescued."Ever the consummate pro, the show…well, you know."I had to just get back up and carry on," she said. And, presumably,  be wary of any falling pianos.
