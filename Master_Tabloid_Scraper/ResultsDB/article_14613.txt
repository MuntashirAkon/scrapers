Leona Lewis was at MTV's European Music Awards yesterday where she performed her latest single "Happy."She had walked the red carpet in harem pants so we weren't expecting too much from her stage style. But then the X Factor winner changed into this amazing custom Vivienne Westwood gown for her performance, and whoa! Total diva status.We are digging the extravagant full tulle skirt and pointy PVC corset. Not only does it flatter her figure, but she goes all the way crazy-fierce evil Barbie—and owns it.It's like a slap in the face to everyone playing it too safe on the red carpet.
