Miz Spelling and her famous family decided to have a surprise reveal for baby number five, and the Mystery Girls alum admitted she's never thrown this kind of pregnancy party before!
She confessed:

"With Liam and Stella we found out at the doctor's office. Hattie and Finn, we didn't find out, we didn't know until they were born. So this is the first reveal. We really wanted to do it with the kids because they were so excited, and we wanted to do it as a family!"
The cute fam found out the little bun in Tori's oven is a boy when they saw a Christmas tree all decked out in blue decorations! Too sweet!
We can't wait to meet Dean and Tori's fifth little one!
