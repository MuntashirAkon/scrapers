Tori Spelling Is Pregnant With Baby No. 5!/n

Tori Spelling has ANOTHER bun cooking in her oven!
Yup, you read that correctly. On Wednesday, the Beverly Hills, 90210 star and her husband Dean McDermott confirmed they are expecting their FIFTH child together. AH-Mazing!

In a candid interview with People, Miz Spelling revealed that this pregnancy was certainly a surprise. The blonde beauty dished: 
"It was a total surprise. But we always wanted a big family. I'm really excited."
Well, a big family is EXACTLY what they're getting as the twosome are already parents to their four children, named Liam, Stella, Hattie, and Finn. McDermott is also a dad to his son Jack with ex Mary Jo Eustace.
Tori continued:
"Dean was saying, ‘We just got Finn out of diapers; I thought we were in the clear!' For the first time this year, they're all in school. So it's like, wow. We're basically starting over."
LOLz!
However, the twosome's family bliss was tested awhile back when Dean's extramarital affair made headlines. Not to mention, the pregnant actress hasn't had the easiest year as she couldn't stop getting sick.
Of course, this baby news comes shortly after it was revealed that Spelling was ordered to pay $39,000 in credit card debt to American Express. Poor thing just can't catch a break!
Nonetheless, it appears as though the industry vet couldn't be more excited to expand her brood — even though she's had quite a few tough pregnancies in her past. The reality TV personality noted:
"This baby happened at the best time. Nothing is ever perfect, but I'm so madly in love with my husband and with our kids. The idea of adding to that is such a blessing."
We honestly couldn't be happier for Tori and Dean on their exciting baby news. Be sure to let us know where you're registered, m'kay??
