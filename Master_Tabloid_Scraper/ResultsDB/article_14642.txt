Pretty Curvy Woman! Julia Roberts Packs On 43 Pounds/n
The road to divorce court for Julia Roberts is paved with junk food wrappers!
That’s the obvious conclusion to come from this sensational photo of Julia on a recent day as she strained the sidewalk beneath her.
As a source told Radar Online, the 5-foot-8 star is so miserable over her tattered marriage, she has gobbled her way up to a scale-crunching 179 pounds.

Pals said Julia, 49, has been binging since December, when the father of her three kids, Danny Moder, reportedly moved into a house across the street from their Malibu mansion.
“Julia’s down in the dumps about Danny. She’s gained 43 pounds, and has totally given up on her diet and exercise regime,” a friend dished. “It’s all she can do to get out of bed in the morning. Once the kids are at school, Julia mopes around the house, watches TV and eats. She gets food delivered, and can polish off an appetizer, entrée and dessert — no trouble!”
Julia’s thunder thighs were on display during a recent outing with twins Hazel and Phinnaeus, 12, and son Henry, 9.

After 14 years of marriage, the Oscar winner and Danny, 48, “are living totally separate lives,” claims the source.
“He’s sick of her controlling ways and petty insecurities, and refuses to come home. Julia doesn’t want a divorce, and is holding on. But the anxiety is taking its toll on her weight.”
