Jermaine Jackson's Wife Files For Divorce Months After Domestic Violence Arrest/n
Jermaine Jackson‘s wife won’t be there anymore! Halima Rashid filed for divorce from her husband of 12 years months after her domestic violence arrest.
The couple cited irreconcilable differences in their divorce documents, People reports.
Rashid, 38, listed their separation date as November 28, 2015, which is the same day she was arrested for felony corporal injury.
Jackson’s estranged wife reportedly bit her husband’s leg, forcing him to call the police on her.

The case was later dropped because of “insufficient evidence.”
As Radar readers know, Jackson’s secret fling with a young blonde sparked his wife’s alleged attack.
“Jermaine and [his lover] have been seeing each other for nearly six months,” a source told Radar in January.

It seemed the couple worked things out though, as they were all smiles on the red carpet of an event last year.
Rashid, who does not have any children with the father of nine, is seeking spousal support.
The ex-couple tied the knot in August 2004 after only five months of dating.
This is the third failed marriage for Jackson, 61. He was previously married to Hazel Gordy and Alejandra Oaziaza.
