 Julia Roberts &  Danny Moder Share Romantic Stroll/n
They are rarely seen together in public, but that didn’t stop Julia Roberts  and her husband Danny Moder from sharing a tender embrace while taking a romantic stroll Saturday afternoon in Santa Monica.
Casually dressed in jeans, a striped red and white shirt, black jacket and sunglasses, the 45-year-old Hollywood heavyweight wrapped an arm around Danny as they walked.

Moder, a cinematographer, was also dressed for comfort and held on tight to his Pretty Woman as they met friends for lunch.
The lovebirds have been married for ten years, and have three children together, twins Hazel and Phinnaeus, and son Henry.
