By Radar Staff
Whitney Houston had a secret affair with Jermaine Jackson, the London Sun is reporting.
Michael Jackson‘s brother was married at the time the romance began in 1984 and ended a year later when Jermaine refused to leave his wife for the superstar, a source told the paper.
And when Whitney recorded Saving All My Love For You that year, she even cast a Jermaine look-alike in the music video.

Jermaine wrote about his deep feelings about Whitney in his 2011 autobiography but he didn’t admit to an affair.  His marriage to Hazel Gordy ended two years later.
Whitney and Jermaine remained friends up until her death last month.
