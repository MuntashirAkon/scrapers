RadarOnline.com was the first to report the couple would be jetting off to Paris for a romantic post Golden Globes break. Moder was a no show at the Globes, where Julia was a presenter, opting instead to stay behind at home and prepare for their Parisian vacation. Julia just inked a new $20 million deal as the “global ambassadress” for Lancome and the couple seized the opportunity to turn her advertising shoot for the French beauty brand into a romantic week-long trip for two. Their three children – five year-old twins Hazel and Phinnaeus and two-and-a-half year old Henry – are staying home in L.A.

Even though Julia and Danny are coming up to their 8th wedding anniversary, they married in a romantic ceremony at Julia’s New Mexico Ranch back in July 2002, they still look like a couple of newlyweds and every bit as much in love as when they first wed. /n
