EXCLUSIVE: Julia Roberts Packs Bags For Romantic Paris Getaway/n
Don’t think that there’s trouble between Julia Roberts and husband Danny Moder just because he didn’t join her at the Golden Globes last night. While Julia was attending the Hollywood Foreign Press Awards with agent Richard Lovett, Danny – who rarely attends industry functions with Julia — was making sure the couple’s bags were packed for a trip to Paris. The Pretty Woman just inked a new $20 million deal as the “global ambassadress” for Lancome, and the couple is turning her advertising shoot for the French beauty brand into a romantic week-long trip for two to the City Of Lights.
