While glamming it up in Versace, Oscar De La Renta, Rachel Roy and Christian Dior for movie premieres and awards shows, Kate keeps her daywear simple and California fresh. Whether strolling the streets with her man of the moment casually clad in jeans and a t-shirt, shopping with son Ryder near her home in Pacific Palisades in a flirty floral sundress, or breaking the waves in Malibu showing off her fat free body in an itty bitty bikini, Kate’s look is always imitated.
