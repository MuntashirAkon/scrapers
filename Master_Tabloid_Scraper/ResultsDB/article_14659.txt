Florida rockers Sister Hazel Tuesday made an immediate impact with their brand new seventh disc, Release, which shot up to the top spot on iTunes rock charts, and eighth overall, in its very first day on the market.
Wrote the band on its Web site: “This band has the greatest fans in the world, a heartfelt “THANK YOU” goes out to everyone who has picked up the new album!”
The group has been playing together for 15 years; it is named after Sister Hazel Williams, a nun who set up a homeless shelter in their native Florida.
In tandem with the album, the band has a 25-date, East Coast tour planned.
