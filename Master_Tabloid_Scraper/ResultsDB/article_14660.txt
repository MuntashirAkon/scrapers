Julia Roberts Inks Lower Back with Kids Names/n
Following her edgy (and obscenity filled) tribute to Tom Hanks, Julia Roberts continues to reveal her wild side.
Spotted Monday on vacation in Hawaii with husband Danny Moder and their three kids, cameras caught a new tattoo peeking out of the Oscar winner’s green bikini.
Situated on the small of her back, the tat consists of the names of her little ones surrounding an illustration.
Four-year-old twins Phinnaeus and Hazel‘s names are side by side rounding her backside, while just above them is Henry, nearly 2.
Roberts is next slated to appear in the movie adaptation of the best-selling Eat, Pray, Love. (Photo: Splash News) /n
