President Trump Creeps HARD On Female Irish Reporter In The Oval Office, America Apologizes/n

Don't think that destroying our healthcare and environment is leaving Donald Trump too preoccupied to creep out a female Oval Office guest.
Americans on Twitter were unsurprised yet embarrassed after an Irish reporter shared a video of POTUS singling her out in a meeting to compliment her smile.
Caitriona Perry, the Washington correspondent for Irish broadcaster RTE, was sitting in with press during Trump's phone call with Ireland's new prime minister when the "bizarre moment" occurred.

After Trump congratulated Taoiseach Leo Varadkar on his victory over the phone, he beckoned Perry over with his finger and cooed: 
"And where are you from? Go ahead, come here, come here. Where are you from? We have all of this beautiful Irish press."
Perry approached the president and told him where she was from before quickly retreating back to her seat, as the President told the Irish leader:
"She has a nice smile on her face, so I bet she treats you well."
WTF, dude? This is the Oval Office, not the Miss Universe dressing room!

Social media quickly reacted to Perry's video with frustration, embarrassment, and apologies on behalf of the Creeper in Chief.

*sigh* The apology tour Americans are going to have to go on after this turnip is ousted is going to be long.
We are truly sorry, Ms. P.

Yes. I'd like a huge sign that says "Pardon our mess, we are working on making America kind again."

We apologize that our president is a weird, inappropriate creep.

It's hell to be objectified. When POTUS has no fear of doing that surrounded by camerasâ€¦ I'm so sorry. Your success is more than a smile.
