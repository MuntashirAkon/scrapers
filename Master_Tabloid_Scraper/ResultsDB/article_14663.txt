Don't believe everything you read, especially from a third party entertainment news source trying to get clicks. Appreciate the concern.

Sounds like he was really dragging.
Miles Teller was arrested early Sunday morning after a late night of partying caused him to be drunk and disorderly in front of cops.
TMZ reports the Whiplash star was literally falling down drunk and refusing to cooperate with San Diego police officers after a night of partying.
The 30-year-old was out on the town with a group of guys when an officer noticed the actor was having trouble standing on the sidewalk.

Teller reportedly became uncooperative when the officer started questioning him, and soon lost his balance and  almost fell into a traffic lane!
After the cop handcuffed him, the actor apparently had a hard time standing in one spot — that's when things got even worse.
The cop reportedly offered to take Teller to San Diego's detox program — a volunteer center where townies can sleep off a long night of partying on a cot — but he refused.

Instead of arresting the uncooperative actor, cops took him to the detox center anyway hoping he'd be obedient. He wasn't, and reportedly refused to follow directions before being rejected by the staff!
Well, that's when Miles was arrested for being drunk in public. He was in jail for around 4 hours before being released without bail.
At least he got to sleep it off eventually… behind bars!
