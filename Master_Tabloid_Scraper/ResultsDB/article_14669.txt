Today is big day for cast and crew of La La Land.

The city of Los Angeles feted the movie by declaring April 25 to be La La Land Day. Though Ryan Gosling wasn’t in downtown for the festivities, he did step out in the quaint neighborhood of Los Feliz for a work lunch at Little Dom’s.
Wearing a green bomber jacket, the actor was spotted leaving the trendy eatery carrying white poster tube and what looked to be a script.

Across town, director Damien Chazelle joined producer Jordan Horowitz and Oscar-winning composer Justin Hurwitz to attend the celebrations at city hall — which included a live jazz band and aerial dancers performing a medley of routines inspired by the musical.
“With the film and the music, we were hoping to capture certain flavors, colors and feelings of Los Angeles, so to have the actual city embrace the film is very flattering,” Hurwitz told The Hollywood Reporter of the festivities. “It’s really cool that this movie has become a touchstone for so many people in so many places.”
