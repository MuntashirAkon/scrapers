Lionsgate is putting on a worldwide La La Land concert tour that will premiere on May 26 and May 27 at the Hollywood Bowl.

Justin Hurwitz, the film’s composer, will conduct his score for La La Land in Concert: A Live-to-Film Celebration, which will be performed by a 100-piece symphony orchestra, jazz ensemble, and choir. The live musical performers will accompany the film’s original vocal recordings. Lionsgate is also encouraging concert-goers to dress in the style of the movie or in vintage Hollywood costume.
“For me, one of the most thrilling and fulfilling parts of making La La Land was scoring the film to a live orchestra: a hundred phenomenal local musicians playing in real-time to the Technicolor images, bringing Justin’s compositions to vivid life,” said director Damien Chazelle [via Variety]. “I couldn’t be more excited to share that experience with audiences this summer, let alone in a setting as epic and as quintessentially ‘L.A.’ as the Hollywood Bowl.”
