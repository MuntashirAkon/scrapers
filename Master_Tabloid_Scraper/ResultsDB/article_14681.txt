EXCLUSIVE! John Krasinski Shares How Baby Daughter Hazel Helped Him With The Hollars/n
As we now know, John Krasinski and Emily Blunt's little family is expanding!E! News confirmed last week that the Hollywood couple are expecting another little one in the near future, making their daughter Hazel Krasinski a big-sister-in-training. So how does she feel about that? Well, she's a little too young to understand much of what's going on, according to the actor.We caught up with Krasinski at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah, during the premiere of his film The Hollars, who shared with us that his firstborn is "not even 2 yet, so we're still just enjoying that right now."

Although little Hazel may be too young to fully understand that she's going to have a younger sibling, she was still able to help her dad in a major way for his film Hollars, which tells the story of a man who returns to his small hometown after learning his mom has fallen ill and is about to undergo surgery."I had my daughter just before we shot the movie and I think had I shot the movie and directed the movie six months earlier, it would've been a totally different experience," Krasinski admitted."I think the raw emotion and also the appreciation of what you have and who you are and what you're responsible for becomes really palpable. So I've always had a great relationship with my family but it really does, all those cliches are true, it bonds you to your parents and your family really closely. So by the time I got on set, I had a whole lot more to work with."Anna Kendrick, Josh Groban and Margo Martindale also star in the emotional film directed by John.The film received a standing ovation from a Saturday morning audience at the festival, according to a photo shared by Krasinski on Twitter, where he wrote, "You'll never know how much this meant to me. Thank you."
