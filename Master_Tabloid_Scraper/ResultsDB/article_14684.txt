Hello, Hazel Krasinski!The Office's John Krasinski shared the first photo of his newborn daughter on Twitter Tuesday. "Pics of kids should only come direct from parents. So I'm thrilled to introduce you guys to Hazel!!!" he wrote.Krasinski and Emily Blunt became first-time parents on Feb. 16, nearly four years after the actors tied the knot in Italy. Based on the cute photo, Ralph Lauren-clad Hazel inherited her mom's sense of style!The family recently purchased a $2.75 million home in the Hollywood Hills (meaning they'll no longer live next to Jimmy Kimmel and Molly McNearney, who are currently expecting a baby of their own).It's the perfect place to raise a family, of course. "The walled estate is situated on two lots, offering plenty of privacy for the new parents," Redfin real estate agent Eric Tan told E! News of the 3,483 square foot home. "The house also has a beautiful swimming pool surrounded by a stone patio."

NEWS: Emily Blunt opens up about motherhood for the first time

Blunt has been keeping a low profile since her daughter's birth, but that will soon change. Later this month, she'll join Tom Cruise to promote The Edge of Tomorrow around the world. In fact, the co-stars are slated to attend three movie premieres—in London, Paris and New York—within a 24-hour period.
