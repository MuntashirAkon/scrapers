EXCLUSIVE! Emily Blunt Opens Up About Her Daughter Hazel and Her Family's Recent Move From L.A. to New York City: Watch! The cause hit even closer to home after the Sicario actress welcomed her firstborn daughter, Hazel Krasinski, in Fe.../n
To put it bluntly, Emily Blunt is a very lucky lady.The actress is aware of it, too, as she herself admitted at the Golden Heart Awards Thursday. The event, co-chaired by Anna Wintour and Michael Kors, celebrated those who are involved with God's Love We Deliver, which is the New York City metropolitan area's leading provider of nutritious, individually-tailored meals to people who are too ill to shop or cook for themselves.Other celebrities who attended the event included Kate Hudson, Diane Kruger and Bette Midler. For Blunt, showing her support was a no-brainer. "No. 1, I love Michael, so I'd pretty much turn up for anything that he would want me to. He's been so supportive over the years," she told E! News. "But to discover this very philanthropic side of him and just how much he does for so many people who are incapacitated, who aren't able to provide food for themselves of their families...It's everyone's worst nightmare to become sick and not be able to cook."

The cause hit even closer to home after the Sicario actress welcomed her firstborn daughter, Hazel Krasinski, in February 2014. "I don't have to think about it when it comes to feeding my child. It's not something that even occurs to me, that I wouldn't be able to afford something to buy her something to eat," said Blunt, who has been married to actor John Krasinski since 2010. "When she's hungry, I have something to give her. When she cries, I have something to give her," she said. "And if you don't have that ability, I can't imagine what that would feel like."Blunt's family recently relocated to New York City after living in L.A. "It's just a really important way to sort of cement the move," she told E! News, adding, "I love it!"This year's Golden Heart Awards honored two prominent supporters. Actor and Best Time Ever host Neil Patrick Harris received the Michael Kors Award for Outstanding Community Service, and Michael Sennott, the former God's Love Co-Chairman of the Board and current Chairman of the Board of Trustees.
