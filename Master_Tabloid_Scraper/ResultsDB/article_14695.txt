'Love & Hip Hop' -- Taking Over L.A. ... But Can't Land a Star!!!/n "Love & Hip Hop " is moving to L.A. for its new spin-off -- with episodes expected to start shooting later this month -- but producers are now facing a HUGE problem ... they can't find a big name to star on it.Sources close to production tell us, they initially planned to attach Ray J as the headliner, but he's currently tied up hosting  "Bad Girls Club All-Stars " on Oxygen so he couldn't sign on.Now we're told producers are scrambling to find someone else, but it's proving more difficult than they anticipated ... which is somewhat surprising, considering  "Love & Hip Hop " is one of VH1's highest-rated shows.According to sources, producers will start by shooting story lines for the smaller stars who have already signed on, including singer Brooke Valentine, radio DJ Yesi Ortiz, rapper Hazel-E, and video vixen Bria Myles. We're told producers have decided to worry about the bigger stars later.Sounds dangerous./n
