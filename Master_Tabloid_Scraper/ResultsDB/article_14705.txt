Blac Chyna's Creamy Cakes Haul in Major Dough/nBlac Chyna had a serious moneymaker on display for her 28th birthday party at a Miami strip club -- and we ain't talking about her ass.  Her 4-tier cake came fresh out of Dollface Delight Cakery in Miami, and we've learned biz is booming at the bakery since the high-profile gig at G5ive. Owners, and sisters, Raquel and Christina Basil tell us they whipped up their creation in 16 hours, but the hard work has paid off -- they've gotten nearly double their usual orders.   Who knew cake lovers hang at strip clubs on the reg? The sisters say BC's cake would normally cost between $1,100-$1,300, but they only charged $500 since only the giant gold ribbon and the bottom tier were edible. Delicious buttercream cake, btw.  Best of all ... BC actually got to have her cake and eat it too, since she's got a little Kardashian on the way. No word if Rob Kardashian took a cheat day./n
