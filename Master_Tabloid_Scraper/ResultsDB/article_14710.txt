Katt Williams: I'm Scoring Again with My 'Ride Or Die'/nKatt Williams has so much game it looks like he's getting back his chick Hazel-E ... even though his legal troubles got a gun pulled on her. We got the exes coming out of The Serving Spoon in Inglewood together, and Hazel immediately tried to play coy with our photog about the reunion ... but our sources tell us they started rekindling things this week. Which is why you gotta see what Katt said about Hazel being a ride or die chick. P.I.M.P.  They took a break in March after she got caught up in a raid at his house. Katt had a lot more to say about Hazel, his legendary rap sheet and drug rumors on TMZ's  "Rock Rants " ... featured on YouTube.   /n
