Baby Luna is gonna flip her sh*t one day!
Proud poppa John Legend hung out with the Sesame Street cast yesterday while filming his appearance for the upcoming season â€” and of course he recorded a special message for his adorable daughter!
That's right, the 8-month-old got a personalized greeting from none other than Elmo, Big Bird, Cookie Monster, Bert and Ernie, Grover, Abby Cadabby, Rosita, and Zoe. How cute!
We're old and we're freaking out! LOLz!
