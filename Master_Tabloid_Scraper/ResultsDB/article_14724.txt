Jimmy Kimmel Mashes Up Sesame Street With HBO's Girls — And It's SO WRONG!/n

Elmo can really deliver that witty banter!
On Saturday, Sesame Street packed up and moved to HBO from PBS for its 46th season!
It's no surprise that the premium cable network is an inneresting home for the preschool classic, being that most shows on HBO cater to a more adult audience!
So, Jimmy Kimmel decided to help the newbie get accustomed to a more mature network by combining footage of Sesame Street with audio from the HBO dramedy Girls!
Video: Jimmy Fallon & The Sesame Street Gang Photobomb Kids!
In the Jimmy Kimmel Live clip, Elmo and Abby have a hilarious discussion about sexuality courtesy of dialogue used in a scene with Lena Dunham and Andrew Rannells!
If you're wondering why they didn't spoof Game Of Thrones instead — Sesame Street already took care of that on its own!
Ch-ch-check out the muppet repartee (below)!
