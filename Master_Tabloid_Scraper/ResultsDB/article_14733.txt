The 1929 Spanish villa, designed by Ralph Flewelling and owned by Tony-winning actor, dancer and theater director Grover Dale, boasts four bedrooms and six bathrooms, an elegant crystal chandelier, a spacious living room and comes equipped with detailed and delicate decorations that adorn the grandiose home.
While this might be a temporary space, hues of soft yellow, rust and warm orange Spanish tiles create a very homey feel throughout the residence. Unlike any other mansion, the courtyard stuns as it offers views of a lush landscape with fountains, a sitting area, a spacious swimming pool and spa. 
Would you dish out $20K for this prime space? Take a tour of the luxurious home in the gallery above.
