All we can say is mazel tov!Jake Gyllenhaal, Christina Applegate, Ben Stiller and Debra Messing are among a host of celebrities joining forces with Grover and the rest of the Muppet gang for Shalom Sesame, a Jewish-themed version of Sesame Street aimed at teaching Jewish-American preschoolers about their culture and heritage.Per published reports, the 12-part series will follow our lovable furry blue hero as he and his A-list pals film educational segments with children in the U.S. and travel to Israel to visit some of Judaism's most prominent sites, among them the Western Wall.Other stars aboard Shalom Sesame include Greg Kinnear, Cedric the Entertainer and Anneliese van der Pol from Disney's That's So Raven.The show is actually a reboot. It was first adapted from the original Sesame Street in 1986 for American public television stations and then again in 1990. Past guests have included Joan Rivers, Sarah Jessica Parker, Mandy Patinkin, Mary Tyler Moore and Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara.No word if Cookie Monster likes matzo. The first installment of Shalom Sesame is due to premiere around the Hanukkah holiday in December 2010.
