Pippa Middleton Walks Down Sesame Street, Sees Grover and Turns Him Into a Jacket/n
We've been indulging in a lot of Muppet analogies lately, and we were going to back off for a while. But folks like Pippa Middleton just...keep...dragging us...back...in.Poor Grover.Yes, Pippa's purse and skirt technically match the jacket, but that doesn't mean that they complement the jacket. Especially when that jacket kinda looks like a bunch of pom-poms got shredded and then glued on in strips.

We're told that this jacket is faux fur, but Grover wasn't exactly made of 100 percent mink himself, now, was he?Now we're just sad.
