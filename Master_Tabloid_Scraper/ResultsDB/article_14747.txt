Sesame Street is introducing a new character—and contributing to a great cause in the process.The childhood favorite is launching a new initiative called Sesame Street and Autism: See Amazing in All Children with the aim to de-stigmatize autism, which affects one in 68 American children. At the center of the initiative is Julia, a new Sesame friend and preschool-aged girl with autism who is friends with Elmo, Abby Cadabby, and Grover. Julia will be seen in digital content alongside her friends, as well as printed story books.

"Sesame Workshop is uniquely positioned to play a meaningful role in increasing peoples' understanding about autism," Sherrie Westin, Executive Vice President, Global Impact and Philanthropy at Sesame Workshop, said in a statement. "This project is an extension of the belief we've always promoted: 'we are all different, but all the same.' I am passionate about this initiative, and am so proud of the partnerships with the autism community that have led to this."Sesame Workshop will work with 14 partner organizations, including Autism Speaks and the Council for Exceptional Children, to share the free resources they've created, and distribute them to educators in child care programs and schools to reach communities across America.For more information, you can check the initiative out at www.SesameStreet.org/Autism.
