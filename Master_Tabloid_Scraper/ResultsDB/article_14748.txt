New Game of Thrones is almost upon us, but before we head back to Westeros, Sesame Street has blessed us with Game of Chairs.The Game of Chairs will determine who will be the king or queen of Jesteros. Will it be Robb, Cersie, Joffrey or Daenerys? Grover is there to help determine the winner. Can we take a moment and admire the thrones? Whiffle balls and bats, golf clubs and balls and ping pong paddles and balls. Got to love Sesame Street.
