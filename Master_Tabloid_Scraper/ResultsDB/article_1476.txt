Dean McDermott Checks Into Rehab/n
Tori Spelling’s husband, Dean McDermott for “intense treatment” following reports that he cheated on Spelling during a work trip.
“I am truly sorry for the mistakes I have made and for the pain I’ve caused my family,” the Canadian native told People Magazine.  “I take full responsibility for my actions and have voluntarily checked myself into a treatment center to address some health and personal issues. I am grateful to be getting the help I need so I can become the husband and father my family deserves.”

Us Weekly broke the story over Christmas, claiming that McDermott, 47, slept with 28-year-old Emily Goodhand while promoting Chopped Canada in early December.
“He told me he and Tori had a sexless marriage,” Goodhand, who stayed two nights with the dad of four, told Us.  “I believed him.”
Since then, Spelling has been seen out in public sans a wedding ring, but has not spoken out about the story.
McDermott will be able to leave rehab to visit with his children – Liam, Stella, Hattie and Finn.  Spelling is said to be “much more heartbroken than anyone realized,” according to a friend.
The couple met while filming Lifetime’s Mind Over Murder (both were married at the time) and wed in 2006.
