Poker Legend Archie Karas Busted For Cheating/n
Archie Karas became a poker legend 20 years ago when he turned $50 into $40,000,000 during a single streak in Las Vegas.
Today Karas — real name Anargyros Karabourniotis — sits in a Vegas jail, arrested for allegedly cheating at the tables.
Karas is being held without bail at the Clark County Detention Center, reports the Las Vegas Review-Journal.

He was busted in Sin City in cooperation with San Diego County, Calif., authorities who allege he’d cheated the Barona Casino out of $8,000 while playing blackjack there.
Karas’ Vegas home was also searched.

Karas has four prior arrests for cheating at cards.  Each ended with plea bargains that knocked the charges down to misdemeanors.
“We were quite familiar with him,” Gaming Control Board Chief of Enforcement Karl Bennison told the Review-Journal. “He has a history with us.”
He’ll be in court for an extradition hearing on Monday. /n
