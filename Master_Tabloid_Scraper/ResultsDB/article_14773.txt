by Radar Staff
The producers of The Governator animated TV and comic book series have pulled the plug on the highly-touted project.
“In light of recent events, A Squared Entertainment, POW, Stan Lee Comics and Archie Comics have halted production,” a statement released Friday night by an A Squared spokesman said.

The obstacles in going forward were massive. The character, who would have been voiced by Arnold himself in the TV series, was a super hero who “leads a double life,” according to an outline for the show seen by The Los Angeles Times.
The Governator is also described in the outline as “a devoted family man.”

As RadarOnline.com has been reporting, the former California governor fathered a child with one of his family’s housekeepers, and kept it secret for almost 14 years.  His son by Mildred “Patty” Baena was born just a week apart from his son by wife Maria Shriver.
Schwarzenegger and Shriver are now separated.
