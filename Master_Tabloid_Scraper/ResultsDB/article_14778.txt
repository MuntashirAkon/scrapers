Cole Sprouse Clashes With Street Performer Allegedly Disrupting Filming For Riverdale — WATCH!/n

We smell drama!
This week, Cole Sprouse — yes, the one from The Suite Life Of Zach & Cody — got into it with a street performer in Vancouver who was supposedly disrupting production of Riverdale by loudly playing her music despite the teen drama series having a permit to film in the area.
In the beginning of the clip that surfaced online on Thursday, the 24-year-old can be heard trying to reason with the musician, saying:

"We can't film anything. I know you're asking for compensation; we're asking simply for an hour."

Before telling the crowd:

"Just in case you guys don't know how this thing works, this is one of the secrets of film production. We give a location to the city and then some scam artists come out and say-"
He was interrupted by the agitated artist, who clearly did not like the production crew entering her territory. The mood was tense AF!
