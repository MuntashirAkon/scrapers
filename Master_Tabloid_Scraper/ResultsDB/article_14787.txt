He’s all grown up now!

Cole Sprouse — best known for acting with his twin brother, Dylan Sprouse, in the popular Disney Channel series The Suite Life of Zack and Cody – was happy to step away from the biz for five years to attend college and gain some perspective.
Speaking with EW.com at the People & Entertainment Weekly’s Upfronts Party on Monday, Cole, 23, talked about his experience as a child actor. “There was a feeling of machination; I felt like an automaton. I needed to take a break and step outside myself … I needed a dose of reality, and I needed to see myself in a more objective point of view. And now I think I can enjoy [acting], which is a really fundamental part about being an actor.”

He added, “I’m not saying that we didn’t enjoy that time, but it was work. It’s a career and a business, and it got me to college, which is one of the most fantastic gifts I could’ve been given. But I’m glad to be [acting] on my own accord now.”
Indeed! Cole will be starring as Jughead Jones in The CW’s Archie Comics adaptation Riverdale. When asked if his brother, Dylan, might appear in the show, Cole responded, “I’m sure he’d entertain that idea.”
