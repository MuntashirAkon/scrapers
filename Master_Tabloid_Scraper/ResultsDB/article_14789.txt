Will Arnett has decided to share his dark story.

“I started to write this character based on things that I loathed in other people and the sort of injustice of the world,” the actor explained of the show’s plot. “It became this tough, uncomfortable process. And because I was putting a lot of stuff about my own life in there, I noticed it really starting to affect my mood and my behavior.”
However, the 47-year-old insists that he’s been clean for at least a few months now and regularly attends AA meetings. “I just know where this path goes, and it’s a dead end,” Arnett said. “I’m not the smartest guy in the world, but I’m smart enough to know that this is not where I want to live. And I’m a dad now, a parent first and foremost.”
He and his ex-wife Amy Poehler — who split back in September 2012 — have two sons together, Archie, 7, and Abel, 5. His decision to stay sober has a lot to do with them.
