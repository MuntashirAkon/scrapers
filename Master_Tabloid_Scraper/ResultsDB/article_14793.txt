The Good Wife’s Eli Gold just got a new love interest, and she’s a beauty.

Vanessa Williams has joined Season 7 of the political drama as a recurring character.
Variety reports the former beauty queen will play “an extremely successful, self-made businesswoman Courtney Boalt who is potentially interested in backing Peter Florrick’s (Chris Noth) campaign for president. She also sparks a mutual attraction with Eli Gold (Alan Cumming).”
The Good Wife creators Robert and Michelle King commented, “There are very few names you can put side-by-side that make you laugh. Alan Cumming and Vanessa Williams are at the top of that list. We couldn’t be more excited.”





The show saw departures from cast regulars Josh Charles at the end of Season 5 and Archie Panjabi at the end of last season. Williams will be joining Season 7 along with previously announced new series regular Jeffrey Dean Morgan, “an experienced and calm investigator named Alex whom Alicia (Julianna Margulies) hires,” new guest star Margo Martindale, who will portray “Willa Eastman, a campaign operative responsible for past successes by underdog presidential candidates in Iowa, who will also have run-ins with Eli,” and English actress Cush Jumbo, who will have a recurring role as Attorney Lucca Quinn.
The Good Wife returns Sunday, Oct. 4 at 10/9 c on CBS.
