As an actor, you win some and you lose some.
And as an audience, it’s perfectly normal to forget who’s won in the past, that is, unless they gave an epic, arm hair-raising speech, did something funny or controversial, or tripped on their way up to the microphone.

So in honor of the 67th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards on Sunday (Sept. 20), here’s a look back at 25 Emmy speeches you may have forgotten about.

Best Actress – Drama
Gillian Anderson: flawless then, flawless now. Here’s her acceptance speech from 1997 for her role as Dr. Dana Scully in X Files.





Allison Janney won the award for Best Actress in 2004 for her role as C. J. Cregg in The West Wing, and called Mariska Hargitay up on stage to share the win. Janney has won six Emmys to date.





 
Best Actress – Comedy
Julia Louis-Dreyfus has the unofficial title of best acceptance speech ever, when she and her Veep co-star Tony Hale channelled their characters President Selina Meyer and Gary the bag man, respectively, in 2013. She also won the award in 2014 and made out with Bryan Cranston on her way up to accept her award (watch here). JLD has won five Emmys (and been nominated 20 times) for her roles in Seinfeld, The New Adventures of Old Christine, and Veep.





Melissa McCarthy gave her acceptance speech for winning Miss America, as well as Best Actress in 2011 for her role in Mike & Molly. Her, Edie Falco, Laura Linney, Tina Fey, Martha Plimpton, and Amy Poehler all walked up to the stage to crown the winner (instead of watching from their seats, as is custom).





Jennifer Aniston won for her portrayal of the beloved Rachel Green in Friends in 2002, and what a throwback this one is: now ex-husband Brad Pitt gave her a kiss on the cheek before she head up on stage stunned.





Sarah Jessica Parker finally won a Best Actress Emmy for her eponymous role as Carrie Bradshaw in Sex and the City in 2004, the show’s last season.





Ugly Betty’s American Ferrera won the award in 2007, becoming the first Latina to win in that category.





Betty White won her own “golden girl” in 1986 for her role in Golden Girls. White has won six Emmys to date.

Best Actor – Drama
Homeland’s Damien Lewis won Best Actor for a Drama Series at the 2012 Emmys. This is just another excuse to look at his handsome face.  





James Spader won the Emmy for Best Actor in 2004, 2005 and 2007 for his role as Alan Shore in Boston Legal. In 2007, he joked that he felt as if he owed money to the mafia, referring to beating out The Soprano’s James Gandolfini.





We all remember Bryan Cranston’s beautiful speech from last year, which celebrated his bromance with his Breaking Bad co-star Aaron Paul and the end of perhaps the greatest television show of all time. Cranston won 4 Best Actor Emmys for his portrayal of Walter White. Here’s his acceptance speech from 2008.





 
Best Actor – Comedy
Oh Alec Baldwin, how we love thee Jack Donaghy. Baldwin took home the award for Best Actor for his role on 30 Rock in 2008 and 2009.





Ricky Gervais won Best Actor in 2007 for Extras, but since he wasn’t in attendance, presenters for the award Stephen Colbert and Jon Stewart gave the prize to Steve Carell, also nominated for hs role as Michael Scott on The Office. A year later, Gervais took his award back:





 
Best Supporting Actress- Comedy
Lisa Kudrow was perfection as Phoebe Buffay in Friends. She won in 1998.





Jane Lynch won in the Best Supporting Actress award in 2010 for her highly entertaining role as Sue Sylvester on Glee. 





Merritt Wever fantastically got straight to the point in her acceptance speech in 2013 for her role in Nurse Jackie.





 
Best Supporting Actress- Drama
Drea de Matteo won the award in 2004 for her role as Adriana on The Sopranos.





Katherine Heigl swore before ascending the stage to give her sassy acceptance speech for her 2007 win for her role on Grey’s Anatomy. The year after, she opted out of the Emmy’s race because she felt she wasn’t given enough good material to warrant an Emmy’s nomination, infuriating the writers, producers, and Shonda Rhimes.





Archie Panjabi won Best Supporting Actress for The Good Wife in 2010 for her stellar role as Kalinda Sharma. Well-deserved, and her character will be forever missed.
