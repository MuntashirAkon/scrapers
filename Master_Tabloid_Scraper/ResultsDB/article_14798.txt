Are The Good Wife fans in for a Kalinda surprise?
Production has only just begun on The Good Fight, a spin-off of the hit CBS drama — and Good Wife star Archie Panjabi already has us speculating about the potential return of her beloved, tough-talking character.
“You never know — you never know,” Panjabi, 44, told Entertainment Tonight on Monday.
“I mean, right now, probably not because I’m working [on Blindspot],” she added. “But if there’s anything I’ve learned in this business, [it’s that] you never know what’s gonna happen.”
The Good Fight will center on Christine Baranski and Cush Jumbo’s characters, Diane Lockhart and Lucca Quinn.

Showrunners Robert and Michelle King are returning for the new series, which will chronicle an enormous financial scam has destroyed the reputation of a young lawyer, Maia Sindell (Game of Thrones‘ Rose Leslie), while simultaneously wiping out her mentor Diane Lockhart’s savings. Forced out of Lockhart & Lee, they join Lucca Quinn at one of Chicago’s top law firms.
We also know that Maia hails from one of Chicago’s preeminent families, and Diane will be clashing with a rival attorney.
Panjabi’s new gig, Blindspot, is filming in New York City — and so is The Good Fight, meaning it wouldn’t be impossible, geographically speaking, to secure her for a brief cameo should the star be interested.
Speaking to PEOPLE in September, Panjabi said her Blindspot chracter is “equally tough and tenacious” as Kalinda.
“I just don’t think she uses sex as much as Kalinda,” she added. “But she’s got a lot of other tricks up her sleeve.”
The Good Fight premieres on CBS in February 2017, before moving exclusively to CBS All Access, the network’s subscription video on-demand and live streaming service.
