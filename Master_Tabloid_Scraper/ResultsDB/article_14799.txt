The Good Wife's Archie Panjabi on Her 'Tough and Tenacious' New Blindspot Role/n
It’s been more than a year since Archie Panjabi walked away from The Good Wife, but the Emmy winner can’t seem to shake the character of Kalinda.
“I think the show is so successful and the character was very, very beloved, so I guess I should take that as a compliment,” Panjabi, 44, says of the fervor with which fans still react to her 2015 departure.
Now, Panjabi has signed on for season 2 of Blindspot as Nas Kamal, the head of a secret division of the NSA that has been tracking the Jane Doe case from afar.
“She’s a very fun, strong character,” Panjabi says of her new role. “She’s a leader and very protective of her team.”

As for how her new character compares to Kalinda, “I would say this one is equally tough and tenacious,” she says. “I just don’t think she uses sex as much as Kalinda. She’s got a lot of other tricks up her sleeve.”
Season 2 of Blindspot premieres Wednesday at 10 p.m. on NBC.
