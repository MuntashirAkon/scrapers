Archie Panjabi on Her Good Wife Exit Drama: 'It Was Time for Me, for Many Reasons, to Unzip the Boots'/n
Many fans were devastated when Archie Panjabi announced she was leaving The Good Wife.
“I loved playing the role of Kalinda,” Panjabi told reporters at the Television Critics Association panel for NBC’s Blindspot on Tuesday. “I had such a great time on [Good Wife]. It’s something that’s very special to me.”
Panjabi won an Emmy in 2010 for her portrayal of hard-edged investigator Kalinda Sharma. The actress starred on the first six seasons of the CBS legal series, but left under a cloud of drama after fans spotted that Panjabi and the show’s star, Julianna Margulies, did not shoot their final scene together.
“In terms of anything that happened on The Good Wife, I think it’s only respectful for it to stay on The Good Wife,” Pajabi told reporters at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills on Monday when asked about the drama. “It was time for me for many reasons to unzip the boots and step into another show.”
Now, Panjabi has joined season 2 of Blindspot. She’s not allowed to divulge much, but her character does seem to have a lot in common with her Good Wife alter ego.
“There is a mystery of what the character is,” says Panjabi. “She is tough. She is tenacious. She’s wild. She’s unpredictable.”
And fans of Kalinda’s wardrobe are in luck!
“I can tell you for those of you who miss the boots,” Panjabi said, referencing her old character’s signature look. “I do wear a pair of knee high boots on Blindspot.”
