Norman Lear Slams Donald Trump: 'He Is Archie Bunker – Can We All Seriously Agree This Is Bad for America?'/n
Norman Lear created the Archie Bunker on the iconic ’70s sitcom All in the Family, but he’s not laughing at the similarities he sees between the lovable bigot and presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.  
“He is Archie Bunker,” the legendary producer said Thursday during a Writers Guild event, Deadline reports. “I think of Donald Trump as the middle finger of the American right hand.”   
Lear, 93, then asked the audience: “Why is this happening? Whether you’re a Republican or a Democrat, can we all seriously agree this is bad for America?”
The longtime producer went on to give his opinion on why Trump, 69, may have some appeal to Americans.    
“I think this is a case of the American people saying, ‘This is the kind of leadership you are giving us’ – because they didn’t invent him. The Republican party handed it to them,” Lear added. “I think they are saying.  ‘Screw you.’ I don’t think they are married to the notion that he is going to be a great President.”

Lear’s comments around the same time as a violent protest broke out in San Jose, California, after Trump supporters left a rally at the city’s convention center.   
Videos posted on Twitter show one woman wearing a “Trump” jersey being cornered by the mob and pelted in the face with eggs, spit on and doused with water bottles.   
The California primary is scheduled for June 7.
