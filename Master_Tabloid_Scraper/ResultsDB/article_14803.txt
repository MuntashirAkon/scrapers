The Good Wife: Archie Panjabi Fires Back After Julianna Margulies Says They Couldn't Shoot Final Scene Together Because of The Fall/n
In May, Archie Panjabi‘s bittersweet exit from The Good Wife was mired by the news that she and costar Julianna Margulies did not actually film their characters’ last scene together.  
 As Entertainment Weekly confirmed, CBS used a split-screen, editing the actresses into the same frame – reportedly because of discord between them.   
 Margulies, 49, tried to temper the rumors at the New Yorker Festival on Sunday, denying a feud. 
 “It’s totally gossip,” she said, according to Vulture. “I feel people just like to have gossip or make something into something that isn’t there. There’s no animosity on my part. It’s a shame, because I wonder if it was two men, when one finds out that he f—ed his best friend’s wife, if it would get that same attention, you know what I mean?”

The Emmy winner also suggested Panjabi, 43, was too busy shooting Netflix’s crime thriller The Fall: “You also have to remember, there’s difficulty … [Panjabi] was also doing another show, called The Fall. I went along with whatever [creator Robert King] asked me to do and I did it happily.”  
 But Panjabi shot down Margulies’ version of events Monday, tweeting that The Fall “was not even in production at that time and I was in New York ready to film the scene!”
