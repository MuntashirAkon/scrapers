Archie Artist Tom Moore Dies at 86/n
If you grew up reading Archie comics, there’s a good chance you have Tom Moore to thank: The artist was one of the people who drew the series from 1953 to 1988. He died on Monday at age 86.  
According to Moore’s obituary in his hometown paper, the El Paso Times, he began cartooning while serving with the U.S. Navy during the Korean War. He drew a caricature of his captain and was called into the captain’s office as a result. However, he wasn’t punished for the drawing but instead offered a job as a staff cartoonist.  
After the war, Moore spent more than three decades drawing the freckle-faced Archie, “America’s Typical Teenager,” and his ongoing adventures with Jughead, Betty, Veronica, Moose and the rest of the Riverdale gang.   
Moore’s other cartoonish credits include Snuffy Smith, Mighty Mouse and Underdog.  
The Archie Comics Facebook page paid tribute to Moore on Tuesday night, posting one of the strips Moore had drawn.    

Upon learning in 1996 that the El Paso Museum of Art would display some of his Archie art, Moore reflected on his work on the long-running series.   
“I have enjoyed what I’ve done and I am pleased that others liked it, too,” Moore told the El Paso Times. “I think it’s such a kick that my stuff is going to be hanging at the museum. Who knew Archie would have such universal appeal?”
