Finally, your awkward childhood feelings for Archie, Jughead, Betty, Veronica and the rest of the gang will be justified with Riverdale, The CW's new drama based on Archie Comics.The series, which hails from super producer Greg Berlanti and Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa isn't your mama's Archie. It's dark, broody and sexy—think Gossip Girl antics with a murder mystery. In the new trailer below, you'll see that Archie (KJ Apa) isn't the peachy keen boy from the funny books. Archie gets it on…with a teacher?"A kid is dead, Archie, and she told you not to say anything," Jughead says to Archie.

Luke Perry also stars as Archie's dad with Molly Ringwald as Archie's mom. Hey, the red hair had to come from somewhere. Marisol Nicols, Mädchen Amick, Shannon Purser, Ross Butler, Cody Kearsley and Madaline Petsch also star in the ensemble cast."The choices you're making right now, they do have consequences," Perry's Fred Andrews warns his son in the trailer.Riverdale premieres Thursday, Jan. 26 at 9 p.m. on The CW.
