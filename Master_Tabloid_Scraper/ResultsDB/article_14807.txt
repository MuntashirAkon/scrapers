Julianna Margulies has heard the Archie Panjabi feud rumors and theories and said that's all rubbish. The Good Wife star spoke about the perceived tensions between her and Panjabi, who left the series at the end of season six with a CGIed final scene with Margulies, during The New Yorker Festival."Right, I've heard about [the feud]. Who says that? It's totally gossip," Margulies said at The New Yorker Festival, according to Vulture. "I heard that question had been asked to [co-creator] Robert King. There's no story there, sorry â€¦ I actually had heard [that rumor] and I feel that it has been talked about and answered. I feel people just like to have gossip or make something into something that isn't there. There's no animosity on my part. It's a shame, because I wonder if it was two men, when one finds out that he f--ked his best friend's wife, if it would get that same attention, you know what I mean?"
