Archie Griffin -- Johnny Manziel Will Do Fine ... But I Want Him to Lose! /nThe Heisman Fraternity always sticks together ... mostly ... so says football legend Archie Griffin who tells TMZ Sports there's a good reason he hopes Johnny Manziel racks up a big  "L " this weekend. The 2-time Heisman Trophy winner (the only man to ever win twice) was out in NYC yesterday -- and while he wouldn't reveal his favorite for this year's statue, he says all 3 finalists belong at the ceremony. But when we started talking about Johnny Football -- who won the Heisman during his freshman season at Texas A&M -- Griffin reminded us why he'll be rooting for the other team. At least for this week./n
