Archie Griffin -- Jameis Winston Could Win the Heisman TWICE ... Just Like Me/nFlorida State QB Jameis Winston could be the next Archie Griffin ... so says Archie Griffin, who tells TMZ Sports he strongly believes JW could be the second man in history to win the Heisman TWICE. Of course, Griffin -- perhaps the greatest Ohio State football player of all time -- is the only man to hoist the trophy in 2 separate years ... and when AG arrived at LAX for the Rose Bowl, he spelled out why Jameis is the next great double-Heisman hope. Archie (super nice guy BTW) also told us why he thinks college football players have it harder now then they did back in the '70s. Plus, he picks a Super Bowl winner ... though he might be a little bias. Check out the clip./n
