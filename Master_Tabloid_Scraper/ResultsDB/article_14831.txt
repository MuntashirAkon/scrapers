Matt Barnes Blasts New Orleans Pelicans/nMatt Barnes is PISSED at the New Orleans Pelicans for cutting his boy Lance Stephenson -- saying Lance busted his ass for the team, only to get waived after he got hurt.  Stephenson suffered a groin injury and will require surgery that will reportedly keep him out for 6 to 10 weeks. So, New Orleans waived him and signed Archie Goodwin to take his roster spot.  The move infuriated Barnes.    "So my man Lance Stephenson busts his ass for the Pelicans, gets hurt, requires surgery & what does he get for his hard work??? WAIVED SMFH, " the Sacramento Kings star wrote.   "Something fans have to understand is y'all get mad when players leave during free agency or hold out for money.. We have to do what's best for US, we have a small window to make as much money as we can. "  "Remember this is a BUSINESS when you can no longer serve your purpose these teams cut you trade you or bury you on the bench! "  "Case in point, Lance gets hurt playing & needs surgery now, so instead of supporting him & helping him get healthy they cut him! #Bulls**t #HoldYaHeadLilBro. "/n
