At the time, Ted, the couple’s only child, was 26-years-old.
Rafael wrote in his petition for divorce from his wife of 27 years, “The marriage has become insupportable because of discord or conflict of personalities…that destroys the legitimate ends of the marriage relationship and prevents any reasonable expectation of reconciliation.”
After the couple’s property was divided, including a 1998 Toyota and their marital residence in Houston, their divorce was finalized on Feb. 13, 1997. Eleanor quickly dropped her husband’s last name and went back to her maiden name of Darragh.

The end of his parents’ long marriage doesn’t bode well for scandal-plagued politician Ted. As Radar reported, Ted, 45, was recently accused of hiding secrets from his wife, Heidi, including alleged flings with five different mistresses.
An insider claimed, “If Ted doesn’t work things out in his marriage, he could be headed for divorce and he has a lot more to lose than his father did almost 20 years ago.“ /n
