“Diane Lane and Josh Brolin have decided to end their marriage,” said a spokesperson for the couple. The divorce papers listed February 13 as the date of separation, although People cited a source who claimed Josh and Diane split prior to that.
The  couple  married in August, 2004 at Brolin’s California ranch and  both have been divorced once before. They did not have children together, but Lane has a daughter, Eleanor Jasmine Lambert, 19, from her first marriage, and Brolin has Trevor, 24, and Eden, 18 from his.

As RadarOnline.com previously reported, 2013 got off to a rough start for Brolin, who was arrested in Santa Monica just before midnight on January 1 for public intoxication after getting a little too involved in the holiday revelry.
“New Year’s, that’s what happened!” he laughed afterwards.
Brolin, 45, was spotted out in Los Angeles Friday, smiling and appearing to be doing well.

In 2004, just four months after his marriage to Lane, Brolin, who is Barbara Streisand’s stepson, was arrested for spousal battery. The actress called police claiming Brolin had hit her but she didn’t press charges. Their spokesperson later claimed it was all a misunderstanding and the police matter was dropped.
But recently there were no outward signs of trouble between the couple and Brolin called Lane “a very strong woman,” in an interview last month, adding, “We just do our own thing.” /n
