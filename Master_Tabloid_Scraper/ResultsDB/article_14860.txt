Complete Chaos Erupted In NYC After Trash Fire Causes Major Subway Delays/n

Talk about a rough Monday.
Commuters in NYC were in for another rude awakening this morning when a trash fire spread to the tracks and caused major blockages and delays for thousands of MTA riders from Brooklyn to Manhattan.
This was a really serious situation as we're hearing 11 people were injured during rush hour, and they were sent to the hospital for their injuries. Yikes.

According to NBC New York, "service on the B and C lines was completely shut down in both directions for two hours, as was A and D train service above 125th Street."
Around 10 a.m. service resumed but faced "extensive delays."
Take a look at the chaos people were dealing with (below):

Looks like there was a really bad MTA track fire. No trains running from 145th ACBD station. Cops and firefighters everywhere. Cool, cool.
