Andrew Garfield's Drag Number To Whitney Houston's I'm Every Women Is His Best Performance To Date! WATCH!/n

Way to WERQ it, Andrew Garfield!
On Tuesday evening, the Hacksaw Ridge star surprised fans by popping up on stage at the Werq the World Tour show in London. And Emma Stone's ex didn't just make an appearance at the drag show revue, as he also donned a curly wig and lip-synced to Whitney Houston's I'm Every Woman.

Yas üëè yas üëè YAAAAAAS! The 33-year-old attended the show alongside Nathan Stewart-Jarrett and Russell Tovey, who currently star in the London revival of Angels in America with Garfield. Nonetheless, Andrew was completely alone onstage as he rocked out to the late Miz Houston's classic.
The impromptu performance was brought about thanks to the show's Wig in a Box segment ‚Äî and it's safe to say that the Oscar nominee brought his A-game for the number.
Not only did The Social Network alum perfectly lip-sync along to the banger, but he also pulled out an EPIC back flip.
Be sure to ch-ch-check out footage from Andrew's performance (below)!

However, Andrew wasn't the only superstar in attendance as Laverne Cox popped up in a pic (pictured up top) next to the celebrated actor and host Michelle Visage. On Andrew and Laverne's visit, Miz Visage wrote:
"What a show, what a night! Thank you as always üá¨üáß YOU ARE MY HEART AND SOUL.

The drag show also featured RuPaul's Drag Race vets Violet Chachki, Kim Chi, Shea Coulee, Detox, Shangela, and Sasha Velor. What a line up!
