Louis Tomlinson Will NOT Face Criminal Charges Following That Airport Arrest!/n

Looks like Louis Tomlinson might be off the hook — criminally, anyway!
As you may remember, the One Direction singer was arrested earlier this month at baggage claim at LAX after getting into an altercation with a photographer and another woman reportedly in an effort to defend his girlfriend, Eleanor Calder.

In the latest news surrounding the incident, TMZ reports the 25-year-old will not face criminal battery charges — but will instead have an informal hearing at the L.A. City Attorney's Office where an officer will advise both parties on how to conduct themselves in the future.
Sounds like a slap on the wrist to us! Could have been much worse!
The hearing will take place later this month.
