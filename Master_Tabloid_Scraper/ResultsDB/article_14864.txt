We won't have what they're having.
Two brothers were arrested on multiple charges after terrorizing an Indianapolis apartment complex on Sunday — while they were completely naked.
Noah Batz (above, left) and his younger brother Timothy (above, right) were tripping balls throughout the naked rampage, in which they attacked a woman who stumbled upon them "passionately making out" near a dumpster.
The assistant manager at Lighthouse Landings apartments alerted police and urged residents to stay away from the the insescuous, drug-feuled make out sesh.

Unfortunately, one unassuming woman came to close to the Batz boys and received several punches to the face — resulting in a large knot on her forehead.
The woman fled the attack, but was chased to her car by one of the brothers who began banging on her windows hurling death threats.
The brothers continued the crazy onslaught by jumping and banging on cars in the parking lot — and even going inside unlocked vehicles and getting blood on the seats.
Police detained and arrested the naked brothers, who claimed they were high on  psychedelic mushrooms and marijuana.
