Tomlinson and Campbell, 21, first sparked romance rumors when they were spotted getting handsy at a Chicago ice cream parlor late last year. At the time, the twosome were joined by Campbell’s family, fueling speculations that the British heartthrob was in town to meet his gal pal’s folks for the holidays.
Previously, Tomlinson was romantically involved with fashion blogger Eleanor Calder for nearly four years before calling it quits in 2015. In early 2016, he welcomed a child — son Freddie Reign — with friend Briana Jungwirth.
