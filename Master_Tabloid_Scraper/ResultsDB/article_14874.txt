This dad-to-be may be officially off the market.

One Direction’s Louis Tomlinson may be preparing for the birth of his first child with Briana Jungwirth, but that doesn’t mean he hasn’t found time to date. Just two weeks ago Tomlinson was first linked to The Originals actress Danielle Campbell after grabbing a milkshake together, and now it looks like they’re ready to take their love public.

Continuing their theme of dessert dates, yesterday (Dec. 20, 2015) the couple was spotted at an ice cream parlor in Chicago, joined by Campbell’s family. A fan who was lucky enough to be grabbing ice cream at the same time, snapped a picture of the couple cuddling up in line, and claims he even kissed her on the cheek.
