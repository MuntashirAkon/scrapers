Fashion is definitely not this mother-daughter duo’s kryptonite.
Diane Lane and daughter Eleanor Lambert looked stunning at the Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice premiere at Radio City Music Hall in New York City on Sunday.
The 51-year-old actress donned a plunging floral design by Naeem Khan. Meanwhile, Lambert, 22, chose a white long sleeve crop top and skirt combo. The NYU senior is the daughter of Lane’s ex-husband Christopher Lambert, whom she was married to from 1988 to 1994.

Lane is once again collaborating with director Zack Snyder, reprising her role as Superman’s adoptive mother Martha Kent following the 2013 Man of Steel film. Also returning for the highly-anticipated DC Comics superhero feature are Amy Adams, Laurence Fishburne and Henry Cavill, who plays the title character.
At the star-studded NYC premiere, Lane was joined by her cast mates Ben Affleck, Jesse Eisenberg and Gal Gadot, who stole the style spotlight in Balmain. Also at the event were Matthew Morrison, Will Smith, Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Nina Agdal.
