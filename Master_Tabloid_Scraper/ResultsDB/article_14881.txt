This Congresswoman Might Have Just Made the Worst Parking Job, Ever (VIDEO)/n

A 77-year-old congresswoman is the latest member of an elite club: people who are caught being truly terrible at parking.  
In video first published by Roll Call, Eleanor Holmes Norton, a delegate representing Washington, D.C., appears to have forced her small sedan the incorrect way into a parking spot – the other cars are parked at an angle, but she pulled straight in.   
As one of at least two people recording her notes aloud, “She has hit the red car next to her repeatedly … If she parks like that, she should not be a member of Congress anymore.”  
After about 90 seconds, the video ends with Norton walking away. But she said she left a note.  
“After the Congresswoman parked her car, we assessed the cars on either side to see if there was any damage. We could not find any,” a Norton aide told Roll Call’s Heard on the Hill. “But we left a note with a business card so the congresswoman could be contacted in case we missed any.”  
The aide added: “The congresswoman heard from the owner of the only car she was close enough to damage. The owner reported no damage.”  
That means Norton already has a leg up on this woman.
