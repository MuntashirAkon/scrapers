Watch James McAvoy & Jessica Chastain Fall in Love from Different Perspectives/n
The first trailer for James McAvoy and Jessica Chastain‘s groundbreaking romantic drama was released Friday, and it has already gained Oscar buzz and thousands of fans.  
The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby, directed and written by Ned Benson in his feature film debut, tells the story of a couple going through a rough patch and trying to find what Chastain’s character calls “someplace good.”  
Benson shot the movie from three different points of views – “Him,” “Her” and “Them” – to create three totally different films.    
Also starring Bill Hader, Viola Davis, and William Hurt, The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby: Them comes to theaters Sept. 26, and the “Him” and “Her” versions will be released later this fall.  
Check out the trailer below.
