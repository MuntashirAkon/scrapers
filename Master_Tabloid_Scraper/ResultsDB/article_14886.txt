James McAvoy Flips Over Taxi in New York City/n
No stunt doubles here!  
James McAvoy fearlessly flipped over the hood of a taxi while filming The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby in New York City Friday.  
In the scene, the Scottish actor, 33, has an explosive fight with on-screen wife, Jessica Chastain. After their argument, McAvoy is hit by a passing taxi.   
Not one to shy away from a potentially dangerous stunt, McAvoy bounded into the air as he was struck by the vehicle, rolling over the hood and finally crashing onto the pavement.  
But even with fake blood dripping down his face, McAvoy was all smiles as he joked with Chastain, 35, in between takes.  
At the present time, there is no scheduled release date for the film.
