"When I got the email in October that Nutmeg had been born and would join our family in a couple months I literally squealed with excitement," Spelling wrote. "Maybe not the ideal timing with my baby due so soon but all babies are blessings whenever they come into your life!""Nutmeg is so sweet and such a great addition to our family!" she said. "My babies absolutely love her! Welcome to the family Nutmeg!"According to the American Mini Pig Association, mini pigs should be bred to grow to be an average of 20 inches tall—the size of a Siberian Husky—and weigh between 50 and 150 pounds.The Spelling-McDermott family has acquired several pets over the years, including dogs, a goat, bearded dragons, a hairless guinea pig and chickens.

"I feel great. I'm enjoying pregnancy again," she told E! News weeks later. "It's really nice to be going through this pregnancy with my kids this age."
