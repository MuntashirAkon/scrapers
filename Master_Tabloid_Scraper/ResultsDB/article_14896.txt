"Liam, good," Helena approves, adding, "Eleanor, not good. I've set a series of meetings for you with merchandisers and manufacturers.""We've already put the royal warrant on half the products on the planet," Eleanor replies.

"But this would be the Eleanor warrant," the queen explains. "You can endorse condoms or personal lubricant." LOL!Check out the clip above!
