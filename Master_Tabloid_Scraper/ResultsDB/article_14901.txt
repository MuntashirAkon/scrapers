Nic Cage's Car in "60 Seconds" Ripped Off?/nA version of the souped-up Ford Mustang that Nicolas Cage stole in  "Gone in 60 Seconds " was knocked off from the original  "Gone " flick and is being marketed and sold unlawfully, a new suit alleges.TMZ has obtained a suit filed by Denise Halicki, the daughter of Toby Halicki, Hollywood's so-called  "Car Crash King, " against Carroll Shelby, the legendary auto designer and driver. Halicki claims that a Mustang that Shelby helped design and market with Ford, based on the 2000 movie, is a full knock-off of  "Eleanor, " the car from the original  "Gone, " made by her father in 1974. Halicki alleges that Shelby and his companies knew that they  "did not have the right to copy or clone Eleanor " from the original movie. What's more, she says that Shelby's marketing and selling of a version of the Mustang is a  "blatant theft " of Halicki's creation. A call to Shelby Licensing, which is named in the suit, was not returned./n
