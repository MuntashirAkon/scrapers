Louis Tomlinson -- Once, Twice, Three Times a Player (PHOTOS)/nOne Direction's Louis Tomlinson is easing back into bachelorhood ... by hooking up with multiple chicks at once -- or so it seemed when a pack of at least 3 went to his London hotel room.  Tomlinson was partying at Cirque Le Soir Wednesday night ... before the after-party moved to the Soho Hotel. Best part of the rendezvous -- the girls' walk of shame Thursday morning -- although maybe it's more like walk of fame ... when you've raged with a One Direction singer all night? Tomlinson broke up with GF Eleanor Calder last month after 4 years together. Everyone mourns in their own way./n
