Is that you, Mimi?For her role as a slave in The Butler, Mariah Carey got a complete makeunder. Understandably, in order to transformed into her character, Hattie Pearl, the singer had to ditch her signature stilettos, diamonds and mini dresses for simple duds and minimal makeup.

Mind you, this isn't the first time the singer has ditched her diva ways for a part. Gone was the extravagant glamour in 2009 when she tackled the role of social worker Mrs. Weiss in the film Precious, which won Oscars for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Supporting Actress—Mo'nique too home the honors at the awards show.Back then critics praised the star for her part in the film and considering The Butler's all-star cast—Terrence Howard, Forest Whitaker, Oprah Winfrey and Jane Fonda, to name a few—perhaps she will be headed back to the Academy Awards for another stripped down portrayal.
