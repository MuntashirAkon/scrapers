‘Roseanne’ Remake Secrets: How Will The Show Handle Glenn Quinn's Death?/n
Roseanne, one of the most successful ’90s TV comedies, is making a comeback — but the joyful reunion will be overshadowed by a dark tragedy! The blue-collar family sitcom, featuring Roseanne Barr, John Goodman and Sara Gilbert, will be missing one of its brightest stars: Glenn Quinn. The Irish actor tragically died in 2002 of a heroin overdose. He was 32. Glenn had made a bundle while working on the show, but after getting hooked on booze and drugs, he lost it all. During his sad last days, the homeless junkie had been crashing on a friend’s couch — which was where his lifeless body was found. “He lost everything because of his addictions to booze, coke and heroin,” says a source close to Glenn. “Everyone in the cast and crew loved Glenn,” Roseanne said shortly after his death. “We adored him.” An insider who worked on the show told Radar, “Glenn’s death casts a pall over the new show!”
