Rigged Election?! DEAD People Caught Casting Votes In Colorado/n
The dead have risen in Colorado! At least, that’s what voting ballots will tell you as allegations of voter fraud are running rampant.
Several cases of dead people voting from the grave have been reported in the swing state. A local media outlet discovered that “Somebody was able to cast a vote that was not theirs to cast,” Chuck Broerman, an El Paso County Clerk and Recorder said.
The fraud was discovered by “comparing voting history databases in the state with federal government death records,” The Washington Examiner reported.

It still remains ambiguous as to how fraudulent votes were cast, but Colorado Secretary of State Wayne Williams said, “We do believe there were several instances of potential vote fraud that occurred” and that “It shows there is the potential for fraud.”
CBS4 reported that one of the most obvious cases of fraud involved a woman named Sara Sosa, who died in 2009, but voting records showed ballots “cast for Sosa in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013,” the report claims.
Colorado is a major swing state in the national election, where Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump remain tied, CNN reported.
