Coroner Releases Alligator Attack Victim Lane Graves' Autopsy/n
RadarOnline.com has obtained a copy of Lane Graves‘ autopsy, showing the toddler tragically died of injuries sustained to his neck, scalp and skull after an alligator attack at Disney World.
As Radar reported, Graves, 2, was playing in shallow water at the the Seven Sea Lagoon at the Grand Floridian Resort when an alligator snatched the Nebraska boy, who was vacationing with his parents at the property in June.
“This afternoon a complete autopsy was conducted on Lane T. Graves by Dr. Sara Zydowicz, Associate Medical Examiner with the District Nine Medical Examiner’s Office,” a rep for the Orange County Coroner told Radar shortly after the little boy’s body was found intact on June 15.

“The skin on the left side of the hair-bearing scalp in the parietal region has two recent puncture wounds,” continued Zydowicz’s gruesome findings.
