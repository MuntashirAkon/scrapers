Alligator Killed After Dragging Toddler To His Death At Disney Hotel/n
Authorities have killed the alligator responsible for dragging and drowning a 2-year-old boy at a Disney World resort last week.
The Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission are “confident” they have killed the animal that snatched Lane Graves.
“There are no words to describe the profound sadness we feel for the family of Lane Graves,” Nick Wiley, executive director of the Florida Wildlife Commission, said in a statement. “We will continue to keep this family close to our hearts as they deal with the pain and grief of the loss of Lane.”
Six alligators were taken out of the Seven Sea Lagoon at the Grand Floridian Resort after the reptile attacked the young boy playing in the water alongside his parents.
The toddler’s body was found intact on Wednesday, June 15.
“This afternoon a complete autopsy was conducted on Lane T. Graves by Dr. Sara Zydowicz, Associate Medical Examiner with the District Nine Medical Examiner’s Office,” a rep for the Orange County Coroner told Radar. “The cause of death was ruled as a result of drowning and traumatic injuries.” /n
