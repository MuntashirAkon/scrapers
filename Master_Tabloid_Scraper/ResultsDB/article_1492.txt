Tori Spelling and Dean McDermott have some great news: They're expecting their fourth child!"Dean, Liam, Stella, Hattie and I are beyond thrilled to announce that another little McDermott is on the way!" Tori posted on her website Friday. "We feel truly blessed that another angel has found us."Spelling, 38, gave birth to daughter Hattie last October. She and McDermott, her hubby since 2006, are also the proud parents of Liam, 5, and Stella, 3.So how does the actress turned reality star juggle work with raising three (soon-to-be four!) kids?

It's not always easy!"There are days when I struggle with wanting to be a full-time, stay-at-home mom, and feeling guilty about that because I work," she told Parenting magazine. "[One mom at school recently said,] 'Oh, you never go to anything.' That hit me really hard.""I'm scared of screwing up my kids. I thought that once we were out of the baby stage, parenting would be a breeze," she said. "You just feel at every turn like, whoa, am I making the right decisions, setting the right boundaries?"Somehow we think Tori and Dean's brood will turn out just fine.â€”Reporting by Marcus Mulick and Claudia Cagan
