‘Teen Mom OG’ Star Confirms MTV Show Is Fake/n
Sorry, Teen Mom fans! You favorite show is fake.

According to Simon Saran, the on-and-off boyfriend of Teen Mom OG’s Farrah Abraham, all the drama on the MTV series is crafted by producers. The reality star recently spilled the tea about the set when he was asked if crew members would set up dramatic “situations” for the cameras.
Recalling the time co-star Amber Portwood and Matt Baier got into a fight over their engagement, Simon claimed the entire incident rehearsed and acted out.
Via Teen Mom Talk Now:
Simon said matter-of-factly, “The Amber and Matt wedding scene was fake. It’s been shot more than once.” Back in the spring, Matt asked Amber to marry him on the spot while they were attending a friend’s wedding in Las Vegas. She didn’t want to because she wanted her family and daughter in attendance. Matt was so angry that he said he would never marry Amber.
