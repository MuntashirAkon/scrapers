Every now and then a good game of beer pong can lead to love.Such was the case for Sara Rue, who married longtime love Kevin Price (who she met while beer ponging) Saturday during a beachside ceremony at the Bel Air Bay Club in Pacific Palisades,  Calif., according to People.

Rather than opting for a traditional white gown, the 33-year-old Jenny Craig spokeswoman and Shedding for the Wedding host reportedly wore a coffee-colored Amsale dress down the aisle of her hummingbird and butterfly-themed wedding.The couple has been engaged since August 2009.This is the second wedding for Rue, who was previously married to writer Mischa Livingstone.Cheers to the newlyweds!
