It's official!Sara Gilbert married her longtime girlfriend Linda Perry on Sunday in front of close friends and family.Aisha Tyler, her The Talk co-host, gushed about the couple's big day saying that it "was the most beautiful ceremony at sunset overlooking the ocean."The couple got engaged almost one year ago after the singer-songwriter popped the question at a Los Angeles park.According to Gilbert, Perry planned a romantic proposal with a backup guitar player and brass band that she put together specifically for the big event."We go to a park, and we have food and we're eating it, it's really sweet and there's this guy sitting playing guitar, like a street musician, and he starts playing this song that we love," Gilbert recalled."I'm like, 'Oh, that's so weird, this is so magical and amazing.'"
