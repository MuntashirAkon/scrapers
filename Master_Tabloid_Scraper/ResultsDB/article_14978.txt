1st Female Ref -- I GOT HER BACK ... Says NFL's Orlando Scandrick/n / /   If they can do it in the NBA, there's no reason female refs can't kill it in the NFL too -- so says Dallas Cowboys star Orlando Scandrick who says he's excited for Sara Thomas to make history.   "I look forward to it, " Scandrick said in L.A. this weekend ...  "I'm sure she'll get the adequate training and she'll be fine. " There are people who are concerned that Thomas is putting herself in harm's way -- due to the risk of being hit during a play -- but Orlando says that's BS and says he's convinced she can hack it.  FYI -- Thomas is a 41-year-old mother of 3.  Anyone really wanna question her toughness? /n
