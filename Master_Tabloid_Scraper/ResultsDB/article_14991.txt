Underage DJs Kill at Grammy Party/nTwo DJs tore it up at the Warner Music Group Grammy party last night -- and amazingly, both of them are under 10 years old! Six-year-old Ryusei and nine-year-old DJ Sara set the scene on fire as they twirled turntables at Vibiana, leaving the audience of recording artists and execs absolutely stunned! Like many of the partygoers, they needed someone else to drive them home./n
