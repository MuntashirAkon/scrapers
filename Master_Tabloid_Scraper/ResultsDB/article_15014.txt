VOTE: Who Wore It Better — The Crown's Claire Foy Or Josie Geller From Never Been Kissed???/n


Left: The Crown's Claire Foy wearing sequins and puffy sleeves on the 2017 Golden Globes red carpet.
Right: Drew Barrymore aka Josie Gellar rocking a shiny pink, errr, statement frock in the 1999 movie Never Been Kissed.
Drew's dress was all the rage in the '80s, so Claire thought it would be a great dress for her win tonight. Right?? That's totally what she thought, we're sure!
Anyway — we want to know who YOU think wore it better, so vote here… FOR YOUR COUNTRY! 



Here's hoping her night doesn't end up like Josie Grossie's…
