Bella Thorne Has A Miley Cyrus Moment On The American Music Awards Red Carpet!/n

My oh, Miley??
Bella Thorne was tongue out a la Miley Cyrus on the American Music Awards red carpet in her continued attempt to break away from that wholesome former Disney image. LOLz!
She looked hot as hell in an Anthony Franco black tuxedo jacket, Josie Natori pants, and sky high Stuart Weitzman sandals. Miz Thorne finished off the look with her fierce red and green locks and a sultry red pout.
