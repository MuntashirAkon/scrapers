Hugh Hefner Has SOLD The Playboy Mansion — And The Guy Next Door Is Moving In!/n

It really is the end of an era!
On Monday it was revealed that Hugh Hefner has OFFICIALLY sold the Playboy Mansion! We were shocked when we first learned that the adult magazine mogul was parting ways with his famous abode, but now it looks like it's a done deal.
But the six-acre estate isn't being turned over to a total stranger, because Hef's neighbor Daren Metropoulos﻿ is in escrow to purchase the party pad.

When the Illinois native listed the mansion back in January, he was asking for a whopping $200 million. And while we don't know exactly how much the 90-year-old will be getting for his place, it's reportedly going for over $100 mil!
We know this huge house is legendary and all, but that's still quite a pretty penny!
As for the new owner, Daren is the son of billionaire C. Dean Metropoulos﻿, and his family actually used to own Pabst Brewing Company.
So we wonder if he keeps the party legacy alive, will guests be sipping PBR instead of champagne?! LOLz!
