Hey Kourtney Kardashian, Someone Else Is Eyeing Your Man/n
Scott Disick is a popular fellow — so much so that someone has put him on their bucket list.
In the upcoming episode of E!’s Keeping Up With the Kardashians, the beau of Kourtney Kardashian is contacted by someone named “Josie” who claims to be terminally ill and would like to meet the suave star before she, well, kicks the bucket.
Though Kourtney is suspicious of the whole thing, her man is all up for a get-together. After all, who wouldn’t want to bow before the great Lord Disick?
Catch an all new episode on Sunday at 9PM on E!.
