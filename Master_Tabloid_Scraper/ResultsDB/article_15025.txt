 Yee-haw!
Slipping into a racy unicorn costume, Courtney Stodden was sure feeling frisky this Halloween season.
While en route to a house party, the 18-year-old reality TV starlet and her husband Doug Hutchison opened up about why she chose to dress like the mystical creature.

“I am the king of the unicorns,” Hutchison, 52, explained. “And I have found the most beautiful and naughty unicorn in the enchanted forest of Hollywood.”
“He’s going to ride me back to the party!” Stodden quipped.

The blonde beauty’s racy costume was made by designer Josie Stevens.
“Her clothing line rocks,” added Stodden.
The couple’s costumes are quite the departure from last year’s getups.
In 2011, the infamous duo — who currently star together on the VH1 reality series Couples Therapy – proved they had a sense of humor when Hutchinson dressed up as his wife. Meanwhile, Stodden wore a sexy, cleavage-baring cheerleader costume for the festivities.
