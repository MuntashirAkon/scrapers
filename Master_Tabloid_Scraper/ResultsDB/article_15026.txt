 After trying on oh-so-many sexy costumes, Courtney Stodden has decided what she wants to be for Halloween.
The 18-year-old reality TV star, who shot to fame in 2011 when she married Lost actor Doug Hutchison, then 51, at the age of 16, was seen leaving a Hollywood Halloween bash in a skimpy unicorn costume designed by Josie Stevens on Sunday.
Stodden’s husband, 52, was also dressed to impress as he stepped out in a plush cape and crown.
Hutchison’s costume is quite the departure from last year’s getup.

In 2011, the infamous couple — who currently star together on the VH1 reality series Couples Therapy – proved they had a sense of humor when Hutchinson dressed up as his wife.
Meanwhile, Stodden wore a sexy, cleavage-baring cheerleader costume for the festivities.
