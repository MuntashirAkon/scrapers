Heather Locklear Moving Back to Melrose Place?/n
Watch out, people, because it sounds like Heather Locklear is gearing up to return to Melrose Place—with a vengeance!
People magazine reports that Locklear is currently in talks to reprise her role as scheming ad executive Amanda Woodward in the CW revamp of the ’90s TV sensation.
“We’re huge fans of hers,” says executive producer Todd Slavkin, laying out the criteria for returning Melrose Place alum (which so far include Laura Leighton, Thomas Calabro, Josie Bissett and Daphne Zuniga): “Does it feel organic? Does it not feel contrived? That’s really what’s important to us.”
Oh yeah, this feels organic. And scandalous!
Readers, sound off in the comments section: Are you excited to see Amanda Woodward return to the small screen?
