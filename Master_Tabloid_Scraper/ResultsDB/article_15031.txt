Remember When: Tara Reid Dated Carson Daly?/n
Ahh…Tara Reid. How everyone loves you so! 

Doesn’t it seem like ages ago that Tara actually had a attention-seeker talented fiancé who wanted to marry her? 
Back in 2001, Carson Daly and the bikini-designing genius were hot and heavy everywhere they were spotted.
This was when she actually had a career—c’mon, how great was Josie and the Pussycat Dolls?
All kidding aside, it looks like Tara is doing better these days and she has paid off found a new love interest to keep her company. Right.
