Josie Duggar Celebrates Her 5th Birthday at McDonald's (PHOTOS)  /n
Josie Duggar just celebrated another birthday, and her family couldn’t be more thankful.  
“It’s a huge milestone for her at 5 years old, because of course she was in the hospital for six months, Jim Bob Duggar tells PEOPLE of his daughter, who was born via emergency c-section at just 25 weeks gestation and weighed only 1 lb. 6 oz.  
“She was pretty fragile there for the first six months and even the first couple years,” he adds. “But she’s gotten stronger and stronger, and it’s hard to hold her down now! We are thrilled with her progress and so thankful to God that she is alive and doing so well.”  
So how did the family celebrate the big day? A fun lunch at Josie’s favorite spot, McDonald’s, followed by a trip to Boingo Bounce, an inflatable bounce house park.

“We had a great time,” says Jim Bob of the party, which Grandma Duggar, cousin Amy, Jill and Derick (who are expecting their first child in March) and Ben and Jessa all attended. “Even the big kids were bouncing around.”  
Now, with Josie’s birthday festivities behind them, the 19 Kids and Counting stars are headed to El Salvador, where they will hand out 500 backpacks full of toys and clothes to people in need.
