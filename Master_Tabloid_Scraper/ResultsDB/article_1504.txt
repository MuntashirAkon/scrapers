The 35-year-old actress gave birth Thursday night in Paris to a son who she and boyfriend Guillaume Canet named Marcel.
Canet, 38, is a director who collaborated with Cotillard in 2010’s Little White Lies.
Cotillard won a Best Actress Academy Award in 2007 for her role as Edith Piaf in La Vie en Rose, but her most challenging role is surely going to be that of a mother!
