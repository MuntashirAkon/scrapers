Jose Canseco's Daughter -- I Promise I Won't Do Porn ... For the Next 5 Years/nJose Canseco has TWO big reasons to be excited for his 17-year-old daughter Josie:1) she just signed a brand new reality show contract2) In the deal, she agreed NOT to participate in any X-rated content for the next 5 years! Josie inked a deal to be on  "@SummerBreak " -- a popular YouTube reality show that follows high school kids in L.A. during their summer break. Because Josie is under 18, she had to file a minor's contract with the L.A. court system to be approved by a judge -- and in the docs it shows she'll get paid a total of $2,600 for her role. But the docs also show that Josie agreed to a clause which states that for the next 5 years,  "she shall not provide services in an 'adult-themed' film or video program or perform onscreen services for any film or video program that is pornographic, involves nudity or graphic violence. "She also agreed to stay away from appearing in content that contains material  "derogatory of any race, nationality, ethnic identity, gender or sexual orientation in any media. "It's a bizarre contract for her to sign -- not just because she's a model and racy photo shoots are part of that world -- but because her mother happens to be Jessica Canseco ... aka Playboy's Miss September 2005. But what happens if Josie breaks the contract after she turns 18? The production company could sue her for the $2,600 … plus other damages -- which could mean big bucks. We called the Cansecos for comment -- so far, no word back. /n
