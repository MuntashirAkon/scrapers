 'It's Nasty!' Watch Judge Joe Brown Reveal What Life Was Like When He Was Tossed In Prison.../n
Judge Joe Brown sat down exclusively with RadarOnline.com to recount his recent stint behind bars.
“It’s nasty,” Brown said of the Memphis prison he was tossed into for five days. For starters, the retired judge notes that the “place is filthy.” In fact, he points out, it’s so bad that the lights have to be left on so the cockroaches don’t climb all over the bedding.
“The jail is effectively a slave warehouse,” blasts 68-year-old Brown, who was housed in a cell separate from other prisoners.

While Brown found his fellow inmates to be emotionally immature, he appreciated the company of the prison’s staff, with whom he would “talk for hours about things that are going on.”
Brown noted that prison officials gave him a booklet on avoiding sexual abuse. However, he says, “I wasn’t worried about that. Most of the inmates when I saw them [yelled] “Judge Brown! Judge Brown! My mama loves you!”
Despite his star status, Brown explains jail is just “a place you really don’t want to be.”
