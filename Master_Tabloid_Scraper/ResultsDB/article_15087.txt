'Why I Disagree With My Dad': Ivanka Trump's Awful Us Weekly Cover Becomes An Early Father's Day Meme!/n

Remember when Us Weekly was bought by Donald Trump supporter and friend David Packer's American Media Inc.?
If you've been waiting for the other shoe to drop, you can put down your magazine now. And by that we don't just mean leave the waiting room — we mean stop reading Us Weekly.
If this week's cover is any indication, the celeb mag is going to do exactly what we expected and start normalizing this crooked family who've taken over our government, starting with Ivanka Trump.

In fact, the "Why I Disagree With My Dad" headline is so completely ludicrous — Ivanka has not and is not "taking a stand" any time soon — Twitter couldn't help but laugh about it.
Several people just responded directly to the inanity of the cover: 

Congrats to @IvankaTrump​ winning the most un-self-aware person in the world award! #WhyIDisagreeWithMyDad #DumpTrump #DisagreeWithDaddy pic.twitter.com/3d7JvlLrkm

Dad: "I know who Trump is, but at least he’s not going to make me love anyone I don’t want to love"
Me: OK…#WhyIDisagreeWithMyDad https://t.co/BFvIA7g1WQ
