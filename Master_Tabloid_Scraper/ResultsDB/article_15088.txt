Attention All Children & Former Children!/n

Have no fear! Captain Underpants is here! (Or at least he will be on June 2.)
Based on the beloved book series (which is celebrating its 20th anniversary this year!), Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie follows grade school pals George and Harold, who let their predilection for pranks get out of hand when they hypnotize their principal into becoming a superhero.
If you think that's nuts, just wait until he's actually needed to stop a supervillain!
