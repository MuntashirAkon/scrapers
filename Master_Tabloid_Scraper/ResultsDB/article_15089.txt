It's official.
Amid speculation that Scarlett Johansson and Romain Dauriac have been separated since last summer, the 32-year-old actress has officially filed for divorce from her husband of two years.
According to Page Six, the Lucy star's attorney, Judith Poller, served the divorce papers to Dauriac's lawyer, Harold Mayerson, on Tuesday.

The filing, which says the marriage is "irretrievably broken," also requests full custody of the couple's daughter Rose, who was born just before their nuptials in 2014.
Mayerson claims his client plans to put up a fight in the expected custody battle:
"He would like to move to France with his daughter and Ms. Johansson does a lot of traveling. It will be an interesting process."
Ugh, we hate to hear about another celeb kid swept up in a messy custody war (especially after such a short marriage) — but we're hoping for the best!
