McCarthy joked to E! news, “It’s just what Chris does. He likes to go topless all the time.” And it was distracting. And he was weirdly, awesomely funny. She explains below:





The actress, who was in L.A. promoting the holiday collection of her Melissa McCarthy Seven7 fashion line at Lane Bryant, stars alongside Hemsworth, Kristen Wiig, Kate McKinnon, Leslie Jones, and many more in the anticipated all-female reboot of the 1984 original, which starred Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, and Sigourney Weaver.
Director Paul Feig also confirmed that we’ll be seeing a topless Hemsworth in the film. “You will be seeing some man flesh,” he said to E! at The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences’ Governors Awards.
No complaints here:
