“Who you gonna call?”
Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig and Kate McKinnon, of course! The trio were spotted filming scenes for the upcoming Ghostbusters reboot today.

McCarthy, Wiig and McKinnon along with Cecily Strong and Leslie Jones are heading up the highly-anticipated remake of the 1984 film starring Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, the late Harold Ramis and Sigourney Weaver, much to the world’s excitement. Oh, Chris Hemsworth is going to be in it too.

In the photos, McCarthy can be seen carrying a ghost trap, which means they’re getting down to business.
Director Paul Feig (who also directed Spy, Bridesmaids and The Heat) revealed to Entertainment Weekly back in October that the reboot wouldn’t quite be an exact remake of the original.
He explained, “I love origin stories. That’s my favorite thing. I love the first one so much I don’t want to do anything to ruin the memory of that. So it just felt like, let’s just restart it because then we can have new dynamics. I want the technology to be even cooler. I want it to be really scary, and I want it to happen in our world today that hasn’t gone through it so it’s like, oh my God what’s going on?”
Are Murray and Aykroyd going to make cameos in the new film? What’s the status of the iconic theme song? We have so, so many questions.
Check out the first pictures from the set in the gallery above. You’ll see Kristen Wiig wearing a questionable matching blazer and skirt, while Kate McKinnon’s getup is real snazzy.
Ghostbusters is set for a summer 2016 release.
