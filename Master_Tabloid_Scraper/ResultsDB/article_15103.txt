 Google has finally released it’s annual Year in Search data, and SPOILER ALERT! Kim Kardashian leads several of their top 10 lists.  (Like we didn’t already guess that would happen!)
But while the reality star was busy doing things like getting married and breaking the internet, which definitely led to her Google popularity, she actually wasn’t the most searched named on the internet… And unfortunately, it’s probably not for the best reason.

Jennifer Lawrence tops the global list of most searched people on the internet, which is likely due to her nude photo leak over the summer–though it’s not to say her hilarious personality and acting skills didn’t add to that, too!
Check out all the lists below:
