17-Year-Old New Yorker Accepted to Every Ivy League School/n
Harold Ekeh’s family moved to the United States from their native Nigeria when he was 8. He’s done pretty well for himself since then. Ekeh, a senior at Elmont Memorial High School in Long Island, New York, has a GPA of over 100, he got a 2270 (out of 2400) on the SAT, and – oh yeah – he’s been accepted to all 13 colleges he applied to, including all eight Ivy League schools, as well as Johns Hopkins and MIT.  
Because you haven’t meditated on your own shortcomings enough today, Ekeh is also a Model U.N. leader, a drummer, a youth choir director and a leader at a mentorship program at his school. “My parents’ hard work and my hard work finally paid off,” Ekeh, 17, told the New York Post.  
Elmont’s principal, John Capozzi, told CNN that Ekeh is “one of the most humble young men I’ve ever had the opportunity to meet.”   
“Anybody who sees my story can say, ‘If he can do it, I can do it,’ ” said Ekeh, who celebrated the news of his acceptances with the almost comically humble move of going to Chipotle. “I’m just a kid who had a real strong support system.”  
Ekeh’s story comes just over a year after the story of another Long Islander, Kwasi Enin, who was accepted to all eight Ivy League schools in 2014.
