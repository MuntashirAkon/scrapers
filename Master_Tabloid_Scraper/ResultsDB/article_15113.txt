80-Year-Old Retired Principal Wins $326M in Mega Millions Jackpot/n
Retired high school principal Harold Diamond may be hearing, “I told you so,” from his wife for the rest of his life.   
Diamond’s wife, Carol, 74, urged him to stop at a Valero’s gas station in Middleton, New York, Nov. 4 to wait out a storm. To pass the time, Diamond, 80, purchased 10 lottery tickets for $10.   
The next day while playing golf, he overheard that the winning Mega Millions ticket was purchased at the exact gas station where he bought the tickets, not far from his Wurtsboro, New York, home. And that evening, the couple confirmed the lucky numbers while watching TV.  
“I saw the first five numbers, so I immediately knew we won a million,” he told the Daily News. “And then when I saw the last number, I yelled up to my wife, ‘I think we won a few bucks!’ ”   

A few bucks was actually more like $326 million, the largest jackpot in the history of the New York Lottery, even after taxes. All in all, Diamond netted $130 million.   
“It couldn’t have happened to nicer people,” a spectator told the Daily News at the ceremony where Diamond and his wife, a former math teacher, received the check Monday.   
They plan to use the money to help family and give back to the local community, according to NBC.
