Oscar Winner Harold Russell Dies/n
Harold Russell--the only person to have won two Oscars for the same role--has died at the age of 88.                Russell, who lost his hands in World War II and then went on to score the Academy Award two-fer for his portrayal of, yes, a disabled war veteran in the classic The Best Years of Our Lives, suffered a fatal heart attack Tuesday at a nursing home in Needham, Massachusetts, the Associated Press reports.                A volunteer who joined the Army the day after Pearl Harbor, Russell was serving as sergeant in the demolition squad of the parachute corps when, during training in North Carolina, a block of TNT he was holding detonated prematurely, ripping off both hands.                He was fitted with special hooks and became so adept that, in the words of 1946 Life magazine profile, "there was no normal daily function he could not perform with them, except to tie his neckties." Russell also joked that he "couldn't pick up a check."                His proficiency was captured by an Army documentary crew, which profiled his rehabilitation in Diary of a Sergeant. One of Hollywood's biggest players, Samuel Goldwyn, saw the documentary and decided to cast Russell, who had no real acting experience, as the disabled vet Homer Parrish in The Best Years of Our Lives.                The film, about vets coping with life back in the real world, was a smash, winning seven Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Director (William Wyler) and Best Actor (Frederic March). In 1998, Best Years ranked 37th on AFI's list of 100 Greatest American Movies.                Thanks to the film, Russell occupies a special place in Tinseltown trivia. He's the only actor ever to have won two Oscars for the same part--a Best Supporting Actor trophy and a special Oscar for "bringing aid and comfort to disabled veterans through the medium of motion pictures."                "I got my award for special contributions," Russell once recounted to the Boston Globe, "and I'm hanging around backstage. I found out, months later, that when I was nominated for Supporting Actor, they figured I didn't have a chance, the other guys [Charles Coburn (The Green Years), William Demarest (The Jolson Story), Claude Rains (Notorious) and Clifton Webb (The Razor's Edge)] had too much background.                "When they get to Supporting Actor, they practically throw me out on the stage."                Russell also has the dubious distinction of being the only actor ever to sell his Oscar. In 1992, when his wife was dying, he decided to put his Supporting Actor statuette on the block. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences tried to keep Russell from selling the award, but he ultimately auctioned it off for $60,000. (Several Oscars have since been auctioned off posthumously, but the Academy now makes all recipients sign an agreement forbidding them from selling their Oscars.)                After Best Years, Russell's acting career went south. He says Wyler told him after the film wrapped, "You're not gonna like this, Harold, but there aren't that many parts for a guy with no hands. You should go back to college, get your degree."  Russell followed the advice, got a business degree from Boston University and became an ardent advocate for the disabled.           Although in his later years he made occasional appearances on TV (guest spots on Trapper John, M.D. and China Beach) and film (1980's Inside Moves and 1997's Dogtown), he was mostly off Hollywood's radar.                Survivors include his daughter, a son, four grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.
