'Good Bones' & Bad Behavior! HGTV Stars Sued For Trespassing/n
HGTV is getting ready to air a second season of Good Bones later this month, but its stars Mina Starsiak and Karen Laine are gearing up for a courtroom battle.
RadarOnline.com can exclusively reveal that the mother/daughter duo was sued in December for allegedly “trespassing” on the property of one of their clients’ neighbors.
The Two Chicks and a Hammer team was in charge of constructing “a residential structure/garage, fencing, and a driveway/parking area” for a local home, but ended up “damaging and destructing” a nearby home, according to the Marion County, Indiana, court documents obtained by Radar.

The neighbor is suing for unspecified damages against Laine, 57, Starsiak, 32, and their client. He also requested the trio cough up the cash for his attorney’s fees.

Laine and Starsiak’s client countersued his neighbor, claiming that his contract with the famous pair required them to “defend [him] from all lawful claims.”

“Laine and Starsiak are obliged to defend Coffey in this action,” the client insisted, and asked the court to rule in his favor and “against Laine and Starsiak for damages resulting from Lane and Starsiak’s breach of warranty.”
The women have not responded to the suit yet, but they are not the first HGTV stars to be sued.
Chip and Joanna Gaines are currently battling their ex-partners in court for allegedly “defrauding them,” and a fan also sued after she was injured at the Magnolia Silos.
