If the news back in March that Wilmer Valderrama was going to star in a new show about puppets caught you off guard, wait until you see the first teaser!
The Hollywood Puppet Sh!tshow is a new semi-reality show in which celeb guests tell untold Hollywood stories, all of which are acted out by marionettes.

Celebs announced so far include Amber Rose, Joe Jonas, Gina Rodriguez, Terry Crews, Lil Jon, Karrueche Tran, Anjelah Johnson, Steve Aoki, Damon Wayans Jr, Big Freedia, and Amanda Cerny.
It actually sounds pretty great, but the preview strikes a weirdly dark tone as puppet Wilmer ponders existential questions the morning before hosting the show. If this is the weirdness we can expect, sign us up!
Ch-ch-check it out (below)! 

The Hollywood Puppet Sh!tshow premieres Tuesday, July 11 at 10:30 p.m. EST on FUSE.
