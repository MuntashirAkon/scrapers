Rihanna Gets Nekkid To Recreate That Shower Scene On Bates Motel — And It’s So Twisted!/n

Ever since it was announced Rihanna would be starring on A&E's Bates Motel as the iconic Marion Crane, fans have been waiting for her to get in the shower!
***WARNING: Spoilers Ahead***
As you probably already know, Marion is the Psycho character who gets fatally stabbed while in the shower, so it seemed likely RiRi would suffer that similar fate at the hands of Norman (played by Freddie Highmore) on the show.
That's one reason why anyone would want to see the songstress and actress strip down to get into the tub, and the other is pretty obvious!

But while nekkid in the shower, the Bajan beauty totally flipped the script and actually finished her shower, stepped out, and said:
"Screw this shit."
Twitter went wild for the scene, not only for the plot twist!! See the best reactions (below)!

This scene where she's in the shower is by far the sexiest and hottest scene EVVVVAAA 💦🔥🔥😍😍 @rihanna #BatesMotel pic.twitter.com/r9sBgt6LWP

Can you believe that Rihanna played the most iconic murder victim in all of cinema, but then she doesn’t even get murdered. #BatesMotel pic.twitter.com/EZBHVh6IdL
