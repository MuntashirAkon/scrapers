In case you forgot, the French starlet first announced her second pregnancy on Instagram back in September. At the time, the Midnight In Paris star wrote: 

"Many years ago, I met the man of my life, father of our son and of the baby we are expecting. He is my love, my best friend, the only one that I need."
So sweet. The lovebirds, who are already parents to a 5Â½-year-old son, first became friends back in 1997. However, they didn't collaborate professionally until the 2003 flick Love Me If You Dare. The pair started dating in 2007.
Well, these two have certainly come a long way.
We honestly couldn't be happier for Marion and Guillaume! Congrats again, you two!
