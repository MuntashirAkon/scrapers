Marion Cotillard and her partner Guillaume Canet recently welcomed a baby girl, according to her rep.

This is the second child for the Allied actress and the French actor, whose son Marcel is 5½ years old.
Cotillard announced that she was pregnant in September of last year on Instagram amid false controversy alleging that she had an affair with Brad Pitt, whose divorce from Angelina Jolie was still fresh at the time. Cotillard denounced these rumors in the same post.

“I am not used to commenting on things like this nor taking them seriously but as this situation is spiraling and affecting people I love, I have to speak up,” Cotillard wrote on Instagram.”Firstly, many years ago, I met the man of my life, father of our son and of the baby we are expecting. He is my love, my best friend, the only one that I need. Secondly to those who have indicated that I am devastated, I am very well thank you. This crafted conversation isn’t distressing. And to all the media and the haters who are quick to pass judgment, I sincerely wish you a swift recovery.”
