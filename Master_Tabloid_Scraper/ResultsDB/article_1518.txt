Former Today show anchors Katie Couric and Meredith Vieira will return to host the show early next year to fill in for Savannah Guthrie, who is out on maternity leave.

Guthrie and her husband Michael Feldman recently welcomed a baby boy, Charles Max Feldman.
The Washington Post reports:
“Couric, who was Today host from 1989 to 2006, has returned for special occasions but this will be the first time in the anchor’s role. In 2012, she spent a week as a fill-in co-host on the NBC show’s bitter rival, ABC’s Good Morning America.
Vieira worked alongside [Matt] Lauer from 2006 to 2011.

‘It’s going to be fun,’ said Lauer on Thursday, describing it as a ‘walk down memory lane.’ He will mark his 20th year as host of the morning show in 2017.
Couric will host on the week of Jan. 2, Vieira the week after, NBC said.”
