Brad Pitt has requested to seal all documents related to his custody war with Angelina Jolie.
TMZ reports the Allied star filed documents in family court on Tuesday (Dec. 6, 2016) to obtain an emergency hearing. Sources say that Pitt intends to ask the judge to seal all documents related to his and Jolie’s ongoing custody battle.
His intention is to avoid further hurting the children by airing their dirty laundry to the public. The hearing is expected to take place the morning of Dec. 7.

As previously reported, Jolie filed documents earlier this week that revealed the family would continue to attend group therapy together. It was also revealed that Pitt would be expected to submit to random drug testing at least four times per month.
To make matters worse, the actor might not even see his children during the holidays. “If a child says they don’t want to see Brad on Christmas, the psychiatrist isn’t going to force them,” a source said. “That’s the whole purpose of this agreement.”
