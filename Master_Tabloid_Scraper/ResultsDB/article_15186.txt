In September, when Angelina Jolie filed for divorce from Brad Pitt, one of the divorce’s supposed causes was a tawdry affair between Pitt and Marion Cotillard that was rumored to have happened during the filming of their WWII film Allied. Now, with the thriller scheduled to drop next week, Cotillard paid a visit to the Today show where she was asked about the salacious stories.

“I don’t give energy to this,” she said, openly dismissing the gossip, via E! News. “It was a wonderful, wonderful experience working with such a visionary director and an amazing actor. So that’s all that matters.”
When Matt Lauer asked if the all the rumors bothered her, she responded that none of it was true, and so it really hadn’t fazed her.

“I never take anything personally when it doesn’t concern me,” she stated. “So I didn’t take it personally because I had nothing to do with those rumors or situation.”
In the film, she and Pitt play French and American military operatives, respectively, who fall in love while targeting a Nazi leader in North Africa. Naturally, a love story means plenty of on-screen romance between the movie stars, but Cotillard was quick to share that those scenes were a bit uncomfortable to do.
“It’s always [an] awkward situation, but it’s also a very fun situation because it’s awkward,” she said, before adding that although there is a sex scene in the film, it definitely wasn’t a steamy shoot. “It’s a beautiful scene, though.”
Allied comes to theaters Nov. 23, 2016.
