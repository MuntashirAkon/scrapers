Although he has been keeping a low profile since his divorce with Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt has been out and about this week and made his first red carpet appearance in L.A. on Wednesday (Nov. 9, 2016), attending a fan screening of his upcoming WWII spy drama Allied.
Pitt stopped to sign autographs, take selfies and give a little Q&A with his fans, and told them how happy he was to be there.
According to E! News, Pitt said, “It’s really sweet, everyone has been really kind out here. It’s really nice to have all the support.” Also in attendance was Pitt’s co-star Marion Cotillard and director Robert Zemeckis. Launch the gallery above!
The actor also stepped out for a private screening of Moonlight on Tuesday (Nov. 8, 2016), a film that his production company executive produced. He was joined by good friend Julia Roberts.

Pitt was officially cleared of child abuse allegations by the Los Angeles Country Department of Children and Family Services earlier in the day. The investigation stemmed from an altercation Pitt had with his son, Maddox, on the family’s private jet in September. Jolie filed for divorce a week after the incident.
The couple have been privately trying to work out details, particularly regarding the custody of their six children.
