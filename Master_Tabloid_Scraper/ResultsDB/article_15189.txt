Since news first broke that Angelina Jolie had filed for divorce from Brad Pitt last month, both stars have maintained extremely low profiles. But now, with his film Allied on the way, Pitt is reportedly going to start doing press again.

According to a source with Us Weekly, the leading man will be appearing at a fan event for the WWII thriller tomorrow (Nov. 9, 2016) in L.A.
The film dramatizes the true story of an American spy who falls in love with a French woman (played by Marion Cotillard) while on a secret mission in North Africa. As their romance progresses, doubts arise about the woman’s true motives.

During the divorce fallout, a rumor circulated that Pitt and Jolie’s marriage ended over an affair with the French actress. It has since been denied by Cotillard.
As we previously reported, Jolie and Pitt are currently in the midst of a heated custody battle over their six children. An investigation is currently underway to determine if Pitt is, in fact, an unfit parent. In the meantime, Jolie maintains temporary custody of the kids.
