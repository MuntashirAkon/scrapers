Kathy Griffin paid a visit to visit to Larry King’s new talk show to discuss her book Kathy Griffin’s Celebrity Run-Ins and rhapsodize about her career when, without warning, the former Fashion Police host decided to tear into Britney Spears!

“I used to make fun of Britney Spears… Did you get the pinwheel eyes?” Griffin asked when discussing the pop singer’s previous visits to King’s show.
The host accommodatingly replied, “Yeah, she’s very pretty.”
Apparently that’s not the particular “pinwheel eyes” Griffin was referring to.

“You know what I’m talking about,” she said. “She’s not all there.”
Next, the 56-year-old comic explained the time she joined Spears on stage at her Las Vegas show for a performance of “Freakshow.” Except when it was over and the singer was supposed to acknowledge and thank Griffin for performing with her…Spears didn’t know who she was. And it’s possible Griffin took it pretty personal.
