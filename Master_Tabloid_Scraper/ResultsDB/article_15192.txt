"Many years ago, I met the man of my life, father of our son and of the baby we are expecting. He is my love, my best friend, the only one I need," she wrote at the time. Ever since, Cotillard has remained as private as possible about her pregnancy and home life.The new parents-of-two first began dating a decade ago after they met on the set of Love Me If You Dare Me a few years prior. And the rest, as they say, is history!

Cotillard recently made headlines when she posted a slew of sexy selfies on her Instagram account from what appeared to be a day on the set of Rock'n Roll (a film directed by her boyfriend).The shots showed her face looking dramatically different, with prosthetic lips and a wig, as she kissed the camera for the world to see.Congratulations to Cotillard and Canet for their second child's arrival!
