‘Tis the season for sparkle and cheer.Thinking about what to wear to that upcoming holiday party, dinner party or date night? Good news: The metallic midi-skirt works for all three, as well as a normal day in the office.Marion Cotillard stunned with this take on a pencil skirt on the red carpet of the New York premiere of Allied, which she stars in with Brad Pitt. The mother-to-be gracefully dressed her growing baby bump with a striped champagne-and-black jacket and a sequined skirt with attached black scoop neck tank from French fashion house Rochas. 

Although mixing striped prints can be risky, Cotillard proved it's worth the risk with this classy and glamorous ensemble. (Tip: For this look, match two striped pieces by the width of the lines, making sure there is one consistent color throughout the outfit.

Don't let the sequins fool you. Like any pencil skirt, this look is versatile. You can dress up the metallic midi-skirt with statement jewelry and patent leather shoes. Or, you can dress it down with a basic tee and blazer. Either way, all eyes will be on you.

Cheers to that!River Island Black Floral Sequin Pencil Skirt, $80; Vantanika Metallic Striped Pencil Skirt, Was $375, Now $263; Tom Ford Sequined Stretch-Satin Skirt, $4,950
