Things sure do get steamy between Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard in their upcoming WWII action drama Allied.In the latest trailer for the movie, we see the two working as spies killing Nazis, falling in love, marrying each other and becoming parents. However, Pitt is then ordered by his superiors to assassinate his wife."There's no easy way to say what we're about to say, we suspect your wife is a German spy," an officer tells Pitt."This is insane," Pitt growls.

Pitt is told that if he could prove she's not the enemy, all will be forgotten. However, "If she is, execute her with your own hand," an officer says. "And if you do not comply, you'll be hanged."The music in the trailer then becomes dark and menacing. After showing Pitt and Cotillard rolling around in bed, the French Oscar winner says, "You were different with me last night. Like you were angry."What follows is a sequence of bombings, explosions, gunfights and more in what appears to be Pitt's fight to prove that Cotillard is not a double agent. The trailer ends with Pitt at their kitchen table with Cotillard asking, "Hey, what happened to my kiss."

Directed by Robert Zemeckis, the cast also includes Masters of Sex star Lizzy Caplan, Mad Men's Jared Harris and The Good Wife's Matthew Goode.Allied hits theaters on Nov. 23.
