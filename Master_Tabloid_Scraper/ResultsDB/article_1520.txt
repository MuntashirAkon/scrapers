Last night (Nov. 2, 2016), Britney Spears switched things up a little bit during her Piece of Me concert in Las Vegas.

Before transitioning into the “Freakshow” segment of her show, Spears took a moment to perform a spoken word piece of sorts. “I just wanted to let you guys know: I feel like a bitch,” she said, before continuing with the entire chorus from Meredith Brooks’ iconic song, “Bitch.”
“And a lover. And a child. And a mother. And a sinner,” she said with her middle fingers up in the air. “And a saint. And I do not feel ashamed! I’m your hell, I’m your dream. And I’m nothing in between. And I wouldn’t want it any other motherf–king way.”
