Happy birthday, Marion Cotillard!The stunning Oscar winner turns 40 today, and the French It girl deserves nothing less than a celebration of her most fashion-forward moments. As the face of Lady Dior, it's no surprise that Cotillard has had major style triumphs throughout her career, shutting down this year's Cannes Film Festival and other recent red-carpet events like no other. Perhaps one of Cotillard's most memorable ensembles was her mermaid-inspired Jean Paul Gaultier gown at the 2008 Academy Awards. Not only did the multi-talented thesp kick off a career of internationally recognized best-dressed moments, she also took home the Oscar for Best Actress for channeling "Little Sparrow" Édith Piaf in La Vie en Rose—making her the only actor to win an Academy Award for a French-language performance.
