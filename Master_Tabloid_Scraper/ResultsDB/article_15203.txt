Human Rights Org Wants Dennis Rodman Axed from HOF Over N. Korea/nA major human rights org is calling for the Basketball Hall of Fame to BOOT Dennis Rodman over his relationship with Kim Jong-un -- saying it's not right to publicly support a  "murderer. "  The Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation -- a non-profit org established by Congress in '94 -- is furious with The Worm over his recent visit to N. Korea and his ongoing relationship with the country's leader.  VOC says KJU has  "blood on his hands " for the  "murder " of American citizen, Otto Warmbier, and they're demanding Rodman either condemn Jong-un ... or else.   "Dennis Rodman’s complacency and coddling of Kim Jong-un romanticizes and makes light of how dangerous North Korea is to it's own people and Americans who travel there. Removing Rodman from the Hall of Fame will send a message that all Americans are united against this regime. " The VOC has started a petition on Change.org to get Dennis out of the HOF -- and exec. director Marion Smith is putting pressure on the NBA to essentially excommunicate him from the pro basketball community.  We've reached out to Rodman's camp for comment -- so far, no word back. /n
