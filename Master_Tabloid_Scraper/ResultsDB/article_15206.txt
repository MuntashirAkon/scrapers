Ex-NFL Star Marion Barber -- Former Teammates Concerned ... 'He Needs Help'/nMarion Barber's former NFL teammates tell TMZ Sports they're  "shocked " by the details of the former superstar's handgun-in-a-church arrest ... and are hoping he gets the help he needs. We broke the story ... Barber was taken into police custody in June after allegedly taking a loaded gun into a Texas church and flashing it at the congregation.  He was held for mental evaluation. One former NFL teammate -- a fellow superstar who didn't want to be named because he maintains a close friendship with Barber -- says,  "He needs help, I care about him. "We also spoke with former Cowboys cornerback Brian McCann -- who played with Barber in 2010 -- who says the Marion he knew was a  "fun-loving guy. " "[The Marion described in the police report] doesn't sound like him at all. He never seemed like a troubled guy. " "He was the team jokester. He showed me you can still have fun at this level. "We've tried contacting Barber to no avail -- and his neighbors say he hasn't been seen at his home since the arrest./n
