No Meatloaf for Scarlett/nMeatloaf has reportedly been snubbed by Scarlett Johansson.The rocker was on a quest to find an actress to duet with for his cover of Celine Dion's 1996 hit  "It's All Coming Back to Me Now. " Yes, you heard correctly, Celine Dion!Loaf allegedly first asked Johansson before reaching out to other actresses, who all turned him down.The gig eventually went to Norwegian chanteuse Marion Raven. The song appears on Meatloaf's new album  "Bat Out of Hell III, " which drops October 31.While we don't know the reasoning behind the actress' snub, Meatloaf's creepy  "American Idol " finale duet with Katharine McPhee probably didn't help matters much.
