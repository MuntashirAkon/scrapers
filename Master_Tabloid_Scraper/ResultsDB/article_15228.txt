The Titanic costars first met on set 20 years ago, but now the Divergent star is married to Ned Rocknroll. Regardless, Winslet, 41, and DiCaprio, 42, have been open about their love for each other — and could be ready to take the next step in their relationship.
“I’ve loved you for 13 years,” Winslet revealed in her Golden Globe speech in 2008. “I love you with all my heart, I really do.”
“Our chemistry naturally happened,” the Wolf of Wall Street star also proclaimed. “We’re a little older, a little bit wiser, but ultimately the same people as we were when were 21. We laugh at the same things. [Kate] never lets me take myself seriously, even if I wanted to.”
