Those Loopy Lohans! Lindsay’s Brother Sends Out Bizarre Wedding Invite To Friends/n
No A-list wedding planner for Lindsay Lohan’s little brother! Michael Lohan Jr. is tying the knot with Nina Ginsberg and RadarOnline.com has exclusively obtained their bizarre, home-spun wedding invitation.
“If we had it our way, all of us would be on [a] Belize-bound catamaran the weekend of July 7 with Moscow Mules in hand, setting sail for 80° weather,” the rambling invitation begins.
“However, our parents have been patiently waiting for a ceremony,” the drab note continues, “so we decided July nuptials somewhere a little closer would suffice. So after about two whole seconds of consideration, we thought ‘No better place than Block Island!'”

Located in Rhode Island, the site of the first Lohan wedding is located a convenient 13 miles off of Montauk.
And it sounds like it is going to be a boozy affair.
“So on July 8, 2017, there will be some festivals to attend and bottles of champagne to pop all we need are your lovely faces smiling back at us. Love Nina and Michael.”
