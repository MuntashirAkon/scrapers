While Kanye West was busy throwing some shade at Taylor Swift during the 2016 MTV Video Music Awards, she was busy preparing for a day of performing her civic duty.

Apparently, the “Bad Blood” singer has been summoned for jury duty back in Tennessee. Though sharing photos of fellow jurors is normally prohibited during trial, one of Swift’s fellow jurywoman has thrown caution to the wind and documented the whole thing on Twitter.
According to Tracy Bates, a woman on the same panel who shared various photos and videos of Swift this Monday (Aug. 29, 2016), the 26-year-old crooner was happy to take selfies and sign autographs while the group waited. Bates also noted that “everyone [was] taking pictures” and “not deliberating” while the impromptu meet-and-greet was going on.

So I just got picked immediately after Taylor Swift. Same jury panel. Waiting for voir dire.

Basically, no one regretted reporting for jury duty that day.

UPDATE: Taylor Swift was been dismissed as a prospective juror in the case involving an aggravated rape and kidnapping. According to TMZ, Swift told the judge that she could not remain impartial on the panel as she had has a pending civil case that also involved sexual assault.
As previously reported, Swift launched a lawsuit against a former Colorado DJ in 2015, claiming he had fondled her backstage during a meet-and-greet in 2013. The man is currently countersuing Swift for slander.
