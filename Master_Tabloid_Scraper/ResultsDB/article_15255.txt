George and Amal Clooney’s twin babies might be arriving sooner than expected.

An inside source tells Entertainment Tonight that Amal is expected to give birth “any day now” even though it was originally estimated that her due date was around the first week of June.
“They are expecting [Amal] to give birth early,” the source adds.
George and Amal are currently staying at their house in Sonning, England and have kept away from the spotlight over the past month.
The twins’ sexes have not been officially revealed to the public, but their family friend Cindy Crawford and George’s mother, Nina Clooney, have dropped hints that they are a male and a female.
“It will be one of each! Yes, a boy and a girl. That’s what I’ve been told,” Nina told Vogue in an interview. “How marvelous! My husband and I are extremely excited.”

George previously said in an interview that he wasn’t expecting the reaction that came from his freinds when he announced he was going to be a father.
“It got really quiet, and they all just started making baby crying noises, and the whole table just busted up laughing,” Clooney told Laurent Weil on Recontres de Cinema.
