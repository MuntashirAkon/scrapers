Leonardo DiCaprio is a single man again.

The Oscar winner has parted ways with model Nina Agdal after a year together.
“Nina and Leo have parted ways. It is amicable. They remain friends,” a source tells People.
DiCaprio, 41, and Agdal, 24, first sparked relationship rumors in May 2016. A month later, they were seen taking a vacation on the private island of Over Yonder Cay. In November, Agdal meet with DiCaprio’s mother to celebrate the actor’s birthday in French Polynesia.
According to the Daily Mail, the breakup happened just four days ago following a lunch date in West Hollywood, where the couple allegedly looked “distant” and glum.
“They both decided it was a good idea to break up,” an insider tells the publication. “They are staying friends and are on good terms.”
