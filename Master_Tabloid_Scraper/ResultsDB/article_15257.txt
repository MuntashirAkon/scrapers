The beautiful Halle Berry has graced us with her curves once again on Instagram.

Berry shared a seemingly nude photo of her posing behind a partially frosted glass door coupled with a quote by Nina Simone.
“I’ll tell you what freedom is to me. No fear,” Berry wrote beneath the photo.

The photo isn’t a promotional tool for a photo spread or a film. Instead, it was just a Tuesday and Berry felt like blessing social media amid a chaotic world.
Berry stripped down on Instagram on the night of the Oscars, letting let her Versace gown fall to the floor and diving into her pool to the sounds of Bruno Mars’ “Versace on the Floor.” More memorable was this radiant photo of her wearing a sheer top that she turned into a meme with a clever caption.
“Me when someone says “I’m coming over and I’ve got snacks,” she wrote. True, Halle. True.
