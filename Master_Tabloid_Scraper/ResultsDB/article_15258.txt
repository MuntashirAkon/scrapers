We know what Ian Somerhalder is doing after The Vampire Diaries: Becoming a dad!

The actor is expecting his first child with Nikki Reed. In an Instagram post shared by his wife, Somerhalder is seen kissing Reed’s growing baby bump.
“I know you, but only because I feel you. How is it possible to love someone so much already? All I know for sure is it’s the strongest feeling I’ve ever felt,” the Twilight alum wrote. “We’ve been sharing this body for quite some time, and we’ve already experienced so much together. We can’t wait to meet you…Love your parents.”

In October, Somerhalder said he knew the actress would be the mother of his child one day. “The second we were around each other, and not [dating] other people, we just knew. Oh, I will one day have amazing children with my beautiful wife,” he told  Modern Luxury magazine.
“I live with someone who strives to find happiness and peace in the smallest things,” he gushed. “Whether it’s sitting for five minutes under a tree or getting out into the country and spending time on our horses or even just going for a walk around the lake or riding a boat. I am so blessed that I did, indeed, find this human being that can deal with me and is also the most caring, compassionate person I’ve ever known.”
The couple married in 2015 after a year of dating.
