If we’re abiding by the outdated “blue means boy, pink means girl” baby color system, Cindy Crawford told us everything we need to know about George Clooney and Amal Clooney’s forthcoming twins in one photo.

Crawford posed for an Instagram photo in which she holds up two baby onesies that respectively say “Casa” and “Migos,” which represent Casa Migos, the tequila company co-owned by George and Crawford’s husband, Rande Gerber.
“Hey, @RandeGerber — think I got the perfect baby gift for the Clooneys!” Crawford wrote in the caption of the photo.
“Casa” is embroidered in pink while “Migos” is embroidered in blue, which could possibly mean that George and Amal are expecting a boy and a girl.



Hey, @RandeGerber — think I got the perfect baby gift for the Clooneys! 👶💗👶💙

In February, George’s mother Nina Clooney also told Radar Online that they are expecting a boy and a girl.
“It will be one of each! Yes, a boy and a girl. That’s what I’ve been told,” Nina said. “How marvelous! My husband and I are extremely excited.”

George spoke with Entertainment Tonight on Tuesday night at CinemaCon and revealed which baby names are definitely off the table.
“My wife says I can’t name them Casa and Amigos,” he said. “That’s the one thing I’m not allowed to do.”
“I don’t know how you fully digest [having two], but I’m excited,” George continued. “It will be fun.”
