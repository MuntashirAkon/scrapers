For the first time, George Clooney openly discusses his thoughts on becoming a father to twins with Amal Clooney in an interview with Laurent Weil on Recontres de Cinema.

The 55-year-old actor is teeming with optimism as the responsibility of fatherhood slowly but surely approaches.
“We are really happy and really excited. It’s going to be an adventure,” says Clooney in his interview with Weil. “We’ve sort of embraced it all… with arms wide open.”
Clooney recalls the moment when he broke the news to his “very supportive” friends. They gave him a bit of a hard time before they humbled him with humor.
“It got really quiet, and they all just started making baby crying noises, and the whole table just busted up laughing,” says Clooney.

The actor says that he looks to French actor Jean-Paul Belmondo for dad inspiration since Belmondo welcomed a child with his second wife at the age of 70.
“I’m feeling a little better about being 56 by the time [they come],” Clooney admitted.
Clooney’s mother Nina recently shared that George and Amal will be having a boy and a girl.
“That’s what I’ve been told,” she told Vogue. “My husband and I are extremely excited.”
