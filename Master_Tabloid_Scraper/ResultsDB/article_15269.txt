Half the price—so what are you waiting for?Nina Dobrev's Robert Clergerie clogs caught our attention immediately (and not just because they're gorgeous). Their somewhat steep $595 price tag has now been knocked down 50 percent to $297.Looking perfect paired with the star's floral mini sun dress, Garrett Leight x Clare V. sunnies and Chanel bag, the shoes really are pretty versatile. They'd look amazing on Emma Roberts in her usual cropped denim and plain white tee look or even something a little more Gabrielle Union like a killer, oversized, menswear-inspired pantsuit. 

Still thinking $297 is a little out of reach? No problem. The below discounted digs are the perfect alternatives to give off the exact same vibe (just at less of a cost).Shop the Look

Fun and feminine footwear.
