After 18 years, Nina Dobrev had to say goodbye to her cat Lynx over the weekend.The actress took to Instagram Saturday to share a cryptic post about having the greatest friends even in the "darkest of times." Then, on Monday, she revealed her cat had passed away when she wrote a heartfelt post to honor her "best friend.""To my sweet sweet angel," she began. "As I look back on the last 18 years together, I smile through my tears. You brought me so much joy, love, unlimited cuddles and so many sandpaper kisses. I still remember the first day I brought you home, the size of a tea cup purring as I held you in my hands. You were so fragile and furry, as soft as the worlds tiniest cashmere blanket. I knew in that moment you were my soulmate."

She continued, "From there our long journey began and we were inseparable. We grew up together in Toronto, then you followed me to Atlanta, from there we road tripped across the United States through New Orleans, Austin City, Amarillo Texas, Santa Fe, Las Vegas, we even saw the Grand Canyon for our first time together. Our final chapter and destination together was here in Los Angeles. I hope I was able to give you a beautiful happy life filled with love, because that's what you gave me."

We're sending our love your way, Nina!
