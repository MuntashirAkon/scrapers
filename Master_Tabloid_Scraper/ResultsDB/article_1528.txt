Josh Duggar and wife Anna are now working on their marriage, following Josh’s cheating scandal and subsequent six-month stint in a faith-based treatment facility.
The couple wrote a statement on the Duggar family website, explaining their next steps in rebuilding their marriage.
“As we enter into a long family weekend together, we want to thank each of you for the prayers, love and encouragement you’ve sent our way. Since the residential treatment program ended, we have been working with a professional marriage and family counselor to take important steps toward healing.”
They continued, “It isn’t easy and some days are very difficult. It is a long road to rebuild trust and a truly healthy relationship. We are very thankful for God’s forgiveness, grace and help, as it is our strength and guide to rebuilding our lives. As the future unfolds, we are taking one day at a time and we are grateful for your continued prayers for both of us and our sweet children.”
Josh and Anna have four children — Mackynzie, 6, Michael, 4, Marcus, 2, and Meredith, 7 months.
The former 19 Kids and Counting star found himself embroiled in two shocking scandals in 2015. First, reports surfaced that he molested five girls – including two of his sisters, Jill and Jessa – when he was 14. Needless to say, TLC canceled the family’s hit reality show pretty much on the spot.
Then it was discovered Josh had paid subscriptions on the Ashley Madison cheating site after hackers released data.
The eldest Duggar fessed up to both allegations and said in one statement he was “the biggest hypocrite ever.”
