Scarlett Johansson's Husband Begs Her To Withdraw Divorce Filing Amid Custody Battle/n
After years of remaining under the radar, Scarlett Johansson‘s estranged husband is finally speaking out about her “unfortunate” decisions in the aftermath of their nasty split.
“Is it indeed unfortunate, especially for our daughter, that Scarlett filed in court and made our personal differences so public,” Romain Dauriac tells RadarOnline.com in an exclusive statement.
The father of the actress’ 2-year-old daughter Rose Dorothy goes on to plead with his ex to back down in court.

“I would implore her to withdraw her actions promptly and to go back, as uncomfortable as it might be, to the negotiating table,” he says. “We are the parents of a lovely daughter whom we will continue to co-parent for many years and share her joys and sorrows as only a parent can.”
As Radar exclusively reported earlier today, Dauriac was “blindsided”  by Johansson’s divorce filing in New York court after negotiating privately over custody issues for five months.

“We were totally blindsided and shocked by her filing,” his lawyer Hal Mayerson told Radar. “She didn’t like the present schedule as it didn’t take into consideration her travel. She wanted the schedule to change based on her needs — not the child’s.”
The star, 32, and her longtime love married in October 2014 before quietly separating over the summer.
