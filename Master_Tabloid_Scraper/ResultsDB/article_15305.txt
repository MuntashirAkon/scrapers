Chris Rock, Gabrielle Union, & Countless Others Pay Tribute To Charlie Murphy Following His Untimely Death/n

What a sad day.
As we previously reported, actor and comedian Charlie Murphy passed away on April 12 after a battle with leukemia. He was only 57-years-old.

Although Charlie was Eddie Murphy's older brother, he made a name for himself by starring in several successful projects such as Chappelle's Show, The Boondocks, Black Jesus, and Are We There Yet. So it's no wonder numerous celebrities have since taken to Twitter to pay tribute to the late funny man — including Chris Rock, Gabrielle Union, Ice Cube, etc.
Be sure to take a look at their kind words for yourself (below).
