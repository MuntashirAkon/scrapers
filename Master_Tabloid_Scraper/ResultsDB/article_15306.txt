The news was confirmed by the comedian's publicist, Tom Keaney. It's certainly heartbreaking to hear about Mengering's passing as fans of Letterman's knew her well from her many appearances on the 70-year-old's shows, The Late Show and Late Night.
In case you forgot, since the Midwestern homemaker was an excellent baker, Dorothy rose to popularity through a cooking bit playfully known as Guess Mom's Pies. Oh, and who could forget Dorothy's cookbook, Home Cookin' With Dave's Mom.
She also served as the Late Show's correspondent at the Winter Olympics in 1994, 1998, and 2002. David's mom will definitely be missed.
Our thoughts are with Dorothy's loved ones during this sad time.
