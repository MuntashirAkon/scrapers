The actress can fake it! The journalist, not so much…
Scarlett Johansson was all smiles, and looking chic in all black, beside estranged ex Romain Dauriac at the Singular Object Art Opening Cocktail Reception in New York Wednesday. She looked genuinely happy!

Romain, on the other hand, was completely stone-faced and even seemed a bit pissed off.
As you know, the two are embroiled in a custody battle for their two-year-old daughter, Rose Dorothy.
When ScarJo filed for divorce, she asked for joint but residential custody, and Romain has been battling her for it ever since. He even went so far as to suggest that his ex-wife's shooting schedule was bad for their daughter, and that the child would be better off with him in a more stable environment.
Scarlett was having none of that!
The actress also blindsided Romain with her divorce filing back in March.
Maybe this appearance at the art opening is a kind of truce? We can only hope so for the sake of their daughter!
