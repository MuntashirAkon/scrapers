Scarlett Johansson is “au revoir” to her marriage.

The actress has split with her French journalist husband Romain Dauriac after two years of marriage, according to People. The duo currently share a daughter named Rose Dorothy Dauric, who was born shortly before they wed in 2014.
Though Johansson and Dauriac have parted ways romantically, the former couple are still partners in business. They are the co-owners of popcorn brand Yummy Pop, which just saw its brick-and-mortar shop open at the Theatre du Gymnase in Paris last December.

Johansson first sparked separation rumors when she was spotted attending the Women’s March in Washington D.C., without her wedding ring.
“We do different things,” the Captain America: Civil War star said of her relationship with Duriac in a 2014 Vanity Fair interview. “He’s in the whole art-scene world. So it’s nice, because we can enjoy each other’s worlds, but we don’t have our crazy conflicting schedules and all that other stuff to contend with.”
Previously, Johansson was married to Ryan Reynolds from 2008 to 2010.
