This week, the first trailer has arrived for the highly-anticipated new drama Hidden Figures.

Based on a true story, the film follows Katherine Johnson (Taraji P. Henson), a mathematician who, along with Dorothy Vaughan and Mary Jackson (played by Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monáe, respectively), help America get a leg up in the Space Race with Russia.
The trailer discusses all the criticism and marginalization the three face as African-American women doing important work for their country.
Glen Powell, who plays astronaut John Glenn, recently spoke with Celebuzz about the excitement surrounding this project.
“We all knew going in it was going to be a special project,” he said. “But the feedback I’ve heard from people who have seen it is just…through the roof.” 
Hidden Figures blasts off January 13, 2017.
