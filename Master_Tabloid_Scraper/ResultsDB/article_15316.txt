Dressing for Coachella is no easy task.

While it’s always easy to throw on a flower crown or slap on some flash tats, the desert climate is a little tricky to pack for. Between the scorching hot sun and dusty winds, it’s a challenge to find the perfect outfit that will take you from day to night. After all, temperatures drop once the sun sets and you don’t want to be that person who’s stuck freezing their butt off in a tiny crop top and cut-offs.
To help you get started on exactly what to wear to Indio this year, we’ve assemble a guide to festival fashion essentials. From eye-catching bikinis for all those star-studded pool parties to one-and-done rompers you can dance the night away in, here are some of our favorite Coachella-ready styles.
Just throw a few of these last-minute pieces into your suitcase and call it a day!
