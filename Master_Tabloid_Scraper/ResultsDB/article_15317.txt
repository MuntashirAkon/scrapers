Because she can.

Khloe Kardashian is single and ready to mingle, according to close sources who tell People that the drama surrounding Lamar Odom’s health crisis was too much for her relationship with James Harden to withstand.
“It hasn’t been easy. James obviously has wanted to see her more and be with her more, but she’s felt like she needed to stay in L.A. to be with her family and to deal with Lamar stuff,” a source close to the family told People. “That has put some strain on things.”
Kardashian confirmed it in her own quirky way by creating a faux OKCupid account on her app on Monday, Feb. 8.
