The first Republican Presidential Debate took place, much to the chagrin of liberals and feminists alike (here’s to looking at you, Donald Trump).

The GOP presidential hopefuls who faced off were Trump, Jeb Bush, Mike Huckabee, Ted Cruz, Chris Christie, Marco Rubio, Rand Paul, Scott Walker, Ben Carson, and John Kasich.

Plenty of celebs made stabs at the nominees (mainly Trump) on Twitter, especially around the time that moderator Megyn Kelly confronted Trump about his treatment and portrayal of women.
Kelly asked him, “You call women you don’t like, “fat pigs,” “dogs,” “slobs” and “disgusting animals.”

Trump responded, “Only Rosie O’Donnell,” then added:
The big problem this country has is being politically correct. I’ve been challenged by so many people and I don’t frankly have time for total political correctness. And to be honest with you, this country doesn’t have time either. This country is in big trouble. We don’t win anymore…Frankly what I say and oftentimes it’s fun, it’s kidding, we have a good time. What I say is what I say. And honestly, Megyn if you don’t like it, I’m sorry. I’ve been very nice to you although I could probably not be based on the way you have treated me, but I wouldn’t do that. But you know what? We, we need strength, we need energy, we need quickness and we need brain in this country to turn it around. That I can tell you right now.
Okay.

Wow, @megynkelly really bombed tonight. People are going wild on twitter! Funny to watch.

Good for you, Megyn Kelly, calling Ben Carson an idiot right off the bat. #GOPDebate — Bill Maher (@billmaher) August 7, 2015



Enough with hating on Trump for being misogynist! Get to the part where these 10 guys debate whether Amy Schumer is fuckable. #GOPDebate

This is just me, but after 15 hours of picking fruit, I’d be too exhausted to rape — Bill Maher (@billmaher) August 7, 2015



Trump says our leaders are all stupid, Cruz says Egyptian president is smarter than us – why do they want to be the leader of this shithole?

The #GOPDebate is worth watching. But as I rushed to get in front of a set, noticed a lot of people uninterested. pic.twitter.com/51WcpXEw1i — Ann Curry (@AnnCurry) August 7, 2015



I wonder what the ratings/interest would be in @liveGOPdebate if @realDonaldTrump wasn’t participating?
— Katie Couric (@katiecouric) August 7, 2015


Why isn’t anyone asking about campaign finance reform if we are talking the donor class and the political class? #GOPDebate — Katie Couric (@katiecouric) August 7, 2015

#GOPdebate included a show of hands like the 1st day of school. We’re learning very little. 10 is too many & I want cross-questioning.
— Larry King (@kingsthings) August 7, 2015


The #GOPdebate is not a debate at all. It’s a series of 1 minute opportunities to avoid answering a question one candidate at a time.

Do you think the republican debaters will do a huge selfie like Ellen did at the Oscars?
