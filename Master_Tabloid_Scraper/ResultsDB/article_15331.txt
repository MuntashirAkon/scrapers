''What the F--k?'' Dorothy Wang Calls Out Bianca Espada for Bringing Security to Her Birthday Party in This #RichKids Clip/n
Is Bianca Espada acting like a diva?In this clip from Sunday's all-new episode of #RichKids of Beverly Hills, Dorothy Wang and Jonny Drubel call out Bianca for bringing security guards to Dorothy's birthday celebration in Las Vegas."Bianca hiring a security guard is kind of embarrassing for her," Jonny says. "My rule of thumb is that the people that actually are something don't act like they are."Even though they're close friends, Dorothy finally tells Bianca she doesn't need the extra protection. That's when she snaps back and calls Dorothy "jealous" and "delusional." The situation gets so bad that someone ends up leaving in tears.Â Yikes!Watch the entire confrontation go down in the clip above!
