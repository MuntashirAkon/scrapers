MJ to be Buried Wearing One White Glove/nMichael Jackson will be laid to rest in pure MJ fashion -- as in he will be wearing one (and only one) of his favorite gloves.Dorothy Gaspar -- who owns Gaspar Gloves in L.A. and designed gloves for the  "This Is It " tour -- tells us La Toya Jackson wanted Michael to wear a glove inside the casket. Turns out La Toya chose a white leather glove Dorothy made for Michael 10-12 years ago -- a glove covered in Swarovski crystals. Dorothy tells us she was informed of this yesterday by Michael's stylist -- Michael Bush -- when he picked up 20 green gloves she had made for Jackson's dancers.
