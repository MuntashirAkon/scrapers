Simon Upset with 'A.I.' Producers/nSimon Cowell feels betrayed by 'A.I.' producers. In a recent interview on 'Good Day LA,' Cowell claimed  "They left the cameras rolling " after contestants left the room, never telling the judges what they were saying would be used on the air.    "That's what's getting me into trouble, " complained Cowell. The crusty judge says when he hears some of his caustic comments on the air,  "It's like, 'hide under the covers.' " Cowell told entertainment reporter Dorothy Lucey he never intended the caustic comments to see air. Cowell told Lucey it's like having a discussion during a commercial -- then finding out the world was watching./n
