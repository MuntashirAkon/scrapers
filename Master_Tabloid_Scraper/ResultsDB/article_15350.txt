Maria Shriver Visits Psychic -- It's All In the Cards/nMaria Shriver -- a highly educated, former First Lady of California, devout Catholic, and well-connected woman about town -- is searching for answers to life ... in energy crystals.Â  We got this pic of Maria leaving a psychic's office yesterday in the very upscale community of Brentwood. We're told she's a customer -- been there before.Maria has some big decisions -- she's gone back and forth on whether to finalize her divorce from Arnold Schwarzenegger, so maybe Dorothy from Clairvoyance -- a spiritual advisor, psychic medium and life coach -- can help her decide.Dionne Warwick approves this message./n
