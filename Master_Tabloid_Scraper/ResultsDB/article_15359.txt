Justin Bieber And Kylie Jenner Have An Ultra Friendly Night At The Floyd Maymeather Jr.Boxing Matchâ€¦Or Are They More Than Friends??!/n

This love triangle is becoming juicier than a field of ripe berries! 
We may have just uncovered why Selena Gomez unfollowed everyone on Instagram after Coachella weekend with Kendall Jenner, Kylie Jenner, and Justin Bieber! 
Rumors were swirling that Selener found scandalous snaps of Kylie on her on-again off-again BF's phone and apparently Justin liked them because he invited the Jenner to rendezvous!!! 
YUP! Justin invited Kylie along to Sin City to see Floyd Mayweather Jr. defeat Marcos Maidana at the MGM Grand Garden Arena.
Even though he deleted the Instagram selfie he uploaded with Kylie (above), when you're a teen idol addicted to social media, whatever happens in Vegas DOES NOT stay in Vegas.
Or perhaps Bieby did it on purpose to make his heartbroken ex a bit more shattered??! 
Whether or not there is a romance brewing, Biebs and the reality TV princess certainly aren't trying to silence the loud whispers around town! 
How cruel! Then again, all is fair in love and war!
