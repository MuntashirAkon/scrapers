Did Farrah Abraham Lie About Her Daughter Buying Her Valentine’s Day Gifts?/n
Farrah Abraham wants you to know she’s well liked, so much so that she’s almost willing to use her daughter as a pawn in her charade.

Fans are accusing the reality star of lying after Abraham claimed her 7-year-old daughter, Sophia, learned how to use the computer to buy her Valentine’s Day presents. Per PressRoomVIP:
Farrah took to her social media to show off what her daughter bought for her on Valentine’s Day. The problem that arose is people wondering how such a young child went out and bought anything to which Farrah explained that Sophia went online, searched for the gifts, and paid for them with her own money from a Paypal account.
