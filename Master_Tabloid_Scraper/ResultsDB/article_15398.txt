Good and ugly gowns come and go, but the fashion at Sunday’s 2017 Screen Actors Guild Award certainly took the cake.

While some stars like Chrissy Teigen, Taraji P. Henson and Kerry Washington slayed in style, others like Nicole Kidman, Kate Hudson and Sophia Bush definitely missed the mark. Glitter, lace, frills and exaggerated sleeves were big trends this years — though some failed to pull it off on the red carpet.
