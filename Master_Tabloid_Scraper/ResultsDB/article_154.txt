It's War! Johnny 'Blindsided' By Amber — And Now He Wants Revenge/n
Amber Heard just filed for divorce from Johnny Depp on Monday, but RadarOnline.com has learned it’s already getting nasty!
“Johnny was blindsided by this but the timing could not be worse for him,” a friend of the Pirates of the Caribbean actor said.
Indeed, Heard, 30, filed for divorce from her 52-year-old husband in an L.A court on May 22, just two days after Depp’ beloved mother, Betty Sue, passed away. In addition, Depp is in the middle of promotion for Alice Through the Looking Glass, which comes out Friday.

Depp did not have a prenup in place to protect his $400 million fortune, said the source. He has already rejected Heard’s request for spousal support, and the insider said the divorce is about to devolve into an “all out war” over the money.
Said the insider, “He sees her true colors now and he is not going to back down to her.”
