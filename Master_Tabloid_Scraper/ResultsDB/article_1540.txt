Word sure gets around. Sometimes, however, it's the wrong word.Cate Blanchett and husband Andrew Upton have adopted a baby girl—and their daughter's name is Edith Vivian Patricia Upton, the Oscar winner's publicist confirmed Friday to E! News.Most regal-sounding, right?The mellifluous news comes amid some reports that they had named the child Vivienne (yes, like Jolie-Pitt). At least that was mildly in the ball park...But ultimately it is Edith who is joining brothers Dashiell John, 13; Roman Robert, 10 1/2; and Ignatius Martin, 6 1/2, in the family fold.

Though in 2013 Blanchett compared juggling three kids while maintaining her film and stage commitments to a "military operation," the now 45-year-old star ultimately opted to add another troop to her brigade.Blanchett told Vanity Fair in 2009 less than a year after Ignatius was born, "We don't mind a bit of chaos. As your life becomes more populated with little people, you have to adapt, but I've never been frightened of change."She also indicated that she and Upton, a playwright and theater director, might not be done in the baby department, saying, "Who knows? Don't close those doors. The world is very overpopulated, but we do make nice ones. They all look like Andrew. To say he has dominant genes would be an understatement."
