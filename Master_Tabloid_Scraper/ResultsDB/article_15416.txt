Sophia Bush, we can hear you asking the all-important question: Are we there yet?As the Chicago P.D. star kicked off her weekend with an airplane ride, there was one unnamed passenger who appeared to be a major thorn in everyone's side.Ultimately, Sophia decided to share her personal encounter with the "random dude on a plane" on social media."When you make a woman so visibly uncomfortable, that after you've ignored all visual cues to please leave her alone (one word answers, she pulls out a book, puts on a hat, she actually asks you to not speak to her with the tone and words you're choosing to use) that she finally GETS UP and MOVES SEATS, leave her alone," she wrote on Twitter Friday evening. "Do not continue trying to make conversation."The actress continued, "Stop turning around and looking at her. Stop leaning out of your seat and towards her body when she has to grab something out of the overhead bin above her original seat, and sadly also above you, mid flight."
