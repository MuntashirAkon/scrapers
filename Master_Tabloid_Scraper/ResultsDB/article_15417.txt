Your ears ain't seen nothing yet.The days of ear cuffs, crawlers and climbers are over—introducing the newest trend in jewelry: ear suspenders. Thanks to celebs like Gigi Hadid, Miranda Kerr, Anna Kendrick and Sophia Bush (to name a few), the style created by LA-based designers Smith + Mara has found its way into the spotlight...and, now, our hearts. Think of them as a twist (or in this case, flip) on a classic pair of earrings—their simple, minimal shape make them an easy wear with any outfit, but it's the upside down nature of them that brings a rebellious, fresh feel. Rock only one or wear them as a pair, no matter how you spin it you're going to look insanely cool. Bonus: They're the perfect balance of sophistication and edge. So, hop on the ear suspender train while it's just getting started.
