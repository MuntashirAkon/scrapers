A Week in the Thirty Mile Zone 1/27 - 2/2/nIt was a week of public meltdowns in the Thirty Mile Zone -- with her ladyship, Britney Jean Spears, making a very public trip to the psych ward, and Sean Young acted out at the DGA awards, then headed for rehab. Hunky Novak Djokovic won the Australian Open, Kelly Rowland was a natural woman -- and Gerard Depardieu coudn't resist 73-year-old Sophia Loren. Can't get enough? Try remembering last week./n
