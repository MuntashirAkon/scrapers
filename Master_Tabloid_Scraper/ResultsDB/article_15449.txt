Anna Kendrick Vs. The World: Best And Worst Wednesday/n
Anna Kendrick was definitely thinking outside of the box when she rocked a Marchesa navy leopard print cocktail dress to the Los Angeles premiere of her latest flick, Scott Pilgrim Vs. the World. Though we loved the impeccably embroidered sweetheart strapless on the Twilight babe, we gasped in horror when we saw that she paired it with bright yellow Jimmy Choo heels, which totally clashed with the already attention-grabbing frock.

Lea Michele showed off her glam Glee girl style at An Evening of Music with the Cast of Glee on Tuesday night in Los Angeles, dressed in awesome and airy summer style. The multi-talented star rocked a beige Reem Acra one-shoulder number, which featured a gold-foiled floral pattern.  Paired with metallic peep-toe heels, the simple but sophisticated look was our pick for the Best Look of the Day!
PHOTOS: More Best And Worst
Aubrey Plaza looked super sexy on the same red carpet as Anna in a cutout mini, while Sigourney Weaver looked like she was about to trip over her way too long trousers.  Audrina Patridge bid farewell to The Hills again, this time in London, looking white hot in an Ina Soltani strapless mini. America Ferrera looked powerfully purple in Brian Reyes at the New York International Latino Film Festival, wearing a peplum mini, which featured a slender belt, but missed the a la mode mark earlier in the day in an unflattering blazer.
