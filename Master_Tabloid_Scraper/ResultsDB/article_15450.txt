RED CARPET RADAR: Stars Shine At The Apollo/n
It was a metallic Monday at the Apollo Theater Spring Benefit Concert in New York City, where Jennifer Lopez dominated the red carpet in diva-delightful style! Wearing a super lowcut Gianfranco Fere number, which hugged her curves in all the right places, with Sergio Rossi heels and a multi-colored Etro clutch, she once again, left us breathless!

Star Jones looked sophisticatedly chic in a white, pleated frock, which featured a metallically embellished waistline, while Angela Basset flaunted her fab figure in a floral body-hugger, pairing the gorgeous number with metallic heels and a clutch. Aretha Franklin wore bronze from head-to-toe, recycling her Tonyâ€™s ensemble from the night before, resulting in an incredible fashion flop.
