Eva In Movie Star Mode At NYC Charity Event/n
It was a glamorous night in NYC on Thursday at DKMS’ 4th Annual Gala: Linked Against Leukemia, where supermodels, reality stars, style makers and starlets showed up in looks hot off the runway. Though the red carpet competition was fierce, top honors go to Eva Mendes, who reminded us what a movie star is supposed to look like. Sorry, Halle!

Eva showed off her curves in a champagne-colored, satin Alberta Ferreti from the Fall 2010 Collection, which wrapped around her body in such elegance and grace. The floorlength featured fabulous embellishment and peek-a-boo shoulders. Eva carried a Ferragamo clutch which coordinated with the embellishment on her dress and also rocked eccentric jewels.

The City’s Whitney Port made high marks a la mode in a youthful Zac Posen gown, while Olivia Palermo did not do herself justice in a feathered Prabal Gurung. Supermodels Coca Rocha and Hana Soukupova both looked beyond sexy in black, while Kylie Minogue was gorgeously embellished in white.
