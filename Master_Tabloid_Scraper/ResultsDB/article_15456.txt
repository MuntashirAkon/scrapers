Lea Thrives, Meg Drives: Best And Worst Tuesday/n
Lea Michele is quickly establishing herself as a style star of 2010. The glam Glee girl, who manages to pull of a variety of looks on the red carpet, hit An Evening with Glee on Monday night in Los Angeles, looking super sexy in a netted Herve Leger by Max Azria dress from the Fall 2010 collection. She paired the exaggerated-hipped dress with black peep-toed heels and diamond and platinum Neil Lane jewels, resulting in a thriving fashion statement.

Speaking of sexy, remember when Meg Ryan was in international sex symbol?  The gorgeous blonde actress was spotted in Los Angeles, looking like a limo driver, wearing a black cap with frumpy menswear.  
Her ex and Proof Of Life costar Russell Crowe also had a dressing disappointment, looking more like a tourist than a movie star, while out and about in Paris, wearing hideously colored tennis shoes, laced in neon green, with dark ankle socks.

Kim Kardashian got terrifically trenched for an evening at STK in Los Angeles, wearing her new fave Proenza Schouler heels, while Victoria Beckham looked Posh, per usual in NYC, carrying a glossy Birkin Bag and rocking Brian Atwood Maniac hidden platform heels.
