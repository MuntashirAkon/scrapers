Raw Beauty At G-Star/n
Model-turned-actress-turned-model Liv Tyler dominated the blue carpet of the G-Star Fall 2010 Fashion Show in New York, boldly rocking Avatar blue elements. Steven Tyler’s gorgeous spawn is featured in G-Star Raw’s latest advertising campaign, so it is no surprise that she was sitting front row of the star-studded runway show, which included Adam Lambert, Kelly Osbourne and Mena Suvari.

Kelly Osbourne continued her impeccable style streak, looking lovely in black and white elements (which included a FAB white corset), adding a blue, beaded necklace to go along with the evening’s color scheme.
