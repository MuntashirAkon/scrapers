Even Victoria Beckham donned a “Help Heal Haiti” t-shirt for the event.
“Events like this are definitely important, not necessarily for me,” Brown said, back stage. 
“I think it’s important for Haiti because you get a chance to see artists and entertainers and fashion icons come together to do something nice for a good cause and it’s not so snobby. 
“t’s very humbling and being able to come and help, it’s nice to see.”
