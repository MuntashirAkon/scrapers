Ladies In Red /n
New York’s most charitably chic ladies braved the blizzards on Thursday night, strutting their stuff over to Bryant park for The Heart Truth’s Red Dress Collection 2010 Fashion Show.  Kim Kardashian, Heidi Klum and Felicity Huffman were amongst the fab ladies who donated their time (and their bodies!) to raise heart disease awareness. Kim, with beau Reggie Bush tagging along as her plus one, looked ravishing in a one-shouldered, Grecian-style Marchesa, which featured gold embellishment.
