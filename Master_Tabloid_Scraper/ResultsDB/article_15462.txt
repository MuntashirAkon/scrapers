Super Mario Bros. Celebrates Silver Anniversary With Star-Studded Party/n
Twenty-five years ago, a short, pudgy plumber named Mario risked life and limb to save Princess Toadstool from the boorish king of the Koopas, Bowser. Countless rescue missions later, the princess is still alive and well, and Super Mario Bros continues its legacy as one of the most iconic games in the home console era.
On Thursday, a huge gala held at New Yorkâ€™s Nintendo World Store, featuring big names in the social and entertainment fields, celebrated the past 25 years of Mario, and the future as well, as the brand new Super Mario Bros. for the Wii is about to hit shelves.
Celebs in attendance at the star-studded bash included socialite Tinsley Mortimer; Real Housewives stunner Kelly Kiloren Bensimon; American Boy singer Estelle; ex-Judas Priest front-man Rob Halford; 30 Rock star Scott Adist, and Nigel Barker, amongst others.
The new Super Mario Bros. game features a multi-player mode, in which players can navigate though levels, with the option to invite up to three others for competitive and cooperative good times; the must-have game for this holiday season hits stores Nov. 15. /n
