How tragic! Apparently, the police were notified about Miz Laurer's passing when her manager Anthony Anzaldo called them after finding the wrestler unresponsive in her bed. While the cause of death is still being investigated, cops believe that there was no foul play involved in Chyna's death.
In a recent statement, the police department explained: 

"The Redondo Beach Police received a 911 call from a friend of the apartment unit resident that the female inside was not breathing. The friend told Redondo Beach Police that the female had not answered her phone in a few days, and went to the location to check on her welfare."
So sad! Sources have claimed that the athlete was allegedly on medication for anxiety and sleep deprivation before her untimely passing. Hmm, very inneresting.
The reality TV star's website has since shared:

"It is with deep sadness to inform you that we lost a true icon, a real life superhero. Joanie Laurer aka Chyna, the 9th wonder of the world, has passed away."
Although it seems that Chyna's legacy will live on as she was in the middle of filming a documentary about her life. Supposedly, a trailer was meant to debut sometime in the near future.
