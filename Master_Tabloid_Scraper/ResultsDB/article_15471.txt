You Could Be Joining John Legend at SXSW if You Just #TakeTheLeap/n
AXE and John Legend are looking for the next great artist to join him onstage at the SXSW Music Festival in March.

Legend tweeted to his fans:
Aspiring musicians! Head over to http://t.co/tdODOJysKm for a chance to work with me and #TakeTheLeap! https://t.co/U0pzZ4rUJJ

The #TakeTheLeap initiative requires talented hopefuls to submit a YouTube video on the AXE White Label website showcasing their vocals and other skills in order to perform with Legend at the festival in Austin, Texas.
Vibe magazine asked Legend how he felt about the impact of this project on others and Legend said “I love this idea because this is really how I got my break, too. I was a young artist writing, recording demos, playing around New York and I needed someone to help me get that opportunity and to take it to the next level. Kanye was that person for me and I’ve been that person for other artists like Estelle and Stacy Barthe. We’re going to try to do more of that with White Label Collective.”
To all those aspiring artist out there, you won’t know if you have what it takes to be the next rising star if you don’t #TakeTheLeap.
