Watch: Sweden’s Adorable Princess Estelle Bakes Christmas Cookies/n
I don’t speak a lick of Swedish, but the cuteness of Princess Estelle’s baking skills translates perfectly.
The heiress, who will turn 2 in February, ate cookie dough at the Haga Palace taping while her parents – Crown Princess Victoria and Prince Daniel – didn’t seem concerned about the risk of food poisoning.

Estelle helped with her own miniature rolling pin before leaving her parents to it, getting up and walking off the set like the queen-in-waiting that she is.
