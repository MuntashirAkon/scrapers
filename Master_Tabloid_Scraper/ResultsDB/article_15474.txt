How Much Would You Pay to See a ‘Golden Girl’ Naked? (NSFW)/n
Bea Arthur is baring all, on canvas that is. A nude painting of the late and great comedic icon will sell at auction today in New York City. The painting, which Arthur did not pose for and is not from this episode of Golden Girls, is expected to go for anywhere between $1.8 and $2.5 million.
Entitled “Bea Arthur Naked,” the work was painted by John Currin in 1991. At the time it was painted, the New Yorker described Currin’s work as “acrid fantasy portraits of menopausal women.” Unfortunately, there are no paintings of Betty White, Rue McClanahan and Estelle Getty to complete the set.
Here is the full version of the painting:
