 It’s raining men. And on them, too.
A handful of hotties were out and about this week, including a soggy Penn Badgley; the Gossip Girl star got soaked on his way to a Gap launch in NYC. Kellan Lutz was also in the Big Apple, flexing his muscle at the the iD Gum launch.
Meanwhile, on the West Coast, Liam Hemsworth turned heads in a pair of skinny jeans as he boarded a flight to Atlanta to film Catching Fire.
