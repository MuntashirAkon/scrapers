Robert Carradine: This 'Nerd' Is Outta Here! Files for Divorce /n "Revenge of the Nerds " star Robert Carradine ﻿is ending his 25 year marriage, and he's asking his wife for spousal support. Carradine, who played the lead role of Lewis Skolnick in 'Nerds,' filed divorce docs late last month ... citing irreconcilable differences in the split with Edith Carradine. The couple has 2 adult kids ... so child support won't be an issue. In his docs, Robert did indicate he wants Edith to pay him spousal support. They've been separated since July. Robert was in a horrific car accident in Colorado back in March ... which he was lucky to survive.  Over the summer, he'd recovered enough to shoot an episode of  "Celebrity Wife Swap " -- he and Edith swapped with Terrell Owens and his girlfriend./n
