LMFAO & Friends Perform at the 2011 Billboard Summer Blowout Concert (PHOTOS)/n
If there’s one thing we absolutely love about summer, it’s all the fun summer concerts that we get to enjoy!
This year’s Billboard Summer Blowout Concert, held on Thursday night in NYC, was no exception to the list of successful summer concerts! Headlined by electro-pop duo LMFAO, the show also included a performance by rapper Swizz Beatz, who during his popular song entitled “Dance Like a White Girl” ended up crowd surfing and got caught up in the crowd. Before the show even began, the audience speculated about any possible surprise guest appearances — and as luck may have it, they were right!
Who ended up showing up to the Summer Blowout Concert?

None other than fan favorite singer Estelle!
The popular “American Boy” singer joined Swizz Beatz for the Rick Ross ft. Estelle song, “Break My Heart.”  When she came on stage, the duo made it a point to mention the turmoil in London and sent their blessings to those abroad. What a classy pair!
Among those in the crowd watching LMFAO party rockin’ on stage with colorful backup dancers and a blow-up zebra were Albie and Chris Manzo from Real Housewives of NJ. It sure seems like absolutely no one was going to miss this show.

Rumor is that right after his set, Swizz ducked out to make a call to his wife, Alicia Keys, who was in town for President Barack Obama’s Fundraiser. Love is definitely still in the air for these two. The couple’s first son Egypt celebrates his first birthday later this year.
