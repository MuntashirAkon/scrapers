Princess Estelle Just Proved She’s the Most Hardcore Royal of All (and She’s 5!)/n
Royal rocker!
When KISS blew into Sweden last weekend, (more than 2o years after the band’s first date there!), the country’s 5-year-old future queen, Princess Estelle, once again showed off her high-spirited personality.
And befitting her VIP status, Princess Estelle not only attended last weekend’s Stockholm concert, but she also she went backstage to meet the band.
Rockers Paul Stanley, Gene Simmons, Tommy Thayer and Eric Singer happily posed with Estelle and her parents, Crown Princess Victoria and Prince Daniel. Meanwhile, Estelle’s baby brother, 1-year-old Prince Oscar, stayed home.

But Princess Estelle, pictured in her father’s arms for the photo op, really got into the groove, complete with Stanley’s signature star makeup on her right eye.
Earlier this year, Estelle’s grandmother, Queen Silvia, spoke about the little princess.
“She is overprotective and very sweet to [her brother Oscar],” Silvia said of her granddaughter, who is second in line to the Swedish throne. “It feels good when you see the two of them together. Estelle’s so alert, interested, happy and curious. She’s adorable and funny — just like her mother when she was little.”
