5-Year-Old Princess Estelle Is Perfectly Poised in New Birthday Portrait/n
Princess Estelle is now our favorite five-year-old royal!
The fun-loving princess sat for new portraits celebrating her fifth birthday on Thursday. The photos follow those released on Monday to mark her first cousin Princess Leonore’s third birthday.
Princess Estelle’s parents, Crown Princess Victoria and Prince Daniel, are careful to control their daughter’s exposure to the spotlight, according to grandmother Queen Silvia.
“They’re always protective,” she told the Swedish outlet Svenskdam. “Estelle can handle [having her picture taken] well. Not all all children might, but she does.”
The high-spirited princess makes a proud big sister to her younger brother Prince Oscar, who will turn 1 on March 3, according to her doting grandmother.
“She is overprotective and very sweet to him,” Queen Silvia said of her granddaughter, who is second in line to the Swedish throne. “It feels good when you see the two of them together. Estelle’s so alert, interested, happy and curious. She’s adorable and funny — just like her mother when she was little.”
Currently enjoying a winter break, Princess Estelle and her family are expected to return to Sweden in March.
