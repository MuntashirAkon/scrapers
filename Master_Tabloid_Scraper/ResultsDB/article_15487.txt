Royal Coloring Session! Princess Estelle Shows Baby Brother Prince Oscar How to Draw in Adorable New Photo/n
Not to be outdone by the Dragon Prince, the Swedish royal family has released two adorable new photos of Princess Estelle and Prince Oscar!
In one snap, the 4-year-old princess shows her 11-month-old brother the coloring ropes. Estelle expertly draws on the floor as Oscar intently looks on. The candid moment shows the sweet bond the royal siblings already share.
The cute duo join parents Crown Princess Victoria and Prince Daniel in a more formal second family photo. And it’s clear that baby Oscar is already taking after big sis Estelle with his blond locks, big brown eyes and sweet smile.

The family of four opted for a gray and maroon color scheme (check out Estelle’s matching headband!), which was likely taken around the holidays, according to Svenskdam. Oscar’s white button-up and gray slacks are from the French children’s clothing line, Tartine et Chocolat.
Both royal children are set to celebrate their birthdays in the next month: Princess Estelle turns 5 on Feb. 23 and Oscar will mark his first birthday on March 2.
