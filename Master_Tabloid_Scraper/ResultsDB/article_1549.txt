Robert Carradine: Divorce Turns Nasty ... She Took My Guitars!!!/n "Revenge of the Nerds " star Robert Carradine is accusing his soon-to-be ex-wife Edith of ransacking their storage space in an attempt to pawn off his most prized collectibles. Carradine says in divorce docs he had a hunch something was amiss after noticing his key to the unit was missing.  When he called the storage facility he was told his wife was there with their grown son, moving items ... a red flag, Carradine says, because their son was in New Zealand.  He claims Edith and the dude made off with 3 antique chairs he got from his grandpa, valued at $5k a piece. She also took his collection of Pentax cameras ... which has sentimental valuable because his late brother and actor David got him interested in the brand. It doesn't end there ... Carradine says Edith also copped to moving his $20k guitar collection. He's demanding a return of all the items. He also wants the judge to order her to stop using the rubber stamp with his signature. /n
