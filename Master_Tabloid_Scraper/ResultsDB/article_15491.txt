Prince Oscar was following in a Bernadotte family tradition since his big sister made her public debut on the same balcony during the king s birthday four years before.   



Earlier in the day, the 4-year-old princess delighted onlookers by insisting on greeting clergymen as she left the royal chapel, before shaking hands and kissing cheeks with other royal guests. The scene-stealing princess then joined in musical tributes to the king, enthusiastically clapping her hands.  

After Princess Estelle and her new baby brother had been put to bed, King Carl XVI Gustaf hosted a banquet at the palace.   
Featuring a DJ and a live band, Abba‚Äôs  Dancing Queen,  was accompanied by a dancing king, according to the Swedish outlet Svenskdam, which reported that the monarch left the party before it broke up shortly before 6 a.m. on Sunday morning.

Prince Oscar, their second youngest grandchild ‚Äì and third in line to throne ‚Äì is expected to be christened on May 27.
