Amber Heard has filed for divorce from Johnny Depp after just 15 months of marriage — and her family had no idea!

When reached by RadarOnline.com, her father, David Heard, said, “I don’t know anything about that!”

The news comes at a particularly tough time for Depp, 52, whose newest movie, Alice Through the Looking Glass, opens Friday. In addition, his mother passed away on May 20.
Reports of trouble in the marriage swirled since the couple tied the knot in February 2015. In addition, Depp’s increasingly bedraggled appearance has shocked fans at several recent events.
Nevertheless, Depp was by Heard’s side as she filmed a bizarre apology video following a guilty plea to charges of dog smuggling in Australia in April.

Reps for Heard and Depp did not respond to Radar’s request for comment.
