This just in: Jenna Wolfe and Stephanie Gosk are mommies!The Today anchor and correspondent along with her partner, who is an NBC News foreign correspondent, welcomed a baby girl tonight at 7:31 p.m., according to Today. Their daughter came into the world weighing seven pounds, 13 ounces. And the couple's bundle of joy has quite the name: Harper Estelle Wolfeld Gosk.Gosk shared the first photograph of the cutie, who was getting a sweet peck from Wolfe, on Twitter, "First pic. We couldn't be happier. Thanks for all the great messages."Funny enough, Wolfe posted a blog post earlier today titled, "Goodbye for now! When we meet again, I'll be a mom," seemingly not knowing that the time would come (much) sooner rather than later.

"It is with slightly borrowed time (I say borrowed because for some reason I feel like labor can literally begin any second now -- wait, no, false alarm, that was just a hunger pain) that I have the need to share my wide range of emotions this hour/this day/this week," Wolfe wrote, and further shared her endearing fears (and lots of questions) on becoming a new mom.

"While I was terrified of the whole birthing process, now I'm sort of terrified of life AFTER birth.What happens in that first minute we walk through the front door of our apartment? How do we know what to do? Does she come with an instruction manual? When does she eat? When does she need a diaper change? How about a bath? Long sleeves? Onesie? Does she sleep in the crib or the bassinet? Is this diaper on backwards?"

Wolfe first announced her pregnancy in March during the program. "My girlfriend, Stephanie Gosk, who works here at NBC, and I are expecting a baby girl at the end of August," she said. "We're really excited."She also revealed that it was no easy task figuring out who would carry the baby between the two of them. It took extreme rock, paper, scissor skills."We rock-paper,-scissored it. I won 34-31, so I'm carrying the baby, bam," Wolfe told E! News in an exclusive sit-down hours after revealing that she was five months' pregnant with a baby girl.Congratulations to the new parents!
