Jenelle’s Mom Lashes Out At Her Baby Daddy: ‘I Do Not Like David!’/n
Jenelle Evans’ mother is lashing out at her daughter’s baby daddy exclusively to RadarOnline.com, and she isn’t holding back!
“I do not like David,” Babs Evans told Radar about Jenelle’s fiancée Eason. As Radar reported, Eason spent time in prison with Courtland Rogers, Jenelle’s ex-husband, before he met the MTV star.
Now, Eason has been dating the Teen Mom 2 star for more than a year and the couple welcomed their first child, daughter Ensley, in January.
But his relationship with Barbara has been rough from the beginning, and she told Radar that there is certainly no love lost.

“Jenelle is into the fame and the fortune and now David is too,” Barbara said.
“I don’t care what people think about me. I act the same way on and off camera,” she continued.
But Barbara admitted that it’s not just David who she has a problem with.
“I don’t hate Jenelle. I don’t like her,” Babs said. “I love her, she’s my child, but I don’t like her.”
