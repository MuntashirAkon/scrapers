Heidi Montag and Spencer Pratt are ready to share the sex of their first baby together with the public.

The couple reveals that they are expecting a baby boy in a new interview with Us Weekly.
“I ran into the room and said, ‘It’s the doctor’s office!’” Montag recalls in this week’s issue of Us Weekly. “The doctor said, ‘It’s a boy!’ I started screaming.”
Montag, who is currently 17 weeks along in her pregnancy, says, “It was in my heart to have a boy.”
“I thought Spencer really used to want a boy, and then a few months ago we had a conversation where he said, ‘Let’s just make sure it’s healthy. Boy or girl, I don’t care.'”
Montag says that she hoped that their child would be a boy because, according to her, it would allow for a “more natural bond for Spencer” since he and his father have a tight relationship. She suspects that Pratt and their child will be doing jujitsu and playing soccer often.

The mom-to-be says that Kristin Cavallari and Audrina Patridge both sent their congratulations after she announced her pregnancy.
“I’ve actually been in touch with both of them for a while now. And I obviously asked both of them for advice,” says Montag. “Kristin sent me a whole list of baby things you need in the first few months, which has been really helpful.”
