‘Cash Me Outside’ Girl Gets Beaten by Her Mom in Alarming Video/n
A video of Danielle Bregoli, the girl behind the “Cash Me Outside” meme, being physically attacked by her mother has surfaced online.

In the clip, Bregoli’s mother, Barbara Ann, is seen grabbing her daughter by the hair as she calls her a “bitch.” The two fall the ground struggle as heated words are exchanged. Via GeekVIP:
Supposedly the fight was over Barbara kicking Danielle’s friend out of the house after she had been crashing (ousside perhaps?) at their Boynton Beach home for a couple of weeks.
Danielle’s friend didn’t appreciate this so she did the classiest and most obvious next step, leaking the video to World Star Hip Hop.
