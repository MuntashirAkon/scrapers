The ‘Cash Me Outside’ Girl Assaulted a Passenger on a Plane/n
Danielle Peskowitz Bregoli — A.K.A. the girl behind the “Cash Me Outside” memes — was kicked off a Spirit Airlines flight after she attacked a fellow passenger on Monday (Feb. 6, 2017).

The internet sensation punched an unnamed female after the woman allegedly complained about Bregoli’s mother, who was in a cast for a foot injury, taking too long to put her carry-on bag in the overhead compartment. Bregoli claimed she intervened because the passenger had tried to assault her mom by putting her hand on Barbara Ann’s throat.
PressRoom VIP reports:
It seems to me like everyone here is at fault: the unnamed woman for arguing about a bag getting put away, Danielle’s mom for getting so heated about her comments, and Danielle for jumping into the fray when the woman insulted her. That’s probably why Spirit Airlines banned all three of them for life, and the police agreed that there was a mutual combat between them; no one is pressing charges against each other, and no one was arrested.
