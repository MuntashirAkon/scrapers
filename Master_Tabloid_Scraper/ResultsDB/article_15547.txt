According to Us Weekly, the twosome spent last weekend holed up at Santa Barbara’s San Ysidro Ranch — the same place where Duff spent her wedding night with then-husband Mike Comrie in 2010. Before then, they were seen having an intimate meal at Gasolina Cafe in Woodland Hills, Calif.
“At the restaurant, they were seated on the same side of the table and pulled their chairs close together,” a source dished. “They were leaning in and laughing a lot. They had their arms linked and kissed at one point.”
Duff previously worked with Koma on several songs on her 2015 album Breathe In. Breathe Out., including “Confetti,” “Arms Around a Memory” and “Breathe In. Breathe Out.”
