Broadway Legend Barbara Cook Dead at 89/n
Barbara Cook, the theater icon and soaring soprano known for originating roles in some of Broadway’s most acclaimed musicals like The Music Man and Candide, has died. She was 89.
Cook died of respiratory failure on Tuesday morning in her New York home surrounded by family and friends, her only son Adam LeGrant, 58, told Variety. 
Most fittingly, Cook’s publicist told the Associated Press that the late singer’s final meal — like the title of the song from She Loves Me that would become her signature tune for years to come — was vanilla ice cream.

Over her six-decade career on stage, Cook became known for her cheerful personality and rich, crystal-clear voice — its natural brightness cutting to the heart with each note on show tune standards like “Till There Was You,” “My White Knight,” “Ice Cream,” and “Glitter and Be Gay.”
Born on Oct. 25, 1927 in Atlanta, Georgia, she began singing locally before making the move to the New York City in 1948 after visiting the Big Apple with her mother.
On Broadway, she often played the leading lovestruck ingenue — like Ado Annie (in the 1953 revival of Oklahoma!) or Carrie Pipperidge (1953) and Julie Jordan (1957) in productions of Rodgers and Hammerstein’s Carousel. She made her debut in 1951’s Flahooley.

Cook’s three biggest roles came in the late ’50s and early ’60s — first with Leonard Bernstein’s Candide in 1956 (where she played the cheeky Cunegonde) and then in 1957’s The Music Man, where she played the sweet but strong-minded Marian the librarian. The latter won Cook a 1958 Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Musical.
She Loves Me, in 1963, would cast Cook as Amalia Balash — the witty letter-writing perfume saleswoman who falls in love with a secret pen pal through a series of lonely-hearts ads, only to discover he’s actually her work nemesis. (Meg Ryan would play a version of the character in the 1998 film, You’ve Got Mail.)

When the leading roles of the Great White Way dried up, Cook began to battle alcoholism and weight gain. “I was so broke that I was stealing food from the supermarket by slipping sandwich meat in my coat pocket,” she wrote in her 2016 memoir Then & Now.
With the help of pianist and music arranger Wally Harper (who died in 2014), Cook sobered up and reinvented herself as a concert singer — interpreting the canon of classic musical theatre songs in venues across the country like New York’s Carnegie Hall. Nearly a dozen concert and solo albums (like 1975’s Barbara Cook at Carnegie Hall and 2002’s Loverman) would follow.

Eventually, her cabaret work would bring her back to Broadway — in engagements like Mostly Sondheim (2002), Barbara Cook’s Broadway! (2004). Her final Broadway role was in 2010’s musical review Sondheim on Sondheim, alongside Vanessa Williams and Scandal star Norm Lewis.
In 2011, Cook was one of the recipients of the Kennedy Center Honors. She was honored there with a medley of her greatest stage songs, performed by Broadway legends like Glenn Close, Kelli O’Hara, Sutton Foster, Patti LuPone and Audra McDonald.

Singing well into her 80s, Cook’s last public appearance was at O’Hara’s Carnegie Hall concert in the fall of 2016. There, the audience all sang “Happy Birthday” to her.
Cook was married once, to acting teacher David LeGrant. The pair divorced in 1965 after 13 years wed.

On Tuesday, some of Cook’s biggest fans (and musical stars) shared their memories of Cook on social media.
“Thank you Barbara Cook for the beautiful songs, the indelible characters, and the masterful storytelling,” Tony winner Ben Platt wrote. “Heaven must sound glorious today.”
“A friend. A mentor. A master. I will forever be grateful for the warmth she showed me on and off the stage. Rest in peace,” wrote Grammy nominee Josh Groban.
“I love you Barbara,” said six-time Tony winner Audra McDonald. “Thank you for being such an incredible mentor. Rest now you sweet sweet angel.”

Officials with the Tony Awards remembered the clear-voiced soprano in a moving Facebook post, writing, “Rest in Peace Barbara Cook, we were so fortunate enough to see you shine in so many great roles.”
Laura Benanti, who starred in Cook’s role in the 2016 revival of She Loves Me, remembered the star she called her idol.
“Barbara Cook was one of my earliest inspirations,” Benanti said in a statement. “I am devastated to hear of her passing. She brought so much joy to so many for decades and I am grateful that through her glorious recordings her legacy will live on.”
