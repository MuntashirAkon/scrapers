Prince's Tragic Death Spurs Ugly Feud: Family Members To Fight Over Fortune/n
Sadly, Prince‘s tragic death has not brought his loved ones together in mourning. Instead, his family members are beginning to feud over the music icon’s reported $300 million fortune, RadarOnline.com can exclusively reveal.
A will for the late singer — who was discovered dead  in an elevator at his Minnesota estate on Thursday morning at just 57 years old — has not turned up, leaving his siblings scrambling for a piece of the massive “Purple Rain” pie, sources claim.
“There will be a fight,” the insider tells Radar.

He was predeceased by half-sister Lorna, and half-brother Duane.
Prince’s parents, John Nelson and Mattie Shaw, who split when their famous son was just 10, have also passed away.

Despite the feuding, the family came together for a memorial service at his Paisley Park compound over the weekend.
As Radar previously reported, the singer’s beloved Jehovah’s Witness Church may also be a beneficiary to his fortune, if a will is uncovered. /n
