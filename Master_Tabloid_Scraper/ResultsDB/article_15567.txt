I wouldn't change a thing."She was quick to note that she is "perfectly healthy" and this is "my decision."Walters added that she will continue to coexecutive produce The View with Bill Geddie "as long as the program is aired" and stated she will come back to visit from time-to-time.

"I'm not walking into the sunset, but I don't want to appear on another program, climb another mountain," she said.
