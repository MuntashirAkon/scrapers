Barbara Walters: Elisabeth Hasselbeck Not Leaving The View/n
Unlike Joy Behar, who announced she is leaving The View, Elisabeth Hasselbeck is staying put.At the top of Monday's episode, Barbara Walters cleared up the rumors that her fellow cohost was departing the ABC daytime program."There is a particularly false story that keeps getting picked up about Elisabeth's alleged departure, saying that we don't approve of her conservative views. The truth is we love Elisabeth. I like her personally and she's just a wonderful person. But beyond that, we value and appreciate her point of view because Elisabeth helps give this show perspective and balance, so we have no plans for Elisabeth to leave show," Walters said.

She added, "Having said that to all of you, [producer] Bill [Geddie] and I have always said that when one of you makes the choice to leave, that's your choice and we will support your decision."Walters' words come on the heels of a rep for The View telling E! News that Hasselbeck "is a valued member of The View and has a long-term contract."
