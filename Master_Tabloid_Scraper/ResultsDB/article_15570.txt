Elizabeth Vargas has been very open about her battle with alcoholism and recent rehab stint. But things got downright awkward for the ABC journalist during a Thursday appearance on The View when she opened up about seeking treatment."What finally happened that made you say, 'OK, it's time to get help?'" co-host Jenny McCarthy asked the 51-year-old on Thursday."Well, I showed up for a shoot on 20/20 and I was in no condition to shoot that interview," Vargas revealed. But not before Barbara Walters interrupted Vargas and said, "We all knew."McCarthy tried to rectify the situation by rephrasing her question but the veteran TV personality interrupted, again, and said, "It was public at that point."

Except that it wasn't, Vargas explained."No, but we all knew," Walters responded.Walters clarified the situation to New York Post's Page Six, saying "I love Elizabeth and have great admiration for her. I never would have deliberately said anything to hurt her, and I called to tell her that.""This is silly! Barbara is a colleague and a friend," Vargas added.
