Amy Schumer & Goldie Hawn Bonding Over Sperm!/n
Snatched star Amy Schumer stunned writer Katie Dippold and director Jonathan Levine
when she pitched a scene that would have co-star Goldie Hawn
spitting what she thinks is whale semen in Amy’s face —
but Oscar winner Goldie didn’t even blink.
“They all just kind of stared at me,” Amy told Howard Stern during an interview.
“Except for Goldie, who went, ‘That’s funny.’
“Goldie and I had no disagreements about jokes,” reveals Amy. /n
