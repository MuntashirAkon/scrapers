Kate Hudson Shows Off New Man With Steamy PDA/n
She’s been Snatched! Kate Hudson stole the spotlight at the May 10 premiere
of mom Goldie Hawn’s comedy, locking lips with new beau, musician Danny Fujikawa.
The amorous display marked the couple’s official debut after they were first linked in late March,
and it seems like Danny’s already made quite the impression.
“He’s a great guy,” Goldie gushed to reporters at the event.
“He’s very special actually.” What more do you need than mom’s seal of approval? /n
