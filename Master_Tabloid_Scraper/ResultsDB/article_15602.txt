Cancer Scare: Kurt Russell Shocks With Frightening & Grotesque Lip Sores/n
A series of grotesque, blood filled scabs lining the lower lip of Kurt Russell has baffled doctors begging the 65-year-old actor to get the frightening blisters diagnosed and treated immediately!
“I’ve never seen anything quite like these,” said Dr. Stuart Fischer, who has not treated Russell. “They need to be examined immediately.”
Dr. Gabe Mirkin, board certified for more than 40 years concurred.
“He needs to have these looked at and have a physician conduct immediate tests,” said the expert, who hasn’t treated the actor. “They could be the result of a serious infection.”

Because the sores closely follow the lower lip line, there was some speculation that horrific sores were the result of a cosmetic procedure, but plastic surgeon, Dr. Anthony Youn dismissed that theory.
“It’s not like any procedure I’ve ever seen,” said Youn.
Similar blisters have been known in a genetic condition called Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, which is associated with a high risk of intestinal cancer.
“He needs to get to the bottom of this immediately,” Dr. Fischer warned.
