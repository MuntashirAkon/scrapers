Kate's Nightmare: Hudson In Custody Battle With Ex-Husband/n
Kate Hudson‘s friendly relationship with her rocker ex-husband seems to have gone south.
Chris Robinson, 50, has reportedly filed a petition in California Superior Court to change the former couple’s custody agreement for their 13-year-old son Ryder, the Daily Mail claims.
According to the report, Hudson, 37, and her Black Crowes frontman ex have both agreed to submit to evaluation interviews, in addition to drug, alcohol and psychological testing if necessary.

An evaluator will reportedly have access to their health and mental health records.
The exes must come to an agreement by June 30, 2017, records indicate.
Hudson and Robinson split in 2006 after six years of marriage.

The Almost Famous Star has admitted to feeling “like a bad mother.”
“Some days I feel like I should win best mom of the day award, and some days I find myself doing strange things that don’t have any real purpose, in faraway corners in my house, and I realize I am literally and deliberately hiding from my children,” she told InStyle.
The single mom recently dated much-younger singer Nick Jonas, 24, and dancer Derek Hough, 31.
