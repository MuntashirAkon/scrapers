We're assuming Andy Cohen hasn't tasted breast milk since he was a wee babe, so this must've been an inneresting experience for him.

The Bravo host had Amber Tamblyn on What What Happens Live! Wednesday night, when Andy brought up the fact that Amber's husband David Cross had tasted her breast milk. And then Amber immediately offered him a sip of some of her freshly-pumped milk. Andy was actually game!
Sure, he made a gross-out face as he was drinking it while Amber shouted "Chug! Chug!" But he seemed to come out of the whole thing unscathed.
Later he quipped: 
"That's the closest to a breast I've ever been."
Amber also explained that she's tasted some famous breast milk of her own:
"I've drank Blake Lively's breast milk. So if that went through me, you've technically had Blake's and my breast milk together."
Andy added:
"So does that mean I've done it with Ryan Reynolds? Cause that would make it better!"
LOLz! Our thoughts exactly Andy!
