Guy Ritchie's King Arthur Opened With A Castratingly Low Box Office — Just Like These Other Big Screen Bombs!/n

Charlie Hunnam reportedly did 1000 pushups a day to get bulked up for his leading role in King Arthur: Legend of the Sword.
And based on the box office report, it looks like the actor did about just as many pushups as the film made in dollars its opening weekend!
Guy Ritchie's adaptation of the Arthurian legend severely underperformed at the domestic box office, earning just $14.7 million from 3,702 theaters — hundreds of thousands of stones short from its $175 million budget.
You can blame it on the not-so-marketable timing of opening on Mother's Day weekend, or David Beckham fans not coming through to watch the athlete's acting debut — but no matter the reason, this epic was the first huge bomb of the summer season.
Of course, King Arthur isn't the first blockbuster to bust little block at the box office. Check out even bigger bombs (below)!
