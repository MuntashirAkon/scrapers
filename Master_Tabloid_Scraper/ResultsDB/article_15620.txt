King Arthur Bombs At The Box Office As Amy Schumer's Snatched Wins Mother's Day In A Surprise Upset!/n

The Mother's Day weekend box office didn't do any favors to King Arthur: Legend of the Sword — but it really helped a mom-focused movie turn into a surprise hit!
This weekend at the box office, two big new releases dominated headlines, with Amy Schumer's Snatched — in which she costars with the legendary Goldie Hawn — taking the lead in an unexpected turn!

Schumer and Hawn's comedy flick netted a grand total of  $17.5 million, which was good enough for first place this week at the box office, but still a disappointing show in its own right considering Schumer's previous movie — Trainwreck — did $30 million in 2015.
But even though the weekend was slow for that comedy genre, the real story was the HUGE bomb of King Arthur: Legend of the Sword. 
The movie cost $175 million to make before marketing, but it opened up as a flop of epic proportions, bringing in just $14.7 million from 3,702 theaters at its opening weekend, making it the first HUGE bomb of the summer season and truly one of the worst openings EVER for a big-budget studio film.
Holy crap!!!
It was a tough weekend all around, with media outlets reporting these last three days as among the slowest Mother's Day weekends ever for new releases in terms of revenue.
