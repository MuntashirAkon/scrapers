Amy Schumer is clearing the air surrounding her controversial “Formation” video.

Even though the comedian tried to brush off the criticism surrounding her Beyoncé parody video, yesterday (Oct. 27, 2016), Schumer posted a lengthy essay on Medium explaining that the video was purely meant to be fun and was never meant to be a parody of the powerful original video. “I did not mean to detract any of the meaning from the video,” she wrote. “I am of course horrified and sickened by the events that are addressed throughout that video and didn’t see this as minimizing that and still don’t.”

“It was NEVER a parody. It was just us women celebrating each other,” she continued. “The video Beyoncé made was so moving and I wouldn’t ever make fun of that. There is absolutely no way to.”
Schumer goes on to explain that she and her co-stars, Goldie Hawn, Wanda Sykes, and Joan Cusack, only meant to have fun and celebrate other women, and absolutely never would have released it without Beyoncé explicit permission.
“If you watched it and it made you feel anything other than good, please know that was not my intention. The movie we made is fun and the women in it are strong and want to help each other. That’s what it was about for me. Of course I had Beyoncé and Jay Z’s approval. They released it on Tidal exclusively for the first 24 hours.”
“My mission is to continue to work as hard as I can to empower women and make them laugh and feel better,” Schumer wrote in conclusion. “And I won’t let anything stop me.”
