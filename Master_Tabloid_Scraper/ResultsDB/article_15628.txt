Amy Schumer and Goldie Hawn are currently on set working on their upcoming mother-daughter comedy and, during their down time, decided to create a “Formation” parody video.

The video titled “Get In Formation,” features Schumer and Hawn in dirty clothes dancing in the jungle with a few appearances by Wanda Sykes and Joan Cusack. It didn’t take long for the video to go viral, but the comedians didn’t get the response they were probably looking for. Instead, the #AmySchumerGottaGoParty started trending.

#FormationParody is a garbage piece of “comedy” done by a garbage comedienne, “sometimes feminist” Amy Schumer #AmySchumerGottaGoParty

Amy Schumer is a talentless joke thief. She;s made her career off of stealing from other people. #amyschumergottagoparty
