Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell are bidding farewell to their love nest after 12 years. The longtime couple, who’ve owned the property since 2004, have listed their five-bedroom, five-bathroom home in the Pacific Palisades, a ritzy suburb in Los Angeles, for $7.25 million.

Located on a large 17,862-square-foot lot tucked away in the Palisades Riviera community, Hawn and Russell’s family abode stands at 6,389 square feet and boasts room after room of luxurious living spaces fit for a family of A-listers. (After all, Hawn’s daughter is none other than actress Kate Hudson!) The main house offers a spacious kitchen and breakfast nook, a massive master suite with its own fireplace, spa tub and dry sauna, a fully-equipped gym that opens onto a beautiful terrace and a home theater.
With an outdoor pool and spa surrounded by a pool by lush green landscaping and a separate meditation room, the residence is essentially the epitome of California living.
However, Hawn and Russell aren’t entirely done with their neighborhood just yet. According to Trulia, who initially reported on the listing, the duo still owns the nearby $6.5 million estate that they bought in 2014.
