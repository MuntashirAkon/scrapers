Kate Hudson’s latest costar may just be her favorite costar of all time.

 
Last night, Hudson was joined by her father, and costar for her latest film Deepwater Horizon, Kurt Russell,  at the premiere of the film at the Toronto International Film Festival. Deepwater Horizon, which tells the story of the catastrophic 2010 BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, is the first movie the father/daughter duo have worked on together.

While Russel is not Hudson’s biological father, he has raised her along with her brother Oliver Hudson as his own ever since getting together with Goldie Hawn more than 40 years ago.
