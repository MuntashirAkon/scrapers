“The ceiling is shattered.”

Last night (Jun. 7, 2016), Hillary Clinton won big in California and finally secured the delegates necessary to clinch the Democratic nomination. But last night was more then just a big win for Clinton: with the secured delegates, Secretary Clinton officially became the first woman in U.S. history to be named the Presidential candidate for the Democrat or Republican party.
To commemorate the historic moment, Clinton’s Hollywood supporters including Lady Gaga, Lena Dunham, and John Legend took to social media to share their excitement and just exactly what her win means to them.

This is kinda of a big deal. First a black president next a women president. In 8 years perhaps a gay midget president. God bless America.

A beautiful day because #historymade and #sheswithus. Tears of joy- I cannot wait to tell my children that once upon a time a woman had never been president. I cannot wait to support this uniquely qualified PERSON all the way to the White House. Putting in my request now for Hilmojis
