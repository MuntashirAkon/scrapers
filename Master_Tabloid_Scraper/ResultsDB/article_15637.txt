Congratulations, Rio!
The 3-year-old daughter of Oliver Hudson graduated from pre-school on Thursday and celebrated with her grandmother, Goldie Hawn.
The Snatched star took to Instagram to commemorate the occasion, writing, “Me and my baby Rio. Pre school Graduation day. At last I graduated!”

Rio is the youngest of Oliver and Erinn Bartlett‘s children, after brothers Wilder Brooks, 9, and Bodhi Hawn, 7.
While Hawn, 71, may have “graduated” from pre-school, she’s certainly achieved so much more in her long career in Hollywood. In May, the Oscar-winning actress received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame alongside longtime love Kurt Russell.

Hawn spoke to PEOPLE and Entertainment Weekly Editor-in-Chief Jess Cagle about her blended family, which includes kids Oliver, 40, Kate, 38, Boston, 37, and Wyatt, 30, along with five grandchildren.
She said she has learned the secrets to a long-lasting relationship.
“Love, gratitude, compassion, because sometimes every man or every woman will drive their partner crazy. Family. Fun. Laughs. Sex,” Hawn said. “If you don’t nurture that, and remember, you’re done.”
