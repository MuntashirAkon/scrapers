Amy Schumer and Goldie Hawn Get in "Formation"/n
The movie was a labor of love, but luring Hawn out of retirement wasn't easy."I met her on an airplane a couple of years ago and told her there's a movie I really want to make with her. And she was very nice. 'OK, honey.' She probably thought I was a psycho. 'OK, crazy person,'" Schumer revealed toÂ The Los Angeles Times in August while promoting her memoir. "Then I'd meet her at different things, saying, 'We're making this movie together,' and I think, eventually, some people got in her ear and told her I wasn't crazy, that I make things."Three weeks ago, Hawn shared details about the film on ITV's Loose Women. Schumer's persistence charmed Hawn. "She's so adorable, and I thought, 'I'd be a good mom for her,'" the actress said, adding, "She's crazy, but that's why I love her!"

As for Schumer? "My character is supposed to go on this trip South America with a boyfriend. But he breaks up with her," she told the newspaper. That's where Hawn's character comes into play. "It's a nonrefundable ticket," Schumer, 35, added, "and she doesn't want to drink alone."Schumer wrote the script with her sister, Kim Caramele, and Katie Dippold. Unlike some female protagonists, "We're very much in charge of our own destiny," Schumer explained. "There's no other way to be." If that isn't enough of a selling point, she added, "It's a Goldie Hawn movie and she's gorgeous. Goldie...Hawn! I don't remember the first time I didn't love her!"
