Dippold eventually helped her mom set up an eHarmony dating profile, although she said it was "the most phoned-in profile I've ever seen in my life," full of typos, capital letters and no photo. "I started daydreaming about: 'What if I took her on a crazy vacation somewhere, and then I took us off the beaten path, just to shake things up?'" Dippold explained. In the movie, "She gets taken off the beaten path, but then everything the mother feared is correct. So, it's then basically trying to get to an American embassy through the Amazon rainforest and whatnot."

Snatched marks Hawn's return to acting following 2002's The Banger Sisters. "Oh, man, I was the biggest Goldie Hawn fan, my entire life," Dippold said. "It's really, really exciting. Seeing her back in action again—she's so amazing and so funny. I'm really excited for people to see this."Schumer shared Dippold's affection for the Oscar winner, as she too grew up watching Hawn's most popular movies. "It's a Goldie Hawn movie and she's gorgeous. Goldie...Hawn!" she told The Los Angeles Times in August. "I don't remember the first time I didn't love her!"

But convincing Hawn to play her mother was no easy feat. "I met her on an airplane a couple of years ago and told her there's a movie I really want to make with her. And she was very nice. 'OK, honey,'" Schumer told the newspaper. "She probably thought I was a psycho. 'OK, crazy person.' Then I'd meet her at different things, saying, 'We're making this movie together,' and I think, eventually, some people got in her ear and told her I wasn't crazy, that I make things."Snatched arrives in theaters May 12, 2017.
