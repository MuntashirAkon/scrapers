The biracial beauty has a black father and white mother, and has admitted that she sometimes gets mistaken for being Hispanic. People on social media criticized her win, also claiming that she was specifically chosen for being so light-skinned.

Her father may be black but socially i see she doesn't even claim it unless when it's convenient for her. That's that shit I don't like

SMH!
Thankfully there were people who were fully in support of the 22-year-old, and defended her on Twitter.

@ID_NUPEs @RachaelMalonson @WhatUpDoeDoe @Emma_mattie @nyleswashington @Davidallen_3 All these people who didn't attend the pageant but know so much about her üôÑ. Congrats Rachael and to the other ladies as well. ‚ù§Ô∏è

@_ColeWorldShwty @avuitton_ @afrolatinababe @ID_NUPEs @RachaelMalonson @WhatUpDoeDoe @Emma_mattie @nyleswashington Lol you talking out of ignorance. So you're saying because she the lightest it's automatically suspicious if she won? Cmon that's stupidity

Wow. It's really beautiful to see how the black community at UT will come together and stand up for their brothers and sisters‚ù§Ô∏è

A time that was supposed to make me feel worthless turned into a beautiful reminder that I have true brothers and sisters at UT‚ù§Ô∏è
