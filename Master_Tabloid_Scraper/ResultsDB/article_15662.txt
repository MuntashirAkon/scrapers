Bunch of Celebs on Burglar Bunch Computer/nTMZ has put together a gallery of photos we found on the computer seized from alleged Hollywood Hills Burglar Bunch member Nick Prugo ... photos which may show other big stars the Bunch had their eye on. In almost all of the photos -- which include stars like Britney Spears, Jessica Biel, Hayden Panettiere, Bette Midler, Mariah Carey, Shania Twain, Goldie Hawn, Rihanna, Lindsay Lohan, Audrina Patridge, Megan Fox and Heidi Montag -- the stars are usually wearing some pretty sizable bling.From the list of ladies above, only Lindsay, Audrina and Megan have allegedly been hit by the Bunch -- the rest of them have emerged unscathed ... except Hayden.Hayden's house was burglarized back in April -- and guess what was stolen?
