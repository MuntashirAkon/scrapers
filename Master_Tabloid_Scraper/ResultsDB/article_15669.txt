Mother Hawn to the Rescue/nThe last couple of weeks have been a little shakey for Kate Hudson. After splitting from her husband, Kate needed some sun, sand and meditation. She immediately jetted off to Hawaii to escape from the rat race and take it down a notch.Now she's returned home to the nest and has been spending time getting support from her mother Goldie Hawn. The two were seen shopping in Santa Monica on Tuesday. While Kate appeared to be indecisive as to where to go, Goldie stepped in and took control of the reigns. Good ol' mom to the rescue./n
