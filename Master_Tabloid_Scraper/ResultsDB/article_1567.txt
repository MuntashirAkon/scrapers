Prince's Half-Brother Is Fighting To Stay In Mansion!/n

Prince's half-brother doesn't want to get kicked out of the house he's living in… and he's taking his fight to court!
Omarr Baker — who shares a mom with the performer — went to court to tell a judge that he should be able to stay in the mansion the late artist built for his mother for the rest of his life.

Apparently, Omarr took care of their mother, jazz singer Mattie Shaw, until she passed away in 2002. In exchange, the singer's sibling claims he was promised a place in the Minnesota mansion until he dies.
This comes after the songsmith's estate administrator, Bremer Trust, filed court papers that seemed to suggest it would be selling Prince's Paisley Park mansion, where the purple one lived.
But it doesn't seem like Mr. Baker will have to fight the bank too much to keep it from selling the pad, because Bremer clarified that the home will NOT be going on the market!
Bremer Trust said in a statement on Saturday that it "has no plans" to sell Paisley Park.
Well, good news for Omarr!
