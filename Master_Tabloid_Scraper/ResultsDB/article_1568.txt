Twitter Goes Crazy About Germany's Very Unfortunately Named Men's Field Hockey Members At The Rio Olympics!/n

Wonder if these guys have ever heard this joke beforeâ€¦
Germany's men's field hockey team is trying to win a medal at the Olympics in Rio this month, but virtually everybody on Twitter and everywhere else is so much more concerned with, uh, this.

Two players on Germany's team â€” Linus Butt and Florian Fuchs â€” were caught on camera Saturday afternoon in a very unfortunately-timed shot during the team's game against Canada and, well, you can just see what's going on (above)!
LOLz!!!
Predictably, social media went berserk about the pairing, with many users tweeting about it (below):

Obviously, it would be hugely childish & wrong to chuckle at Linus & Florian, the backbone of Germany's hockey team. pic.twitter.com/jn1lJESmkE

If banter were an Olympic event, the Germans would be gifted a Gold Medal! #ButtFuchs #Rio2016 ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª pic.twitter.com/VwblNdS4d7

OMG!!!
These poor guys.
If it's any consolation, Butt, Fuchs, and the rest of the German team did beat Canada 6-2 in the field hockey match.
