Kendrick Lamar Is Being Sued For Sampling THIS '70s Star Without Permission! Take A Listen & Decide For Yourself!/n

Someone's got a bone to pick with Kendrick Lamar!
The Grammy-winner has cranked out a lot of hits over the past few years, but one of his earlier tracks is getting the rapper into a bit of legal trouble!
According to TMZ, K.Dot is being sued for sampling a Bill Withers song in his 2009 track without permission.
The lawsuit was issued by Mattie Music Group, a music company that claims it owns the rights to the 1975 song Don't You Want To Stay.

The company alleges that Kendrick's song I Do This — featured on his self titled EP — is a complete replica of Withers' love song.
Claiming that the King Kunta performer's track "consists of nothing more than new rap and hip hop lyrics set to the existing music of Don't You Want To Stay," Mattie Music is suing for damages and wants the hitmaker to stop using the song.
Though we still have to see how this pans out in court, we're sure Lamar would be fine with scratching an old track from his repertoire.
