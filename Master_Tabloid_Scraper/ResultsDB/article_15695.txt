 Robin Williams’ Life Was Scarred By Drugs And Booze—Star Was Haunted By Pal John Belushi’s.../n
The drug overdose of his close friend John Belushi haunted Robin Williams.
According to the new issue of The National ENQUIRER, Williams, who committed suicide, battled alcohol and drug problems throughout his life—and was deeply shaken by Belushi’s cocaine and heroin overdose.

The Saturday Night Live comedian was found dead at age 33 due to the drug combination known as a “speedball” at the Chateau Marmont in Hollywood on March 5, 1982.
Cathy Evelyn Smith admitted in a famous ENQUIRER interview that she had given Belushi the fatal speedball shot. She later served fifteen months in prison for involuntary manslaughter.
“The Belushi tragedy was frightening,” Williams once shuddered to an interviewer. “His death scared a lot of show business people.”

Williams’ own life was scarred by drugs and booze in the 1980s before he got clean on his own. But his sobriety didn’t last; the Mrs. Doubtfire funnyman checked into rehab in 2006 and again this past June.
A National ENQUIRER source said he fell off the wagon in 2006 by opening a mini-bar in a hotel room and drinking all the liquor in sight.
“I thought I could handle one drink,” he told a pal. “The next thing I knew, I drank all the liquor in the minibar.”

Williams checked in to the Hazelden rehab center in Minnesota, but sadly, he couldn’t dodge his demons and hanged himself at age 63.
