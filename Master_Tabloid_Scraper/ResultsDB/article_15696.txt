 Radar Told You First! ‘Dance Moms’ Star Abby Lee Miller Admits Engagement To Michael.../n
Abby Lee Miller may have recently boasted about her engagement to sexy communications specialist Michael Padula — but now she’s eating her words.
When hosts Chuck Nice and Dr. Evelyn Minaya congratulated the controversial Dance Moms star, 47, about her impending nuptials on Veria Living TV Network’s The Juice this afternoon, she immediately attempted to quiet the crowd’s applause.

“No, wait, wait, wait, just let me explain,” the reality star said. “My mother was very ill, and she just passed away . . . I just think it was a comfort thing for her to know there was somebody.”
Miller’s mother, dance teacher Maryen, died in February at age 86 after a long battle with colon cancer.
“I don’t even have a ring yet,” she confessed.

As RadarOnline.com exclusively reported, the hunky Padula, 33, has been very active in Los Angeles’ gay community
in recent years: He competed in a gay ballroom competition held by the National Gay Dance Council of America in 2008, and three years later, attended many events for the SoCal Social Club, an LGBT networking organization.
“She could know about Michael and just be engaged to him for attention,” a source suggested to Radar earlier this month.
