These Stars Skipped The Oscars To Rally Behind Flint, Michigan!/n

While most A-listers were gathering in El Lay for the Oscars on Sunday night, other celebs decided to skip the awards ceremony and rally behind Flint, Michigan.
Good on 'em!!
Creed director Ryan Coogler put on the "Justice for Flint" event hosted by comedian Hannibal Buress. Other stars in attendance were Ava DuVernay and Jesse Williams, who were among those to enjoy incredible performances by Janelle Monae and Stevie Wonder.
The event aimed to raise $100,000 for the community affected by the terrible water contamination crisis — and as of right now, they've exceeded that goal by $50,000! Woo!

Not to worry, there's no drama here. Coogler said the Academy Awards had nothing to do with the fundraiser being held the same day — but instead to honor Black History Month. He told Buzzfeed:
"With the #JUSTICEFORFLINT benefit event we will give a voice to the members of the community who were the victims of the choices of people in power who are paid to protect them, as well as provide them with a night of entertainment, unity, and emotional healing."
Other celebs like Diddy and Michael B. Jordan took to social media in support:
