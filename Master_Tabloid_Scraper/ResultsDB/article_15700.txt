Michelle Rodriguez Is Playing A Transgender Assassin In A New Film And People Are Pissed!/n

When will Hollywood finally learn…
As we reported, Mark Ruffalo received a lot of heat on social media when he casted Matt Bomer as a transgender sex worker in his upcoming film Anything. Many felt an actual trans woman should have been cast in the role instead of a cisgender actor.
Sadly, another film that portrays a trans character is coming out, and people are NOT happy.
In the new film (Re) Assignment, Michelle Rodriguez plays a male assassin who turns into a woman by a rogue doctor.

First off, many are angry that Rodriguez's character is FORCED to undergo sex-reassignment surgery, which makes it seem like the procedure is a punishment.
Similar with Anything, the film has a cisgender actress portraying a role that could've gone to someone who is actually transgender.
On social media, thousands are demanding a boycott of the film. As seen on Instagram:

The picture (above) is presumably of Rodriguez's character before the surgery. Many are deeming this as an example of "trans face". 
On Twitter, users are saying:

We just hope the trans community will one day get the representation they deserve!
