Now, there's no way for us to know what Miz Obama was taking a puff of, but tabloids are saying it's marijuana. Regardless of whether the Harvard-bound girl was taking a drag of a cigarette or a joint, people are ready to drag the 18-year-old AND the entire First Family over the incident:

Malia Obama is living in the people's house, supported by we the people. Her parents need to get a grip on her for being so disrespectful.

However, the teen is seeing tons of support from people on Twitterâ€¦ including Meghan McCain!
That's right! The daughter of John McCain â€” AKA Barack's 2008 presidential rival â€” is actually backing Malia!
She posted:

It's really not a big deal for Malia Obama to be smoking weed but her friends are TRASH for posting a video that shows her doing it

I don't care if Malia Obama is smoking cigarettes, or smoking pot. I don't care if she's licking toads, for God's sake. Let her be a teen.

Sigh, leave Malia Obama alone. She's growing up, gracefully. I won't even share the link.
