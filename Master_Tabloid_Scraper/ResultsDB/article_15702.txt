Juma The Jaguar Shot Dead By Soldiers After Rio Olympics Torch Ceremony/n

This is so awful!
A jaguar was shot dead in Manaus, Brazil on Monday after attempting to escape following a torch lighting ceremony en route to the Olympics in Rio.
17-year-old Juma was brought out of her military-run zoo habitat for the event, along with a sibling, because they are the mascots of Brazil's Olympic team.

When the torch passed by the zoo, handlers brought the cats out to be photographed. Shortly after, as she was being moved, Juma attempted to escape.
Soldiers tried to put her down with four tranquilizer darts, but they took too long to take effect. When Juma turned on one of the zoo's veterinarians, she was shot dead. Colonel Luiz Gustavo Evelyn said: 

"To protect the handler, it was sacrificed."

The military says they are investigating the incident further.
RIP, Juma.
