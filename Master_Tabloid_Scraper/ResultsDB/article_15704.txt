That's not to say the original Barbie won't still exist because she will, but kids will finally have the option to choose otherwise!!
And how fab do they look??
The three body types also feature different skin tones and hair, just like the original. Obviously there is a lot more to do, but it's a pleasant surprise seeing them with more realist bodies.
Evelyn Mazzocco, global SVP at Barbie, admitted: 
"Yes, some people will say we are late to the game. But changes at a huge corporation take time."
The dolls are available for pre-order right now exclusively on Mattel's site for $9.99 each.
Richard Dickson, president and COO of Mattel, revealed:
"Ultimately, haters are going to hate. We want to make sure the Barbie lovers love us more—and perhaps changing the people who are negative to neutral. That would be nice."
Additionally, Barbie revealed the reasoning behind their evolution:
