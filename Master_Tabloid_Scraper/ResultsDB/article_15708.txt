“People think walls separate us, but they also protect us. Those people out there kept us in a cage for 200 years. That is not someone I want to engage with.” 
Evelyn (Naomi Watts) utters these foretelling words to Four (Theo James) in the new trailer for The Divergent Series: Allegiant, and you know not all is well in (and out) of the walled-Chicago.

Shailene Woodley’s heroine Tris, Four and their group of friends (played by Zoë Kravitz, Miles Teller and Ansel Elgort) venture outside of the wall, where they are taken in by the Bureau of Genetic Welfare, helmed by Jeff Daniels’ character David.
The Bureau is basically riddled with new truths and threats against humanity as they know it (see trailer above for said commotion).
Allegiant, out in theaters on March 18, 2016, is the third film in the Divergent series. The first, Divergent, came out in 2014. Divergent’s sequel, Insurgent, was released earlier this year and the fourth and final film, Ascendent, is set to be released in March 2017.
The Divergent film franchise is an adaptation of the best-selling young adult novels by Veronica Roth.
Allegiant also stars Octavia Spencer, Maggie Q, Ray Stevenson, Bill Skarsgard, and more.
