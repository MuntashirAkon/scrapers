New mom Carey Mulligan shared her thoughts on women’s rights in a new interview.
Since giving birth, Carey says she’s hardly had any time to reflect on life as a new mom. She and Marcus Mumford welcomed their daughter, Evelyn, earlier this month, and Carey is already back hard at work promoting her new film, Suffragette, with Meryl Streep.
After this, the 30-year-old actress told E! News she’s taking a bit of a break and doesn’t have any projects planned so that she can focus on being a new mom.
However, Mulligan did have time to share her thoughts on women’s rights, since her new film concerns the British women’s right to vote movement that took place in the 1800’s.

“I would say the biggest problem is education. I think there are 62 million girls denied an education today,” she told E! News. “That is the starting point for hope and having a life and for being empowered. If you have no education, you have no power.”
She continued by saying, “We still have 1 in 3 women experiencing sexual violence and only 22 percent of our parliaments are made up of women, so the imbalance is still massive. We’re definitely come a long way in the western world.”
