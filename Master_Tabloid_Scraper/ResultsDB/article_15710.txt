Unlike most of Hollywood, new parents Carey Mulligan and Marcus Mumford have given their newborn daughter a fairly normal name.

While attending the premiere of Suffragette, Mulligan, 30, revealed the name of her new baby and explained the surprisingly low-key way on how she picked the name with her Mumford & Sons frontman husband.
“[Her name is] Evelyn,” the actress told Entertainment Tonight. “[We] just came up with it.”
Previously, Mulligan confirmed she gave birth to a daughter on the The Graham Norton Show, saying, “It is a girl and she’s three weeks old.”
Though word of the parents expecting their first child together got out in June, Mulligan and Mumford, 28, never confirmed the pregnancy until after their baby was born. A source told E! News at the time, “Carey has given birth to a healthy and happy baby. She is just enjoying this time with her family and close friends.”
