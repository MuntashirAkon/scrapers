Johnny Depp Talks ‘Transcendence’ In Our Exclusive Clip/n
Johnny Depp’s latest, Transcendence, comes to DVD/blu-ray this week and to celebrate we’ve got an exclusive clip from the film’s special features for you. In the clip, Depp, alongside co-stars Kate Mara, and Cillian Murphy, discusses what the movie means to him.
“This film will force people to ask questions: how far should any of it go?” Depp says. “That kind of intelligence in the wrong hands could be quite devastating.”
Transcendence is the story of Dr. Will Caster (Depp), who dies following an attack by anti-artificial intelligence terrorists. His wife, Evelyn Caster (Rebecca Hall) is able to upload her husband’s mind onto the internet where he continues to exist in an increasingly all-knowing state. Whether or not that is a good thing is the central debate of the film. Transcendence is out on DVD and blu-ray tomorrow.
