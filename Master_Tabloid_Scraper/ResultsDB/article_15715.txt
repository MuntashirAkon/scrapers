 When it comes to celebrity sightings, Wimbledon is always a treat.
Stars get dressed up, look for their coolest pair of shades and sit in the privacy of Royal Boxes to watch tennis players sweat it out on the court.
This year, Hugh Jackman showed up to his assigned seat in full Blackbeard mode. The 45-year-old, who’s currently filming the new Peter Man movie Pan, was just one of many famous faces spotted at Sunday’s Gentlemen’s final match between Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer.

Speaking of gentlemen, blue suits were all the rage at this year’s championship. Jude Law, James Righton (who attended with wife Keira Knightley), Prince William and Jim Parsons were all spotted in similar shades of navy.
As for the ladies, it was a showdown between spring patterns and solids, but Kate Middleton easily won hearts with her Evelyn dress by Jonathan Saunders. (Fans of the Duchess of Cambridge will recall that she first wore the frock in 2012 when she visited the Solomon Islands for the Diamond Jubilee Tour).
