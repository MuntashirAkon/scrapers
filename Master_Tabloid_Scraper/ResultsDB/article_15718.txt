Evelyn Lozada, star of the VH1 reality series Basketball Wives LA, opened up during a cohosting appearance on The Real and revealed she recently had three miscarriages.
The 40-year-old is a mother of two children, Shaniece Hairston, 23, and Carl Leo Crawford, 2, but was candid on the talk show — which will air Monday — about struggling to have another baby and wishing she’d frozen her eggs.
“You know, I didn’t think to do that,” Lozada says in a clip exclusive to PEOPLE. “So, now, I’m struggling with trying to have another one. I had three miscarriages in the last year and a half. So, fast forward, you don’t really realize how quickly your body changes.”
The reality star is in engaged to her son’s father, former Los Angeles Dodgers player Carl Crawford, 35, with whom she has been in a relationship with since 2013.
While conceiving again may not be easy for Lozada, she does have other things to look forward to, such as her highly-anticipated return to Basketball Wives, which she also revealed on the show.
“I know what everyone is thinking, ‘Is she going crazy? This is her going backwards,'” she said. “We just really want to change the direction of the show. We really want to add substance and depth to the show.”
