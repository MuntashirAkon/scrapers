Evelyn Lozada Is Engaged to Carl Crawford/n
Evelyn Lozada definitely had a Christmas to remember – the Basketball Wives star became engaged to Carl Crawford.  
The reality star, who’s expecting a baby with the Los Angeles Dodgers player, posted a picture of her huge diamond engagement ring on Instagram on Wednesday along with one word: “YES!”  
“I’m overjoyed and in complete and utter shock!” Lozada, 37, tells PEOPLE. “What a different year and a half it has been – I’m truly happy!”   
Her rep tells PEOPLE that Lozada, who announced her pregnancy in November, “wasn’t expecting a proposal at all,” and when Crawford got down on one knee on Christmas Day “it took Evelyn by surprise.”  
Lozada, who divorced Chad “Ochocinco” Johnson in 2012 after just two months of marriage, loves her new ring, and who could blame her? It’s some rock!  
The 14.5-carat diamond ring was made especially for her by Jason Arasheben, CEO of Jason of Beverly Hills.   
“Carl has been a longtime client of mine and I knew immediately that he was really smitten and in love and wanted to make a statement that would light up the Christmas tree as well as the bride-to-be,” Arasheben tells PEOPLE.

Crawford was involved in designing the ring and looked at 10 or 15 stones before picking one and then he took his time finding the perfect mounting. Arasheben (who also designed Gabrielle Union’s engagement ring) delivered the precious jewelry to Crawford in Arizona and says “his face just lit up when he saw it. You could tell they’re very much in love. He was excited and nervous.”  
“HappiestGirlInTheWorld,” the bride-to-be posted along with another pic of the ring.
