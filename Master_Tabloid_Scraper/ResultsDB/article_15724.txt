Evelyn Lozada: My Marriage to Chad Johnson Can't Be Repaired/n
Is Chad Johnson – formerly known as Chad Ochocinco– hoping to reconcile with his estranged wife Evelyn Lozada?  
After his arrest on Aug. 11 for allegedly head-butting Lozada, the former Miami Dolphins player recently showed off a new tattoo of Lozada’s face on his leg. When a Twitter user mentioned the tattoo and Lozada’s filing for a divorce, Johnson responded, “Divorce? Child please… that’s my WIFE.” To another user, he wrote, “I don’t give a flying pretzel in skittle rainbow hell what she filed for.”  
But Lozada is adamant that their relationship is over. “You can’t repair this,” Lozada told PEOPLE exclusively last week. “Not right now. You just can’t.” 
After the Aug. 11 incident, Lozada went to the hospital for stitches, and Johnson spent a night in jail for simple domestic battery. An upcoming reality show starring the couple, Ev and Ocho, was canceled by VH1, and his contract with the Dolphins was also scrapped.

“I would like to apologize to everyone for the recent events that have occurred,” he wrote on his website. “I would like to wish Evelyn well and will never say anything bad about her because I truly love her to death.”  
And while Lozada admits that she’ll “always have love” for her husband of 41 days, she can’t see them working things out in the future.  
“This is something you should never tolerate,” says Lozada, who hopes to inspire victims of domestic abuse to get help. “I don’t care what the situation is – or who the man is.”
