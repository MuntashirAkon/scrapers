Evelyn Lozada Hopes Chad Johnson (Ochocinco) 'Seeks Help' After Arrest, Mourns Brother-in-Law/n
Evelyn Lozada is speaking out.  
Following Saturday’s domestic violence incident involving the Basketball Wives cast member and husband Chad Johnson (formerly Ochocinco), she told Entertainment Tonight, “I am deeply disappointed that Chad has failed to take responsibility for his actions and made false accusations against me.”   
Johnson was taken into police custody Saturday after he allegedly head-butted Lozada, who was treated for a “pretty good sized” laceration at a nearby hospital, Davie, Fla., police Cpt. Dale Engle told NFL.com over the weekend.

But the football player originally told authorities it was Lozada who head-butted him during the incident.   
“It is my sincere hope that he seeks the help he needs to overcome his troubles,” she said. “Domestic violence is not okay, and hopefully my taking a stand will help encourage other women to break their silence as well.”  
It has been a difficult week for Lozada, who is also mourning the death of her brother-in-law, Anthony Ochoa, who died Monday after battling cancer.   
Ochoa, 43, who was married to Lozada’s sister, Sylvia, escorted Lozada down the aisle during her July 4 wedding to Johnson last month.  
“Anthony was an amazing husband, father, and brother-in-law. He will be dearly missed,” Lozada told TMZ.
Since Johnson’s arrest, he has been cut from the Miami Dolphins and the couple’s VH1 reality show, Ev and Ocho, has also been canceled.
