Evelyn/n
Has 007 traded in his shaken, not stirred martinis for a warm pint of ale? Nope, that's just the charming Pierce Brosnan playing a pub-loving, down-on-his-Irish luck dad in this true story about a war over the custody of his children. The tear-jerking is as predictable as Robert's Rules of Order. Brosnan gathers up a killer legal team (Stephen Rea, Aidan Quinn, Alan Bates) and takes his case all the way to the Irish Supreme Court for a precedent-setting trial in 1953.

 Brosnan shows us that he can go deeper than Bond, while the adorable Sophie Vavasseur--she's his cutesy daughter, Evelyn--keeps the mugging to a minimum. Our verdict? An okay, heartwarming time.
