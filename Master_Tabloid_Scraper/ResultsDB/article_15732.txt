Chad Johnson and Evelyn Lozada's two-month marriage is officially over.E! News has confirmed that a Florida judge signed the couple's divorce papers early this morning.Per Johnson's attorney Adam Swickle, the hearing was "very quick" and "very procedural." It only lasted "three to five minutes" and neither Johnson nor Lozada were in attendance.

While Lozada filed for divorce back in August after Johnson was arrested for allegedly assaulting her, it took the NFL star another month to give in and file his response.

Johnson, formerly known as Ochocinco, married the Basketball Wives star July 4 in a lavish ceremony. Their nuptials were chronicled in their short-lived VH1 reality show Ev and Ocho. VH1 promptly canceled the show after Johnson, 34, allegedly head-butted his wife of one month on Aug. 11.Lozado began divorce proceedings two days after the alleged incident. Johnson, contrarily, got a tattoo of his estranged wife's face.

Although Johnson didn't directly address the divorce on Twitter Wednesday, he did post a dapper Instagram shot of himself smiling with the caption "Love Never Look So Good."Lozada also took to Twitter after the divorce was finalized, tweeting: "Oh what a GREAT morning!!!"We wish them both the best.(Originally published Sept. 18, 2012, at 7:59 a.m. PT)
