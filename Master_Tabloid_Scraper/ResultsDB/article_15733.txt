Chad Johnson entered a plea of not guilty in a Florida courtroom on Thursday morning, less than 24 hours after charges were brought against him, E! News has learned.The State Attorney's Office in Broward County, Fla., had charged Johnson (aka Chad Ochocinco) yesterday with misdemeanor battery stemming from his domestic-violence arrest last month when he allegedly got physical with his now-estranged wife, Evelyn Lozada.If convicted, the former Miami Dolphins wide receiver could face up to a year behind bars.

Johnson was not at the hearing this morning, as his plea was entered in by his attorney, Adam Swickle."We continue to work diligently on the case with the state attorney's office, and we have been exchanging all evidence in the case," Swickle told E! News.Swickle added that Johnson is "doing well, considering the circumstance," and noted that "he always lands back on his feet."A status conference has been scheduled for Oct. 31.
