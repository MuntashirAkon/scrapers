Bruce Willis is still man of the house!The actor and his wife, Emma Heming, welcomed daughter Evelyn Penn in L.A. Monday, E! News confirms. The newborn weighed 8 lbs., 10oz. "Both mother and baby are healthy and doing beautifully," a rep for the couple says. Willis, 59, and Hemming, 35, got married in 2009. They have another daughter, Mabel Ray. Per the rep, the 2-year-old "is delighted to have a new baby sister."Heming's pregnancy was first reported in December 2013. Willis has three more daughters—Rumer Willis, 25, Scout Willis, 22, and Tallulah Willis, 20—with his ex-wife, actress Demi Moore, 51.How does the Die Hard star feel about being surrounded by so many women? "It's all good. I haven't found a time yet that's bad," he said in the summer of 2013. "I get to learn a lot more about women than most men do—because it's just me and 20 women around me."

Congratulations to the happy family!
