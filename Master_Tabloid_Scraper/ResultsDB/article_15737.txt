This wasn't the news we wanted to hear.Just one week after Evelyn Lozada revealed she was pregnant with her third child, the former Basketball Wives star shared some heartbreaking news on her new OWN reality show.Based on the low level of her hormones, Lozada would end up miscarrying around the six-week pregnancy mark."I feel like when something tragic like this happens, I've always learned that there is something better to come and I guess that's what I hold onto," she shared on Saturday's new episode of Livin' Lozada. "That it just wasn't meant to be." 

The OWN star and fiancé Carl Crawford are already proud parents to a baby boy named Leo. Lozada also has Shaniece from a previous relationship.Throughout the ups and downs, Lozada simply hopes that her story can bring comfort to other women who have experienced similar situations."Getting the news that my hormone levels dropped was/is devastating! Hardest thing ever!" she wrote on Twitter. "Thank you to everyone who tuned in!! It's a true blessing to share my life, my new beginning and all that it encompasses."Livin' Lozada airs Saturday nights at 9 p.m. only on OWN.
