Chad Johnson -- I Can't Pay Baby Mama Because I Make No $$$/n "At least you're not Chad Johnson " might be something people say soon ... because on top of being a wanted man, TMZ has learned the former NFL star's finances are sinking faster than his career.Chad filed new court docs as part of an ongoing battle with one of his baby mamas, Andrea Pearson, asking a judge to lower his $5,420 per month child support payments because he claims can't afford it. In the docs, Chad says he agreed to that number back in March 2012, when he was a successful NFL star. He says he now  "finds himself without a contract and without a team. Simply [I am] unemployed. "He also says, at such a late stage in his career, it is CERTAIN he will never make the kind of cash he once did. The news is a far cry from his money days ... in 2012, Chad claimed he raked in $66k per monthâ€‹. But he got released from the Dolphins in August after his head butting arrest and his endorsement deals dropped like flies. As TMZ first reported, a warrant was issued for Chad's arrest on May for an alleged probation violation, also stemming from the domestic violence case. Hmmm ... where'd it all go wrong?/n
