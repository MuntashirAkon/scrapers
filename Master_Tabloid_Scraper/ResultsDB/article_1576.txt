Picks and Pans Review: Mattie Stepanek/n
LEGACY OF HOPE
Jeni Stepanek, 46, who has muscular dystrophy, lost all four children, including Mattie, author of the poetry series Heartsongs, to the disease. She has edited a new volume of Mattie’s work, Just Peace.
Since Mattie died in ’04 at 13, Jeni says, “I’m trying to embrace life the way he did.” Though physically weaker, “I feel his strength with me,” says Mattie’s mom.
