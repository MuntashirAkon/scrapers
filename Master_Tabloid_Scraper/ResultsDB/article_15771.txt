Awkward! Is THIS Procedure How Jonah Hill Lost All The Weight?/n
Jonah Hill has officially slimmed down, and sources say Leonardo DiCaprio may have been the pal who helped him do it!
Hollywood insiders have confessed to Straight Shuter that DiCaprio has been a big fan of Colonics for a while now, and was once a frequent customer at a wellness center on Spring Street in NYC.
Colonics – while uncomfortable – is a cleansing procedure that purifies the body and promotes weight loss while decreasing bloating.
Friends of Hill suspect A-list pal DiCaprio, 42, may have introduced him to the unusual routine.

Other sources close to Hill however have assured Radar that the star has been losing his extra pounds the old fashion way: by going to the gym.
As Radar previously reported, Hill has been looking fit on recent L.A. outings.
While the actor has often battled with weight loss, he’s now reportedly lost over 40 pounds!
In 2015, he shocked onlookers by appearing heavier than ever. But earlier this month, fans were amazed at the sight of the 33-year-old star’s trim and toned muscles.
