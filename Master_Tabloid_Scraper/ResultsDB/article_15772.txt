Tobey Maguire: Back In The Party Scene After Split From Jennifer/n
He’s partying like it’s 1999! Since Tobey Maguire ’s October 2016 split from wife of nine years,
Jennifer Meyer, the actor, who was a staple of the raucous Hollywood nightlife scene early in his career,
appears to be back to his old habits. Sources close to the star reveal that he’s out nearly every night of the week,
smooching random girls and hitting the clubs with old pal Leonardo DiCaprio —
behavior that could be troubling considering Tobey has previously claimed to be sober.
But on May 7, an eyewitness says the Spider-Man star looked like a mess at L.A.’s Delilah nightclub
following the MTV Movie & TV Awards. “He was with Leo, Lukas Haas and their old buddies
in a corner table near the smoking area,” shares the snitch.
“Tobey looked pretty rough. When the bar cleared out at 2 a.m., he was one of the last ones standing.”
Now friends worry that the actor, who hasn’t had a major on-screen role since 2014, may be falling off the wagon.
“He doesn’t seem to be in a good place,” shares a different source. “He could be having a midlife crisis. Someone needs to help him.” /n
