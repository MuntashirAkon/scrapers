The then secretary of state wrote, “I’m sitting in the Libya mtg, wondering what other shoe will drop.” Only a few months later, on September 11, 2012, Islamic militants attacked the American compound in Benghazi, Libya, killing four Americans.
Another email deals with Benghazi. Clinton wrote to her daughter’s alias, “Two of our officers were killed in Benghazi by an Al Queda-like group: The Ambassador, whom I handpicked and a young communications officer on temporary duty w a wife and two young children.”
Why exactly Chelsea decided to write her mother using a code name remains unclear.
