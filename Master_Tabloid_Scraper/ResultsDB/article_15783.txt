 Clinton Cash Map UNCOVERED! Find Out How Bill & Hillary Made $110M — But America.../n
Hillary Clinton has released her tax records, but she still could have some MAJOR financial secrets that she’s hiding from the American public! In an exhaustive special investigation, RadarOnline.com has uncovered the truth about Hillary and Bill‘s money train, including bombshell revelations on the following:
+How the career politicians made $110 million and pulled in much more to the Clinton Foundation
+Who paid for their over-the-top lifestyle
+And how foreign entities might have benefited!
The biggest concerns surround the Clinton Foundation, which took in millions from foreign donors over the years, including during Hillary’s time as Secretary of State. The Clintons have said they will stop accepting such donations if she is elected, but is it too little, too late?
Peter Schweizer, author of Clinton Cash, said, “I think the evidence is pretty clear they gave a lot of money. There’s also pretty clear evidence that favorable actions were taken on Hillary Clinton’s behalf — by her, for their benefit” following such donations.

In one instance, for example, a Swedish organization donated $26 million to the Clinton Foundation — despite the fact that Hillary’s State Department was considering sanctions against similar businesses for dealing with Iran! (Ultimately no companies were cited for wrongdoing.)
And in another, Proctor and Gamble won the prestigious Secretary of State’s Award for Excellence in 2011, after donating millions to the fund.
