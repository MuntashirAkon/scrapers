Scott Disick’s playboy ways are catching up to him.

The dad-of-three was caught lying to rumored girlfriend Ella Ross when the model walked in on his dinner date with Bella Thorne. According to E! News, Disick canceled his previously-scheduled date with Ross — telling her he had to attend a birthday party — for a chance to sit down with the Famous in Love star. When Ross showed up at West Hollywood hotspot Catch LA, she found Disick, 33, and Thorne, 19, sharing a candlelit meal-for-two.
Though an insider claims the two “didn’t interact,” you can only imagine how awkward it must’ve been to be caught in your own web of lies! (This also might’ve explained why Disick and Thorne made a quick dash to The Nice Guy soon after the dinner.)

However, Disick and Thorne’s attempt to dodge the British model was thwarted when the three of them went to The Peppermint Club that same night. A source told the publication Ross crossed paths with the pair when she rolled up to the live music lounge to party with Leonardo DiCaprio and a group of gal pals.
Thorne reportedly left with Disick around 1:30 a.m. in the back of his chauffeured car.
The awkward encounter follows news that Disick’s ex, Kourtney Kardashian, is casually dating 23-year-old model Younes Bendjima after meeting him in Paris last year.
Sounds like both of them have moved on for good!
