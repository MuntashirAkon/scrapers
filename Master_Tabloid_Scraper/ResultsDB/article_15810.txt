Melissa Leo made Academy Awards history tonight—and it was a shocker!Commenting on how intimidating it felt for the Best Supporting Actress winner (for The Fighter) to looking at the audience, she said last year the actors made it look "so f--king easy!"She only said it in front of a billon people, any second thoughts?

"I didn't mean to offend!," she yelled to me, when I congratulated Leo on carrying her profanity powered Fighter character to the podium, as well."There are a lotta words in the English vernacular," Melissa, glistening in white, stated, practically breathless in explanation. "But it wasn't appropriate."I told Leo I disagreed and found her very, very refreshing. After all, isn't ABC gunning for a younger audience?You guys swear like a mother!Right?
