Leo and Leo and the Critics' Choice Noms/n
 Can anybody beat Forest Whitaker? Leonardo DiCaprio has a better statistical shot than anyone at the 12th Annual Critics' Choice Awards, having received a pair of Best Actor nominations Tuesday. DiCaprio's in the running for adopting a South African accent in Blood Diamond. And DiCaprio's in the running for adopting a Boston accent in The Departed. Whitaker looms large with the lone nomination for The Last King of Scotland­­­—the movie about dictator Idi Amin that so far has brought Whitaker year-end plaudits from critics groups in New York, Los Angeles, Boston and Washington, D.C., as well as the National Board of Review. The Queen's Helen Mirren has been just as unbeatable as Whitaker, likewise earning honors from all the major critics groups. Critics' Choice voters were no less impressed with Mirren, nominating the Brit in what has become her own personal category, Best Actress. Among films, the mob-friendly The Departed, the multilingual Babel, the quirky Little Miss Sunshine and the splashy Dreamgirls led the way with seven nods each. Unlike the other top critics groups, which announce short-and-sweet slates of winners, the Broadcast Film Critics Association (the outfit behind the Critics' Choice Awards) slots more than 100 nominees across 19 categories, offering the season's first potential preview of the overall Oscar race. All of this is good news for Ben Affleck, who generated loads of Academy Award buzz for stepping into George Reeves' woolen Superman tights in Hollywoodland but had nothing to show for it—until Tuesday. Now, per the Critics' Choice announcement, he's officially a Best Supporting Actor nominee. Jack Nicholson, Will Smith, Meryl Streep and Eddie Murphy are other big names who made their biggest splashes of the award-show season via the Critics' Choice nominations. Nicholson, noted for being a good bad guy in The Departed, and Murphy, noted for being James Brown-esque in Dreamgirls, will go up against Affleck in the Best Supporting Actor race. The other nominees: Little Miss Sunshine's Alan Arkin, Flags of Our Fathers' Adam Beach and Blood Diamond's Djimon Hounsou. Smith, who pursues the heartstrings in The Pursuit of Happyness, is in the Best Actor game opposite Whitaker, DiCaprio and...DiCaprio. Ryan Gosling, lauded as the crack-addict teacher in Half Nelson, and seven-time Oscar loser Peter O'Toole, lauded as the aged thespian in Venus, round out the field. Streep, who went gray and scary in The Devil Wears Prada, is in the Best Actress race opposite Mirren. Also there: Volver's Penélope Cruz, Notes on a Scandal's Judi Dench and Little Children's Kate Winslet. The Best Supporting Actress field is led by Jennifer Hudson, the odds-on Oscar favorite for Dreamgirls, and Catherine O'Hara, who has her supporters (and an NBR win) for the spoof For Your Consideration. Also nominated: Mexican actress Adriana Barraza and Japanese actress Rinko Kukuchi, both for Babel; Cate Blanchett for Notes on a Scandal; and Emma Thompson for playing the novelist out to get Will Ferrell in Stranger Than Fiction.   Elsewhere: Clint Eastwood picked up a Best Director nod for the Japanese-troops flick Letters from Iwo Jima, but not for the American-troops flick Flags of Our Fathers; Letters from Iwo Jima picked up a Best Picture nod and a Best Foreign-Language Film nod; Borat picked up a Best Comedy Movie nomination, but not an acting nomination for star Sacha Baron Cohen; and the Will Smith family picked up a second nomination—via a Best Young Actor nod—for Jaden Christopher Syre Smith, the elder Smith's eight-year-old son and Pursuit of Happyness costar. The Critics' Choice Awards are scheduled to be presented Jan. 12. E! will broadcast the show on Jan. 20. (E! Online and E! Entertainment Television are divisions of E! Networks.)
