Crowe Caught in Leo's Lies/n
Russell Crowe will be the brains behind Leonardo DiCaprio's next clandestine mission.The New Zealand-born Australia resident is set to join the cast of the upcoming Ridley Scott-directed terrorist thriller Body of Lies, playing a CIA boss who formulates a risky plot for DiCaprio's journalist-turned-government agent to ensnare an Al Qaeda leader in the Middle East.Shooting on Body of Lies, based on the David Ignatius novel, is set to kick off this fall. DiCaprio signed up for the job in April and the crew had reportedly been trying to enlist Crowe ever since. This will be the fourth team effort for Crowe and Scott, who directed the actor in the Oscar-winning Gladiator, in the largely panned A Good Year and in the upcoming American Gangster, which at least seems promising and is finally slated to unspool Nov. 2 after almost not getting made in the first place. Crowe plays a New York detective itching to take down Denzel Washington's Harlem drug lord in the based-on-a-true-story drama, which sifted through multiple leading men, directors and script revisions for about four years before hitting on the winning combo.Scott and Crowe will collaborate again early next year for the Robin Hood-inspired Nottingham, with Crowe as the title sheriff.Body of Lies, meanwhile, will be Scott's third go-round with Oscar-winning scribe William Monahan, who picked up a little gold man earlier this year for his work on The Departed. The writer penned Scott's previous flicks Kingdom of Heaven and the still in pre-pre-production Tripoli. Before any lies are told, bodies buried or bad guys unmasked, Crowe will be on the big screen in the Western drama 3:10 to Yuma, costarring Christian Bale, which hits theaters Oct. 5.
