While Leonardo DiCapriocelebrated at the Vanity Fair party for his Best Actor win at the 2016 Oscars, his fans in Mexico were having quite a celebration of their own!Mexico won big on Oscars night, Mexicans Alejandro González Iñárritu and Emmanuel Lubezki broke records and took home gold. Oddly enough, however, the biggest celebration was for DiCaprio. Several hundred fans gathered at Mexico City's Angel of Independence monument to celebrate The Revenant star's highly anticipated win. The celebration included signs with the 41-year-old actor's name and chants of "Leo, hermano, ya eres Mexicano" (Leo, brother, you're Mexican now). Best of all, fans had masks with DiCaprio's face and plastic gold awards. They even had an acceptance speech from a fake Leo.
