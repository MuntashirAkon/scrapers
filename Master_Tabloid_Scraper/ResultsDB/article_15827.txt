Leonardo DiCaprio and Tobey Maguire Add Orlando Bloom to the Wolf Pack/nIt's not next season's 'Bachelorette' cast ... it's just Leo DiCaprio, Tobey Maguire and Orlando Bloom kicking it in NYC. NBD.  We're used to seeing BFFs Leo and Tobey hang out, but Wednesday afternoon Orlando was suddenly part of the crew. No word where the trio was headed, but there's a good chance they had a trail of female fans following. Tobey and Leo's group of friends have been known as the  "P***y Posse " for years ... so adding Orlando is like the Golden State Warriors adding Kevin Durant. Oh, the slaying they will do./n
