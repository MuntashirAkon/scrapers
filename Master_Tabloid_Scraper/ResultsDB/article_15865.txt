Protestors Head To Times Square Against Donald Trump's Transgender Military Service Ban!/n

The people are fighting back!
As we reported, on Wednesday, Donald Trump released a statement on Twitter where he announced transgender individuals will no longer be allowed to serve in the military.
Later that day, a couple hundred of protestors gathered outside the U.S. Army Career Center in Times Square to denounce the President's latest discriminatory policy. Many held up signs that read "Resist!"

Several organizations — including Equality New York, GLAAD, and the New York Civil Liberties Union — made their presence known at the demonstration. 
U.S. Army veteran and trans woman Tanya Walker told the crowd:

″It is our duty to fight… It is our duty to win. We must love each other and protect each other."

Jacqueline Swannick, trans woman and former Army medic, told the Huffington Post: 

"Transgender people should be able to serve just like everyone… It sends a very bad message that we're not equal to other Americans."

Marches were also held in San Francisco and Portland.
Ch-ch-check out the pics from the protest (below)!
