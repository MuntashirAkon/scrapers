James Blunt Says Ed Sheeran Straight Up LIED About Getting His Face Cut By Princess Beatrice! WTF??/n

Is Ed Sheeran just dropping "alternative facts" on us??
Back in January, the ginger singer opened up about BEING opened up by a sword swung by Princess Beatrice last year.
The way Ed told it, the Princess had accidentally swung her sword too far back while performing a mock knighting ceremony on James Blunt at a party.

But now James is saying Ed's Lego House is made of lies!
In a new interview with Shortlist, the Beautiful singer says the whole thing was something they jokingly made up but that Ed decided to run with it in the press: 

"Ed was drunk, messing around, and he cut himself. We made a fancy story up; people fell for it. It was very embarrassing."
WHAT?? But we've seen the cut! You can STILL see it! So which part was a lie?

"All of it. Apart from the actual scar. It's bizarre that people fell for it. I blame him. He must be desperate – he's trying to sell records."
Seriously? That's pathological!

When asked if they were even really at a party together when it happened, James said:

"Yeah, but I didn't do it! He cut himself and I just patched him up. It's made him look prettier."
Hmm. James has been known to mess with people — maybe this is just his crazy sense of humor?
Because we can't imagine a reason for Ed to lie; it seems like something that could be so easily disproven, by say, the sword-wielding Royal??
What do YOU think? Is Teddy lying or not??
