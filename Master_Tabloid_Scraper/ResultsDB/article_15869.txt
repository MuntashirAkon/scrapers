Ed Sheeran Opens Up About 'Doubling In Size' During His Year-Long Hiatus & Reveals How He Lost 50 Lbs.!/n

When Ed Sheeran decided to take a break from the industry after his tour, he didn't realize how it would actually affect his body.
Even though the 25-year-old spent his year-long hiatus doing things like whitewater rafting, swimming with bull sharks without a cage, and bungee jumping around the world â€” he also admits he "doubled in size," and was forced to drop 50 pounds (whoa!) before he made his highly-anticipated return.

During an interview with The Breakfast Club this week, the Shape of You singer reveals: 
"I doubled in size. Sweatpants were the only things that fit and I thought everything had shrunk in the wash, but it hadn't."

As a result, the Thinking Out Loud crooner decided to make a couple lifestyle changes (AKA ditch the beer and start exercising) to get back on track:
"It was the beer. Well, I'm back on beer now, because I'm fine, but I cut out beer for a bit and started exercising which was quite weird. I didn't realize how much I burned on stage. I stopped touring and I just ballooned instantly."
That totally makes sense. Bravo!
Listen to Ed talk about his travels and his plans for the future in the full interview (below)!!

We're so happy to have him back!
