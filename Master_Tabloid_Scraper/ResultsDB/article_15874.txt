The Duchess stole the show at the royal service!

Kate Middleton, her husband Prince William and brother-in-law Prince Harry attended a special service at St. Paul’s Cathedral in London today (June 10, 2016) to formally commemorate Queen Elizabeth II’s 90th birthday.
The Duchess of Cambridge chose a regal, pale blue dress by Catherine Walker for the event. She also wore her hair in a loose bun under a white pillbox hat.
The trio were joined at the event by Prince Charles and Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie of York, and Prime Minister David Cameron.
