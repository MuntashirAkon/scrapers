Who Wore It Best: Lady Gaga vs. Princess Beatrice/n
Last night, Lady Gaga promoted ARTPOP in London, looking like one of the many gilded sculptures that grace the city.
Her golden head piece and 70s get-up were a hit with yours truly, but one couldn’t help but draw comparisons to another young lady’s eccentric accessory.
Upon first sight of the photo, I thought “Philip Treacy Fallopian Toilet Set Hat!”   Translation: The hat Princess Beatrice wore to Will and Kate’s wedding in April 2011.

If we were to pick our favorites, I’d go with Gaga’s masterpiece.   Besides, the Princess has Treacy on her side.
The milliner told the Observer in 2011 that “there was a little bit of bullying going on,” regarding Beatrice’s head piece. “I didn’t give a f*** about 140,000 bloggers. In the future, we’ll look back and think she looked wild.”
Here, here!
Which one do you pick?  Gaga’s gold or Bea’s fallopian tube?
