Prince George To Be Christened At The Chapel Royal, St. James Palace/n
Kensington Palace announced today that HRH Prince George of Cambridge will be christened at The Chapel Royal, St. James Palace on Wednesday, October 23rd.
The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby will perform the private service.

According to royal reporter Victoria Arbiter, Princess Beatrice, Lord Frederick Windsor and his sister, Lady Gabriella Windsor were all christened at The Chapel Royal.
Both Prince Charles and Prince William were christened in Buckingham Palace’s music room.  Prince Harry was christened at St. George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle.  According to Arbiter, the Queen was christened in a private chapel inside Buckingham Palace, while her father’s took place at Sandringham.
It’s understood that Prince George will wear a replica of the original Honiton lace and satin christening gown created for Queen Victoria’s eldest daughter in 1841, worn by Queen Elizabeth, William and other members of the current royal family.  However, it was deemed too delicate to be worn again after Lady Louise Windsor’s 2004 christening, so The Queen then had a replica commissioned for future use, according to HELLO!
Th night before her funeral at Westminster Abbey, Diana’s casket rested in The Chapel Royal.
