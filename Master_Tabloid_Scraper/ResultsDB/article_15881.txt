Bradley Cooper Has Eclipsed Philip Treacy and Become Our Generation’s Greatest Avant-Garde Milliner/n
Some headwear — such as Lady Gaga’s hair bow or Princess Beatrice’s toilet seat hat — is iconic. Other headwear — such as Bradley Cooper’s blue shirt hat — ascends beyond icon status to a level all its own. Some captions are like that too:

“‘Undercover’ for a new movie!” – Stephanie
“I’m to sexy for my shirt so sexy it hurts!!!” – Leah
“Preparing for my next role as sexy smurf” – Romi
“will i pass as an avatar” – Lyndal
“I don’t remember signing up for Hangover 4.” – Lady Lookout
Congrats to our winners! Visit our Facebook page for a new Caption Contest each and every weekday!
