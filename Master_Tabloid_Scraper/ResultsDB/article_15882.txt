Prince Andrew And Fergie: Why That Marriage Rumor Might Be True/n
When the Daily Express spotted Sarah, Duchess of York deplaning in Aberdeen en route for Balmoral Castle, I knew in an instant that Fergie was making her way back into the royal fold. 
The report was published on August 11th, just one day before Prince Philip was to join Her Majesty at their Scottish retreat.  Ferguson, who divorced Prince Andrew in 1996, has been persona non grata in the royal family for a string of reasons: Getting her toes sucked by a financial advisor while her eldest daughter was nearby, attempting to sell information on her ex-husband to an undercover journalist.  The list goes on and on, but the fact remains that Fergie hasn’t been warmly received by the House of Windsor in quite some time.
It should be said, though, that the Queen reportedly still likes Fergie, but the Duke of Edinburgh wants absolutely nothing to do with her.  In 2011, Fergie told Harper’s Bazaar that the monarch as “the most wonderful, forgiving, nonjudgmental person I know.”
I spoke to Royal Central’s editor-in-chief, who believes that there is a good reason that Fergie was seen at Balmoral.  Princess Beatrice, 25, has been dating her boyfriend, David Clark, for over five years, and it’s believed that an engagement announcement is forthcoming.  Since Beatrice needs the Queen’s permission to marry, it would make sense that the York family gathered together in Scotland.
