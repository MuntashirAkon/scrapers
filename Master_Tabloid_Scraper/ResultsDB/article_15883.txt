Sarah Jessica Parker is Fabulous in Flapper at the Serpentine Gallery Summer Party/n
Looks like SJP borrowed a look from Daisy Buchanan’s closet.
On Wednesday, Sarah Jessica Parker sparkled in a flapper dress as she hit the red carpet for Serpentine Gallery Summer Party in London. The 48-year-old actress was joined by her hubby Matthew Broderick, who kept things dapper in a light grey suit.
Other big names at the gathering, co-hosted by L’Wren Scott, included Matthew Morrison, Naomi Campbell, Kate Moss, Alice Eve and Princess Beatrice.
The night before, SJP, Broderick and their son James got all dressed up for the press night performance of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, also in London.
But let’s get back to that flapper dress. Launch the gallery, above, for more shimmery fashion goodness.
