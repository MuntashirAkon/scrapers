We know anytime Princess Beatrice shows up in public with a hat on her head, the Fashion Police put themselves on high alert. But this is one instance in which they can stand down.Because this time around, the royal cousin of Princes William and Harry traded in her style monstrosity fascinator for a piece of headwear that should be congratulated rather than ridiculed: a graduation cap!

The  23-year-old matriculated from the University of London's  Goldsmiths  College this morning with a degree in history and, rather  fancifully  sounding, history of ideas, while her father Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, and mother Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, proudly looked on.Beatrice donned the trademark mortar board and gown with a brown   hood—Goldsmiths' school color—for the ceremony. As for her future plans?   Buckingham Palace announced today that the princess will spend the  next  few months "undertaking a number of internships to develop her   experience, particularly in business and philanthropy."Well, it's not as though she's short on connections.
