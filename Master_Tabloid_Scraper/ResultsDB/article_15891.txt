Prince William's two cousins purportedly ran a red light Thursday in Germany while on a promotional tour repping Britain's royal family, per published reports.As part of the promo blitz, Beatrice, 24, and Eugenie, 22, were tasked with driving an iconic red Mini, which was decked out in the Union Jack, through the streets of Berlin.

But as they were en route to the British embassy, Eugenie, who was behind the wheel, seemingly unleashed her inner speed demon and zipped through a red light.The blunder was caught by a swarm of paps and police, who were trailing the princesses on their joyride jaunt.Reportedly, ignoring a red light in Germany can result in a fine of $267 and getting your license suspended for a month.

However, a rep for the royals said, "They were following the instructions of the German police,"This is the first promo trip abroad for the sisters, as the palace seeks to raise the profile of its next-gen royals while boosting business in the U.K.Something tells us Beatrice and Eugenie wouldn't have had any problem paying for that parking ticket!
