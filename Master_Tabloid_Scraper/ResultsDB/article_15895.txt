The other day Blood Princess Beatrice—yep, that's really what the Brits call her—stepped out for a London event wearing a cool-looking Roskanda Ilincic dress. The crepe frock, sported by Beatrice, featured a pale ivory bodice and futuristic cobalt cuffs that remind us of what Victoria Beckham's dogs might wear after surgery.In a good way, people.And then came Marisa Tomei...

The Oscar-winning actress wore the same dress to a private dinner in Paris the other night, pairing it with a breezy updo and ocean-hued sandals.For her part, Prince Andrew and Sarah "Fergie" Ferguson's oldest daughter paired her Ilincic dress with blue Nicholas Kirkwood platform heels and a pink clutch by Anya Hindmarch.So, you tell us: Who wore it better?
