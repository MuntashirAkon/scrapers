Sir Paul: No Party for Heather!/nContrary to recent reports, Sir Paul McCartney is not making nice with ex-wifey Heather Mills, and Heather WILL NOT be welcome at McCartney's 65th birthday bash on Monday. The Sun reports that though the one-legged dancing diva's camp has been suggesting that McCartney and Mills are getting on just fine, it simply isn't the case. The  "cute " Beatle deals with Mills only when he absolutely has to -- when picking up daughter Beatrice after a visit. A source told The Sun that if Mills tries to swindle her way into the soiree she'll be sent away. So much for friendly exes!/n
