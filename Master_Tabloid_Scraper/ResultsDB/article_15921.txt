Chris Rock On His Failed Marriage: ‘I Was A Piece Of S***t”/n
Serial cheater Chris Rock admits he’s to blame for his 2016 divorce
from ex-wife Malaak Compton-Rock,
the mother of his two daughters — Lola, 14, and Zahra, 13.
The comic says he thought he could run around on Malaak because he was the family’s breadwinner.
He had a rumored hook up with Scandal hottie Kerry Washington, says a source.
“I wasn’t a good husband a lot of the times.
I was a piece of s–t,” he says. /n
