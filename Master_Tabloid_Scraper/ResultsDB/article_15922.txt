Brooke Baldwin filed for divorce in November 2015, citing irreconcilable differences. The couple tied the knot in 1997 and separated in August 2013. They welcomed two daughters — Isabella in 2000, and Lola in 2001.
Carino shares legal and physical custody with his ex, and is required to pay $8,983 per month in child support as well.
The amount was calculated based on the claims that Baldwin only made $50,000 per year, while Carino made $1.35 million per year.
