Pay Up! Brooke Mueller Claims Charlie Sheen Owes Her $80K In Child Support/n
Legal troubles continue to mount for Charlie Sheen. As he faces a felony investigation from the LAPD, RadarOnline.com has learned that the HIV-positive actor is also fighting back against new charges that he owes his ex, Brooke Mueller, more than $80,000 in child support.
As Radar reported, Sheen recently filed paperwork to reduce his payments to Mueller, the mother of his twin sons Bob and Max, 6, as well as payments to Denise Richards, mother to his daughters Sam, 12, and Lola, 11. On April 7 — a day before Sheen’s ex Brett Rossi got a restraining order against him — Mueller filed new documents in their case.

According to court papers obtained by Radar, Mueller, 38, claims that Sheen, 50, owes her $88,874 in child support, plus $499 in interest. Their 2011 divorce settlement stipulated that she was to be paid $55,000 per month, but records submitted by Mueller state that Sheen only paid her $10,563 for the month of March 2016, and $10,563 for the month of April. She asked the judge to order a writ of execution, which would allow a sheriff to take the money directly from Sheen’s bank.
But according to a source close to Sheen, the smaller payments are perfectly in line with with his current income. Sheen has argued that he earns about $87,000 now, compared to the $613,000 per month he made while filming Two and a Half Men — and when he signed his settlement with Mueller.
Said the source, “Charlie is following his lawyer’s instructions and the court’s instructions. Brooke should stop with this.”
