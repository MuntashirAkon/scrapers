Brooke's War With Ex Charlie Sheen Continues From Rehab/n
Brooke Mueller had been on the road to recovery at a rehab facility in Utah, but insiders told RadarOnline.com she is distracted by fears that her ex-husband, Charlie Sheen, is going to sell the mansion she lived in with their twin sons.
With all of the drama surrounding the mansion Denise Richards had lived in with daughters, Sam, 11, and Lola, 10, “Brooke thinks it’s only a matter of time until Charlie puts her house up for sale, too,” an insider told Radar. “But she wants to continue to live in the mansion with the boys, and doesn’t want to move out.”
Talks between Mueller’s camp and Sheen’s representatives have stalled as the former Palm Beach socialite has been unable to raise the money to buy the mansion from the Anger Management star. And now her rehab stay has put a pause on the situation, but sources said Mueller, 38, wonders how long Sheen will hold off.

“Brooke’s sobriety is still in the very beginning stages, and the last thing she needs is this additional stress,” the source claimed.
Mueller said that the reason for her most recent relapse was the public revelation that Charlie Sheen, 50, was HIV positive.
“Brooke had a very difficult time in the immediate aftermath of Charlie’s situation going public. Even though she and the twins don’t have HIV, it just brought back a lot of very bad memories of the time when Brooke was married to Charlie,” an insider previously told Radar.
