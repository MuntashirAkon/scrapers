According to a source, “There was a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship between Charlie and Robert Brandt. Mark Kaplan was recommended, and Charlie hired him.”
As Radar reported, Richards, 44, is asking a Los Angeles judge to force Sheen, 50, to either put $7 million in cash into the trust fund for Sam, 11, and Lola, 10, or purchase a home of equal value, after the actor sold the Mulholland Estates mansion that had been titled to a trust for the girls.
However, a source close to Richards previously told Radar, “This has nothing to do with Denise getting any money out of Charlie for herself. This is only for their daughters, period. There was a trust agreement drawn up in 2014 and Denise just wants Charlie to abide by the terms of it. There was money put into the girls’ trust fund, but it’s nowhere near the $7 million that is required to be in the account.”
