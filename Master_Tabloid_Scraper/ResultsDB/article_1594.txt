Kendrick Lamar Sued for Ripping Off Bill Withers/nKendrick Lamar simply slapped his lyrics on a Bill Withers song in order to crank out his track,  "I Do This " ... but the costly problem is he did it without permission ... according to a new lawsuit. Kendrick's being sued by Mattie Music Group, a music company that says it owns the rights to Bill Withers' song  "Don't You Want To Stay, " which was released back in 1975.  According to legal docs filed by MMG ... the company says K. Dot's 2009 track  "I Do This " is a complete replica of  "Don't You Want To Stay " -- to the point it  "consists of nothing more than new rap and hip hop lyrics set to the existing music of  "Don't You Want To Stay. " Mattie Music is suing for damages and wants Kendrick to stop using the Withers track./n
