Denise Richards Sues Ex-Husband Charlie Sheen!/n
Denise Richards has filed a lawsuit against her ex-husband, Charlie Sheen, RadarOnline.com has learned. Richards is accusing the actor of taking money out of a trust for their daughters, Sam, 11, and Lola, 10, in order to fund his party lifestyle.
The lawsuit accuses Sheen, 50, of selling a Mulholland Estates mansion that was put in a trust for their daughters, and not turning returning the money to the trust after it was sold. The house was supposed to give them financial security for the future, according to insiders. Sheen is the only defendant in the suit.
Sheen had bought the 9,000 square foot home with six bedrooms, nine bathrooms, a pool, and pizza oven in 2011 for Richards for $6.99 million. The house recently was sold for $6.6 million, resulting in nearly a $400,000 loss to Sheen in an off-market deal. It had been listed on the MLS last year for $7.495 million.

Sheen was once the highest-paid star on television and he’s currently worth a reported $125 million, but as Radar reported and Sheen recently admitted, he spent millions trying to keep his HIV diagnosis a secret in recent years.
In addition, two weeks after the announcement, Radar reported he paid Richards, 44, $110,000 in back child support payments that he’d owed her.
“At most, he was behind two months by missing a payment because he switched business managers,” a source previously explained.

Sheen’s attorney did not immediately respond to Radar’s request for comment.
