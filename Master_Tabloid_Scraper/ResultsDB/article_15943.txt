This Guy's Maternity Shoot With His Dog Reminds Us What REAL Beauty Is!/n

Sometimes a bitch just needs to feel beautiful.
And for Daquan Collins' pregnant dog Heidi, some glam photos were all she needed to feel like a life-bearing goddess.
Photos: Celebs Who've Posed Nude With The Baby Bump!
The 20-year-old recently shared snaps from a maternity shoot with the pooch, who is expecting any day now with that nine-weeks pregnant glow!
While Collins says Heidi is usually "camera shy," the soon-to-be mom worked the camera for this Ciara-esque shoot, baring her litter-filled belly for all to marvel at:

Collins told BuzzFeed News the shoot was "a spur of the moment thing," explaining:
"I was sitting in the yard and I was yelled to my sister to just start taking pictures… [Heidi is] honestly kind of camera shy if she knows your recording she'll just lay there."
Oh did she lay there alright — and quickly became a viral sensation for those intimate, sassy poses:

Did Heidi perfect the naked photo shoot? We think so.
