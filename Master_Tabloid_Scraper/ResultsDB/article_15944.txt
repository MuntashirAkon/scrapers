The controversial actor confirmed he was in a relationship to the paparazzi outside of the restaurant. He said:

"This is my girlfriend… No one's gotten a photo of it yet."
Although the two were spotted out yesterday, sources say they have been linked since late last year.
Ex-wife Denise Richards was also at the dinner and posted a cute photo of her baby girl on Instagram!
