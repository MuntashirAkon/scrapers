Congratulations are in order for Penn Badgley!

The Gossip Girl alum married Domino Kirke, the sister of Girls star Jemima Kirke, in a courthouse ceremony in Brooklyn on Monday. According to E! News, the couple said “I do” in front of just several friends and family members.

“Love these lovebirds and their love. Congratulations babes,” a friend wrote.
Penn wore a navy blue suit and Domino, a doula, was dressed in a white lace gown. Meanwhile, her sister Jemima wore jeans — yes, jeans! — to the low-key nuptials.
Previously, Penn dated co-star Blake Lively for three years. He was linked to Zoë Kravitz for two years before splitting with the actress in 2013.
Domino has an 8-year-old son from a previous relationship.



When someone gets married in a courthouse, it’s really an open invitation to everyone but the beautiful bride to explore all that fashion has to offer. Here, I try a look simply called “Pants,” as Cassius goes for “That Dude from #incubus” and Jemima experiments with “Off to Therapy!” Congratulations @dominokirke. We love you.
