Like any proud mother, Madonna couldn’t wait to show off her new daughters to the world.

Just a day after completing the adoption process, the singer took to Instagram to share a family photo featuring her twin girls, Esther and Stella. Seen holding hands with the 4-year-olds in the picture, Madonna thanked the people of Malawi, where she adopted the children, for all their love and support.
“I can officially confirm I have completed the process of adopting twin sisters from Malawi and am overjoyed that they are now part of our family,” she wrote in the caption. “I am deeply grateful to all those in Malawi who helped make this possible, and I ask the media please to respect our privacy during this transitional time. 🙏🏻 Thank you also to my friends, family and my very large team for all your support and Love!”

As it turns out, the sweet portrait was not the first to be shared on Madonna’s Instagram account. Six months before finalizing the adoption, the 58-year-old posted a shot of her eldest daughter, Lourdes Leon, with the orphaned twins.
“3 Beauties! 💘 Lola spends time with twins, Stella and Esther at Home of Hope Orphanage,” Madonna shared.

According to Mlenga Mvula, a judicial spokesperson from Malawi, the sisters’ mother passed away just a week after their birth. The girls’ father and uncle were present in court on Tuesday (Feb. 7, 2017) to witness Madonna taking over guardianship.
Besides Lourdes and the twins, Madonna is also mother to  Rocco Ritchie, 16, David Banda, 11, and Mercy James, 11. She adopted the latter two from Malawi as well.
