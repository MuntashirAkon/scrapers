Jason Momoa, whose probably best known as Game of Thrones’ Khal Drogo and will be playing DC Comics’ Aquaman, recently opened up about his family life and being a dad to his two kids with wife Lisa Bonet.
Momoa was featured in a Carhartt-sponsored eight-minute clip called “Canvas of My Life,” as he talks about growing up with an artistic mother. As well as how those past experiences shaped him into the father he is today, raising daughter Lola Iolani, 9, son Nakoa-Wolf, 8, and step-daughter Zoë Kravitz, 28, Bonet’s kid with Lenny Kravitz.
“My dreams finally came true,” Momoa is heard saying. “I’m a father. I found my place, my home.” Watch below!





Momoa will be seen as Aquaman in the upcoming Justice League (Nov. 17, 2017) and then in a standalone DC movie on October 8, 2018.
