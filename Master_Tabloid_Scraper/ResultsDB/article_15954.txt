While we patiently await the next installment in the Fifty Shades of Grey series, lead man Jamie Dornan has already moved on.

Yesterday (Nov. 7, 2016), Dornan was spotted in LA on the set of his latest project Untogether. According to The Hollywood Reporter, Untogether is a film that “follows the affair between Andrea (Jemima Kirke), a former teen prodigy turned heroin addict who is trying to be a writer now that she’s sober, and Nick (Dornan), a writer who’s found success with his memoir of wartime bravery, which sees him showered in wealth and women.”
