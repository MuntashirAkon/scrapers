Time flies when you’re a parent. Charlie Sheen proved that on Wednesday (Aug. 31, 2016) when he shared a family photo of his children all grown up.

In a shot shared on his Instagram, the former Two and a Half Men star has his arms around daughters Lola, 11, and Sam, 12, with ex-wife Denise Richards grinning in the background.
“A gaggle of awe sum!!” Sheen, 50, captioned the picture.

The actor married Richards, 45, in 2002. Three years later, Richards filed for divorce while pregnant with their second daughter, accusing Sheen of alcohol and drug abuse during their marriage.
Sheen is also the father to a grown daughter Cassandra from a previous relationship with his former high school girlfriend, Paula Profit. He also shares twins Bob and Max with ex-wife Brooke Mueller.
