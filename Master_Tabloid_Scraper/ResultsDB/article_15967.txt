Chris Rock's Wife: He Needs to Keep Cash Flowing for Mystery Girl/nChris Rock's estranged wife is calling him out in legal docs, demanding he continue supporting the 7-year-old South African girl they raised -- even if she's not legally their child.    In Malaak's divorce docs, which TMZ obtained, she listed the 2 daughters she and Chris had together, Zahra and Lola, but also lumps in Ntombi as a dependent. Malaak says she's been raised  "as a member of the family and has been solely supported by [Chris and Malaak]. " What's interesting is when Chris filed his divorce petition, he only mentioned Zahra and Lola ... implying he has zero financial responsibility for Ntombi. But Malaak's point is clear -- Chris has always supported Ntombi as his daughter, so he needs to continue doing so. As we've reported, Ntombi is living in the U.S. under a visitor visa ... but was never legally adopted by Chris or Malaak./n
