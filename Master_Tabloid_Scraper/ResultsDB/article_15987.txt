“I think that this was a gift, because I needed to change my life,” she confessed during an interview with Megyn Kelly.
“I needed to change the way I did everything,” she added.

“I know you’re going to think I’m crazy, but I think I have a brain tumor like my mom,” she recalls saying to the doctor before her final diagnosis.
She said before he even told her it was true, she knew it for herself.
“At that point, when I said all those things out loud to (my doctor), the symptoms mirrored what my mom had, and I realized it in that moment,” she said.
When the doctor confirmed she did in fact have a non-cancerous brain tumor, Menounos started “chuckling”.
“‘At that point it’s like, ‘This is a joke.’ Like, how does this happen?” she said in her recent interview.

While the TV personality is getting her rest and recovering alongside her loved ones, her mom still has a long way to go.
“I’m worried about her,” claimed the star. “I just hope that we can make her one of the long-term survivors.”
As of now, Menounous is taking care of her mother and “focusing on life.” It is uncertain whether or not she will ever make a return to the News screen.
