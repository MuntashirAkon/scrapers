The Goodfriends, who are being represented by Hollywood pitbull attorney Marty Singer, are seeking damages — a total of $1 million — to “make an example of Phoenix” and “deter similar conduct in the future,” according to the lawsuit filed.
“This case is a classic example of ‘bait and switch’ tactics employed by David Phoenix, a rogue interior designer who has swindled [the Goodfriends] out of more than $4 million through his fraudulent misrepresentations and other tortious conduct concerning services and materials that he falsely promised [the Goodfriends],” the documents state.

“To add insult to injury, after obtaining vast sums of money from [the Goodfriends], Phoenix converted to his own use nearly $1 Million in cash and furniture, fabrics, material and other furnishings for which [the Goodfriends] had already paid,” the suit continued.
The Goodfriends also accused Phoenix of “arrogantly ignoring” their inquiries in recent months.
According to his website, Phoenix is a “celebrated and influential Los Angeles designer known for thoughtful, modern luxury and livability.”
