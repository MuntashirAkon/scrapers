Princess Diana's Butler Bombshell: He's Gay & Marrying His Boyfriend/n
The butler that sold out Princess Diana after her tragic death has revealed the bombshell news that he is marrying his boyfriend after divorcing his wife just nine months ago.
Paul Burrell, 58, was the personal butler for Prince William and Prince Harry’s late mother and she so depended on him she once called him her “rock.”
He was previously married for 32 years to Maria Burell and had two sons, but divorced in 2016 after living apart for many years.
Burrell announced that he will be marrying Graham Cooper, a lawyer. They were photographed together at a bed and breakfast in 2014 but the length of their relationship was relatively unknown.
Burrell met his wife when they were both working at Buckingham Palace and in 2015 he said that he still loved her. “Marrying her was the best thing in my life, and to witness the boys being born – nothing compares. It’s sad when people part, but it happens a lot,” he told the Sunday Mirror.

Burrell became Princess Diana’s butler in 1987 but subsequently wrote two tell-all novels about her. The Princes decried his actions as a “betrayal,” of their beloved mummy.
In 2002 Greg Pead claimed he and Burrell had a three-year relationship in the early Eighties, before his marriage. Pead claimed Burrell would sneak him into Buckingham Palace where they would have sex.
He addressed the report, saying “I knew Greg Pead when I was 20. Isn’t it sad when someone hangs on to something that happened 33 years ago? I thought close friendships were between two people, but apparently not.”
Princess Diana died in Paris in 1997 after a car crash and Burrell recently said: “It was probably the saddest day of my life.”
