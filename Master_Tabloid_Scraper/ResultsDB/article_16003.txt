Scheana Shay may be putting her divorce plans on hold for an acting career, RadarOnline.com has learned!
“Scheana wants to focus on the show [Vanderpump Rules] which is her number one job,” a source close to the reality star told Radar. “She wants to make good TV.”
“She wants to host like Rocsi Diaz or Maria Menunos,” the source added, noting that “she’s putting her singing career away for awhile.”
Scheana and her estranged husband Mike collaborated on music during their time together on Vanderpump Rules. She even sang her one-hit wonder, “Good As Gold,” at their engagement party, and the couple made “Shake That” with now frenemy James Kennedy.

Now, Scheana, 31, is getting back to her roots in acting. She made appearances on The Hills and The Jonas Brothers’ Disney show
“She always wanted to be an actress and wanted to be famous,” the insider explained. “Scheana is trying really hard to focus on her career and the show especially because they started filming what went down with her and Mike.”
As Radar previously reported, Scheana feared Mike went missing shortly before she filed for divorce on Nov. 30. Now, friends close to the couple are worried that Mike may relapse on drugs as their divorce proceedings continue. But, Mike’s family insisted to Radar that he’s still clean and sober.
Meanwhile, Scheana has been partying in Vegas with her family, and has been spotted celebrating the holidays with her Bravo costars.
