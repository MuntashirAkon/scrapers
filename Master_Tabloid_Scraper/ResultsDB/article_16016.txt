Blac Chyna followed in the footsteps of an unbothered Mariah Carey by receiving a brand new whip for her birthday.

Chyna, who turned 29 on Thursday (May 11), showed off pictures of her new 488 Spider Ferrari on Instagram. Her son with Tyga, King Cario, was most excited about the gift, as he’s a noted Ferrari enthusiast. Remember his Ferarri-themed fourth birthday party?
