Mariah Carey has impossibly high standards when it comes to the value of birthday gifts.

Carey received a Maybach for her birthday and it didn’t exactly float her boat.
TMZ reports:
Mimi was celebrating her belated bday Thursday night at Tao in Hollywood. She turned 47 back in March. The ride was a belated gift from her manager, Stella Bulochnikov.
Most people would’ve freaked out over a whip with a starting price of $200k. Mariah barely flinched.
