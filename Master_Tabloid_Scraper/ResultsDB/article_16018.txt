Leave it to Courtney Stodden to throw herself a divorce party.

The former teen bride hosted a raunchy bash at Las Vegas’ Crazy Horse III on Friday (Apr. 28, 2017) to celebrate her freedom. Clad in a skintight pink dress, the 22-year-old threw back shots and rang in her single status with reality star Heather Marianna and a bunch of gal pals.
Stodden reportedly received numerous lap dances from entertainers at the Sin City joint before smashing open a groom-shaped piñata. “To divorce!” she toasted the crowd. “This is like a reverse bachelorette party, because I get to celebrate in Vegas and be single!”

As previously reported, Stodden split with husband Doug Hutchison, 56, in January after five years of marriage. She broke things off with the Green Mile actor, who she married in 2011 when she was just 16, after suffering a miscarriage last summer.
In February, Stodden revealed she identifies as bisexual. “I think I just want to have fun,” she told fox News at the time. “I like guys who are funny and you know, successful and girls too! You know, I mean, I’m bi so why not some girls too?”
