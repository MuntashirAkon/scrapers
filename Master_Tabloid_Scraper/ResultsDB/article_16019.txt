Nick Cannon revealed the most outlandish bit of behavior he’s ever witnessed Mariah Carey exhibit on Thursday’s episode of The Wendy Williams Show.

Wendy Williams asked Cannon to give her the scoop on the “most diva thing” he’s ever seen Carey do, and his response was a bit of information we’ve heard before.
“Have twins,” Cannon replied, “She shut the whole hospital down.”
He says that Carey made him play her music while she gave birth to Moroccan and Monroe, who are now five years old.
“It was a fantasy,” said Cannon. “They was dancing…to ‘Fantasy.'”
Cannon shared the same story with Gayle King in 2011, the same year that their twins were born.

Williams also asked Cannon if he and Carey are still sleeping together. “In my mind, you are and there would be nothing wrong with that,” she added.
“There would be nothing wrong with that, but that’s not the case” Cannon replied. “There’s nothing but unconditional love there. I mean, she’s gorgeous but, you know, I’m respectful. I put the kids to bed and I go home.”
The former America’s Got Talent host also discussed their divorce, citing the lack of growth as a reason for their separation.
“It should be a situation where everyone’s becoming a better human being in the relationship,” he explained. “So when you get to a point where there’s no longer any growth and you’re not bettering each other…I felt like it was probably best, especially for our children, since they’re the number one priority, if I could be the best human being and the best father from outside of that house.”
Cannon just welcomed his third child with his ex Brittany Bell back in February.
