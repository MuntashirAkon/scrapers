Mariah Carey has broken things off with boyfriend Bryan Tanaka just months of dating.

The “We Belong Together” singer split with the backup dancer over jealousy problems, according to TMZ. The two haven’t spoken to each other since their five-month anniversary vacation to Mexico last month.
Sources told the outlet Tanaka, 36, “had unbridled fury” over his girlfriend’s relationship with ex-husband Nick Cannon and felt “disrespected” when the parents-of-two, who share 5-year-old twins Monroe and Moroccan, showed up to this year’s Kids’ Choice Awards together. Insiders claimed Tanaka even “demanded” Carey to come home when he saw the former couple had posed for photos on the red carpet.

Aside from the trust issues, Carey was also allegedly fed up with paying for Tanaka’s new lifestyle, which included spending money on expensive shoes, watches and jewelry from designer brands like Gucci and Balmain, and dumped her beau because she believed he was leeching off her millions.
The elusive chanteuse, who was previously engaged to James Packer before parting ways with the billionaire in 2016, is said to believe Tanaka took advantage of the split and was only in the relationship for the fame.
Better luck next time, girl.
