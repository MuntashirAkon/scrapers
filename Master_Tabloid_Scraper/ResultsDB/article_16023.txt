Mariah Carey’s dress turned on her once it was exposed to the paparazzi’s cameras while grabbing a bite at Catch LA in West Hollywood.

Carey wore a skin-tight dress with a lace-up front underneath a motorcycle jacket with a diamond necklace. She opted out of wearing a bra, which became evident when her dress met the flashes of light from the paparazzi.
