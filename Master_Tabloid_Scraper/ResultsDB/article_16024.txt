Monroe and her twin brother Moroccan Scott have popped up all over Carey’s Instagram account during her tour, which kicked off in late July and concludes Sept. 5 in Seattle.
Both “DemKids” — Carey’s only children with ex Nick Cannon — have joined their mom onstage multiple times, including her July 31 show at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles, when they shared the mic to help her with the song’s chorus.
“We learned this song the other day,” Carey shared of “Always Be My Baby” at the time.

All that singing hasn’t been without some sweet treats to celebrate! On Aug. 10, the “Heartbreaker” songstress brought the twins to a candy-themed bash at the Sugar Factory American Brasserie on Ocean Drive in Miami following her concert at the BB&T Center in Sunrise, Florida.
The following week, Carey’s minis joined her backstage ahead of her N.Y.C. show, striking poses for the camera. “#mysquad #curlyhaircrew #newark #allthehitstour getting ready for you #nyc,” Carey captioned the cute moment.
