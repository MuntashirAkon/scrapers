One Sweet Day! Mariah Carey Brings 6-Year-Old Twins Moroccan and Monroe to Sugar-Filled Party/n
Mariah Carey and her 6-year-old twins Moroccan and Monroe had one sweet day on Thursday.
The trio stepped out for a candy-themed party at the Sugar Factory American Brasserie on Ocean Drive in Miami, Florida.
Thursday’s event, which came after Carey’s concert at the BB&T Center in Fort Lauderdale, brought out the silly side of Carey and her kids.
Posing for photos in front of a candy button backdrop, the family was all smiles. Carey wore a low-cut, long-sleeve green sequined mini dress with matching heels. The 47-year-old singer accessorized the look with mirrored sunglasses and hoop earrings.
Moroccan and Monroe were all decked out — he in a grey blazer, matching shorts, white T-shirt and silver sneakers; and she in a palm-leaf printed dress and glittery sandals. Getting playful, Monroe (in a pair of pink glasses) even stuck her tongue out for the camera.

Sipping on cocktails and spending time with her kids at the party wasn’t the only sweet treat for Carey.
Pal Serena Williams, who is expecting her first child with fiancé Alexis Ohanian, stopped by Carey’s concert — visiting with the three backstage.

Moroccan and Monroe have been enjoying time with mom as she spends her summer on the road alongside Lionel Richie for their All The Hits tour.
They’ve even joined her on stage a few times, singing along with their mom on her the chorus of her 1996 tune, “Always Be My Baby.”

“We learned this song the other day,” Carey told them at her Hollywood Bowl show on July 31 as they took the mic.

While life on tour can surely be tiresome, Carey’s spent plenty of time trying to make things fun for the kids.
In Florida, she threw a treasure hunt on a boat — dressing up as pirates with Moroccan and Monroe (and sharing photos to Instagram, of course).

Meanwhile, Carey’s ex Nick Cannon — with whom she shares her twins — told Entertainment Tonight in July that he’s still hurt from his relationship with Carey and not currently looking to open up his heart to someone else.
“I’m broken. I’m shattered,” said Cannon, who married Carey in 2008 before their breakup in 2014.
The former pair remain friendly. “They are co-parenting,” a Carey insider told PEOPLE in May.
