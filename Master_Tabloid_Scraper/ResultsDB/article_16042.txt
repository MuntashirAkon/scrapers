EXCLUSIVE! Tyler Henry Helps Maria Menounos Find Closure on Hollywood Medium After the Death of a Close Friend ''Haunted'' Her/n
Maria Menounos' loved ones are never too far away.In this exclusive sneak peek from Wednesday's upcoming episode of Hollywood Medium With Tyler Henry, the E! News host receives closure from Tyler Henry after the death of a dear friend."I, for sure, am connecting to a lady I want to bring up," Tyler tells Maria, while her fiancé, Keven Undergaro, watches from the next room. "There is, interestingly good to keep in mind, a Karen or a 'C' or a 'K' connection that I would need to highlight. This is a woman who acknowledges dealing with medication actually being put on her or having to take medication. This is someone, who by nature, if they were hurting would not even take an Advil."While Maria listens to Tyler's message, Keven recognizes the person he's talking about: a close friend named Chiera Michelle.

"She brought up very strongly referencing to breast cancer and referenced to a mass being found," Tyler continues. "Then, I feel like we establish this and we find this, but then it spreads. Do you know if anybody dealt with cancer twice?" he asks.Maria then reveals that it is Chiera and confirms everything Tyler is saying is true: She did have cancer twice and she didn't like taking medicine.Tyler expresses Chiera doesn't want them to feel guilty about not making it in time to see her before she died. "There wasn't a need to get there in time because that closure was already established, from her end, long before," he says. "It's like, 'We don't need you to actually be there to give me that closure.'"

Maria seems comforted by that revelation. "Keven and I talk about it more often than you would imagine," she says. "We're just like 'Oh my god. Oh my god. Why weren't we there? Why weren't we there?' And it has haunted us."Check out the emotional clip above for yourself.
