Maria Menounos Battles Brain Tumor/nMaria Menounos just revealed she's battling a brain tumor ... and her diagnosis comes while her mother is currently battling brain cancer. Menounos, who has hosted  "Access Hollywood " and worked as a correspondent for  "Today " as well as anchoring an  "E " program, says she underwent surgery back in April -- a 7-hour procedure -- to remove the golf-ball sized growth.  She says the operation was successful and almost all of it was removed.
