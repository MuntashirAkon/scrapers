Genie Bouchard Says 'Cheater' Maria Sharapova Should Be Banned for Life/nTennis pro Genie Bouchard is slamming Maria Sharapova as a  "cheater " who should NEVER be allowed to play pro tennis ever again.  Sharapova returned to pro tennis Wednesday after serving a 15 month suspension for testing positive for a banned substance. But Bouchard -- a 2014 Wimbledon finalist -- told TRT World that Sharapova got off wayyyy too easy.   "She's a cheater and so to me ... I don’t think a cheater in any sport should be allowed to play that sport again, " Bouchard said.  "It’s so unfair to all the other players who do it the right way and are true. So, I think from the WTA it sends the wrong message to young kids -- cheat and we’ll welcome you back with open arms. "  "I don’t think that’s right and ... [she's] definitely not someone I can say I look up to anymore because that's definitely ruined it for me a little bit.”  Genie on Sharapova!
