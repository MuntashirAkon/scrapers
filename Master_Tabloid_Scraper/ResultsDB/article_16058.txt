'Simpsons' Creator Matt Groening Sued By Hispanic Nanny Claims Discrimination/n "The Simpsons " creator Matt Groening has been sued by his former nanny, who claims he has it out for Hispanics, even though Matt's wife is Hispanic. Tania Cardona claims in a new lawsuit, obtained by TMZ, Matt and his wife treated employees  "like animals, " claiming she was not only worked to the bone, but harassed over her heritage. Cardona says Matt would say his son was not going to speak  "good English " because there were so many Hispanics in the house. The lawsuit says Groening would complain,  "his house looked like a Hispanic community and he 'hated' it. " Cardona grouses she and the other Hispanic employees had to eat at a small table next to a trash can in the laundry room. It's a puzzling lawsuit, because Matt is married to Agustina Maria Picasso Achaval, who is from Argentina. Cardona claims she was wrongfully terminated and wants millions in damages. We called Groening for comment. The lawyer said they hadn't seen the lawsuit and therefore had no comment./n
