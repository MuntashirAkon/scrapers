Sasha Vujacic -- I'm Over Maria Sharapova ... Forever  /nNBA sharpshooter Sasha Vujacic is pulling a Taylor Swift ... saying that him and his tennis superstar ex-fiancee Maria Sharapova are never, ever, ever getting back together. Vujacic -- who just recently signed with the NY Knicks -- was at LAX when we tossed some questions at the former Laker ... most notably, if he ever thinks he'll get back on serve with Sharapova.  The two used to be quite the sports couple -- dating for years until they called off the engagement in 2012 ... but with Drake rekindling his romance with Maria's chief rival Serena, we had to know if reconciliation was on Sasha's brain. The short answer? Hell no ... Vujacic bristles at the very mention of Sharapova, maybe because there is another lady in the clip who he may or may not be connected to. Life is just like tennis ... love loses./n
