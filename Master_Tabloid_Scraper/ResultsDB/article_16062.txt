Judge Phoned Suspect in 'Survivor' Murder/nTMZ has obtained court papers from the legal drama that is unfolding ... involving a former  "Survivor " producer who is suspected of killing his wife.According to the minute order, the judge was determining guardianship of the two children of Bruce Beresford-Redman, after his wife, Monica Burgos Beresford-Redman was found dead in Mexico.According to the doc, the judge actually spoke with Bruce -- who was still in Mexico -- by phone in open court to find out who Bruce wanted as guardians.Monica's sister had filed a petition for guardianship, but Bruce said he wanted his parents to assume that role, and the judge agreed.The judge did, however, give Monica's sister, Carla Burgos Van Bastelaar  "reasonable visits " with the kids.  The judge also gave Maria Beatriz Oaxaca -- whom we believe is the nanny --  "liberal visits, " including overnights.The judge also ordered that the children's passports be surrendered to the court and that they stay in L.A. County.  The passport issue is relevant because Carla -- the victim's sister -- is from Brazil.Bruce, who was arrested in Mexico and then set free, is still in the country -- and can't leave while the investigation is active./n
