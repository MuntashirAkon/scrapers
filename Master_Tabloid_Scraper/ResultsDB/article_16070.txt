Michael Douglas Confirms Radar Scoop - Val Kilmer's Secret Battle With Cancer/n
Radar told you so! Michael Douglas accidentally confirmed pal Val Kilmer‘s cancer secret during a Q&A with Jonathan Ross in London on Sunday.
“Val was a wonderful guy who is dealing with exactly what I had [tongue cancer],” he revealed. “My prayers are with him. That’s why you haven’t heard too much from Val lately.”

According to Douglas, things “don’t look too good” for his The Ghost in the Darkness costar either.
As Radar exclusively reported last winter, Kilmer was finally able to ditch a tracheostomy tube that he had been wearing. But the Top Gun actor’s frail appearance sparked concerns that he was still secretly struggling with his health.
Though he denied he had throat cancer, multiple insiders, including his mother, Gladys Leach, confirmed to Radar that he was battling a potentially deadly throat tumor.

In recent months, the 56-year-old actor — who normally covers up his throat with bandanas, scarves or turtlenecks — hasn’t attempted to hide the noticeably sunken area of skin on his neck.
