Val Kilmer Appears Healthier After Life-Or-Death Throat Tumor Fight/n
RadarOnline.com can reveal that Val Kilmer may finally be out of the woods in his brave life-or-death fight against a throat tumor, which forced him to undergo an emergency tracheotomy.
Last winter, Kilmer was finally able to ditch a tracheostomy tube that he had been wearing.
However, the Top Gun star’s frail appearance sparked concerns that he was still secretly struggling with his health.

Though he denied he had throat cancer, multiple insiders, including his mother, Gladys Leach, confirmed to Radar that he was battling a potentially deadly throat tumor.
Kilmer, looking noticeably less gaunt, was photographed at a screening of Citizen Kane in Westlake Village, Calif., on Sept. 16.
The 56-year-old actor, who normally covers up his throat with bandanas, scarves or turtlenecks, didn’t attempt to hide the large sunken area in the front.
