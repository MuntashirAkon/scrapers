 Inside Val Kilmer's Life-Or-Death Throat Cancer Fight — 'Docs Believe They've Got It'.../n
RadarOnline.com can reveal that Val Kilmer may be winning his life-or-death battle against throat cancer.
“Val is telling friends that doctors believe they’ve gotten it,” a source tells Radar of the Top Gun star, 56, who “speaks in a whisper and can’t really talk.”
As Radar reported, doctors found a tumor after Kilmer was suddenly hospitalized last January. His mom, Gladys Leach, confirmed at the time that her son had a throat tumor and tracheotomy.

Now, said the source: “He actually looked pretty good — sturdy and not particularly frail.”
However, added the source, “Val’s whole mouth is wired up and he has a small whitish square on his throat near his Adam’s apple where the surgery was.”
According to the source, Kilmer has been getting through his health ordeal thanks to the support of some of his famous friends.
Said an insider: “Val is telling pals how Cher has been a huge help and a friend to him throughout this experience.” /n
