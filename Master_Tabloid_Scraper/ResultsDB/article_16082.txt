It’s the latest racially-charged chatter from the Ray star, who told the December/January issue of VIBE that “every single thing in my life is built around race.

“As a black person it’s always racial. I come into this place to do a photo shoot and they got Ritz crackers and cheese, I’ll be like, ‘Ain’t this a b*tch. Y’all didn’t know black people was coming?” Foxx said. “What’s with all this white sh*t?’
“By the same token, if there is fried chicken and watermelon, I’ll say ‘Ain’t this a b*tch’ … so, no matter what we do as black people it’s always gonna be that.”
