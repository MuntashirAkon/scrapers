Fantasia Barrino Is Back With A SexXxy New Single All About Sleeping With The One I Love!/n

This is simply fantastic!
Fantasia Barrino may not be the most celebrated American Idol winner of all time, but she's certainly one of the most talented.
But just in case you don't believe us, you should probably listen to her new single Sleeping With The One I Love before passing any judgment.

The R&B ballad is the third single off Fantasia's upcoming fifth studio album The Definition Of… and it's by far our favorite track we've heard from her so far!
Plus, if you like what you hear, you can pick up The Definition Of… when it drops Friday, June 10.
Way to slay, Fantasia!
