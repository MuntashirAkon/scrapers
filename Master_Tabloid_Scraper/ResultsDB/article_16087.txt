Picture (above), the superstar strode in and delivered quite the speech when she was announced as this year's recipient of the Rock Star Award!
Rihanna said at the event, about empowerment and success: 

"The thing that's kept me successful is being myself. I only know how to do that. And the minute you learn to love yourself you would not want to be anybody else. Role model is not the title they like to give me, but I think I can inspire a lot of young women to be themselves and that is half the battle."

Embracing her tough side and not caring what the critics have to say!
OK, girl!!

Hillary Clinton was in attendance, as was Shonda Rhimes, Gladys Knight, Amandla Stenberg, and many, many more, so it wasn't just Rihanna there, of course. 
But she certainly left her mark!!!
