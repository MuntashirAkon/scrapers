Shia LaBeouf Attempts To Woo Rumored Fiancée Mia Goth's Grandmother By Taking Her To Easter Brunch!/n

Winning over the family, nice!
On Easter Sunday, Shia LaBeouf proved that he's on good terms with his potential, future in-laws when he brought rumored fiancée Mia Goth and her grandmother out for brunch. Well played.
The couple, who've been reportedly telling their friends and family that they are getting married, were spotted grabbing a bite with the model's grandmother Maria Gladys in Sherman Oaks, CA. Looks like Mia's family has put that pesky death threat incident behind them!

As we reported, the Even Stevens alum supposedly dished about his wedding plans to a grocery clerk earlier this month. Not to mention, the 29-year-old DID refer to Mia as his fiancée during his performance art piece #Elevate.
The trio kept their Easter attire especially casual as the Fury actor was spotted in a baseball cap and a sweatshirt, whereas his lady donned a tweed over coat and jeans while holding hands with Miz Gladys. Also, Mia's grandmomma certainly fit in with the two lovebirds as she too dressed down for the event!
We guess birds of a feather flock together, right?? We doubt Shia will have any problem getting Nana's blessing now.
Just be sure to stay out of trouble Shia, m'kay?
