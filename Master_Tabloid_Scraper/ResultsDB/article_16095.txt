 Talk about waltzing the weight off.
Bristol Palin wowed the crowds not only with her Cha- Cha but also with her new super slim figure on the Dancing With The Stars premiere.
But she isn’t the only celebrity who has Paso Doble-d the pounds away. Celebuzz is looking at the weight loss winners of the reality dance show.
So who dropped the most?

Kelly Osbourne, 27, had a complete body makeover when she was a contestant in 2009.
She lost 40 pounds through a combination of gruelling dance rehearsals and learning how to eat healthier, which she thanks her dance partner Louis Van Amstel for teaching her.
But by far the biggest weight loss wonders were Kirstie Alley, 61, and Gladys Knight, 68.


Bristol was a fan of fast food

Alley lost a whopping 100-pounds in total, but it wasn’t all from training on the show. The former Cheers star put it down to organic food and dance.
Knight, on the other hand, appeared to shrink in front of viewers eyes. The legendary singer shed an incredible 60 pounds during her stint on the 14th season of the show.
Look through the gallery to see which other stars pulled off a perfect 10 in the weight loss wars.
