Mario Lopez Reveals All-Star ‘Dancing With the Stars’ Season Planned/n
Don’t tell Mario Lopez any secrets! The Extra host let it slip that Dancing with the Stars is planning an all-star reunion next season while he was co-hosting Live! With Kelly on Wednesday.
The two were talking about Gladys Knight’s elimination when he blurted out the news. “I thought she was doing amazing,” he said, adding, “You know what, Kelly? They’re doing a Dancing With the Stars: All-Stars this next season. They called me to do it.” 
His announcement trumps any word from ABC, the network that airs DWTS. Whoops!
As for Mario being on the show, “I just don’t know how I’d be able to pull it off,” he said.
