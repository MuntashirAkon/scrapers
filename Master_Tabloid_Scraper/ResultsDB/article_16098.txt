 She’s leaving!
Maybe not on a midnight train to Georgia, but legendary singer Gladys Knight was sent packing from Dancing With the Stars Tuesday evening after a relatively close Dance Dual against Roshon Fegan.
The 67-year-old Motown legend certainly put up a good fight, dancing the jive for the judges’ save; however, in the end, she was no match for her 20-year-old competitor, whose routine won the votes of Len and Bruno — enough to keep him in the game for another week.

Gladys was admittedly at a disadvantage heading into tonight’s elimination, given that she received the lowest score of the week on Monday (21) — which might explain why she took the bad news on Tuesday like a seasoned pro.
“It’s been absolutely extraordinary,” she said of her experience on Dancing With the Stars season 14. “I’m just overjoyed.”
Ironically, Gladys, who for decades was the lead singer of the popular group Gladys Knight & The Pips, was eliminated during Motown week, which featured a live performance by Smokey Robinson.
For the first time ever in Dancing With the Stars, the show has implemented a Dance Dual, in which the bottom two contestants dance for a judges’ save. Last week, the judges unanimously chose to save Jaleel White over Gavin DeGraw.
The Dance Dual will remain in effect for the next couple of weeks.
What do you think? Should Gladys have been eliminated tonight? Sound off in the comments!
