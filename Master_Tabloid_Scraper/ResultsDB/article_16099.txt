 In the first minor surprise of the season, actor Jack Wagner was eliminated from Dancing With the Stars on Tuesday.
Despite receiving a score of 24 from the judges on Monday, Wagner’s emotional Samba failed to win over the rest of America, even though it was inspired by a tearful reunion with his long-lost daughter, in 2011.
Also in jeopardy tonight were a pair of famous singers: Gladys Knight and Gavin DeGraw, the latter of whom faced elimination last week.

It was an emotional week for the entire cast of Dancing With the Stars season 14. Practically everyone was reduced to tears on some level — and for good reason, as each contestant was asked to perform a routine based on their most memorable year. In addition to Jack’s story, we heard tales about everything from coming to America (William Levy) to finding out that their father had lung cancer (Katherine Jenkins).
Between revealing those stories and another tough elimination tonight, it’s clear the remaining contestants will be looking forward to a lighter performance night next Monday!
Meanwhile, another surprise happened about midway through Tuesday’s episode, when Tom Bergeron announced a mid-season twist: After next week, and then for the subsequent three weeks, the bottom 2 couples wil dance for the judges, who will then decide who will go home. Interesting!
What do you think: Should (X) have been sent home? And should the judges decide who stays and who goes? Sound off in the comments!
