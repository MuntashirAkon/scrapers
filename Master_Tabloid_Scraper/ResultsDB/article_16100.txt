 Though Dancing With the Stars season 14 hasn’t even started yet, it looks like Maria Menounos and Derek Hough’s chemistry is going to be red-hot!
The good-looking duo, who will hit the ballroom floor together on March 19, bonded at the Staples Center in Los Angeles last night as the Lakers took on the Boston Celtics.

Maria showed off her Boston pride in a Celtics jersey, while Derek went the incognito route in a Lakers hat. After the game, Maria posted a video on her WhoSay account, in which she and Derek practiced their dance moves on the court. We approve!
Maria is one of many stars who will be competing for the season 14 title this year. Other stars include Gladys Knight and Sherri Shepherd.
