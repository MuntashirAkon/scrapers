Kim Kardashian wore head-to-toe white as she stepped out of her hotel this afternoon in New York.
Wearing a white Gladys Tamez floppy hat (named Bianca, for Bianca Jagger!) and all white pants suit, Kim looked stunning in the ’70s inspired ensemble as she made her way to an awaiting car. She could totally pass for one of Charlie’s Angels, right? The reality star was reportedly heading to a photo shoot with her sister Kourtney and mother Kris Jenner.
