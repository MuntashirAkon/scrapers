Michael Jackson Is Laid to Rest/n
More than two months after his untimely and shocking death in June, Michael Jackson finally received his burial at Glendale, California’s Forest Lawn Memorial-Parks and Mortuaries on Thursday.
The Associated Press reports that the send-off was a star-filled event, with the 200 mourners including former Jackson pal Macaulay Culkin and his girlfriend Mila Kunis, Elizabeth Taylor, baseball slugger Barry Bonds, Jackson’s ex-wife Lisa Marie Presley, and Gladys Knight, who sang the hymn “Our Father” for the service.
The event was scheduled to begin at 7 p.m., though it started closer to 8:30, due to the Jackson family’s late arrival. Jackson’s five brothers—who each wore a single crystal-studded glove in his honor—served as pall-bearers, carrying Jackson’s casket into Forest Lawn’s Grand Mausoleum, where the singer will be interred.
