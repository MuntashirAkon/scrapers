Dancing With the Stars paid tribute to the music of Motown this week, but did that mean Gladys Knight was given a free seat on the midnight train to next week?Despite being perhaps the biggest star on the floor, she's been the weakest dancer—but, week after week, the voters had kept her around.Were they really going to pick Motown week to show her the door?

Um, yep—and so were the judges, though not unanimously.The dance duel was a jive, and Gladys and Tristan MacManus were really no match for fleet-footed Roshon Fegan and Chelsie Hightower—even though Bruno Tonioli really overshot and compared the task of having to choose between them to "Sophie's choice.""I am so amazed at this journey," the iconic songstress exclaimed. "It's been absolutely extraordinary, I learned so many things, found so many friends and family. I'm overjoyed."

As usual, William Levy, Donald Driver and Katherine Jenkins were once again golden, and Jaleel White made a thorough comeback from languishing in the bottom two last week to being the first star declared safe tonight.Melissa Gilbert and Maria Menounos were initially "in jeopardy," but remained out of real trouble.
