Cricket Superstar Dwayne Bravo -- I Get More Chicks Than Ronaldo ... Seriously. /nDwayne Bravo is a HUGE star in the world of cricket -- he's the first cricketer to be nominated for an ESPY -- and when it comes to chicks, Bravo says he pulls more ASS than ANY soccer star.  He's not kidding either ... despite the fact cricket hasn't exactly caught on in the U.S., Bravo says the sport is massive internationally ... and there are several countries where he's bigger than Ronaldo!  "If I'm in India or Trinidad or the Caribbean ... it's game over, " Bravo says.  And on a global level, Bravo says Ronaldo and other soccer stars may get more attention,  "but I get more females than anyone! " BTW, Bravo is in Los Angeles to work on his aspiring music career -- he recently signed to the same music label as Gladys Knight. /n
