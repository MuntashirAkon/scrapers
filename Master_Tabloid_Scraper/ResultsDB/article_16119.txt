New 'We Are the World' Video Released/nThe new  "We Are the World " video debuted before the Winter Olympics Opening Ceremony last night. The song brought together the biggest names in music -- including Jamie Foxx, Lionel Richie, Tony Bennett, Jennifer Hudson and Gladys Knight -- but it was 15-year-old Justin Bieber who got the coveted opening verse of the song. Didn't realize they were doing it in size order. Seriously though -- go to wearetheworldfoundation.org to donate./n
