Gladys Knight Takes 'First Family' Kids to Singing School/nThe only thing better than starring on a TV show with music legend Gladys Knight ... is getting singing lessons from her. Knight -- who co-stars on  "The First Family " as the President's mom -- was filming a scene with her TV  "grandchildren ", which required them to sing ... on key. But the youngins couldn't hit the notes.In the video ... Knight gave her young pips -- Khylin Rhambo, Yara Shahidi, Sayeed Shahidi, and Layla Crawford -- a crash course in singing, with a little tune called  "This Little Light Of Mine. " It totally paid off (duh it's Gladys) ... because the kids nailed it the very next try./n
