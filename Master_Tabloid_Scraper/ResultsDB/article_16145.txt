Ben Carson's Campaign Team Doesn't Know Basic United States Geography/n
Ben Carson was torn apart by Twitter users after posting an abysmally flawed map of the United States on Tuesday evening.
The presidential candidate attempted to take a stand against accepting Syrian refugees into the country, highlighting a coalition of governors opposed to the movement.
The only problem was, Carson’s campaign team didn’t draw their U.S. map very accurately.

A closer look at the “We’re Saying No” map reveals that New England is a little wonky—to say the least—with five states in the wrong location. Of course, the campaign deleted the Twitter and Facebook posts Wednesday morning after utmost ridicule from news outlets and social media users.

Twitter users were some of the harshest critics of the map, cracking jokes that Carson was either “drunk” or in need of a geography lesson.

Ironically, as the Washington Post shrewdly observed, this week is Geography Awareness Week. Yikes.

As Radar previously reported, Carson’s fakery goes well beyond a poorly drawn map, however.
The retired neurosurgeon has been at the center of plenty lawsuits involving disgruntled patients; he’s been caught eating meat despite calling himself a vegetarian; and the republican candidate even admitted to violent behavior towards his mother and classmates in his autobiography Gifted Hands. /n
