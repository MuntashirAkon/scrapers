 We're Bound 2 Notice! Kim Kardashian Still Sporting Cellulite Before Her 'Big Fat Florentine'.../n
Amidst multiple reports detailing Kim Kardashian’s fitness push on the way to the altar, the reality star’s cellulite was visible as she was out and about in Paris Monday, prior to a trip to the gym Tuesday alongside her hubby-to-be, Kanye West.
The 33-year-old’s physical flaw was spotted as she and her rapper beau were on a shopping jaunt to Parisian boutique Celine, as the fleshy area underneath her shoulder and behind her sideboob had noticeably crinkly flesh, days before sources say she’s expected to squeeze into a Vera Wang gown intending on making a “huge, chic fashion statement.”

Perhaps more work on her lats were in order as she headed to a workout with “The New Workout Plan” singer, 36, hidden under sunglasses and baggy clothes.

In more wedding related-news, the NY Post Tuesday reported that the couple’s wedding guests — a group that includes Jay-Z and Beyoncé — will receive personal security and cell phones for the purpose of keeping plans under wraps.
Designer Valentino Garavani will host a brunch for the couple at his opulent Château de Wideville, and journalist Andre Leon Talley will cover the affair for Vogue, the fashion bible the couple made waves in appearing on the cover this spring.

As we previously reported, the couple is expected to exchange vows in Florence, Italy, the locale where they conceived their daughter North. West proposed to Kardashian in grand fashion last autumn, proposing to her at San Francisco’s AT&T Park on her 33rd birthday. /n
