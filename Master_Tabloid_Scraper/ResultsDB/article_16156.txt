It was no surprise to fans of The Big Bang Theory that star Kaley Cuoco wed her beau on New Year’s Eve, but now RadarOnline.com has some behind-the-scenes video footage of the actress getting ready for her big day.
While preparing for her nuptials to tennis pro Ryan Sweeting, Cuoco invited cameras to tape her makeup artist and friend, Jamie Greenberg, doing her hair and makeup for her wedding.
“I can’t wait to go get married to Ryan,” Cuoco, 28, gushed in the clip.
“I’m not nervous at all. I’ve never been less nervous about anything in my whole life.”

Greenberg posted the video on YouTube with the caption, “An EXCLUSIVE behind the scenes at Kaley Cuoco’s wedding. We share the look and some other fun moments as we get her ready.
“It was a blast to be a part of this EPIC new year’s eve/surprise wedding. Come with me and enjoy this candid experience.”
Once she was all dolled up, Cuoco walked the carpet in a gorgeous pink Vera Wang gown and she tweeted to the designer the next day, “Thank you @VeraWangGang for creating my pink fairy princess gown 🙂 it was a dream come true.”
