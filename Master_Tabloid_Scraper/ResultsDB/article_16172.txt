Caitlyn Jenner — a staunch Republican who voted for President Donald Trump — has responded to the Commander-in-Chief’s plans to ban all transgender people from the U.S. military.

Amid backlash, including some aimed at Jenner for openly supporting the 71-year-old, the transgender Olympian broke her silence and expressed her disapproval the POTUS’ latest move.
“Studies estimate there are as many as 15,000 transgender people already serving this country—and for those brave people fighting for our nation, Trump’s early morning tweets must be devastating. I believe every American should be outraged by the disrespect shown to those people wearing our country’s uniform,” she wrote on her website. “Furthermore, this half-baked idea puts all of our service members in harm’s way.”
She continued, “Does President Trump intend to just pull 15,000 people out of every critical position to which they are currently assigned? That would disrupt core military missions around the world and needlessly endanger our troops.”

Jenner, who revealed she identified as a woman in 2015, also seemingly renounced her support for the politician amid his decision to forbid transgender people from serving.
“Over the past two years I have met the most inspiring trans people, and I can testify to the trans community’s incredible resilience and perseverance in the face of enormous discrimination and hate. We are strong, we are beautiful, and we will win,” she wrote. “America’s 15,000 trans service members and 134,000 veterans are much braver than you, Mr. Trump; my allegiance is with them and our country, not you.”

Trump previously announced his plans to ban transgender people from the military due to costs. “After consultation with my Generals and military experts, please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow Transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military. Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail. Thank you,” he tweeted Wednesday morning, sparking outrage from citizens.
Since the announcement, many put Trump on blast for excluding trans Americans from fighting for their country. Those on social media also alled out Jenner for voting Trump despite his anti-LGBT policies.
