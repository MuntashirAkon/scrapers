Blac Chyna doesn’t need Rob Kardashian for his money.

The reality star proved that when she bought her very own Ferrari after her ex-boyfriend took back the cars he had previously purchased for her. Showing off her whip on Instagram, the 29-year-old gushed about her 2017 Ferrari 488 Spider.
According to TMZ, the vehicle’s starting price is around $334,000 — though Chyna’s car is presumed to cost more after she upgraded it with Forgiato wheels.
“Dreamy,” she captioned a photo of her holding Kardashian’s daughter, Dream, as she posed in front of the fancy ride.

The big splurge came weeks after Chyna’s former fiancé took claim of the $200,000 purple Lamborghini — along with several other pricey possessions — he gifted her during their time together. “I pay Lambo. Ferrari. Down payment on the Rolls. Down payment on your mom’s car,” Kardashian wrote on Twitter during a online tirade, in which he also shared nudes photos of Chyna to his followers. “I pay your mother since u won’t even call your own mother back in months. I prob spent a million alone in the past 2 months. … The disrespect in the bed that my baby daughter lays in. Chyna u literally lost on this one.”
Recently, Chyna also filmed a music video for “Rake It Up” with Nicki Minaj. The model was seen driving her 488 Spider Ferrari, though the car was painted red at the time.
