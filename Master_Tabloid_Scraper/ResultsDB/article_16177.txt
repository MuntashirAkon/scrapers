In Snapchat videos, Chyna — who was Minaj’s body double in Kanye West’s “Monster” music video in 2010 — posed seductively as the “Anaconda” emcee pretended to lick the mother-of-two. The two also flashed their matching diamond watches.
“Just to race with Chyna,” Rob Kardashian’s ex captioned on Instagram photo, quoting lyrics from her pal’s song. She also snapped a photo of her red Lamborghini parked right next to Minaj’s Barbie pink car.
