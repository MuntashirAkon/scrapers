She ain’t yo average chick.

Beyoncé fans are in an uproar after a photo of the singer’s wax figure at Madame Tussauds in New York City went viral. The statue — which was recently put back at the venue after a stint at another location, according to the museum’s Twitter — received much backlash for supposedly looking nothing like the “Hold Up” songstress.
Many fans criticized Madame Tussauds for lightening Bey’s skin and thinning out her signature curves. “This is a melanin-defunct, lipless, thickless Bey,” one Twitter user wrote.
Needless to say, the Beehive was not kind…

The viral reaction came after Kylie Jenner unveiled her first wax figure, gushing that the figure was near-identitical to her appearance. “I made her FaceTime my whole family,” she joked on Instagram, sharing a selfie with her look-alike. “Fooled everyone.”
