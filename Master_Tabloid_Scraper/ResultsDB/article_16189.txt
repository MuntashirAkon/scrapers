Are Vera Wang and Evan Lysacek more than friends now? That's what the rumor mill would have us believe. And rather than just idle chitchat, they do seem to have some merit to their claims.After all, the two go way back, with Wang—a former competitive figure skater herself—having designed all of Lysacek's costumes for his gold-medal-winning run at the 2010 Winter Olympics.And, the 63-year-old wedding gown icon was in the audience when the 27-year-old competed on Dancing With the Stars that year. And...

Wang even took him as her date to Kim Kardashian's wedding last October, where she pulled double duty as guest and dress designer.The pair have certainly sustained a friendship over the years, but now there's speculation that there could be more going on. The New York Daily News reports that Lysacek moved into Wang's Beverly Hills home last month.When the iconic designer and her husband of almost 23 years, Arthur Becker, confirmed earlier this month that they had separated, a source told E! News that they had pretty much closed the book on their marriage last year.So, are they or aren't they? Chalk this one up to imaginations running wild.A source close to the skater tells E! News that this rumor is nothing but thin ice, and that the pair are simply "really good friends."—Additional reporting by Ken Baker
