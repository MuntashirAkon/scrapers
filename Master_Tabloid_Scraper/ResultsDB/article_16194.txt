However, he soon realized fashion was the route he should take because "whenever I would leave my acting class, all I wanted to do was go shopping." He started small, without even a office, but he soon worked his way up and confesses, "It's a very exciting thing to see your ideas become reality."The special also features commentaries from huge Hollywood names including Kerry Washington, Blake Lively, Vera Wang and even Anna Wintour.

Vera recalls the first time she saw Michael, "I met this gorgeous angel, he had a head full on blond curls. He had so much energy and passion and youth and a sense of fun. We just collaborated and from then on I was a fan." In the above clip, Michael also shares his chaotic experience on meeting another legend for the first time. "I threw all of my samples into a garment bag and we went to go see Anna Wintour," Michael shares.  Anna adds, "He was a complete one man show and he was positive and enthusiastic."  Tune-in to Stylemaker: Michael Kors tonight Tuesday, November 18 at 8:30pm ET/PT on E!
