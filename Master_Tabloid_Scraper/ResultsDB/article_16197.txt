Petra Ecclestone -- The Wedding You Could NEVER Afford/nIt's amazing ... Petra Ecclestone blew $85 million on Candy Spelling's 57,000 mansion, and she could still afford a wedding that rivaled the one recently thrown for those 2 kids in England.Petra tied the knot with businessman James Stunt in Italy yesterday, in the same village where Tom and Katie got hitched.  But this wedding was a lot more expensive -- reportedly more than $5 mil -- and a lot grander.For starters, Andrea Bocelli was there performing  "Time to Say Goodbye, " the first dance was courtesy of Eric Clapton, and the crowd then danced to The Black Eyed Peas.  BTW, Peas don't come cheap -- $2.4 million for the live appearance.Petra -- the daughter of Formula One billionaire Bernie Ecclestone -- was decked out in a $130,000 Vera Wang special.Guests guzzled wine at $6,500 a bottle -- Chateau Petrus, of course.And, of course, Paris, Nicky and Kathy Hilton were there.Wait till Petra Petra's dad gets the credit card statement. /n
