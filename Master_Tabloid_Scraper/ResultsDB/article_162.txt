Lupita Nyongâ€™o, Diddy, Naomi Campbell, RuPaul & MORE Pose In The All-Black 2018 Pirelli Calendar!/n

The Pirelli Calendar has gone a new direction for 2018, and it's amazing!
Not only has the once NSFW spread gone away from racy snaps, they've also decided to feature an all-black cast for the newest calendar!
Lupita Nyong'o, Naomi Campbell, Diddy, RuPaul, Whoopi Goldberg, Slick Woods, Lil Yachty, Sasha Lane, and even more star in the Alice in Wonderland-themed shoot photographed by Tim Walker.
The calendar has come such a long way!
