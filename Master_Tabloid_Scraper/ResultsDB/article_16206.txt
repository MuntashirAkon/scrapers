Kim K's Wedding Too Noisy for Hoity-Toity Neighbors/nKim Kardashian and her wedding posse of 460 were too loud for the neighbors ... law enforcement tells us the residents were so pissed off over the noise, they called the cops.We're told several neighbors reached their limit at 11:30 PM and called the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Department.Â  Deputies paid a visit to the ritzy estate where Kim's bash was in full gear, and asked them to turn the music down, which they promptly did.A Sheriff's official tells TMZ ... none of the neighbors wanted to sign an official complaint so no one was cited.What's unclear is if the music was live or canned -- a bunch of singers and groups performed live, including Earth, Wind & Fire and Robin Thicke, and DJ's like DJ Cassidy were spinning./n
