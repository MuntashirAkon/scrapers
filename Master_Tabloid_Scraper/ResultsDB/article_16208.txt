Jay Z and Beyonce: Cheering On The Champ At Wimbledon/nJay Z and Beyonce had one of the best seats in the house for Serena Williams' record-tying W at Wimbledon.  Williams took down Angelique Kerber ﻿Saturday on the grass to take her 22nd Grand Slam singles title ... tying Steffi Graf for most all time. Jay and B were in good company, sitting with Venus Williams and the rest of Serena's family. Ellen DeGeneres, Portia DiRossi, Vera Wang and Natatlie Portman ﻿were there too.  Serena and Beyonce are known to be tight -- with Williams recently appearing in the singer's  "Lemonade " video -- but judging by the pic, Jay Z might be the bigger fan. /n
