'Iron Man' -- One Good Suit Deserves Another/nRobert Downey, Jr.'s   "Iron Man " suit was a shameless copy, kind of like a designer ripping off a Vera Wang wedding dress ... so claim 2 guys who now say Marvel and Disney jacked their suit.  Artists Ben and Ray Lai claim in a new lawsuit they came up with a design in 2001 depicting a  "futuristic, armored, and weaponized " body suit and featured it in their  "Radix " comic book. The following year they say Marvel hired them to work on various comics.   The Lai's point out ... the original  "Iron Man " suits from the comics -- created in 1963 -- were simple spandex that had minimal armor. But fast forward to 2008, when the first  "Iron Man " movie was released ... they say Robert Downey. Jr.'s suit was a dead ringer for theirs. And they say to add insult to injury, Marvel used almost the exact same pose from their book for the  "Iron Man " 2 and 3 posters. They're suing Marvel, Disney and others ... and they want all profits attributable to their design./n
