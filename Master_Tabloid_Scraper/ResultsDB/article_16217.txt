Kris Humphries' Sister: Here's What I Think of My Kardashian Bridesmaid Dress/nKris Humphries' sister, Kaela, had some serious fun with that Vera Wang couture bridesmaid dress she wore when Kim Kardashian married her bro -- and then trashed it! We got photos of Kaela and her pal, Angela Kosteliz, rocking the old frock, which reportedly cost $10,000, during a fun girls night fueled by wine.  Angela tells us the pics were taken a couple years ago before Kaela moved from Minnesota to NYC. She invited friends over to help her pack, and they took turns posing in the dress. During the evening they tore strands of tulle off the gown to make headbands. Big difference from the first time Kaela wore it -- next to Kourtney, Kylie, Khloe, and Kendall. We're gonna guess Kaela had way more fun with her GFs. Angela says the dress ended up in a Goodwill donations pile./n
