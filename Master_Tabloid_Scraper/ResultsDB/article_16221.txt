“O.J. will visit often, but he won’t live with them because the media attention will be too disruptive,” his former longtime manager Norman Pardo told Radar.
Both Sydney, 31, and Justin reside in the Tampa-St. Petersburg area.
She’s a Boston University graduate and owns her own business, Simpsy LLC. Justin, 29, is a real estate agent for Coldwell Banker.

Simpson and first wife Marguerite Whitley had three children — Arnelle, Jason and Aaren, who accidentally drowned as a toddler.

Jason, 47, has struggled with booze and depression, and now works as a cook at an Atlanta-area restaurant.
