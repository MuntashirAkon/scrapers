 Losing Her Religion: Kirstie Alley's Ex-BFF 'Blames Scientology' For Ruining Her Life!.../n
Kirstie Alley’s former friend “blames Scientology” for wrecking her business and her life, new court documents obtained by RadarOnline.com claim.
Alley’s former insurance agent, Michelle Seward, is currently a co-defendant with the actress in a Ponzi scheme lawsuit, as Radar has reported. But according to new court documents she has stopped cooperating and is unlikely to appear at the upcoming trial, instead choosing to spend her time bashing the religion online!

According to legal documents obtained by Radar, “Since answering plaintiffs’ complaint, defendant Seward has stopped responding to pleadings and gone into default. She, nonetheless, continues to maintain a presence on the internet, where the once prominent Scientologist blames the Church of Scientology for the unraveling of her financial business, advertises her continued insurance activity, and promises somehow to repay investors a portion of what is owed them.”
Seward and the Cheers star were sued Jeffrey and Marguerite Stabile, who claim they loaned approximately $500,000 of their life savings to Seward, before she “purportedly lost control of the funds.”

Rob Bastian, the lawyer representing the Stabiles told Radar exclusively, “Since Ms. Seward stopped responding to legal correspondence, she was served with a default notice. I don’t expect her to appear at the upcoming trial, but my clients won’t stop trying to get their money back from her. It’s time for Ms. Seward to come forward and play by the same rules the rest of us do.”
The trial is expected to begin in August, with Kirstie Alley scheduled to take the witness stand.
As Radar reported, Seward said in court documents that she and Alley are no longer close. /n
