Justin Bieber And Ryan Gosling Simultaneously Shared A Woman's Vagina!/n

Two of Canada's seXXXiest celebrities inside her at once? Marguerite Bire sounds like a lucky lady!
She was! Until she died nearly 400 years ago.
Let us explainâ€¦
Way back before dodos were extinct, Marg and her hubby emigrated from France!
These lovely colonists were two of Justin Bieber and Ryan Gosling's 2,048 great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grandparents!
Whoa!!! So Marguerite had DNA for two of the future's brightest shining stars in her body at the same time!!
She must be totally proud!! And perhaps slightly embarrassed after Justin's recent penile dysfunction mistake!
JB, as it turns out, has famous relatives other than Ryan, his 11th cousin once-removed!
Celine Dion, his 10th cousin thrice removed, and Avril Lavigne, his 12th cousin, are getting invites to his next family reunion too!
They may be on distant branches of his family tree but it's cray how many of Canada's most spectacular stars share lineage!!
