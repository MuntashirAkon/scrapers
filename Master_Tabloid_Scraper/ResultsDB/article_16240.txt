Car Thief Almost Breaks Record For Highest Blood Alcohol Content/n

Looks like a South Dakota woman almost broke the record for the highest blood alcohol content last month after getting arrested.
Cops found 45-year-old Marguerite Engle passed out behind the wheel of a stolen truck. 
When they ran some tests, they determined she was almost nine times over the state's .08 legal limit with a .708 BAC!  She broke the state record, but the national record high was set by some lady in Oregon with a .72 BAC last year.
As for Engle, this wasn't her first run-in with the law. 
Engle's been arrested before for assaulting a government employee (the mug shot above is from that incident) as well as being intoxicated and disruptive. 
We're guessing her New Year's resolution might include going to some AA meetings.
