The pro: the trailer ignites just enough nostalgia to get everyone all excited for the series. I mean, just look at the bubbly font.
The con: the trailer is basically just names of the actors starring in the show.
Here’s the star roll call: Elizabeth Banks, Michael Ian Black, Bradley Cooper, Judah Friedlander, Janeane Garofalo, Joe Lo Truglio, Ken Marino, Christopher Meloni, Marguerite Moreau, Zak Orth, Amy Poehler, David Hyde Pierce, Paul Rudd, and Molly Shannon.
David Wain and Michael Showalter return as writers, with Wain also sitting in the director’s chair.
