Brad Pitt Bores the Hell out of Zahara/n
With Angelina Jolie sidestepping postpartum depression by getting back to work, Brad Pitt finally has some alone time with the kids.
Papa Pitt took daughter Zahara Jolie-Pitt to the Aime and Marguerite Maeght Foundation—a contemporary and modern art museum—in Saint Paul de Vence, France. Daddy and daughter were met there by Brad’s parents.
What, was Chuck E. Cheese closed or something? An art museum is about as exciting to a three-year-old as a Chippendales revue is to a girl like Samantha Ronson. 
Zahara probably can’t wait till boring Daddy goes back to work. Because that’s when the nanny let’s her use the computer and IM all mommy’s friends.
