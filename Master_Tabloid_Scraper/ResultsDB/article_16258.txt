Poor, poor Caroline (Candice Accola).The Vampire Diaries fan-favorite didn't get the chance to savor her long-awaited romantic moment with her BFF-turned-something-more Stefan (Paul Wesley) in last week's episode, because almost immediately after they shared a passionate and beautiful kiss—on a cabin porch in the woods with the sunset in the background no less (swoon!)—Caroline found out her mother, Sheriff Forbes (Marguerite MacIntyre) was dying in the hospital.She raced to the hospital to spend her mother's last few moments with her, giving her a beautiful memory to leave with, and we cried buckets as Caroline was forced to say goodbye to her mother all too soon. Aaaaaand we just started crying again.
