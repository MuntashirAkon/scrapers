This is it, guys. This is the best cast on TV, and it's not even actually on TV.The cast of Netflix's Wet Hot American Summer reboot just expanded to include Jon Hamm, Kristen Wiig, Chris Pine and Jason Schwartzman on top of the already seriously impressive list of names that was only just confirmed yesterday with the release of the teaser trailer.That list includes: Elizabeth Banks, Michael Ian Black, Bradley Cooper, Judah Friedlander, Janeane Garofalo, Joe Lo Truglio, Ken Marino, Christopher Meloni, Marguerite Moreau, Zak Orth, Amy Poehler, David Hyde Pierce, Paul Rudd, Molly Shannon and Michael Showalter.And that's not even the end of it! The cast also includes Michaela Watkins, Josh Charles, Randall Park, Lake Bell, Paul Scheer, Rob Huebel, Jayma Mays, Richard Schiff and probably everyone in our high school graduating class, along with all the kids who ever on Zoom (kidding). David Wain will direct and co-write with Showalter. 

The eight-episode limited series tells the story of the first day of Camp Firewood's summer season as the prequel to the 2001 cult classic Wet Hot American Summer, which starred many of the same people set to star in the series.Filming has already begun, and there are hints that the series will hopefully premiere sometime in the summer, but it might as well be December because we're pretty sure this means Netflix can make Christmas come early.
