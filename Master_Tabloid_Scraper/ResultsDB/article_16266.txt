Feel free to take the rest of the week off because there's no topping it after you hear the nostalgia bombshell we're about to drop!Aside from Taraji P. Hensons superstar-making turn as Cookie on Fox's breakout hit Empire, the other actor's name on everyone's lips seems to be Jussie Smollett, who plays Cookie and Lucious' (Terrence Howard) gay son, Jamal. But watching the show, did you ever find yourself thinking that Smollett looked familiar, you know, when you're not drooling over his insane singing voice? Well, you're welcome because we finally figured it out.He was in The Mighty Ducks. We repeat: He. Was. In. The. Mighty. Ducks. 

In the cult 1992 film about a ragtag hockey team coached by Emilio Estevez, Smollett played Terry Hall. Terry Hall, of course, was the nicer of the Hall siblings, as older brother Jesse Hall (Brandon Adams, where art thou?) had no time for niceties, choosing to call Banks (Vincent A. Larusso) "Cake Eater" a lot. While Jesse appeared in The Mighty Ducks 2, Terry did not rejoin the team, and we assume it's because he wanted to get as far away from his brother as possible. Smollett isn't the first Duck to pop on our pop culture radar over the years: Elden Henson (aka Fulton) recently appeared in The Hunger Games: Mockingjay and is in Netflix's upcoming Daredevil series, Marguerite Moureau (Connie) is set to return for Wet Hot American Summer's Netflix miniseries, and Aaron Schwartz (Karp) had a small but memorable recurring role on Gossip Girl as Vanya, And Joshua Jackson...well, do we really need to say how we all know him? (Dawson's Creek, Fringe and The Affair and many, many flawless red carpet appearances for you poor, unfortunate souls out there.)
