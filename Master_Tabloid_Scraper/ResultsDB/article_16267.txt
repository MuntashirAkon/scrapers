The Ducks are back together!The all-grown-up cast of the hit 1994 movie D2: The Mighty Ducks recently reunited in honor of the film's 20th anniversary and the reunion photos are wonderfully nostalgic. Over the weekend, star Marguerite Moreau and her husband Christopher Redman documented the get-together on their social media accounts.In one group photo, Moreau poses with co-stars Mike Vitar (Luis Mendoza), Garrett Henson (Guy Germaine), Vincent Larusso (Adam Banks), Aaron Lohr (Dean Portman) and Scott Whyte (Gunnar Stahl). She captioned the smiley shot, "Mike Vitar, @garretth Vincent LaRusso Aaron Lohr and Scott Whyte #mD2 #mightyducks #20yearreunion."

Last but not least, the cast also took a photo while standing in the "flying v" position. "Flying V!!!! Scott Whyte, Aaron Schwartz, Colombe Jacobsen, mike Vitar, Stephen Herek, rob Lieberman, Vincent LaRusso, @garretth Elden Henden, Carsten Norwgard, Jordan Kerner, Brandon Adams, Danny Tamborelli, Asron Lohr, Maria Ellingsen, Matt Dohery, Shawn Weiss #mightyducks #mD2 #20yearreunion #ducksflytogether," Moreau captioned the cast photo.Too cute!Unfortunately, Mighty Ducks stars Emilio Estevez, Kenan Thompson and Joshua Jackson didn't make the reunion.
