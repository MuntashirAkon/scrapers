Taylor Swift Announces Charity Donations For Sexual Assault Victims In Statement After Groping Trial Verdict/n

Now that Taylor Swift has won her trial, she has a message for her supporters — one of pure gratitude.
First the Shake It Off singer takes a moment to thank everyone who helped her, writing:

"I want to thank Judge William J. Martinez and the jury for their careful consideration, my attorneys Doug Baldridge, Danielle Foley, Jay Schaudies and Katie Wright for fighting for me and anyone who feels silenced by a sexual assault, and especially anyone who offered their support through this four-year ordeal and two year long trial process."
But Taylor didn't stop by making it about herself. She made a point of mentioning all the assault victims who don't have a voice — and what she would be doing to help change that: 

"I acknowledge the privilege that I benefit from in life, in society and in my ability to shoulder the enormous cost of defending myself in a trial like this. My hope is to help those whose voices should also be heard. Therefore, I will be making donations in the near future to multiple organizations that help sexual assault victims defend themselves."
The only thing that would be better is if it was David Mueller's money going to those organizations.
But Taylor's entire payout from winning her case will be a symbolic $1.
