Caitlyn Jenner Calls Out Donald Trump Following His Ban On Transgender Americans Serving In The Military/n

Caitlyn Jenner is D-O-N-E with Donald Trump.
Despite previously supporting the Celebrity Apprentice star during the 2016 presidential election, it appears as though the I Am Cait star has officially withdrawn her #TeamTrump membership. So what was the breaking point for the retired Olympian??

Well, unsurprisingly, Miz Jenner's disappointment in Trump has EVERYTHING to do with the Commander-In-Chief's recent decision to ban transgender Americans from serving in the military. Like the rest of the internet, the 67-year-old hit back at the Trumpster's announcement as she wrote on Twitter: 

There are 15,000 patriotic transgender Americans in the US military fighting for all of us. What happened to your promise to fight for them? https://t.co/WzjypVC8Sr

We're glad Cait is finally seeing Donnie for the monster he is. But, tbh, it took her long enough!
Fans have since criticized Kris Jenner's ex for weighing in on the news as many blame her for helping the bigoted politician get elected. Ch-ch-check out their harsh reactions for yourself (below).

YOU voted for him. Great job.
