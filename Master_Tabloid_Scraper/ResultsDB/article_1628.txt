Amber Rose is thinking of going under the knife.

The How to Be a Bad B*tch author revealed on Monday she has been seriously considering getting plastic surgery after experiencing health complications. Sharing a photo of her ample bosom on Instagram, the 33-year-old wrote she’s “thinking about getting a breast reduction this year.”
“My boobs are stupid heavy, my back hurts and I can’t wear cute lil shirts without a grandma bra,” she explained.
Rose, who previously admitted she wears a 36H bra, expressed she’s hesitant on going through with the procedure due to scarring.

“I’m really scared of the lollipop scars tho…. any advice?” she asked her followers. “Are there any ladies out there that are much happier even though you have breast reduction scars? And no I don’t have implants so they can’t just cut around the nipples.”
In 2015, Rose actually expressed interest in getting implants in the area between her breast and armpit to give her girls a lift. “I want to fill it out,” she said while appearing on E!’s Good Work. “But I don’t know if I want to get an implant because my boobs are kind of really nice.”
