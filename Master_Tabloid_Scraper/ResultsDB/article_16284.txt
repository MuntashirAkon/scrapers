Halle Berry may be new to Instagram, but that doesn’t make her any less susceptible to internet trolls.

Yesterday (Oct. 6, 2016), Berry posted an adorable picture of her two children Nahla Ariela Aubry and Maceo Robert Martinez on Instagram, but strategically left their faces out of the photo.

While most of Berry’s followers loved the photos, a few were disappointed not to see the children’s faces and decided to let the actress know how they felt. It’s not the first time Berry’s faced that criticism, but this time, she decided to do something about it and speak up.
“I’ve noticed you have said this several times now so let me be clear– I’m not at all ashamed of children. I try to find creative ways to incorporate them into my feed because they are the biggest part of my life, but I also work very hard to keep their identities as private as I can considering they are only children,” Berry wrote.
“It’s my belief, and I’m not criticizing others who have different beliefs, that it’s my job as their mother to protect their privacy as best I can. When they grow and they’re of age and they want share their images on the internet, that will be for them to decide, not me. Feel me? Have a beautiful day.”
