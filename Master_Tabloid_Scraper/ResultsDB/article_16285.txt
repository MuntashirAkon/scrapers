Just a little over a year since the release of The Weeknd’s Beauty Behind the Madness, the singer announces a new album by — gasp! — parting ways with his signature ‘do.

On Wednesday (Sept. 21 2016), The Weeknd debuted the cover for his new record. Titled Starboy, the new record features art shot by Nabil Elderkin.

While the news of new music was definitely exciting for fans, the thing that got people really talking was the absence of The Weeknd’s sky-high hair on the freshly unveiled LP cover.

So far, no official release date has been announced (which is probably a good thing, because it seems we all need at least a few months to get over The Weeknd’s haircut).
