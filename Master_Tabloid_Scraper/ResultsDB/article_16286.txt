Sarah Hyland debuted a brand new ‘do just days before she hits the red carpet at the 2016 Emmys.
The Modern Family star was spotted out and about West Hollywood, Calif. on Wednesday (Sept. 14, 2016) rocking the perfect blonde bob. While many celebs will probably go dark this fall, the actress decided to go with some lighter locks.

“It was just a touch-up, but it looks like a change. It’s always best to do it in stages so the hair remains healthy,” her hairstylist, Nikki Lee, told Us Weekly. “I turned her into a golden goddess so she’s fresh and ready for the Emmys! I think it looks dreamy with her skin tone.”
