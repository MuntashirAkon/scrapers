Halle Berry and Olivier Martinez are putting a hold on their divorce (for the time being).

TMZ acquired a legal document sent to Berry and Martinez by a court clerk that advised the couple that their divorce case would be dismissed if they did not finalize their divorce proceedings that were filed last October. The couple cited “irreconcilable differences” as the cause for their separation. TMZ speculates, after speaking with “multiple” related sources, that neither Berry nor Martinez are in a rush to finalize their divorce while insiders tell E! News that the hold on their separation is due to “continued discussions about money and Maceo,” their two-year-old son.

Berry and Martinez were married for two years before filing for divorce. They released a joint statement following the announcement of their separation that read:
“It is with a heavy heart that we have come to the decision to divorce. We move forward with love and respect for one another and the shared focus for what is best for our son. We wish each other nothing but happiness in life, and we hope that you respect our, and most importantly our children’s privacy, as we go through this difficult period.”
The couple was spotted in public together two weeks after the news went public, leaving the public to wonder whether they were trying to mend their marriage or if they were just trying to remain amicable.
