When it comes to getting frisky, Gwyneth Paltrow thinks toys in the bedroom are worth every dollar—even if it's 15,000 of them. That's right—the Oscar winner just recommended a $15,000 golden dildo, complete with "free discreet shipping" and a 10-year guarantee, on her lifestyle website, GOOP.Well, we certainly hope it lasts at least a decade considering it will take about that time to make a dent in that hefty price tag.  The LELO "INEZ" appeared on the GOOP's "Not-So-Basic Sex Toys" roundup. According to the product's website, the device is "for women who demand the ultimate in luxurious indulgence."  "Sex toys have long since graduated from the floppy rubber things you hide in your bedside table to beautiful works of interactive art," GOOP's feature began. "Below, a few of our favorites for all scenarios."

Among those favorites was this luxury dildo, which stylishly comes in two finishes—either 24-karat gold or stainless steel. For those looking for pleasure for half the price, the latter option rings in at $7,900. For the many who aren't prepared to sink that much of a monthly paycheck into this kind of an investment, Paltrow and her team also recommend the Jimmyjane Form 2 Universal Waterproof Vibrator with a less alarming $149.00 price tag. Now that is much more our speed. The best-selling author has been known to make pretty lavish suggestions on the website. Last year, Paltrow included $50 vagina steams from the Los Angeles Tikkun Spa on a list of recommended spots for saunas, colonics and detoxes. Still, for some, self-love is priceless. As one user adequately wrote in a review of the INEZ, "What could be more luxurious than a golden dildo? Enough said."
