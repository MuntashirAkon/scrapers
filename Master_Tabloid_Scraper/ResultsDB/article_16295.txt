It's been 25 years since Christy Turlington Burns was first the face of Eternity Calvin Klein, and now she's backâ€”and somehow, she hasn't aged a day.If Christy told us she found the fountain of youth, we'd believe her! At 45, she looks as stunning as she did back in 1988 when she first inked a deal with Eternity.But this time Christy isn't going at the fragrance campaign alone. She's brought along her husband Ed Burns, who also stars in the Eternity Night ads with her.

The campaign photos of the famous couple were shot by Inez Van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin (also a couple) in Turks and Caicos. Ed and Christy pose on a beach, looking like one of those impossibly good-looking couples that you are secretly (or not-so-secretly) jealous of.Christy is the founder of Every Mother Counts, a health advocacy campaign for mothers, and for the week of May 30, all of the proceeds from U.S. sales of Eternity Calvin Klein's 25th Anniversary Edition bottles will support the charity.You can scoop up a bottle of the The Eternity Night fragrance, when it's available in June, and Eternity Night Calvin Klein for Men is out in August.
