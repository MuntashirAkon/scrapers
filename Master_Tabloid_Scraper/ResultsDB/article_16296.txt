Looks like Elle Fanning isn't alone!Yesterday we reported that Maleficent actress would be fronting the Miu Miu Spring 2014 campaign and now it turns out rising stars Lupita Nyong'o, Elizabeth Olsen and Bella Heathcote will be joining her.Today the fashion brand released the full campaign, shot by Inez & Vinoodh in New York. The colorful ads feature all four girls in their own images—not as a group. The gals are modeling gorgeous bags, shoes, patterned duds and even pink and yellow stockings.

Of course, the timing couldn't be more perfect. With the 2014 award season kicking off on Sunday, we won't be surprise if a few of these ladies pop up on the red carpet wearing the label—particularly the 12 Years A Slave star.

This is the first fashion spokesmodeling gig for Lupita. Dakota Fanning's 15-year-old sister was previously the face of Marc Jacobs and obviously Olsen has a clothing line named after her.
