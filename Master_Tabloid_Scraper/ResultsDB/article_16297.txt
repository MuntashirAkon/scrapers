ARTPOP Film 

Nudity is nothing new for Lady Gaga, but somehow, she still manages make it shocking. The "Do What U Want" singer released an ARTPOP Film on Wednesday, Nov. 20, which features her in various states of undress. The 27-year-old collaborated with Inez and Vinoodh for the project, which was first unveiled during her secret artRAVE party in Brooklyn on Monday, Nov. 11."This album is a celebration, my pain exploding in electronic music," Gaga says in the intro. "It's heavy but after I listen to it, I feel happy again. I feel lighter."The clip features Gaga modeling a brown wig, purple dreadlocks and a buzz cut. Other scenes show her writhing around in dirt while naked and crying, wearing couture creations and rocking a creepy, toothy grill.

The unveiling of an ARTPOP Films comes as Gaga celebrates her album charting at No. 1 with 258,000 copies sold. It marks the third-largest first-week sales week for a woman in 2013, behind Katy Perry's Prism (286,000) and Miley Cyrus' Bangerz (270,000). Both Perry and Cyrus' albums also hit No. 1.
