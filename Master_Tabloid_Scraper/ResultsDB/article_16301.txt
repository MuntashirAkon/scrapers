Safe to say these pics prove why Gisele Bündchen is the most successful model in the world.The stunning starlet graces the November issue of Vogue Paris and while Tom Brady's missus certainly looks gorgeous in the close-up cover shot, the pics inside the mag are much more revealing.Namely, she strips down completely naked. And, unsurprisingly, looks picture-perfect.The mother of two cheekily captioned the nude pic on her Instagram account, writing, "Opps I think I'm seeing double @vogueparis by @inezvinoodh @emmanuellealt."



Inez van Lamsweerde & Vinoodh Matadin/Vogue Paris

The sexy shot features the 33-year-old beauty interlocking her elbows in a mirror image while wearing a beaded body suit on the right and nothing but socks and a pair of tennis shoes on the left. She sports big wind-blown hair and kicks her leg up in a sexy pose while covering her breasts and leaving little to the imagination.The photographers, Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin, also kindly shared another pic from the November issue in which Vivian Lake's mama wears a beautiful blue gown on the right...and absolutely nothing on the left.

Looking toned and trim as ever, the former Victoria's Secret stunner flaunts her naked bod, arching her back and letting her hair hang down to which we can only say: OMG, that body!

Another pic features the blond beauty in a navy blue beaded gown and—despite the fact that she's covering her face—she still looks perfect.

There's also the close-up cover shot which sees Bündchen sporting a smokey eye, a nude lip, soft curls, diamond earrings and a winter-white jacket.All in all, girl can do no wrong.
