Fans Lose Their Shit As Ryan Reynolds Shares The First Pic Of Josh Brolin As Cable From Deadpool 2!/n

Deadpool ends with a post-credits scene in which the titular antihero teases that longtime X-Men comic book fan favorite Cable would be joining him in the sequel.
Spoiler alert? Well, whatever, too late now.
With the exception of possibly casting Keira Knightley (we heard she wasn't even in the final three!), the Merc with the Mouth made good on his promise.

Ryan Reynolds shared the first look at Josh Brolin as the gruff, half-cyborg, time-traveling mutant from the future (he's actually the son of Cyclops and a clone of Jean Grey), and it is spectacular.
First, Ryan gave us some head, tweeting: 

We all have that one, grumpy, heavily armed Uncle from the future. #PremiumCABLE #JoshBrolin pic.twitter.com/JV3yBIIPQH

And just like that, Twitter shot its nerd load all over the place! See some of the best, funniest, messiest reactions (below)!

DEADPOOL 2's Cable and Domino look better than pretty much anything I've seen in any of the Singer X-MEN movies.

If Deadpool references Cable being Thanos I don't know what I'll do.

Even Cable creator Rob Liefeld was happy with the result!

In case you missed it, RyRey gave us our first look at other new addition to the Deadpool team, Zazie Beetz' Domino, last week.
