The recording, a heartbreaking cover of Simon & Garfunkel's Bridge Over Troubled Water, also features vocals from Robbie Williams, Bastille, Geri Halliwell, James Blunt, Nile Rodgers, the London Community Gospel Choir, and more British artists.
As for the survivors, the government has acquired 68 luxury apartments in neighboring Kensington to permanently house those left homeless by the fire. The lavish complex includes a 24-hour concierge, swimming pool, and private cinema.
City communities secretary Sajid Javid made the announcement on Wednesday afternoon, saying "it is our duty to support" the residents of Grenfell Tower, whose lives — and, in some tragic cases, loved ones — literally went up in flames.
Our heart goes out to all those affected by this horrible incident. Take a listen to the moving song (below).
