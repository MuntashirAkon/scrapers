On a night when so many things went wrong, Kris Jenner added the cherry to the shitstorm sundae that is the 2017 Academy Awards by publicly proclaiming her ignorance on live television.

While giving her fashion commentary during E!’s red carpet coverage on Sunday night (Feb. 26, 2017), Jenner let it be known she knew nothing about the American Civil Liberties Union, an organization that advocates human rights and is currently working overtime in the face of President Donald Trump’s Muslim ban, when she questioned the blue ribbons many celebrities were wearing in support of the non-profit.
Giving her critique of Oscar nominee Ruth Negga’s red Valentino gown, the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star quipped, “What is the little blue thing she has there?”

“This is the first one I’ve seen,” Jenner remarked after host Giuliana Rancic explained to her its meaning and directed her an article about the pin.
The momager was then promptly dragged by Twitter for, well, not reading up on current events that affect many minorities in America.

Kris Jenner thinks ACLU is UCLA.

Rancic, who experienced backlash in the past for ignorantly presuming that Zendaya smelled of Pachouli oil for wearing dreadlocks on the red carpet, was also roasted for blasé and dumbed down explanation.
“It’s all about um, human rights.” Giuliani Rancic could not say more than 2 words about the ACLU ribbon to a clueless Kris Jenner. #Oscars

Giuliana Rancic trying to explain the ACLU blue ribbons at the Oscars to Kris Jenner: “it’s about people’s rights and stuff.” Ohhhhhh 💔

The ACLU’s official Twitter account even responded to Jenner’s comment, writing,”It’s a ribbon that says you stand for people’s rights, @krisjenner!”
A source later told Radar Online that Jenner “absolutely flipped out when the cameras stopped rolling,” saying, “Kris accused producers of trying to sabotage her. She actually went on to say that it was their fault that they did not inform her of what the blue ribbons signified.”
Aside from Negga, celebrities like Lin-Manuel Miranda, Karlie Kloss, Busy Philipps and Moonlight director Barry Jenkins were seen sporting an ACLU ribbon at the awards ceremony. At an Oscars after-party, newly-minted Academy Award winner Emma Stone was also spotted with a blue pin on her second outfit of the night (she was previously wearing a small gold Planned Parenthood badge on her Givenchy gown).
