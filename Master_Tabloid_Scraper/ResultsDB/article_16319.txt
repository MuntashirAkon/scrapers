Fall is the transition season that everyone loves, but keeping up with the weather can get tricky.
You still keep some of your summer clothes out for the occasional warm day and steadily start bringing your winter clothes out of storage. Some days you’ll need more coverage than a sweater, but it is too soon for a full blown winter coat. This in-between weather calls for extra warmth but not too much. Find the perfect balance with these fall jackets that are perfect for this transition period.
Denim jackets are one of the more casual options for fall outerwear. They can be worn with any simple combination of a shirt and jeans. Denim jackets are also mostly light weight, but for added warmth it is easy to layer sweaters underneath them. Some jackets even come lined with fur if you need extra warmth. They are available in any denim wash you can think of, black, dark wash, light wash and even colorful washes.

Bomber jackers are slightly more dressy than denim ones but can still capture a casual style. The texture of these jackets are what makes them dressier. They are most commonly made in satin or nylon material, which give them that signature sheen. Bomber jackets can still be worn with a t-shirt and jeans, but you can also throw a dressy button down into the rotation to be more formal. Grabbing a bomber with a different texture or design than the classic ones is another way to look more formal.
