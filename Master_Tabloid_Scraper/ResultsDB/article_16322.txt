A four-hour memorial concert for Prince finally took place on Thursday night (Oct. 13, 2016) after much ado about scheduling conflicts amid performers.

Though John Mayer dropped out of the lineup earlier in the week due conflicting recording obligations with his band and Jessie J stepped in to replace Christina Aguilera hours before showtime, President Obama kicked off the concert with a short video message in which he addressed the late singer directly. “Thank you, Prince, for all the great works you have done. You will be in our hearts forever,” said Obama.
Stevie Wonder and Chaka Khan performed together, duetting on “1999” and “I Feel For You.” Other performers included Tori Kelly, Nicole Scherzinger, Anita Baker, Doug E. Fresh, and Bilal.

Prince’s ex-wife Mayte Garcia also recreated a segment of his 1993 Act I tour by performing a belly dance with a sword balanced on her head.

Wonder gave a speech about how he will “miss Prince forever” before playing the final live number, “Superstition.” Purple confetti rained upon the audience as the concert concluded with the band playing “Purple Rain” with Prince’s pre-recorded vocals.
“I want [fans] to get some closure,” Prince’s sister Tyka Nelson told the BBC. “It takes time to kind of get over it, and I see that they are grief-stricken.”
