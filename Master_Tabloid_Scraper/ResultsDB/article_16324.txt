The FBI has been dragged into Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt’s divorce after allegations of child abuse surfaced.

As previously reported, Pitt was accused of committing verbal and physical abuse on his children during an incident on a private plane last week. Sources claimed the actor was drunk when the altercation occurred and someone either on the flight or the tarmac reported it to authorities. Jolie, who filed for divorce on Monday (Sept. 20, 2016), and Pitt reportedly had an interview with the L.A. County Dept. of Children and Family Services regarding the matter.

Now, TMZ is reporting that the Federal Bureau of Investigations — and not the Los Angeles Police Department — have been called upon to investigate Pitt since the alleged incident occurred in the air during flight from France to the U.S. As the LAPD doesn’t not have jurisdiction, their Abused Child Unit has closed its case and referred it to the FBI.
Sources close to the situation previously told People the incident was what led Jolie to file for divorce. “She sat down, talked to Brad and offered to file [for divorce] together,” an insider revealed. “She said, ‘This is what I’d like to do.’ She explained everything. Angelina did what she felt she needed to do.”
Jolie and Pitt have been married since 2014 and share six children together. In the divorce papers, Jolie asks for physical custody of all their children with only joint legal custody for Pitt.
