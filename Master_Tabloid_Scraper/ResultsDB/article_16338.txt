While backstage at Monique Lhuillier's spring 2017 NYFW show, Essie's lead nail artist and celeb manicurist Julie Kandalec let us in on a super simple yet often overlooked tip on how to keep your cuticles clean."I always tell my girls not to go all the way to the edge of the nail [when applying any shade]," said the pro. "Because remover will emulsify [a.k.a. liquefy] the polish and it'll bleed onto the skin." If you're a model during fashion month who gets their nails done sometimes five to six times a day or just the type to always have your nails done, then you know just how annoying it can be when past-polish residue lingers and is there days later. 

Since she also let us know that dark shades like blues, metallics and reds (she was applying Essie's popular color Wicked to the models hands before the show), are hot this season, it's especially important to keep this in mind.So, if you do your own nails or get them done often, get close but try not to get paint into those cuticle lines.
