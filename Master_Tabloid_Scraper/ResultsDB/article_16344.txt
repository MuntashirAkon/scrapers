When it comes to signature style, what's worse than trying to re-up on your can't-live-without-it lipstick shade, only to find that it's been discontinued?Martha Stewart feels our pain. In her Into The Gloss interview, she laments the loss of an all-time-favorite eyeliner, once made by Parisian brand T. LeClerc, now discontinued. And she's holding on to those liner stubs for dear life."My stick is seven years old," she said. "I had about 10 when I first started my daily TV show, and I just add water and use a tiny little brush to line the top of the eye and under the lash. If I wear it, I don't feel like I need mascara. They really need to start making that again."

If anyone can single-handedly bring back a long lost liner, it's the lifestyle queen. Other beauty fans have certainly done the same.Recalling Cindy Crawfords glamazonian ads for Revlon, in which she wore a rich cocoa color called Sandstorm, fans took to social media to vote for its resurrection and brought the shade back into production and onto shelves.

Classic fashion "It" items have also re-emerged by popular demand. Last year, journalist Jenni Avins wrote an impassioned open letter to J.Crew on New York magazine's fashion blog, The Cut, in which she plead for the brand to re-issue its iconic scoop-back one piece swimsuit.J. Crew creative director and president Jenna Lyons responded in kind by reissuing the classic. She announced its comeback in a New York magazine ad that read, "Dear Ms. Avins, Your wish is my command...within reason. XO Jenna."If the Internet and social media have given us anything, it's the ability to jolt companies into giving us the products that we want.So what's the next cult classic poised to make a comeback with a little help from its fans? We're betting on the elusive Essie nail polish shade, Starry Starry Night, a deep sparkle-dotted navy shade, which was sold on eBay for $250 last year. Cue the #WeOwnTheStarryStarryNight Twitter campaign—who's with us?
