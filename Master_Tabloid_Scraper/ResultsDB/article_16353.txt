It's War! Vicki & Tamra Feud EXPLODES Over 'RHOC' Salary Dispute/n
The Real Housewives of Orange County’s signature blondes — Vicki Gunvalson and frenemy Tamra Judge — are already at each other’s throats!
RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned that Judge, 49, is desperately trying to get on 55-year-old Gunvalson’s good side for this season, but the OG of the RHOC is not having any of it.

“Tamra knows that Vicki has some serious dirt on her, and she really wants to soothe things over so that Vicki does not go into full attack mode this year,” a source close to production for the hit Bravo show said.
But perhaps the real reason for the battle of the blondes comes down to the huge difference in salary that each is earning this upcoming season. While Gunvalson is earning a whopping $750,000, Judge is only pulling in $600,000 to return to season 12, one insider told Radar. (A Bravo source said those numbers were false.)
“Tamra is of course upset that Vicki is getting paid so much more money than her because she feels like she is the reason that viewers will want to tune in,” said the source. “Tamra honestly thinks the entire show should revolve around her and that she should be the highest paid out of all of them.”

As Radar previously reported, Gunvalson’s nasty feud with Judge, which has gone on for several seasons, exploded two years ago when Judge and her ally, Shannon Beador, 53,  ganged up on Gunvalson and tried to get her fired from the show over claims that she knowingly lied about her ex, Brooks Ayers, faking a cancer diagnosis !
