Kandi SLAMS Nemesis Porsha In Nastiest ‘RHOA’ Reunion EVER/n
It’s been months since Porsha Williams accused her friend turned nemesis Kandi Burruss of attempting to drug and sexually assault her — an outrageous claim the mother of two vehemently denied.
But in a new preview clip for The Real Housewives of Atlanta reunion, it’s clear time hasn’t healed all wounds.
Burruss, 40, erupts into angry tears as she explodes on Williams, 35.
“You accuse me of being a f***ing rapist!” she screams. “The lies, the lies!”

But rather than retaliate, Williams claims she was served a cease and desist letter, and tells Burruss to take it up with ally Phaedra Parks.
“What?!” Burruss responds.
The video ends with both women storming off stage in hysterics.
As RadarOnline.com previously reported, Williams kicked off the season by claiming Burruss and husband Todd Tucker got freaky with other women in an alleged secret sex dungeon in their home. She even alleged that Burruss attempted to seduce her on a drunken night out.

Burruss retaliated by exposing text messages that painted Williams as the aggressor for a lesbian love affair.
“Kandi thinks Porsha is a low-rent troublemaker,” a source huffed. “She knows she’s only making drama to keep her spot on the show!”
