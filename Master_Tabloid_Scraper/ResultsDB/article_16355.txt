'VPR' Mean Girls Attack! Scheana & Lala Set Their Sights On New SUR-ver/n
Scheana Marie and Lala Kent have a new ally in their fight against Stassi Schroeder, Kristen Doute and Katie Maloney!
“I love Scheana and Lala,” new SURver Elisa Jordana told RadarOnline.com exclusively. “They’re my favorites.”
“They’re just so sweet,” she claimed. “Scheana was unbelievable to me immediately. Like, she’s just the sweetest person in the world. They’re so pretty and just lovely.”

As for Marie, “She’s so inclusive,” Jordana said. “She’s just so nice. You can tell she has a really good heart. She’s really not affected by anything. She’s just a true, true soul. I really like her a lot.”
Lisa Vanderpump hired Jordana in February after tweeting that she was looking for a new hostess. Now, the Kermit and Friends podcast host loves her time at SUR, and doesn’t miss New York or Howard Stern at all.
But, her new bestie Kent, 25, didn’t enjoy her time at SUR nearly as much — and even quit her job half way through season five of Vanderpump Rules because of her co-stars’ bullying!

Kent then joined forces with Marie, 31, to fight against the “Witches of WeHo” (Katie Maloney, Kristen Doute and Stassi Schroeder) at the reunion.
The SUR-vers’ catfight began last summer when Kent was accused of fat-shaming Maloney and Schroeder during a filming break. Marie ditched Kent to secure her spot in Maloney’s bridal party last summer, but rekindled their friendship after she filed for divorce from Mike Shay.
