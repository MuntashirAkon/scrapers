Brad Pitt's Allied Gets Teaser Trailer: Why It Already Looks Like a Dramatic Version of Mr. and Mrs. Smith Here is what struck us in particular: The love story: While Pitt and Jolie didn't know the other was a spy, they ultimately fell in (forbidden).../n
Brad Pitt is putting his spy hat on yet again.No stranger to war movies, having appeared in Inglourious Basterds and Fury, Pitt has learned a thing or two about war and spies. In his upcoming movie, Allied, Pitt stars as an intelligence officer in North Africa who forms a relationship with a French resistance fighter played by Marion Cotillard. With the pressures of war looming over them, Pitt and Cotillard's relationship becomes a risk.If the plot seems vaguely familiar, you wouldn't be wrong. A drama film taking place in the height of World War II, Allied still manages to give give us Mr. and Mrs. Smith vibes, if only because of the chemistry between Pitt and Cotillard, as well as the whole spy plot. While Mr. and Mrs. Smith, which starred Pitt and now-wife Angelina Jolie, was an action comedy, it easily shares some similar qualities.

Here is what struck us in particular:The love story: While Pitt and Jolie didn't know the other was a spy, they ultimately fell in (forbidden) love and became a real couple, much to the chagrin of their spy bosses. In Allied, it appears that Pitt and Cotillard's love might also be a bad idea, give her status as a resistance fighter and his job as an intelligence officer. 

The women and their weapons: Both Cotillard and Jolie prove that they know what they're doing with a gun in hand. Whether it's Jolie's sniper knowledge or Cotillard's rifle work, both women are rocking the same powerhouse skills (and stance).

The steamy scenes: Just look at the passion! Maybe it doesn't matter with whom Pitt is partnered because he has sizzlin' chemistry with everyone. Do you see anymore similarities after watching the trailer? Sound off in the comments!Allied hits theaters Nov. 23, 2016.
