Too Cute! Amber Rose’s 4-Year-Old Son Goes on a ‘Date’/n
They grow up so fast!
Amber Rose‘s 4-year-old son Sebastian Taylor spent Friday in the company of a young lady friend, on what Rose noted was a “date.”
“‘Mom stop kissing me I’m on a date,’ ” Rose wrote in the caption of an adorable photo of Sebastian and his female friend.
Sebastian seemed to be doing great, too, sitting next to his friend on matching chairs in front of Rose’s coffee table — and munching on snacks as Moana played on the screen in front of them.
