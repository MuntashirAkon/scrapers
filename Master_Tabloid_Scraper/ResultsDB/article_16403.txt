Porn Honcho -- More Adult Film Stars Should Read to Kids!/nVivid Entertainment president Steven Hirsch thinks Sasha Grey is the porn version of Jackie Robinson ... hoping she's opened the door for other adult stars to read books to kids.As TMZ first reported, Sasha read children's books at Emerson Elementary School in Compton on November 2 as part of the Read Across America program. Even though we have photos of Sasha reading to kids, a rep for the school denies she was ever there. Regardless, Hirsch fired off a letter commending the school for allowing Grey to appear. In the letter, Hirsch offers up two of his stars -- Chyna and Allie Haze -- as possible future volunteers.So he's saying there are three porn stars who can read? Who knew? /n
