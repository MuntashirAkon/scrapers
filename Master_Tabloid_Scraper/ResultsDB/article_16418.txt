George & Amal Clooney Welcome Twins Ella & Alexander/n
George and Amal Clooney have officially become parents! The couple welcomed twins, a boy and a girl, on Tuesday, Radar can confirm.
“This morning Amal and George welcomed Ella and Alexander Clooney into their lives. Ella, Alexander and Amal are all healthy, happy and doing fine,” the proud papa told Radar.  He then joked: “George is sedated and should recover in a few days.”
As Radar reported, the couple had been happily hiding out in their lavish British estate as they awaited the double arrival.

“George isn’t planning on traveling anywhere now that the due date is so close,” a source told Radar last month. “Amal could give birth early. George doesn’t want to miss anything.”
And the new parents spared no expense to ensure they had a healthy delivery, dropping over a million dollars to provide the best doctors and experience possible.
Sources say that included reserving an entire hospital wing, flying in a masseuse from Italy and even booking the British royals’ baby nurse!

Of course, as Radar revealed, the sex of the babies comes as no surprise. George’s own mother, Nina, revealed what the happy couple would have back in March.
“It will be one of each! Yes, a boy and a girl. That’s what I’ve been told,” Nina Clooney, 77, told Radar from her home in Augusta, Kentucky. “How marvelous! My husband and I are extremely excited.”
Congratulations to the happy couple!
