Scott Disick: Furious & THREATENED By Kourtney’s New Boytoy/n
When Kourtney Kardashian went public on May 2 with her latest boytoy, 23-year-old former boxer Younes Bendjima, it put her ex Scott Disick on the ropes.
“Scott was blindsided,” an insider explains. “He really thought he and Kourt were working their way toward getting back together.”
But instead of doubling down on dedication to his baby mama,
Scott has chosen to drown his sorrows in L.A.’s nightclubs and flaunt his own latest flame, 19-year-old model Ella Ross.
Even worse, he’s “determined to split up Kourtney and Younes,” the source says —
and won’t hesitate to use his kids to do it: “He’s having a lawyer draw up an agreement that states Younes can’t be around the children.
It’s ridiculous, but Scott’s threatened and wants Younes out of the picture.” /n
