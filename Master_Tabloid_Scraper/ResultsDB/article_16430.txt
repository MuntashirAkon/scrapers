So, what will Middleton be up to before she pops?
Umm, EVERYTHING! 
The glowing momma reportedly has three engagements lined up to support youths in London. The three days will be jam packed â€” first Kate and Prince William will tour the Stephen Lawrence Centre, a place for "community learning and social research". After the tour, the couple will meet with teens and watch an Arts Showcase presentation by some of the charity's Arts program alumni.
Finally, the pair will visit a community bus and mobile recording studio to meet with a group of kids who've become intimately involved with the charity and they'll hear about the issues they have faced.
Wow! What a packed schedule! We admire that the 33-year-old is using her time in such a positive way before she gives birth to baby number two!!
Enjoy your last few weeks in the public eye, girl!
