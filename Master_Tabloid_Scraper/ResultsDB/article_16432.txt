The royals recently placed an ad in The Lady, which is a publication for "elegant women with elegant minds," which is a totally normal thing to do, even if you're a prince and duchess.
It is a 10-room house, Anmer Hall, which is located in Norfolk, 120 miles north of London. It's finally finished being renovated, and now they need some help!
In case you're innerested, the job description reads:

"Housekeeper sought for a large family home in Norfolk. We are looking for someone with previous housekeeping experience, ideally within a large private house, and preferably within a family environment with dogs.
Main duties will include: cleaning all areas of the house to a high standard; caring for and maintaining the home owners' clothing; cleaning silverware and glassware; purchasing groceries and general provisions for the house; and dealing with deliveries. On occasions, the role will also involve the preparation of meals, assisting with childcare and caring for dogs.
Discretion and loyalty is paramount and a current valid UK driving licence is essential.
The Housekeeper will be required Monday to Friday, but with the flexibility to work during the weekend on occasion, and to work additional hours if ever required.
Self-contained accommodation will be provided (suitable for a couple). The partner may be offered ad hoc maintenance work, although there is no guaranteed work provided for them."
Of course, they already have nanny Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo to look after Prince George, so at least some pressure will be taken off there.
Would U be up for the job???
