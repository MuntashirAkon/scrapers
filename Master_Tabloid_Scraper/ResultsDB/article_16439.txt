It’s been a supremely busy week for Kate Middleton and her growing baby bump. Friday was no different, as the pregnant Duchess of Cambridge joined the British royal family for a service at St Paul’s Cathedral in London.

Middleton, who was on hand with Prince William, Prince Harry and company to honor troops stationed in Afghanistan, stepped out in a chic navy blue Beulah London coat, along with a matching fascinator, clutch and navy blue pumps.
The Duke of Cambridge, meanwhile, looked slick in his Royal Air Force uniform.
The commemoration service comes one day after the Duchess, 33, dropped by Ealing Studios in London to tour the set of Downton Abbey. Prince George’s mother also attended a Commonwealth Day service with the royal family earlier this week and on Wednesday, made an appearance at the Turner Contemporary gallery in Margate.
The Duchess is due to give birth next month.
