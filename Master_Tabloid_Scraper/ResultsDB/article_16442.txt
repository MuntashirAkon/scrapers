Kate Middleton Hosts a Dinner, Rocks a New Hair Do/n
Tonight, the Duchess of Cambridge hosted a gala dinner for 100 Women in Hedgefunds, a event put on to support Action on Addiction.
A patron of both organizations, Catherine attended her first 100 WHF dinner in October 2011, for which she chose to wear a red gown by Beulah London.

Guests at the event have reportedly paid nearly $100,000 for a table, according to the Mirror.
HuffPoUK’s picture desk tweeted the first photos from tonight, featuring Her Royal Highness in an ink blue gown to the dinner from Jenny Packham’s Autumn/Winter 2013 collection (Thanks to royal watcher Kelly Matthews for that outfit ID).

Catherine didn’t have to travel far, as the outing was just a stone’s throw from her new home at Kensington Palace.  It’s believed that Prince George is at home with Prince William and the couple’s nanny, Jessie Webb.
The new mom spoke to Sky News about yesterday’s historic christening and how well-behaved her three-month-old son was.
“He was such a good boy actually. We were very lucky, he’s not always like that.”
William and Catherine will host a Winter Whites Gala on November 26th, in aid of Centrepoint.
