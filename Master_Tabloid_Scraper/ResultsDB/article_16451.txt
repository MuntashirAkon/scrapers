TV: Wednesday Hot List/n
We’re starting to LOVE Wednesday nights more and more now that we have Modern Family and Top Chef Masters to look forward to (and rumor has it that in the coming week, the cast of Modern Family will actually be on Top Chef Masters!) Anyway, both shows sound fab tonight. On Modern Family, Jay and Phil vie to coach Manny and Luke’s basketball team while Claire and Gloria commiserate about their kids getting older! And, on Top Chef Masters, accomplished foodies Carmen Gonzalez, David Burke, Marcus Samuelsson, Monica Pope and Thierry Rautureau have to create the menu for Mekhi Phifer‘s birthday bash!
And, we saw good-bye too soon tonight to our beloved Ugly Betty. On the series finale, Betty frets about telling Daniel she is planning to leave Mode magazine, Amanda mourns the loss of her dog, Justin convinces Hilda to move to the city and Marc is discouraged by his romantic prospects. We’ll miss this show and hope to see the cast find great, new projects soon!
