Well according to a source close to the couple, we now know the name of their cute bundle of joy…
And it's a little strange!
You can call their child… 
Rocket Zot!… Say what?!
If you think the Avatar actor and the 27-year-old went through the painstaking process of culling through baby monikers… think again!
The insider said the star and the model chose the title simply because:
"They just liked it!"
Sounds like a good enough of a reason for us!
However, the photogenic twosome decided on the middle name "Zot" because it was Miz Bingle's father's nickname. She was very close with her papa — Graham Bingle — who died in 2008 from liver cancer.
So touching!
Congratulations to Sam, Lara, and Rocket for the launch of their new family!
P.S. Pharrell and Robert Rodriguez also have sons named Rocket! Small world!
