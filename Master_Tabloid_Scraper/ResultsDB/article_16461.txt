 Celebs! They’re just like us.
At last night’s Keep A Child Alive Black Ball 2014, superstars Madonna and Kanye West took an epic selfie together.

The self-proclaimed “self-obsessed”, #unapologeticbitches snapped the selfie last night (October 30th), which Madonna posted to her Instagram, thus alluding that Madonna and Kanye are, like, totally BFF’s.



Self Obsession much? #unapologeticbitches
