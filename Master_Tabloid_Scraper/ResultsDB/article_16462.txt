Prince Harry Broke His Toe, Needs a Cuddle/n
Royal reporter Phil Dampier tweeted this morning that Prince Harry has a broken toe, bad timing given that he’s about to embark on a mission to the South Pole.
CNN”s Max Foster confirmed with Kensington Palace that is, in fact, is true.   They would not, however, comment on how it happened.

“Prince Harry does have a broken toe but his trip to the South Pole is not in doubt,” an aide told Foster.
Some of Harry’s Walking With the Wounded teammates are amputees, so a broken toe won’t stop the prince from competing against other countries come November.
Funds are being raised to help injured servicemen and women.
