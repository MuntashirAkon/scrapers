Almost Time? Will And Kate Leave Bucklebury For London/n
While everyone is on edge waiting for the Duchess of Cambridge to go into labor, The Sun thought it would have a laugh by sending Will and Kate lookalikes down to St. Mary’s Lindo Wing today.
PS- No one was amused.
Meanwhile, a few outlets are reporting that the Duke and Duchess have left her parents’ Bucklebury home en route to London, where the Duchess is planning to give birth.
The Kent and Sussex Courier spoke to royal reporter Phil Dampier today, who lives near the Middletons.
“It looks like it’s starting to happen,” Dampier told the paper.
E! News spoke to sources, who claimed that no helicopters were around when they left.  Royal protection offiers left the family home as well.
