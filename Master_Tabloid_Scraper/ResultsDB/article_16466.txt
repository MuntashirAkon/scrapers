 Throughout his career, Quentin Tarantino has often courted controversy – violence, language, and even the very subjects of his films have attracted criticism and debate. In Django Unchained, Tarantino tackles no less than America’s history of slavery with his first “Southern,” which one of the film’s co-stars, Sammi Rotibi, says addresses it in a remarkable, unique way.
“When I read the script, it was funny,” Rotibi told Celebuzz. “Honestly, I’ve never read a script where they used so many n-words, but it was written in a really tasteful way, a funny way.”

Although the film is set in the antebellum South, and focuses on a slave (Jamie Foxx) who is offered his freedom in exchange for helping a bounty hunter (Christoph Waltz) track down three fugitive siblings, Rotibi said that it has a decidedly sweeter focus than its premise suggests.

“It’s really a love story between Django and Broomhilda, it just so happens to be back in the slave trade,” he said.
“Obviously I feel offended at certain things that happened back then,” he said when asked if he had any concerns about playing a slave, even in a film written and directed by Tarantino. “But I really enjoyed the script and I just felt fortunate to be a part of this. I think it kind of also reminds you of what happened, but it does it in a light way.”
Django Unchained opens nationwide December 25. Watch the film’s theatrical trailer below.
