Molly Ringwald: Pregnant With Twins!/n
It seems as though Molly Ringwald’s day job is catching up to her!
The 40-year-old actress, who currently stars as the mom of a pregnant teen, Shailene Woodley, on ABC Family’s The Secret Life of the American Teenager, has just announced that she is pregnant with twins!
This will be the second daughter and first son for the well-loved redhead and her husband of one year, Panio Gianopoulos, who have a 5 year old daughter, Mathilda Ereni. The twins are expected in August.
Ringwald has been in the public eye since the 80’s, when she starred in widly popular movies, like Sixteen Candles and The Breakfast Club.
Lucky for Molly, there will be no need to hide her growing belly on set, since the directors of Secret Life have alleged plans to write her pregnancy into the script!
The controversial show, in it’s second season, is doing considerably well, with 4 million viewers and a number one ranking in it’s Monday night time slot. It also won a Teen Choice Award last year for Choice Summer TV Show.
Our congratulations go out to Molly and her husband!
