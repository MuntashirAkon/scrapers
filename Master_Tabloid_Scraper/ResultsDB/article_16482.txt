All hippos go to heaven.We must keep that in mind as we mourn the loss of Prince Harry the pygmy hippo. The royally adorable tiny calf passed away Wednesday morning, the Cango Wildlife Ranch in Oudtshoorn, South Africa posted on their website. Prince Harry, who was rejected by his mother Hilda at birth, was raised by devoted human caretakers. The 7-week-old mammal died after undergoing surgery to repair a hernia. 

He went into respiratory arrest and then suffered heart failure. Then, despite "repeated attempts to resuscitate him, he passed away on the operating table," according to the sanctuary's website.Toni Iggs, one of Harry's primary caretakers, is "completely devastated, as are all the staff at the Cango Wildlife Ranch." Prince Harry became a worldwide phenomenon due to his adorable appearance and regal namesake. E! News put him and Beyoncé the tiny dachshund mix in an adorable animal face-off last month (Harry dominated that one); the real prince's rumored girlfriend, Mollie King, professed her love for the pygmy hippo, but denied any romantic ties to the spare heir himself.Prince Harry the pygmy hippo, you will be sorely missed.
