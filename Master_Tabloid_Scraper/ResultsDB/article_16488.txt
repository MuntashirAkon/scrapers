Ugly Betty forever!This past Sunday marked the fifth anniversary of the series' finale, and it also happened to be the day after America Ferrera's 31st birthday! So, in true Mode style, several cast members got together in New York (at Kinfolk, a coffee shop/lounge in Brooklyn, to be precise)—including  Judith Light, Mark Indelicato, Vanessa Williams, Tony Plana and Ugly Betty costume designer Patricia Field.Williams, aka the always conniving Wilhelmina Slater, tweeted a photo of the get-together. As you can see, each and every member of Ugly Betty's fashion family looks happy about the informal reunion!

Indelicato, who played Betty's fashion-obsessed nephew Justin Suarez on the show, shared a sweet snap of himself and Ferrera, calling her "My [Heart] and soul."Ana Ortiz, who played Betty's big sister Hilda Suarez, and Victor Nelli, the show's director, couldn't make it to the reunion IRL, but they still celebrated the show and Ferrera! 

Nelli Instagrammed a photo of the pals toasting, adding jokingly, "I blew off @americaferrera birthday party to hang with this cool chica @therealanaortiz Happy B-Day old lady."Eric Mabius (Daniel Meade) couldn't be there either, but both he and Michael Urie (Marc St. James) made sure to pay tribute to Ugly Betty's legacy on Twitter!

It's pretty obvious that the Ugly Betty bond is strong. As Ferrera told the U.K.'s Independent last year, "...what I kept from Betty was my friends because the cast is my family and they were all at my wedding and we've all been to each other's hospital rooms when babies were born and graduations and weddings and birthday parties and life moments."So sweet!
