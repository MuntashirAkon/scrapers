It doesn't get any more star-studded than this!Meryl Streep, Neil Patrick Harris, Nicole Kidman and Cate Blanchett, along with their significant others, celebrated the Oscars the only way they could—by grabbing a delicious dinner afterwards!The whole gang, which also included Stephen Huvane and Keith Urban, cozied up in a booth at The Palm in Beverly Hills where Bruce Bozzi, the executive vice president of the Palm Restaurant Group, Instagrammed a photo of the A-list crew."Cozy post Oscar Supper The Palm #beverlyhills #hilda #NPH #Huvane #Mr.Gummer #Ms. Streep .#Ms.Kidman #Mr.Urban #Burkta #Madame Blanchett #oscarsunday Kevin Huvane ROCKS!!!!!! So what's at this table? 5-6-7 Oscars, Emmy's, CMA's...Grammy? how many Tony's....and a well deserved 10%!! #K&H," Bozzi captioned the pic.Of course, this was before many of the Academy-Award winners attended the post-Oscars Vanity Fair after-party, which Streep skipped out on! Perhaps she enjoyed too much steak? We may never know...

What we do know, however, is that the stars had an intense discussion at dinner about NPH's Oscars prediction case, debating how he managed to pull it off. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, this year's host explained, "I loved hearing their theories, and trying to work out how it was done. Meryl's reaction on camera was my favorite."Because a magician never reveals his methods, the How I Met Your Mother alum wouldn't give up his secret, but insisted that everything was legitimate."Every single thing we said on the show is true: I brought my predictions to PricewaterhouseCoopers, they were held in a locked box until Sunday, walked through the carpet, and locked into that box on stage...No one went near it or touched it. We went to some pretty great lengths to ensure its validity," he explained.So how did he do it?! Yet another secret that might never receive an answer.
