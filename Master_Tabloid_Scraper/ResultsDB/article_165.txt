He took to Instagram over the weekend, sharing: 




Had the amazing pleasure of attending the #CHOC Prom last night. This is one of 4 or 5 rooms they decorated. It was incredible. I Brought Austin Ames out of retirement, I mean Hey it's Prom! Met the best kids & got to dance with my Wife at her 1st Prom. Thanku @warnerbrosentertainment for letting me take the wardrobe out for a night. Big win- IT STILL FITS! #cinderellastory #AustinAmesLives #PrincetonGirl #Nomad #promA post shared by Chad Murray (@chadmurray15) on Jun 25, 2017 at 8:01am PDT

Wow, they look so cute together!
But what makes us even happier about their prom pic together is that they were doing it to support a good cause!
Ch-ch-check out another shot of CMM spreading the joy, as taken by the Orange County Register's Bill Alkofer:




Prom guest Chad Michael Murray greets Liliana Paez Gallardodiring their annual CHOC oncology prom at CHOC Children's hospital in Orange, CA on Saturday. Former and current Childrenâ€™s Hospital of Orange County teen cancer patients and their guests held the annual event with the theme "Alice in Wonderland". The event provides a night of normalcy for teens who may have had to skip their high school proms because they were in the hospital or have weakened immune systems. On Saturday, they dressed in gowns and tuxedos, danced and posed for pictures. Hairdressers and make-up artists helped the teens get ready.
