Lions, And Tigers, And Chanel: Front Row Style Stars At Paris Runway Show/n
Anyone who has seen The Devil Wears Prada, knows that Paris Haute Couture Fashion Week has the swankiest of the swanky runway shows in all of the world. It was no exception at the Chanel Couture Fall Winter 2010 show on Tuesday night, where the coveted front row spots were filled by Jessica Alba, Milla Jovovich, Leighton Meester and Blake Lively, as well as the Devil, Vogue Editor Anna Wintour, herself!
All dressed to impress in distinctively unique looks, the ladies took in the latest high fashions from the iconic French design house during a memorable runway show, which was inspired by the founding fashionista’s zodiac sign: the lion.

While most people were watching the absolutely flawless collection of neutral sheaths, cropped jackets and sequined a-line dresses traipse down the runway, we couldn’t keep our eyes off the stylish starlets! Our fave Gossip Girls were dressed true to their onscreen characters. While Leighton looked super fab and edgy in a sleek Chanel Pre-Fall 2010 embroidered dress, which she paired with a stunning necklace from the same collection and Christian Louboutin booties, Blake opted for an easy and breezy floral dress from the Resort 2011 Collection and a pastel pair of Christian Louboutin Altas.

Jessica Alba stunned in a bright white Spring 2010 frock, piped in red, which she paired with contrastingly dark Christian Loubtouin Bridget Heels.  The mom a la mode sported a loose updo and a flawlessly made up face, which was finished off with red lipstick.
