The talk show host wrote:

"I lost my bear today. She was struggling and I couldn't bear to have her fight anymore."
Although the comedian only had the rescue dog for two years, they developed quite the bond, and the cute pup even had her own Insta account.

"Anyone who doesn't believe a dog changes your life has never rescued one. I only had 2 years with Tammy, but she made sure I never went to bed once without hearing her little paws mount my stairwell 2 paws at a time. If my door was closed, she slept outside my room like a security guard. Dogs give you something you never knew was missing."
Miz Handler plans to "get another dog" to join her family along with her other mutt, Chunk.

I will get another dog that needs a home and it will remind me every day how much I miss you.
