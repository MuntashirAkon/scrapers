Rachel Lindsay Is Ready To Find The One — But What Are The Other Bachelors & Bachelorettes Up To These Days??/n

It's Rachel Lindsay's time to shine!
As you surely know, tonight (May 22) marks the premiere of Miz Lindsay's season of the Bachelorette — and we're just so excited about it! If the teasers for this installment of the ABC dating competition live up to expectation, then we're slated to have a pretty entertaining season on our hands.
We mean, one of Rachel's suitors lists his job as a tickle monster… So bananas.
However since fellow Bachelor vets, Ben Higgins and Lauren Bushnell, have called it quits on their relationship we're a little nervous about what's in store for the Dallas-based lawyer down the line.
Not to mention, there are plenty of Bachelors and Bachelorettes who get engaged and don't make it to the altar. Be sure to discover their fates for yourself (below)…
