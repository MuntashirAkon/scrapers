Christina El Moussa just got inked.

The Flip or Flop star showed off a new tattoo on Instagram Thursday (May 18, 2017), debuting a design featuring 6-year-old daughter Taylor and 1-year-old son Brayden’s birthdays on her wrist.
“Been wanting this for a long time,” she captioned a photo of the tat. “No time like the present. #taylorreese #braydenjames.”

The fresh ink comes shortly after the 33-year-old announced she was reuniting with estranged husband Tarek El Moussa — who filed for divorce this January — for an extended seventh season of their popular HGTV show. Though Christina and Tarek’s tumultuous marriage was exposed last year when cops were called to their Orange County home following an explosive domestic dispute, the two remained adamant on continuing to be co-parents and colleagues.
On Monday (May 15, 2017), Tarek shared a photo of his children and praised his ex for being a good mom. “I’m a day late and a dollar short, but I want to wish Christina a happy Mother’s Day,” he wrote on Instagram. “Tay and Bray love her to the moon and back!”
