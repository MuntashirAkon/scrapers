Jamie Lynn Spears’ daughter, Maddie Aldridge, is conscious after nearly drowning in an ATV accident over the weekend.

The 8-year-old, who was rushed to a Louisiana hospital Sunday (Feb. 5, 2017) after her all-terrain vehicle was flipped into a pond, is awake and aware of her surroundings. According to a statement released by Tangipahoa Parish Sheriff’s Department, the child is on the mend following the harrowing experience.
“With her father, mother and stepfather by her side, Maddie regained consciousness mid-day Tuesday, February 7,” the statement, provided to People, read. “The 8-year-old daughter of entertainer Jamie Lynn Spears was involved in an ATV accident at a family home Sunday in Kentwood, La. Paramedics resuscitated her and she was airlifted to a local hospital. She is aware of her surroundings and recognizes those family members who have kept a round-the-clock vigil since the accident.”

 “Doctors were able to remove the ventilator today and she is awake and talking. Maddie continues to receive oxygen and is being monitored closely but it appears that she has not suffered any neurological consequences from the accident,” the statement continued.
As previously reported, Maddie was driving the Polaris ATV she received for her birthday when she made a sharp turn to avoid a drainage ditch, causing the vehicle to fall into a nearby body of water. She was reportedly submerged for several minutes as Jamie Lynn rushed to free her daughter from the safety straps.
According to the owner’s manual, children under 10 should not operate or ride as a passenger in the vehicle.
Maddie’s aunt, Britney Spears, recently asked friends and fans for support, tweeting:
