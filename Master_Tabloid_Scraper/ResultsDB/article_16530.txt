Bride-to-Be Who Wants to Shed 30 Lbs. Before Her Wedding Tears Up While Dress Shopping on Altar'd
/n

For many brides, trying on wedding dresses is an emotional process.
For Gina Shansey — who appears on the new weight loss reality show Altar’d that follows six engaged couples trying to lose weight before walking down the aisle — the experience is even more pressure-filled than usual.
The bride-to-be, 36, is determined to lose between 30 and 40 lbs. before she says “I do” only 82 days after this early dress shopping appointment. In an exclusive clip, Shansey starts crying when the bridal stylist recommends she orders her dream princess-inspired wedding dress in a size 12 rather than her current size 20.
“That’s a little scary because what if I don’t make it? I can’t visualize myself that little yet,” Shansey says in the clip. “I don’t know why I’m getting so emotional. I want to feel comfortable in my skin. If I was that small again, I’d feel a lot better and more like myself.”
Shansey admits to the camera that she isn’t sure if she will be able to achieve her weight loss goals.
“I don’t even know if I can do it,” she says. “I haven’t been that small in a really long time. I don’t even know when the last time I was, probably high school. I know I can lose weight, but can I get down to that size? I don’t know. I have to let go of a lot of stuff that I’ve been holding onto. It’s hard. I feel really vulnerable. It’s kind of like having an open wound — it’s all out there.”
