We’d gladly take this consolidation prize any day.

While not everyone can walk away with a golden gramophone at the Grammy Awards, performers and presenters do get to take home pricey and expensive swag simply for showing up to the ceremony.
This year, celebrities like Adele, Lady Gaga, Beyoncé and Katy Perry were sent home with thank you gifts ranging from gourmet chocolates and designer jewelry to a 10-year supply of makeup and a one-week spa trip worth over $8,000. According to Distinctive Assets, who produced the 2017 Grammy Awards gift bag, this year’s goodies had a combined value of more than $30,000!
