Chrissy Teigen, Kim Kardashian, and Jen Atkin invited all of us to join in their book club, but you need to get the book first in order to participate.

If you haven’t been following Kim’s social media musings as of late, she’s been fascinated with Betty J. Eadie’s book Embraced By the Light, which tells the story of one woman’s near-death experience — a likely mental association driven by Kim’s traumatic run-in with armed robbers last year at Paris Fashion Week. On Wednesday night (Feb. 1, 2017), Kim made her relationship with the book to the next level by making it the first official reading selection in her newly minted book club.


So guys….. @chrissyteigen & @jenatkinhair & I are starting a book club!
