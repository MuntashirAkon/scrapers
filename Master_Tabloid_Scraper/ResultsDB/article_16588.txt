It’s incredible how many things have changed in just 10 years.

A decade ago, the People’s Choice Awards was a totally different place: Miley Cyrus was just a Disney Channel star with hair past her shoulders. Cameron Diaz was a brunette. Heroes beat out Ugly Betty for Best TV Drama. Robin Williams was still alive.
Today (Jan. 18, 2017), Fifth Harmony — a group those members were only children back then — will be taking the stage at this year’s ceremony. In honor of how time flies, we’re taking a look back what the show looked like 10 years ago.
From Eva Longoria in her Desperate Housewives days to a Grey’s Anatomy lineup that still included McDreamy, here are 26 photos that will give you serious flashbacks.
