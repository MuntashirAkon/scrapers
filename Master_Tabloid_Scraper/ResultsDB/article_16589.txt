Queen Latifah was the victim of a carjacking after her 2015 Mercedes Benz S63 was stolen while being refueled at a gas station in Atlanta.

The ordeal happened on Dec. 20 when a man driving the car got out of the vehicle to get gas, according to FOX-5­ Atlanta. The person, identified by TMZ as the actress’ security guard, was by the pump when a BMW pulled up and someone jumped into the Mercedes Benz, started the ignition and drove off.
The incident occurred at a Shell gas station on Fulton Industrial Boulevard.
Authorities later discovered the stolen car in an apartment complex on McDaniels Street, where security there said they spotted three males near the vehicle, along with a white BMW and a Dodge Charger that is also suspected to be stolen.
TMZ reports that Latifah’s Tumi bag was ransacked, but the culprit left behind some important documents the 46-year-old was worried about losing. Lemonade and fruit punch bottles presumably belonging to the thieves were also reportedly found inside the car.
The suspects remain at large.
