America Ferrera ran into two special co-stars while participating in the Women's March on Washington D.C. today. The actress, who delivered a speech during the women's rights protest, reunited with none other than fellow Ugly Betty alums, Mark Indelicato and Ana Ortiz. America shared a heartwarming photo of the trio, who proved they are just as much family offscreen as they were on television. "I march for family! I found my #UglyBetty family @therealanaortiz & @markindelicato here at the #womensmarchdc and we're here celebrating @plannedparenthood with @funnyordie & @ronnaandbeverly #fullheart," Ferrera captioned the snapshot. In the popular ABC series, which ran from 2006-2010, Ferrera starred as Ortiz's younger sister and Indelicato's aunt. 

Celebrities including Miley Cyrus, Katy Perry, Chrissy Teigen, John Legend, Brie Larson, Charlize Theron, Amy Schumer, Helen Mirren, Whoopi Goldberg, Cynthia Nixon, Evan Rachel Wood and more stepped out in support of equality in major cities such as Los Angeles, D.C., Chicago, Denver and Park City, Utah. Pink and husband Carey Hart brought their kids, including newborn son Jameson, along as well.
