Fans learned that the network originally wanted to call the show Betty the Ugly. A musical episode was in discussion. And yes, Ana Ortiz did audition for Betty before receiving the role of Hilda Suarez.As for talk of the show getting a Netflix revival a la Gilmore Girls, the cast certainly seemed interested at the idea. "I mean, it took 20 minutes for everyone to say yes to my email to be at ATX," America joked on stage.One person notably absent from the panel was Amanda (Becki Newton). But don't worry, fans. She had a really good excuse."'Hey Skinny Bitches!!!!!' So sad that I have pneumonia and won't make it to the #uglybettyreunion," she shared on social media. "Mandy is there in spirit. Forever. Xo."Ugly Betty told the story of a young, smart woman named Betty Suarez who worked at a high-fashion magazine named Mode. While trying to focus on her inner beauty, Betty also had to survive the shark infested waters of the fashion industry.The series aired for four seasons between 2006 and 2010. The ABC series also picked up two Golden Globe awards including Best Television Series: Comedy and Best Actress for America's role.
