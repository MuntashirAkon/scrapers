Paris Hilton -- Her New Man Is Insanely Expensive ... And Might Crap Her Floor/nParis Hilton finally said screw finding Mr. Right, and settled for Mr. Amazing -- that's his name -- but she had to drop $13,000 to get him. Paris' new guy is the world's smallest Pomeranian -- according to  "Betty's Teacup Yorkies " ... the place where Paris bought him. We're told he weighs 11.6 ounces and stands (kinda) 2.5 inches tall. As for that price tag? Betty says 5-month-old Mr. Amazing hails from a super-fancy breeder in Calgary. Whatevs. He'll be getting on a plane to L.A. soon ... with his nanny, naturally.  Life in Paris' purse awaits. /n
