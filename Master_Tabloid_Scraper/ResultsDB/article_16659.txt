Millie Bobby Brown Gets Sheerly Dotted At The MTV VMAs Red Carpet/n

We love seeing Millie Bobby Brown grow up right before our eyes!
We've seen her red carpet choices get bolder and bolder, and she really hit a new level at the MTV VMAs in LA Sunday!
The Stranger Things star opted for a sheer dotted Rodarte dress paired with patent leather Stuart Weitzman ankle boots. It wasn't our favorite look of the night, but we love that she's trying new things.
Thoughts???
