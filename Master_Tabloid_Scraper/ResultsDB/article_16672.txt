Prince Harry and his new girlfriend, Suits actress Meghan Markle, aren’t hiding their love, and the prince made that very clear on Tuesday (Nov. 15, 2016).

Earlier today (Nov. 15, 2016), Prince Harry met with the staff of NAZ, an organization based in London that provides sexual health support to minority communities, to speak out about the stigma surrounding HIV, AIDS, and other sexually transmitted diseases. While meeting with the organization’s choir, Joyful Noise, during which he urged the singers to speak out about their experiences, people couldn’t help but notice the Prince’s newest accessory.
Harry wore a blue, black, and white beaded bracelet on his right wrist, which, while it complimented his outfit, also looked suspiciously similar to the bracelet Markle’s been spotted wearing over the last few weeks.

She even wore the simple piece when meeting with Canada’s Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau.

While Markle is reportedly reluctant to make their relationship more public than it already is, sources close to the actress tell People she is “head over heels” for the Prince. “It’s been an absolute fairy tale for Meghan,” the insider continued.
There’s been no confirmation as to who gifted the bracelet to whom, but we like the idea of Harry sitting in his bedroom crafting a bracelet by hand for his lady love.
