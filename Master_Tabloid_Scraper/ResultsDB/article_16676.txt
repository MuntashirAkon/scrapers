Millie Bobby Brown will return to Stranger Things to reprise her role as the mysterious Eleven.

When the hit Netflix series was renewed for Season 2 in August, the creators refused to confirm whether or not Brown’s character would be back, telling Entertainment Weekly that her return was still “up in the air.” Now, TVLine reports that the young actress will definitely be back for the second season.

The end of the first season of Stranger Things left viewers with tons of questions regarding the fate of Eleven. At least now we know she’ll definitely be making an appearance even though the extent to which she will be back on the show is still unknown.
All we know for sure right now is that Season 2 will pick up about one year later in the fall of 1984 and that it will consist of nine episodes.
The sci-fi series is expected to return sometime in the summer/fall of 2017.
