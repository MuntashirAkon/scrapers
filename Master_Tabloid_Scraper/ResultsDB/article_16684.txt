Millie Bobby Brown Cancels Pop Culture Convention Appearance: I've Worked Too Hard and Need to Rest Other celebrities slated to attend the three-day gathering include Outlander's Graham McTavish, Gotham's Jessica Lucas, '.../n
Other celebrities slated to attend the three-day gathering include Outlander's Graham McTavish, Gotham's Jessica Lucas, 'N Sync member Chris Kirkpatrick and The Walking Dead's Addy Miller. Millie was set to sign autographs and take photos with fans for a fee of $50 and $60, respectively, per Collective Con's website. Similarly, Millie's Stranger Things co-star Noah Schnapp also pulled out of the event for unspecified reasons. It's been a whirlwind few months for the British child star, who attended nearly every award show with her Netflix fam and most recently stepped out on multiple occasions during New York Fashion Week in February. And with filming well underway for season two of Stranger Things, it's no wonder Brown hoped to clear her plate for some R&R. 

Here's to a clean bill of health in the very near future for Ms. Millie!
