Finn Wolfhard, Caleb McLaughlin and Gaten Matarazzo also chatted with us and dished about feeling overwhelmed by the whole thing."It's a blessing because not many people get to have this opportunity and get nominated and win...and on our first season?! Thank you, God," McLaughlin gushed."It's amazing. We are kids, and even tonight, a lot of people tell me that I'm a good actor, and I couldn't believe it because I don't have a lot of experience," Matarazzo added. "This night just proved to me that kids can be just as good of actors as adults."Along those same lines, Wolfhard decided to dedicate their award to other young actors. "Being 14-years-old and having a trophy like this, it proves to you how much you can do in the span of like four or five years...This is for all the child actors, all the kids!"
