Kate Hudson Shaves Her Head for New Movie Role with Sia /nKate Hudson has pulled a G.I. Jane (and countless other badass Hollywood heroines) by completely shaving her famous golden locks ... and like all of them, she looks great.  Kate was seen on set Tuesday in L.A. for a new flick she's working on with Sia, and she's rocking a new shaved 'do for the role.
