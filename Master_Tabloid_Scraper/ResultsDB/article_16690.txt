Paris Jackson's Punk Rock Look Will Never Die/nParis Jackson's putting in some serious work on her acting career, and she's getting to do it her way ... punk rock chick all day! MJ's daughter was shooting Monday in the San Fernando Valley, and sporting a look she's been rolling with for a while now. Edgy just fits the 19-year-old model and actress. Unclear what she was shooting Monday, but last week Paris was working on Lee Daniels'  "Star " alongside  "Stranger Things " star Millie Bobby Brown. She slipped into something a little more comfortable on her way home. Uggs for the win, baby!/n
