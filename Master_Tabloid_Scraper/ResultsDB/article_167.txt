Patton Oswalt is getting hitched!

The comedian is engaged to Meredith Salenger just weeks after going public with his relationship with the actress, according to People. The engagement comes just 15 months after the passing Patton’s wife, Michelle McNamara, who died unexpectedly in her sleep in April 2016.
A source tells the publication the couple started dating just months ago after being introduced by mutual friend Martha Plimpton. “They’re very happy,” an insider says. “They started chatting as friends and it blossomed from there.”

Since his wife’s death, the actor has been very open about dealing with grief. He’s currently the sole guardian of their 8-year-old daughter, Alice.
“I’ll never be at 100 percent again,” he told the New York Times last October. “But that won’t stop me from living.”
