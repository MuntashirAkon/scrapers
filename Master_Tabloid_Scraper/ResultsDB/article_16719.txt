'Rehab Addict' Custody War Explodes With Shocking Courtroom Twist/n
Nicole Curtis‘ Christmas may not be as cheerful this year, RadarOnline.com has learned!
Curtis is due to face off against her on-again-off-again boyfriend Shane Maguire on December 7 as part of their ongoing custody battle over Harper, 1.
READ THE COURT DOCS
They are currently fighting over allegations that Curtis, 40, denied Maguire, 54, of parenting time set forth in their initial agreement.
The argument started over Halloween weekend, and now the Rehab Addict star is being denied Christmas with her son again. The ruling they agreed upon states that “in all even numbered years, Father’s Christmas parenting time will be from 6:00 p.m. on the last day of the child’s school until 9:00 p.m. on December 26th.”

Maguire also asked the court to order Curtis to undergo a complete psychological evaluation — but Curtis argued the testing was not necessary to their case.
This is not the HGTV star’s first bitter custody battle either.

It is still unclear if the now 18-year-old is still estranged from his mother.
