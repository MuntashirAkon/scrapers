Noted Donald Trump impersonator Alec Baldwin was among the many celebrities that gathered at the “We Stand United” rally in New York City on Thursday (Jan. 19, 2017) outside of Manhattan’s Trump International Hotel to protest Trump’s presidency.

Baldwin made a short speech that began with a few statements from his Saturday Night Live alter ego, PEOTUS Trump, at the assembly, which was organized by filmmaker Michael Moore.
“I’ve been standing out here in the freezing cold for a long time. I have to go to the bathroom, I have to pee. But I’m holding it in, I’m holding it in, I’m not going to pee,” Baldwin said. “I’m going to a function at the Russian consulate tonight. I’m going to hold it in until I get there. And then when I get to the Russian consulate, I’m going to have a really, really long pee. Like the biggest pee I’ve ever had in my lifetime.”
He quickly shifted gears and expressed his honest sentiments, encouraging the crowd to teach their children “what a real American is.”
“These people are a disgrace,” said Baldwin. “They are a disgrace to everything you and I believe in. But there is hope, and the hope is us, and us fighting. One-hundred days of resistance.”

Other speakers and attendees included Julianne Moore, Cher, Mark Ruffalo, Shailene Woodley, Robert De Niro, Rosie Perez, and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio.
Here are a few more key moments:
Shailene Woodley encourages love and compassion in protest, Cher says that “the power of the people is bigger than those a**holes that are there in Washington”


Mark Ruffalo says that Americans have to protect one another


Robert De Niro mocks Trump’s Twitter rants: “I’m very happy to be here tonight with all of you and all of my overrated friends”
