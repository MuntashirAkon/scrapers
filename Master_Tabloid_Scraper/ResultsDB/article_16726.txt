Megyn Kelly’s new book reveals dirt on Donald Trump that she kept from everyone until after the election.
In her upcoming memoir Settle for More, the FOX host claims someone tried to poison her and that the President-elect received a question ahead of the first Republican presidential debate. The New York Times obtained an early copy of the book (due out Nov. 15), in which Kelly writes that, on the day of the debate, she became violently ill after accepting a cup of coffee from her “suspiciously enthusiastic driver.”

The memoir also reveals that Trump tried to woo her. “This is actually one of the untold stories of the 2016 campaign,” she writes. “I was not the only journalist to whom Trump offered gifts clearly meant to shape coverage. Many reporters have told me that Trump worked hard to offer them something fabulous — from hotel rooms to rides on his 757.”
Following the newspaper’s review, Kelly has disputed reports that Trump was leaked a question and that anybody in his camp had anything to do with her being sick.


For the record, my book "Settle for More" does not suggest Trump had any debate Qs in advance, nor do I believe that he did.

Also for the record, I believe the reason I got sick the day of the first debate was I contracted a stomach virus, just as Rand Paul did.
