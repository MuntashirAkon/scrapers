Harper’s Bazaar celebrated their annual Women of the Year Awards on Monday night (Oct. 31, 2016) and famous ladies everywhere came out in full force. Clad in an ’80s-inspired leopard print number, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley was all smiles as she accepted the honor of being 2016’s Businesswoman of the Year for her work with brands such as Marks & Spencer, Ugg Australia and Paige Denim.
Meanwhile, Keira Knightley, who was a vision in green, nabbed the prize for Theatre Icon, while Rogue One: A Star Wars Story actress Felicity Jones received the award for British Actress. The Fall star Gillian Anderson received the top honor of Television Icon, and Musician of the Year went to Grimes.
Emma Watson was awarded with the Inspiration of the Year title for her work as an advocate for gender equality.
