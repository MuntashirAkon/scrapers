Precisely how long the couple have been planning to expand their family is uncertain, but as the new mom told the Sunday Express in 2015, “Having a family is something I think about for sure.”
“Whether I’d live here in America or in England, it’s not always as simple as that,” she added at the time. “I have no idea what will happen but it’ll be interesting to find out, right? And nothing will be perfect, I’m sure.”
