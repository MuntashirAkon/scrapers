FROM PEN: Katherine Heigl Opens Up About Experiencing Her First Pregnancy

Huntington-Whiteley, 30, and Statham, 49 — engaged in January 2016 — made their baby news public in February, when the former Victoria’s Secret Angel shared a photo of herself in a bikini on the beach.
In the photo, taken by the Fate of the Furious star, a baby bump is clearly visible as Huntington-Whiteley poses on the warm sands. “Very happy to share that Jason and I are expecting!” she captioned the announcement.





 Such a beautiful day filled with love for my gorgeous bestie and mummy to be @rosiehw 🌹

FROM PEN: Raising a Little Princess: All About Charlotte’s Amazing Childhood

 
From blush hues to little black dresses and even silver sparkles, the Transformers: Dark of the Moon star has given her fans a peek at her adorable bump throughout her pregnancy.
And though she has been fairly quiet about her baby-to-be, Huntington-Whiteley has spoken in the past about motherhood, telling the Sunday Express in 2015, “Having a family is something I think about for sure.”
She added at the time, “I have no idea what will happen, but it’ll be interesting to find out, right? And nothing will be perfect, I’m sure.”
