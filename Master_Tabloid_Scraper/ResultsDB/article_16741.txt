It seems the couple that frequently exercises together stays together as they have been by each other's side for seven years—and having a family together is something that has been on the couple's mind for some time."Having a family is something I think about for sure, and whether I'd live here in America or in England," the model told Esquire magazine in 2015. "But it's not always as simple as that…I have no idea what will happen, but it'll be interesting to find out, right? And nothing will be perfect, I'm sure."

Congratulations on your new bundle of joy, you two!
