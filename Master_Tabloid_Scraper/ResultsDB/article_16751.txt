UPDATE! Rosie O'Donnell's Daughter Chelsea Undergoing Psychiatric Evaluation After Hospitalization/n
UPDATE: O'Donnell took to Twitter to share an update about her daughter Chelsea. "She is ok...#RealLife #chillymy," she wrote, adding a throwback photo of her daughter.____________________________________Rosie O'Donnell's formerly estranged daughter Chelsea O'Donnell has been hospitalized at a Long Island hospital.E! News has learned that the 19-year-old is currently undergoing psychiatric evaluation. While there's no word on when Chelsea is going to be released, we're told that she is "alert and awake" and "is safe."O'Donnell has been admitted to the state-wide program which aims to offer psychiatric evaluations on an emergency basis, as well as any subsequent treatment services such as interventions or medical professional referrals depending on the patient's needs.Chelsea will be evaluated by social workers, psychiatrists and other mental health professionals.

O'Donnell's rep has no comment.Rosie O'Donnell and her daughter have had quite the strained relationship over the years, but seemed to have made amends recently. Just a week ago, Rosie shared a selfie with her teenage daughter in honor of her birthday, writing, "happy birthday chelsea belle !!! 19 today #believe."Their personal strife reached a peak last summer when the then 17-year-old was reported missing from the television personality's New York home. "Chelsea stopped taking her medicine and is in need of medical attention," a post read on Rosie's website at the time. "Any information please contact authorities."Police later found Chelsea in New Jersey at the house of a 26-year-old man with an arrest record. No arrests were made at the time because Chelsea was there voluntarily.After her 18th birthday a week later, Chelsea and Rosie's relationship faced another hurdle when her daughter opted to move in with her birth mother, Deanna Micoley, who gave Chelsea up for adoption as a baby in 1997. "Chelsea made a decision when she turned 18 that she wanted to go to her birth mother," Rosie's publicist told E! News at the time. "This was her choice."However, last month, there was a glimmer of hope in rekindling their relationship when Rosie shared a photo of herself with Chelsea, with the caption, "chelsea and me - what a difference a year makes. #hopelives."(Originally published Sept. 6, 2016 at 9:01 p.m. PT)
