Donald Trump and Rosie O'Donnell Agree Over Firing Comey/nPresident Trump just jumped on Rosie O'Donnell's bandwagon -- and no, Hell is NOT freezing over ... as far as we know. The prez apparently just realized Rosie tweeted 5 months ago that then-FBI Director James Comey should be fired. So, he tweeted Thursday, right at Rosie,  "We finally agree on something Rosie. " Never mind that Rosie was calling for Comey's head because she blamed him for Hillary Clinton losing -- therefore putting Rosie's archenemy, Trump, in the White House. Pretty sure Rosie won't be amused by Trump cozying up to her ... even sarcastically. Bingo! Rosie just clarified her feelings on Comey, and called out Trump's  "motives. "  @NicoleWallace11 - he shoulda been fired when he threw the election - we see his motives now - TRUMP IS DONE 4 good ❤ pic.twitter.com /U8AMng5Z05 — ROSIE (@Rosie) May 11, 2017/n
