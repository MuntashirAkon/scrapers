Former 'View' Host Debbie Matenopoulos -- I LOVE the New Panel... With ONE Exception/nOriginal  "View " co-host Debbie Matenopoulos doesn't need an umbrella, because she has plenty of shade ... which she happily threw at one of the show's new panelists.A very pregnant Matenopoulos was hanging out at Craig's in West Hollywood and had glowing reviews for 3 members of the new foursome -- Rosie Perez, Nicole Wallace ... along with Whoopi Goldberg and Rosie O'Donnell. Debbie laid out her issues with one of them. Debbie -- who's now repped by Wendy Feldman -- doesn't have hard feelings though about getting canned in '99, and replaced by Lisa Ling. Last night she told our photog she'd be down for a return, and she's even cooked up a ploy to score ratings./n
