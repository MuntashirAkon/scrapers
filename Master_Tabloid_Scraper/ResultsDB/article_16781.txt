We just don't understand.

As we previously reported, the Soundgarden frontman was found in his hotel room after a gig in Detroit on Wednesday night, with a band of some kind around his neck.

A family friend discovered him after forcing his way into the room when Chris' wife called up worried.
We can't imagine why Chris would do this. It's just unfathomable. Was he trying to communicate something to fans with his final performance? We may never know.
A full autopsy has not been performed at this time.
