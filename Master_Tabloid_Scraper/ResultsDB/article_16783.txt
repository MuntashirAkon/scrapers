The Internet Reacts In Outrage As Donald Trump Drops 'The Mother Of All Bombs' In Afghanistan/n

In case you hadn't heard the blast, the U.S. just dropped a 22,000 lb bomb on Iraq Syria Afghanistan.
Apparently Donald Trump is making good on his campaign promise to "bomb those suckers" — which of course means going back on his promise to stay out of it and focus on American infrastructure.
The largest non-nuclear weapon in the world, the Massive Ordinance Airblast Bomb or MOAB (colorfully known in the military as the "mother of all bombs"), was dropped on an ISIS-K "tunnel complex" — a network of caves used by the terrorist group's Eastern Afghanistan affiliate.

According to the official statement by U.S. Forces - Afghanistan:

"The strike was designed to minimize the risk to Afghan and U.S. Forces conducting clearing operations in the area while maximizing the destruction of ISIS-K fighters and facilities."
While some are cheering on Trump dropping bombs — which sadly will only encourage him — many are pointing out the unfathomable cost of using such a device. Others don't want you to forget he may have not-too-hidden ulterior motives.

The #MOAB dropped on Afghanistan cost $314 million. That's enough to combat homelessness in the U.S, but our military has been "depleted"

We just spent 300 million dollars dropping ONE bomb in Afghanistan. You know how much that money could've helped the American people
