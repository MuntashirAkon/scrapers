Chances are, the odds won’t be in your favor if you criticize Beyoncé‘s decision to take the stage before it’s even set up.

The trolls of the internet crept out of their corners to yell about the Beyoncé’s taking the stage to perform at the 2016 CMA Awards on Wednesday night (Nov. 3, 2016) shortly after the news was announced earlier in the day. The most popular argument against was that she’s “not a country singer.” Unsurprisingly, their tune was dampened when she and the Dixie Chicks stole the show with their collaboration on “Daddy Lessons” from Beyoncé’s Lemonade, complete with a sweet “good job, Bey!” from one of their band members at the very end.





Even Reese Witherspoon was beside herself:

If you like their performance so much that you want to put a ring on it, their studio version of “Daddy Lessons” is available to stream on Beyoncé’s SoundCloud channel.
