Go Inside Jasmine Tookes’ Super-Instagrammable VS Fashion Show Fitting (Check That $3 Million Bra!)/n

 
Model Jasmine Tookes often gives her Instagram followers inside peeks at her high-fashion gigs, totally intense workouts, and of course, all the prep that goes into getting ready for her fifth year walking in the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show (airing Dec. 5 on CBS). But this year’s show is more special than ever: she’ll be wearing the $3 million Fantasy Bra down the Paris runway, and she gave us a look at her most Instagrammable day at the brand’s corporate headquarters in N.Y.C.
Before hitting hair and makeup in the morning, “I had a breakfast sandwich and a lot of bacon and a green tea,” she says. “I have a pretty balanced diet. I work out very often I do a lot of weight training so I just really amp up my protein intake and I really focus on building my muscles and giving them the right fuel.”
She then preps for her wardrobe try-on. “This year I’ll be wearing two outfits in the show,” she says. “My first outfit is in the ‘Road Ahead’ segment…it’s bright pink with a bunch of jewels up the arm. And I have these beautiful wings that have a feather texture. They’re so stunning.”

Tookes was treated to a surprise at her fitting as well: The Fantasy Bra got a blingy upgrade!  “Today when I showed up for my fitting there’s this whole extra body piece which is super beautiful and delicate and it really complements the bra,” she says of the bodice, which is made up of 27,000 Swarovski crystals. “It gets more and more sparkly every time I see it!”

But the first steps of the Fantasy Bra fitting weren’t nearly as glamorous as the end result. “I had to do like a Plaster-of-Paris session where I sat in the chair for three hours and I had to stay very still. The lady even told me, Don’t breathe heavy because it will shift around,” she says. “And after that, they take the molding and they actually built the bra onto my body. So it only fits me!”
What do you think of Tookes’s VS Fashion Show looks? Will you be watching the runway show on Dec. 5?
