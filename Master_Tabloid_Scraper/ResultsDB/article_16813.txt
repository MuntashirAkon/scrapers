The blooming romance comes just two months after 25-year-old Agdal was seen wrapped around the arms of now ex Leonardo DiCaprio, 42.
As Radar readers know, the couple called it quits after DiCaprio was allegedly caught texting and meeting with British babe Roxy Horner, 25, behind Agdal’s back.
“Leo has been texting Roxy in the past month, even though everyone thinks Nina is his girlfriend,” an insider told Radar. “They’ve been friends for years, but he has always wanted more.”

While Agdal and the Shutter Island actor lasted almost a year, sources say she and Brinkley-Cook are already getting “serious.”
As of now, it remains unclear how Christie Brinkley’s son, 22, met the Victoria’s Secret model.
