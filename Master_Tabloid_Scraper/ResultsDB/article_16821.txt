The couple was “properly served with Plaintiff City National Bank’s Complaint for Damages and that the Defendants failed to answer,” the Default Judgment documents obtained by Radar state.
The couple missed their subpoenaed court appearance on May 22 and so the judge ordered them to pay City National Bank $202,066.10, according to the documents obtained by Radar.

“It is hereby further ordered that Plaintiff City National Bank shall be awarded a judgment from and against Victoria Spelling in the sum of $17,730.56,” the court papers also stated.
