Cooper, 42 and Shayk, 31, welcomed their child after about two years of dating.
According to Radar sources, Cooper and Shayk secretly got engaged, but before the birth, the couple’s relationship had hit a low point.
“Bradley has never looked so miserable,” a source told Radar about witnessing the way the Silver Linings Playbook star acted around his model fiancée.
Shayk covered up her baby bump at the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show, and as Radar reported, adjusted her diet and fitness routine for her pregnancy.
