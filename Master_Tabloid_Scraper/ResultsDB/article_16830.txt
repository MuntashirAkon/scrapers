Wait, Kendall Jenner & Gigi Hadid Might Not Be Walking In The Victoria's Secret Fashion Show??/n

Summer isn't even over, but preparations have already begun for the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show!
Case in point, VS models have started to take to Instagram to announce their new gig walking the runway in a few months. Regulars like Adriana Lima, Alessandra Ambrosio, Behati Prinsloo, Candice Swanepoel, Lily Aldridge, and more are officially confirmed.
But we've yet to hear a peep from Kendall Jenner and Gigi Hadid, who both walked in the last two shows!

Additionally, it's said Kenny wasn't even seen at the casting call days prior.
It's possible the duo just haven't shared the news yet, but it's almost unlikely. The reality TV starlet ditched VS a few months ago in favor of modeling luxe lingerie brand La Perla!
Sigh. There's also no word on whether Bella Hadid will be backâ€¦
Will U be tuning in if the social media models don't make it??
