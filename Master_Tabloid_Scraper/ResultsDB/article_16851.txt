The Secret Behind How Celebs Travel With Their Kids/n
Celebrities have assistants and teams managing their daily lives, which does make vacations much easier. While schedules and itineraries are being handled, a star can focus on getting their child ready to go out the door. Nannies also help with allowing parents to find some personal time to recharge, or enjoy a few activities away from their kids. But according to Mercedes, the key here isn't the extra help—it's knowing it's there if they need it."Even if a celeb forgoes all that, they still have a leg up because they have access to it, which gives a celeb parent piece of mind when they start to feel overwhelmed," she explained. "It's the knowing that I have someone I can trust to help when it gets to be too much that I believe can truly make or break a parent's resolve and sanity."

Family travel can certainly be a hassle, but there are so many benefits to having that adventure together. You're exposing your children to new places and cultures that can help them develop a greater understanding of the world at a young age. It's also an important break from day-to-day work, parenting and life in general. For stars, travel is an escape from the spotlight with the people they cherish the most.

"While I won't be naïve in saying that the benefits outweigh the cons of traveling with kids because I don't always think that's the case," Mercedes said, "I do believe that the memories you have with your child while traveling can be a great foundation for your relationship."
