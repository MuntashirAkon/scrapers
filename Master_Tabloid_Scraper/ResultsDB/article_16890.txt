 Move Over, Ladies! NeNe Leakes Ready To Rumble With 'RHOA' Men, Todd Tucker.../n
NeNe Leakes has been known to throw shade at her fellow the Real Housewives of Atlanta co-stars – and now she’s moving on to their men.
In a sneak peek for the March 23 episode on RadarOnline.com, Kandi Burruss’ fiancé Todd Tucker gets riled up by Leakes during a heated exchange.
Tucker raises his voice to Leakes while the group is sitting together, though for what exact reason, it’s unclear.

“It’s okay to school me, but don’t f**king talk down to me and then school me,” Tucker scolds the I Dream of NeNe star.
Leakes doesn’t apologize for upsetting him.
“If you don’t like the way I say it, then that’s your problem,” she shouts back.

“You stop trying to be a damn b*tch!” Leakes shouts at Cynthia Bailey‘s husband.
