 Tamra Barney's Ex-Hubby Accuses Her Of Forgetting To Pick Up Daughter From School.../n
Real Housewives of Orange County star Tamra Barney‘s ex-husband made the shocking allegation on Friday afternoon via Twitter that the reality TV star forgot to pick up their children from school, RadarOnline.com is exclusively reporting.
This claim comes just hours after Tamra suffered a huge setback in the legal hearings about whether the kids she had with Simon Barney can appear on the hit Bravo show or not.
For all the world to see, Simon tweeted on Friday:
“@TamraBarney school called.u didn’t pick up Sophia.on my way to get her.no response from you from Schl or I. R u ok? Where r u?”

The tweet has since been deleted and it appears Tamra was at home all along.
In reply to a follower that slammed Simon writing, “wtf who posts this on twitter” he responded with:
“I did,text and so did the school. Was hoping to get response from twitter. Btw. She’s fine & was home.”
Radar reached out to Tamra for comment and got no response, and she doesn’t appear to have tweeted about the alleged incident.

As Radar exclusively reported, in a brief hearing Friday morning in an Orange County courthouse, the judge ordered an independent custody evaluation and investigation to determine if the former couple’s three children should appear on camera.
It was a dramatic development, and the judge refused to issue a temporary ruling allowing the kids to appear on the original Bravo housewife franchise, pending the results of the investigation. /n
