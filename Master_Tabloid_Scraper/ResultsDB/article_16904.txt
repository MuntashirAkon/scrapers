Two months after welcoming twins with Beyoncé, Jay-Z finally shared the inspiration behind his son and daughter’s unique names.

Like older sister Blue Ivy, Sir and Rumi Carter’s moniker holds a lot of meaning for the rapper.
Via Revolt TV:
JAY-Z says it’s no huge mystery why he and his wife Beyoncé decided to name their newborn twins Rumi and Sir (a daughter and son respectively). Rumi was named after 13th Century Persian poet Jalāl ad-Dīn Muhammad Rūmī. “Sir” was inspired by Hov’s only son’s regal aura.
“Rumi is our favorite poet, so it was for our daughter,” Jay-Z explained during Part 2 of his interview on the Rap Radar podcast. He was sitting down with RR’s Elliot Wilson and Brian ” B Dot” Miller in an interview that was taped in early August at JAY-Z’s California estate. “‘Sir’ was like, man, come out the gate. He carries himself like that. He just came out, like, Sir.”
