Proud grandfather Carey Lowe could not contain his excitement, sharing Samuel’s first photo on Facebook, captioning it, “An athlete’s hands, right?”

As Radar has reported, Sean and Catherine are one of the few Bachelor couples to actually make it to the alter. While they did experience some relationship hiccups after the wedding, they appeared on Marriage Boot Camp to sort through their problems.
