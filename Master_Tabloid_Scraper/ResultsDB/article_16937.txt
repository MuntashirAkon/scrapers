Celeb Chefs to 'Wish' Kid -- We'll Cook With You!/nTwo TV chefs have stepped up to the plate -- and have offered to cook for a  "Make-A-Wish " kid who was snubbed by  "Barefoot Contessa " star Ina Garten ... TMZ has learned. Food Network star Beau MacMillan and  "Iron Chef " Michael Symon are both reaching out to 6-year-old Enzo ... hoping they can fill the void Garten left after she turned down the kid's  "wish " to cook a meal together. In fact, MacMillan tells us he's ready to fly Enzo and his entire family out to Arizona STAT -- put them up in a fancy resort and treat them all to a VIP dinner at his 5-star restaurant. MacMillan says he also wants to bring Enzo into the kitchen so they can prepare the meal together. Â As for Symon -- the chef tells us he'll be in Enzo's home state of Oregon in the very near future and would be more than happy to swing by Enzo's house to  "cook a dish " with him too.
