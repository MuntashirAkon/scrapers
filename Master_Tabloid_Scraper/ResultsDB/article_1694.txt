Epic Fail! Watch Carly Fiorina Fall Off A Stage During Campaign Event/n
Ted Cruz‘s poll numbers are dropping, and so is Carly Fiorina!
At a rally in Indiana earlier this week, Cruz’s vice presidential candidate tried her best to fire up the crowd as she introduced the Texas senator and his family.
“Welcome your next first family,” Fiorina said. “Heidi Cruz, your next first lady, Caroline and Catherine, and the next president of the United States, Ted Cruz!”

The crowd applauded, music played, and the Cruz family walked out.
But Fiorina couldn’t keep her balance as she turned and quickly fell from from the stage. Seemingly nonplussed, Ted continued glad-handing before Heidi noticed what happened.
