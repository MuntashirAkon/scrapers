“Michael’s eyes welled up with tears as he revisited the paradise where his ancestors presided,” an insider told Radar. “He sadly gazed over his shoulder at the water, knowing he might never again see the place where he wants his ashes scattered.”
As Radar reported, Douglas was diagnosed with deadly stage 4 tongue cancer in 2010.
A year later, Douglas and his wife, 46-year-old Catherine Zeta-Jones, celebrated when doctors declared him “tumor free.”

But sources — and experts who reviewed recent photos of Douglas — said he’s once again in a life-or-death battle and could have just six months to live.
“He’s become more spiritual,” said the source. “He realizes with all his success that family is everything and most important.“ /n
