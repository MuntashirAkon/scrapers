After a day of panels, such as “Stay True to Your Voice” and “How I Became an Entrepreneur” the event, which took place at the Annenberg Community Beach House, concluded with a chic cocktail party and performance by A Fine Frenzy.   Jessica Alba looked uber chic in an Alice + Olivia sweater that featured an embellished tie paired with patterned Lela Rose pants and coral and cream heels, while Elizabeth Banks took glam to the max with a futuristically fashioned cutout cocktail dress.
