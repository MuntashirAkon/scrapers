Mutilated Body Parts Wash Ashore On Rio de Janeiro Beach… Just YARDS Away From Olympic Volleyball Courts!/n

We really hope this doesn't set the games up for failure…
Volleyball is usually one of the most anticipated events the Olympics have to offer thanks to the revealing athletic attire and beach-ready bodies… but the 2016 Summer Olympics may just bump the sport off the map.
That's because after a spiking number of other disasters — i.e. Juma the Jaguar being shot dead, Paralympian cyclist Liesl Tesch getting robbed at gunpoint, and a general fear of the Zika virus — Rio de Janiero just suffered its most grotesque setback yet.

According to reports, body parts were discovered on Copacabana Beach on Wednesday… just YARDS away from the Olympic Beach Volleyball Arena!
Apparently, a mutilated foot and a second unidentified piece of human remains were found by a runner, and while local police have no leads, this just serves as a another sad reminder of what we might be getting when the Olympics kick off on August 5.
Please stay safe if you're traveling down to Rio this Summer!
