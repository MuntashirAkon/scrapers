TLC Aired A Josh-Centric 19 Kids & Counting Marathon After Molestation Accounts Surface â€” And Viewers Were NOT Happy! Read The Reactions HERE!/n

Josh Duggar made headlines on Thursday when he admitted to molesting young girls when he was a teenager â€” some of which were his younger sisters.
However, TLC seemed unphased by this news, because they thought it would be appropriate to run a Josh-centric marathon of 19 Kids & Counting the very same night!
The cable network has yet to discuss the controversy or comment on the show's future, which angered former Here Comes Honey Boo Boo star Mama June, whose show was shortly cancelled after it surfaced that she was dating a convicted child molester.

The marathon ran episodes featuring the 27-year-old playing with his kids and focusing on the gender of his unborn child â€” and created quite an uproar on social media.
We're not sure if the cable network is just neglectful, or attempting to exploit the controversy for some good old fashioned publicity! Either way, they're not showing too much T-L-C to their viewers!
Check out the Twitter reactions of the marathon airing (below)!

Is it cynical or tone deaf that TLC is airing a 19 Kids and Counting mini-marathon in wake of Josh Duggar news?

After news of Josh Duggar sexually abusing his sisters, @TLC airs a marathon of 19 Kids and Counting instead of cancelling it. Disgusting.
