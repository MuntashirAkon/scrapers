According to reports, Greig “didn’t flinch” when the judge informed her that because no maximum penalty has been set in place for the contempt charge, she could be sentenced to life in prison.
“She loved [Bulger] and still does,” Geirg’s lawyer, Reddington said of her decision not to rat out the infamous mobster.
Meanwhile, as Radar reported, Bulger has expressed his disgust over Johnny Depp‘s recent portrayal of him in Black Mass, calling the film “pure fiction!”
Bulger, 86, was convicted in 2013 and is currently serving a life sentence. /n
