Beyoncé Fan Emails Professor About Missing Class On The 'Lords Day' AKA Bey's Birthday & It's Incredible!/n

This takes some major balls to do. Kudos to you, Ja-Niece Best!
Yesterday was Queen Beyoncé's birthday so the world, of course, celebrated the BeyDay in many different ways.
Well, in preparation of this 'high holy day' Ja-Niece, a student, sent a HIGHlarious email to her professor letting them know that she wouldn't be in class that day. 
Because it was Blue Ivy's momma's birthday. 
She said: 

LOLOLOLOL! She was totally serious! We love it! 
This is Queen Bey loving to a whole new extreme and it's AMAZING.
Always remember that Beyoncé loves you so bow down.
