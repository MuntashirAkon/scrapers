‘Mad Men’ Fashion: A Look Back at Season 6/n
Mad Men will close another season on Sunday as it airs its finale on AMC.
On a season filled with dropped campaigns, the assassination of public figures, mergers, riots and Bob Benson’s shorts, show creator Matthew Weiner has held viewers at the edge of our seats.
Since the season six premiere in April, we’ve been haunted by theories on what will happen to Megan Draper, who Bob really is (we think we know now) and whether or not Don Draper will dig himself out of his latest mess.
On a lighter note, thanks to costume designer Janie Bryant, this season of Mad Men has also given viewers slick suits and gorgeous dresses fit for a pitch to Avon Cosmetics.
Celebuzz has compiled a gallery of the season’s best fashion moments, above.
Mad Men season six concludes at 10/9c on AMC on Sunday.
