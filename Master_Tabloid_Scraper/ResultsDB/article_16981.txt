Justin Bieber Announces More ‘Believe’ Tour Date, Angers A Lot Of Fans/n
Somewhere in South America right now, there a bunch of Beliebers are crying.
Justin Bieber — who revealed the tour dates for the Latin America leg of his Believe World Tour Tuesday — neglected to include Venezuela as one of his 12 city-stops, angering many fans.
The hashtag #VenezuelaWantsBelieveTour became a trending topic just hours after the announcement.
The country’s capital, Caracas, was recently named the third most violent city in the world by Mexican-based Citizen Council for Public Security and Criminal Justice — which may have played a factor into why the 19-year-old is not performing there.
Other notable places that were skipped were Uruguay and Peru, whose Beliebing citizens also protested the snub on Twitter.
Here are the complete Latin American dates:
Oct. 19 – San Juan, Puerto Rico – Coliseo de Puerto Rico
Oct. 22 – Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic – Quisqueya Stadium
Oct. 24 – Panama City, Panama – Figoli
