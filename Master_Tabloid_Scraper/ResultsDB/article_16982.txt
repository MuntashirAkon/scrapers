 She may only be 13 years old, but Kiernan Shipka is a bit of a fashion expert.
It’s no accident — she’s had five seasons of Mad Men to learn from the best in show costume designer Janie Bryant. And on Apr. 7, Shipka will portray Sally Draper for a sixth season, as the AMC show heads to the ‘60s.
Off screen, Shipka has hit the right fashion notes thanks to names like Miu Miu, Oscar de la Renta, Valentino and Moschino.
At this year’s Nickelodeon Kids’ Choice Awards on Mar. 23, the young star turned to Rag & Bone for a floral frock that doubly served as a reminder that you can look chic and fresh all while being age-appropriate.

“What I try to do with red carpets, I try to make it a little different each time,” Shipka told Harper’s Bazaar last summer. “I most admire people who aren’t afraid of what people are going to think and really just rock it, even if it’s really crazy.”

While the red carpet is still waiting for Shipka to pull off a “really crazy” look (a la her personal favorites Willow Smith or Helena Bonham Carter), the actress has settled comfortably into an affair with patterns, bright colors and looks that let the clothing — not the makeup, shoes or accessories — do all the talking.
Mad Men will kick off its sixth season on Apr. 7 on AMC.
