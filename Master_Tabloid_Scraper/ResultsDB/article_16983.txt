According to property records obtained by The Real Estalker, the Oz: The Great and Powerful star purchased the home from Janie Bryant, the Emmy award winning costume designer from AMC’s Mad Men.
The home was previously occupied by designer Diane von Furstenberg’s daughter Tatiana before she sold it to Bryant in 2002.
