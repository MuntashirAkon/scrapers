Steven Tyler on Starting a Charity to Support Abused and Neglected Girls: 'There's Something That Can Be Done'/n
Steven Tyler is taking a stand for victims of abuse.  
On the 26th anniversary of the release of Aerosmith’s song “Janie’s Got a Gun,” the band’s frontman has launched “Janie’s Fund,” a charity to benefit abused and neglected girls.  
In a clip exclusively debuting on PEOPLE, Tyler, 67, explains what motivated him to start the program.  
“The one thing that bothered me the most [about ‘Janie’s Got a Gun’] was that somehow, people who had watched the video saw that the father was abusing the daughter and mom was looking on and nothing was ever said,” Tyler shares. “So with hopes I could do something about that – until I met Youth Villages, I didn’t think I could.”  
He continues, “So now I get to start my own fund and invite some of my friends and start to get the word out that there’s something that can be done. And so when some kid is sitting at home and they realize that somewhere along the line they feel broken … and they realize that they were abused, they might find the words to say something to someone about it and start in their recovery.”  
In a press release about the launch of Janie’s Fund, Tyler said, “We can’t undo what’s been done by abuse in this country … but we CAN let these girls know they are loved, get them the help they need, and assure them that there is MUCH LIGHT at the end of the tunnel.”  
The charity will generate money and awareness for the trauma of childhood sexual abuse and will “bring hope and healing to girls who have endured neglect and abuse,” according the release.  
“As a father and grandfather, I want to focus my energy on things that really matter and leave behind something else in this crazy world along with my music,” Tyler says. “I am starting Janie’s Fund to give a voice to the millions of victims who haven’t had one and encourage everyone to join me on this mission.”
