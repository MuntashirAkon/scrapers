Hollywood's Golden Thirties! Watch Matt Bomer as a Rising (and Smooth!) Movie Mogul in The Last Tycoon
/n

When the champagne of the Roaring ’20s ran dry, movies were all that was left of America’s period of indulgence — and one of the few places an ambitious executive could make money.
Based on a half-finished novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald, The Last Tycoon takes place in that jilting period between the Roaring ’20s, the Great Depression and the Golden Thirties, during which Americans clung to movies as their last luxury. Monroe Stahr (Matt Bomer) is a rising executive in the fledgling industry who competes against his own mentor, Pat Brady (Kelsey Grammer), to create the kind of glamorous love stories and adventures that would come to define the Hollywood image of America.
Bomer’s Monroe navigates the cutthroat world of aging execs, enterprising ingenues and tireless paparazzi — all while clad in the stiff but timeless menswear of the ’30s. His costar, Lily Collins — daughter of “In the Air Tonight” legend and knighted British singer Phil Collins — plays Cecilia Brady, the boss’ daughter, who’s eager to break into the industry herself as a producer, much to her father’s chagrin.

Monroe longs to create great artistic works, but he has to balance that goal against his growing affection for actress Kathleen Moore, the advances of Cecilia and Pat’s greedy desire for a textbook hit — not to mention mounting political tension from the Great Depression.
The series is being developed by Billy Ray, known for writing blockbuster hits like The Hunger Games and Captain Phillips. The production will also benefit from renowned costume designer Janie Bryant, who’s likely to bring the stern glamour of the 1930s to life with all the double-breasted woolen suits and flowing bias cut gowns featured in the teaser.
