A new affliction is sweeping the nation: early-onset Mad Men separation anxiety. And along with revelers of Americana, proponents of the 3-martini lunch, and fellow  vintage style lovers, we've got it bad. With the knowledge that the much-beloved show will air its final episodes beginning April 5, comes feelings of melancholy, nostalgia and loss for our favorite characters—and what they wear.Where else will we turn for the retro fashion inspiration that each episode has brought—from Betty's ball gowns to Sally's go-go boots and Megan's Pucci looks?  How will we get our weekly dose of costume designer Janie Bryant's genius?

Luckily, help is on the way. Next week, Bryant launches a capsule shoe collection that gives us a modern take on ‘60s style with design-your-own-shoe-site Shoes of Prey. ( We're already salivating at the thought of slipping our feet into Bryant's designs, just likeJanuary Jones, Elisabeth Moss andKiernan Shipka have done on set.)The collection promises ‘60s-inspired wedges and chunky heels in bright colors, prints and textured materials. And while they're sure to be plenty covetable as is, like every shoe on the site, the collection will be customizable—just in case you want to bump a heel height from Sally-sized to something more Megan-esque.

While fans across the US are coping in different ways—with dedicated museum exhibits and a New York-based Mad Men Restaurant Week (which kicks off March 23)—the most effective Rx for fashion fiends may be solace found in new soles.The Janie Bryant capsule collection for Shoes of Prey will be available Tuesday, March 24. The mid-season premiere of Mad Men airs April 5.
