"Now that I did one," Keys admitted, "I don't feel as nervous.""Don't ever feel nervous here," the host told her. "I have to be nervous."When Fallon hit the button, he was tasked with performing the State Farm jingle as The Pointer Sisters. "Is that a mistake?" he wondered. "Oh, I know what's going on. I can do the one sister."Keys followed up by performing "The Alphabet Song" to the tune of Adele's Hello," while Fallon channeled Elvis Presley when he sang the Meow Mix jingle.

"Give it up for Alicia Keys!"

Keys isn't the only Voice coach to participate in The Tonight Show's "Musical Impressions" sketch: Adam Levine did it in September 2014, while Christina Aguilera did it in February 2015.(E! and NBC are both members of the NBCUniversal family.)
