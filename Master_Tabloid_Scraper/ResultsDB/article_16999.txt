On this, opinion is not divided: Within his genre, Jani Lane was an icon.And like any icon, the former Warrant frontman and '80s metal king's death—the cause of which has been deferred pending the results of toxicology tests—is being mourned accordingly.Chief among those feeling the sudden loss of the 47-year-old, who was found dead in a Los Angeles-area hotel room Thursday evening, are his former bandmates.

"We are deeply saddened to hear the news of Jani's passing," Warrant said in a statement."Our thoughts and prayers go out to his family. Jani was a very  important part of our lives for a long time. We will always be  incredibly proud of the music we created together. He was a true talent  and will be missed by all of us."The band will also be paying tribute to their late member tonight during a show they have planned in Grand Forks, North Dakota.

Meanwhile, Sullivan Brigg, who repped Jani for seven years and   remained close friends with him until his passing, told E! News that,   like many rockers, his pal was not without his demons."He was an incredible and gifted musician and a dear friend, but he   had a lot of problems. It's no secret that Jani's had a difficult time   for many years. Our genre of music has lost a real legend. I'll miss   him."And he's clearly not alone in his sentiment.—Additional reporting by Katie Rhames
