Andy Cohen got to be a kid again when he was offered to taste Amber Tamblyn’s breast milk.

During Wednesday night’s episode of Watch What Happens Live (May 17, 2017), the host drank some of the milk the Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants alum had previously pumped for her baby daughter. Though Cohen initially made a face, he later revealed the concoction wasn’t as bad as he thought it would be.
“It’s sweet. And it’s good with a tequila chaser!” he said after the tasting. “That’s the closest to a breast I’ve ever been.”
Tamblyn welcomed her first child with actor David Cross in February. In a letter sent by Hillary Clinton, the actress revealed she had named her newborn Marlow Alice Cross.
“That was crazy!” Cohen added. “We’ve been doing this show for eight years and we’ve [never had breast milk].”
However, he’s not the only celebrity to have tasted another star’s breast milk! Reality TV cameras famously captured Tamera Mowry drinking twin sister Tia Mowry’s milk after the Sister, Sister actress gave birth. American Pie star Jason Biggs also previously admitted to slipping on some pumped by his wife, Jenny Mollen.
See? Everybody’s doing it.
