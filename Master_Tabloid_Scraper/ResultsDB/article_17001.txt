Have you ever imagined what it would sound like if the Rolling Stones covered a Taylor Swift  song? OMG, us too!But you don't have to imagine anymore, Swifties, because the internet is our friend.Anthony Vincent, the self-proclaimed "voice of the ten second song," has given us the most epic "Bad Blood" cover ever because he does it in not just one, or even two voices. Rather, he performs the pop hit in the style of 20 famous voices! Vincent shows off his skills in famous guises such as Mick Jagger and the rest of the Stones, TLC, Def Leppard, the cast of Grease, Cyndi Lauper, Janis Joplin, Coolio and more.Seriously, we couldn't stop listening to it because his impersonations are on point. We are pretty sure Taylor would appreciate this tribute right down to his ridiculously amazing cat T-shirt.
