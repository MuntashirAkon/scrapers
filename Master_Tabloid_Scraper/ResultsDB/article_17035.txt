Demi Lovato Gets Extra Explicit With A Series Of Nude Photos To Go Along With Her SexXxiest Single Ever Body Say!/n

We're confident this will end up making your Summer 2016 playlist!
Demi Lovato had us a bit worried recently when she started deleting and reactivating her social media accounts… but we guess that was all a ruse to get us ready for a brand new single!
Luckily, the 23-year-old blessed us with Body Say late Thursday night — and it is indeed her sexiest single to date.

In case you still thought of DemiGod as a Disney star, we're thinking lyrics like "And if I had it my way, I would take you deep," and, "If my body had a say, I would come again," kind of shatter that illusion.
Unless their Original Movies have changed a WHOLE lot. LOLz!
Still, what's most interesting about this release is that Body Say is NOT part of Demi's fifth studio album Confident, which means we might be getting a whole entire album this Fall.
Ch-ch-check out Demi Lovato's Body Say WITH the controversial lyrics (below)!!! 

What do YOU think, Perezcious readers? Better than 2015's Cool for the Summer??
