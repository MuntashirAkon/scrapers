The gorgeous gal also unapologetically promised to be "more honest than ever," and it looks like she's already working on that social media resolution!
The 23-year-old took to the status sharing site on Thursday to vent her frustration about society's obsession with celebrity culture, saying: 

The world is weird

I bet our country knows more about celebrities than they know about what's happening over seas or global warming

We complain about how unfair paparazzi and tabloid rumors are but still buy the magazines to find out who's fucking who and who wore it best

The singer makes a pretty good point!
And the Disney alum even went on to create a poll, asking her almost 37 million followers if they know more about the FBI's Top 10 Most Wanted list or Justin Bieber's former flames, sharing: 

How many people can name someone on the FBI's top 10 most wanted list

The Cool for the Summer performer then tried to figure out who is responsible for all this focus on fame, pointing fingers at the media:

Is it our fault though? Has society fed into it or is this just easy business with everyone from blogs to magazines trying to cash in?

Who's fault is it that teens can name more celebrity feuds than wars?

But Twitter might not be the only place where DemDem goes to let off some steam.
On Wednesday night, the artist also revealed that we might be hearing a song about her grievances in the future, posting:

In the studio….. Gettin honest….
