Girlfriend’s Guide to Divorce star Lisa Edelstein is taking flack for an anti-Donald Trump tweet she posted following the death of Alan Thicke.
Edelstein wrote, “RIP Alan Thicke. Seems like everyone is checking out before the Trumpacolypse.”
The negative response from Twitter soon rolled in, with many calling the actress “classless” and slamming her for politicizing Thicke’s sudden passing.

Edelstein has not personally responded to the backlash but retweeted several anti-Trump posts.
