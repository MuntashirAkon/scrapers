Overalls, and slip dresses, and daisies! Oh my! Kendall and Kylie Jenner are definitely throwing it back to the golden age of the 90s in their latest fashion collaboration with PacSun.

With over 100 pieces to choose from, the new collection — dubbed “Golden Child” — is a fresh take on the retro decade with dashes of the girls’ sporty influence. Clean and minimal, the line includes everything from so-hot-right now gingham prints to a daisy-patterned slip dress that looks at home in an old dELiA*s catalog.
The collection ranges from a super-affordable $22.95 to $64.95. Release dates of the new line will be split in two with pieces debuting July 24 and September 9 — so fans will have double the reasons to go back-to-school shopping!
For now, take a look at the sister’s freshly-released ad campaign — below.
