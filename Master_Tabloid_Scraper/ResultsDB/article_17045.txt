After being arrested for impersonating a nurse, a woman caring for Bobbi Kristina Brown during the final six months of her life has been charged with practicing nursing without a license.

According to the AP, Taowo Sobamowo is being held at the Gwinnett County jail in Lawrenceville, Georgia. Sobamowo cared for Brown at Peachtree Christian Hospice in Duluth, GA. last year, until Brown’s untimely death in July.

As previously reported, Sobamowo was arrested for impersonation and was immediately fired. Also according to previous reports, Brown’s care was not in any way affected by Sobamowo.
Bobby Brown and the late Whitney Houston’s daughter passed away on July 26, 2015, six months after she was found unconscious and facedown in the bathtub at her Georgia bathroom on Jan. 31. Houston passed away in a similar manner almost three years prior, in February 2012; she was found in the bathtub at the Beverly Hills Hotel one night before the Grammy Awards.
In October 2015, Bobbi Kristina’s conservator Bedelia Hargrove filed a lawsuit containing the allegation that Brown’s live-in boyfriend Nick Gordon injected her with a fatal “toxic mixture” before she was hospitalized. The lawsuit further claims Gordon “battered and bruised” the 22-year-old aspiring singer, and knocked her tooth out.
Gordon has since appeared in a TV interview/intervention with Dr. Phil in March 2015, and in December caused a stir when he tweeted a photoshopped Holiday Christmas card photo with the late Brown.
