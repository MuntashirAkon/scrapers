Delia's Is Baaaaack! Here Are 5 Stars We Think Should Partner with the Online Retailer/n
We’ve already said our goodbyes to clothing chain Delia’s. But thanks to fan support and feedback, the beloved teen-targeted brand is making a comeback returning to both online and catalog in time for the next back-to-school season. To celebrate, we’ve rounded up five young stars who we think would make great ambassadors for the re-vamped brand.

Kylie Jenner
The 17-year-old understands what it takes to launch her own clothing line (she has a line at PacSun with sister Kendall). So what can she bring to Delia’s? Her colorful line of hair extensions, of course. Girls all over the country go crazy for her vibrant clip-in tresses, which would be perfect for the clothing store’s accessories section.

Bella Thorne
She’s the face of Candie’s, a rising star on red carpet and she has the street style to help the brand thrive.

Bethany Mota
This YouTuber has a partnership with Aeropostale, her own fragrance and a cult following, so it’d be silly for the brand not to team with the young star, who has practically reached celebrity status thanks to her video blogs.

The Cast of Pretty Little Liars
The Rosewood girls have a serious sense of style — and a huge fanbase. Plus, it seems the retailer already loves the PLL girls (see photo below), so a collaboration only seems natural.





 Who tuned in to #PLL last night for the #BigAReveal?!? Our mind is blown! 😱🅰😱
