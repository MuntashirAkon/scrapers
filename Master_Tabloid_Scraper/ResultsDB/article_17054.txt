5 Things Our Inner Teenagers Will Miss Most About Delia's/n
If you grew up in the ’90s, you probably let out a big, long sigh when you heard Delia’s filed for Bankruptcy. (And if you’re just hearing it now, we’re sorry to be the bearers of the tough news.) WWD reported that the retailer will probably be forced to close all its stores and liquidate, as its been unable to find a merger partner. (That’s right — no more printed Henleys for you.) 
Needless to say, this development has made us very nostalgic. So we rounded up the things we’ll always remember about the brand (and miss the most).

1. The Catalogue 
What was better than flipping through and earmarking the pages, while eating your after-school snack? Nothing. 





 You could say we’re hungry… is there an emoji for tacos yet? 🍕❓🎂 #Nom #SayYes

2. The Huge Selection of Graphic Tees
No other store has the range and variety. Period. 





 Just call us a couple of knit wits! Which one to wear first? #NewArrivals

3. And of Course the Animal Sweaters 
They’re coming back, you guys. Just ask Taylor Swift, Jessica Alba and Kate Hudson.

4. Witty Slogans 
That make us want to doodle at our desks.

5. Endless Outfit Inspiration 
In conclusion, we’ll be busy mourning with some ice cream and a My So Called Life marathon on Netflix. (We’ll also be busy searching through old photos to find the perfect Delia’s themed #TBT for this week.) 
Are you sad the store is closing its doors? What’s your best Delia’s memory?
