Picks and Pans Review: Delia Smith's Winter Collection: Comfort Food/n
by Delia Smith
An ebullient home cook whose books sell by the millions in Great Britain, Delia Smith has yet to make her mark in America. This handsome volume, then, is likely to be a magnet for cookbook junkies eager to see what the fuss is about. They won’t be disappointed; brisk but reassuring, Smith presents innovative versions of classic cold-weather fare: braised steak au poivre in red wine; a tarte tatin made with red onions, rather than apples; and mashed potatoes sparked with pesto. And lagniappes including Parsnip Crisps and Camembert Croquettes with Fresh Date and Apple Chutney are particularly amusing. Evocative and wonderfully readable, Smith’s Winter Collection is a nice book to settle in with—even if you have no intention of re-creating her poached pheasant with celery or confit of cranberries. (Random House, $35)
