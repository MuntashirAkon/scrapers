George Clooney is making waves overseas. The actor was photographed manning a water taxi in Venice, Italy, on Thursday, Aug. 29, prompting a local lawyer to alert the authorities. Clooney—wearing a T-shirt advertising his liquor brand, Casamigos Tequila—arrived at Cipriani to promote his new movie, Gravity, during the Venice Film Festival.According to La Nuova Venezia newspaper, attorney Mario D'Elia sent a letter to police after seeing Clooney at the helm. D'Elia explained that the actor would need a nautical license and a permit to drive a water taxi, and asked cops to check his credentials.

Clooney, 52, laughed off the incident later that afternoon by comparing his steering skills to his astronautical film costarring Sandra Bullock. "Other than getting lost in space, turning in Venice by boat is one of the most difficult situations I faced," the single star joked during a press conference.According to Venetian police, any administrative penalties would concern only the owner of the vehicle—not Clooney. Phew!
