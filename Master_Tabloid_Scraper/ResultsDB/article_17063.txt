Delia Brown, is that you? Everwood star Vivien Cardone returned to TV screens in "Star-Struck Victims," the Wednesday, Feb. 24 episode of Law & Order: SVU.Viewers first met Cardone in A Beautiful Mind when she played Marcee in 2001. She went on from there to Everwood, which ran from 2002-2006. On the WB series, she played Delia Brown, the daughter of Andy (Treat Williams) and sister to Ephram (Gregory Smith) for 89 episodes.After Everwood ended, she appeared in 2008's All Roads Lead Home, did an episode of Law & Order: Criminal Intent in 2010 and in 2011 was part of One Life to Live.

On SVU, Cardone played Kristi Cryer, a vlogger who accuses a famous TV star (Craig Bierko) and the manager of his night club of rape. Her vlog brought other victims out of the woodwork and prompted Rollins (Kelli Giddish) to go rogue and undercover in an attempt to catch the perps in action."The blogging aspect is so disturbing to me," Giddish told E! News. "It's just a very strange thing to see a victim going through that and also talking about it at the same time to her online audience." She urged viewers to keep an open mind about that and acknowledged it could be a struggle, "but it's very present in today's time. Kids do that stuff."In the end, the attackers weren't found guilty in the assault on Cardone's character, but Dodds (Andy Karl) leaked Rollins' undercover tape to the press.Law & Order: SVU airs Wednesdays, 9 p.m. on NBC.(E! and NBC are both part of the NBCUniversal family.)
