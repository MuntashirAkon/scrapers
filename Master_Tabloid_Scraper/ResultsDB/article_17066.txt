The Comedy Central Roast of Justin Bieber just got really interesting. Why? Martha Stewart.Yes, the domestic goddess will roast the pop star. Seriously. Other Justin Bieber roasters include Snoop Dogg, Ludacris, Shaquille O'Neal, Hannibal Buress, Chris D'Elia, Natasha Leggero and Jeffrey Ross.Martha Stewart. Wonder what kind of sick burns the two will come up with for each other.OK, we're moving on now. The special will tape on Saturday, March 14 at Sony Studios and air on Comedy Central on Monday, March 30 at 10 p.m. Kevin Hart is the roast master. "I don't normally do roasts, but I had to step out for my guy Biebsâ€¦It's his big 21. It's about to be operation roast everyone's ass," Hart said in a statement when his role was announced.

Guess Seth Rogen is still happily ignoring Bieber's requests to join him on stage. Joel Gallen will executive produce the special. He also helmed the roasts of James Franco, Charlie Sheen, Donald Trump and William Shatner.Bieber's roast coincides with his 21st birthday. "For years I have wanted Comedy Central to roast me. They said only if I provided them w/ more material so for a year now I have worked hard," Bieber wrote on Twitter when his special was announced. "Finally after all that hard work for my 21st bday it's happening. Thanks @RyanSeacrest & @ComedyCentral for the announcement. Let's do it :) Lol. #BieberRoast.""Justin has been asking us for a few years to roast him, and we just kept telling him to go create more source material first. We're thrilled he listened," Kent Alterman, president of content development & original programming at Comedy Central, said in a statement.
