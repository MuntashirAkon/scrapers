Chris D'Elia -- DON'T RELEASE OSCAR PISTORIUS ... He Should Rot for Years/nIf you kill your chick, you SHOULDN'T GET A BREAK -- so says Chris D'Elia who says the fact Oscar Pistorius is being considered for early release from prison is disgusting.  Oscar has been locked up for 8 months for killing his girlfriend back in 2013 -- and a parole board recently moved to release him in 2 months to house arrest ... so he could stay in a nearby mansion.  That is, until a judge stepped in this week and blocked it after a public outcry.  Enter D'Elia with the straight talk:   "You gotta be in jail for longer than 8 months if you kill somebody. It's gotta be years and years and years of you to be in jail and think about what you did. " The good news for the  "Undateable " star ... it could now take months for officials to re-review Oscar's case. /n
