Common: HGH Is A Cop-Out ... Great Athletes Don't Need It /nRap star Common says there are no shortcuts to greatness ... and athletes who use HGH can never, ever be compared to legends like Michael Jordan and LeBron James ... who did it au naturel. Common was out in Beverly Hills when we talked all things sports with him ...Â  and when the conversation turned to HGH ... the Chicago rapper sounded off. HGH is a hot topic right now ... with everyone from Mark Cuban to Chris D'elia weighing in on whether or not its time for the sports world to accept the health benefits the drug can offer. Check it out -- Common's not the type of guy to diss anyone -- but he makes it clear -- HGH just takes all the wonder and fun -- out of professional sports. Hope no MLB Hall of Fame voters see this ... for some guys' sake./n
