Nicki Minaj Shares A Cryptic ‘Humble’ Tweet & The Internet Is Calling Taylor Swift Shade!/n

Is Nicki Minaj bringing her feud with Taylor Swift back from the dead??
That's what some fans are saying following the release of the country-turned-pop star's new track Look What You Made Me Do!
Video: Nicki & Blac Chyna Rake It Up In New Yo Gotti Video!
Minutes after Tay's single dropped on Thursday night, the rapper took to Twitter with a cryptic message: 

Nigga sit down. Be humble
— NICKI MINAJ (@NICKIMINAJ) August 25, 2017
The tweet quotes Kendrick Lamar's hit HUMBLE., and seemingly comes out of nowhere!
While Nicki didn't elaborate at all, commenters are certain she's throwing shade:

Drag her queen.

After all, the award-winning artists got into a bit of a feud two years ago… also ahead of the MTV VMAs. In case you don't remember, Swift thought Minaj was throwing shots at her after being snubbed for a video nom!
It ended up being a big misunderstanding, which the 27-year-old apologized for.
So, do U think Nicki is calling out the singer this time??
