Yesterday (Oct. 30, 2016), Michael Douglas confirmed what Val Kilmer has denied for years: the actor is battling cancer.

Page Six reports that Douglas made the confession while discussing their 1996 film The Ghost in the Darkness in London saying, “Val was a wonderful guy who is dealing with exactly what I had, and things don’t look too good for him,”
Douglas, who battled tongue cancer back in 2010, revealed that’s why Kilmer has been keeping such a low profile the last few years. “My prayers are with him,” Douglas continued. “That’s why you haven’t heard too much from Val lately.”

Rumors about Kilmer possibly having throat cancer surfaced last year when he was hospitalized after he began bleeding from his throat. Soon after, the actor was photographed with a breathing machine and a tracheotomy tube in his neck.
Despite the overwhelming evidence, Kilmer has steadily denied he’s battling cancer, even taking to Facebook to shut down the rumors.
“Thank you for all your sweet support. But I have not had a tumor, or a tumor operations, or any operation. I had a complication where the best way to receive care was to stay under the watchful eye of the ucla ICU. Friends have assisted who know my spiritual convictions and have been most sensitive and kind for the extra effort in making sure there’s minimum gossip and silly talk. I am praying for a speedy return to the boards as they say. God bless you all and please don’t worry. Love and deep affection , Val”
