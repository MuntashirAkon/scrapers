Yolanda Hadid’s long and hard battle with Lyme disease was so straining at times that she even considered suicide.

In an excerpt from her new memoir, Believe Me: My Battle With the Invisibility of Lyme Disease, the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills alum opened up about wanting to kill herself during one of the darkest moments of her life.
