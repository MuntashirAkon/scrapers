Tina Fey promises that the Mean Girls musical is full of “baby Timberlakes.”

Fey dropped by The Tonight Show to talk to Jimmy Fallon about what’s happening behind the scenes of the Broadway musical based on Mean Girls as it’s “moving along” in production.
“I mean, I’ll probably come back here like five more times before we actually come to Broadway,” Fey told Fallon, “but it’s a real thing now.”
The writer told Fallon that the show will preview in D.C. at the National Theatre beginning in October and that you can buy tickets now.
“The secret with movie musicals is you can secretly suck and be a star,” she explained to Fallon. “But to do things on stage? Like, these kids are so talented. We have the cast now. We’ve been rehearsing for about a month. There’s a bunch of baby Timberlakes. Everyone can do everything! They just sing so loud and they dance so hard.”

Fey’s husband, Jeff Richmond, who also scored 30 Rock, is writing the music and Nell Benjamin is writing the lyrics. The show is expected to open on Broadway in 2018.
Fey also updated Fallon her daughters, Alice and Penelope Richmond.
“Alice, my older one, is 11. I really can’t say more than that, because recently she said to me, ‘Hey, I was at my friend’s house and her older sister showed me a link of you telling a bunch of stories about me as a baby on talk shows.’ I was like, ‘I don’t know what you’re talking about…That never happened.’ So, I can’t talk about her anymore,” Fey explained.
