Kate Middleton made history in style when she visited The Netherlands on Tuesday (Oct. 11, 2016) as a part of her first solo engagement abroad.

Conducting business alone on behalf of the royal family, the Duchess of Cambridge had lunch with King Willem-Alexander and his children before viewing the art collection at the Mauritshuis Museum in The Hauge. During her trip, Middleton also visited the British Ambassador’s Residence for a roundtable discussion about mental health and attended a robotics class at Bouwkeet workshop.

For the outing, Middleton kept things simple and opted for a custom skirt-and-blazer combo by Catherine Walker & Co. She accessorized her look with a pair of nude Gianvito Rossi pumps and a matching clutch from L.K. Bennett, as well as a pair of pearl earrings on loan from the Queen.
This was Middleton’s first solo trip abroad. She was originally slated to visit Malta alone in 2014, but canceled after coming down with severe morning sickness from her pregnancy. Her husband, Prince William, took her place instead.
