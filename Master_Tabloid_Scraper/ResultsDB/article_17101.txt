The cast of Jersey Shore may have moved on from their wild ways, but Ronnie Magro seems to be up to his old antics.

The former MTV star was spotted wandering around a casino all bloodied up while partying with a gal pal early Friday morning. An eyewitness told TMZ the 31-year-old came out of a bathroom at The Venetian around 1:15 a.m. with his white shirt splattered with blood. Though Ronnie had his left hand wrapped in a plastic bag, the onlooker claimed Sammi “Sweetheart” Giancola’s ex-boyfriend didn’t seem to care.
The woman with Ronnie was also reportedly covered in blood, though she appeared to be uninjured as she was escorted off the premise by security along with the reality star.
The shocking public appearance came after news that Ronnie will not be featured in an upcoming Jersey Shore reunion special. According to co-star Deena Cortese, the cast have not spoken to the him in quite some time.
“Right now we’re in a group chat with me, Pauly [DelVecchio], Vinny [Guadagnino], Mike [“The Situation” Sorrentino], Nicole [“Snooki” Polizzi], Jenni [“JWoww” Farley] and Sam. Ronnie’s actually not in it right now, in the group chat, but we’re all talking about it and we’re all trying to figure out ways to make it happen,” she told Us Weekly. “We just all haven’t spoken to him. I think Vinny’s the only one that really talks to him.”
