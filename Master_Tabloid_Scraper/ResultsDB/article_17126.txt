Ola said she was still owed a massive chunk of the  "Thriller " profits ... nearly 30 years after it was released.The director of the music video John Landis -- who filed a similar lawsuit against the estate -- has also settled ... but he wanted in excess of $2 million, so we're guessing he got a little more than Ola./n
