As Radar previously reported, Jackson claimed he “got played” during his explosive sex drama with Olympios in BIP, but according to a source, “he’s over it.”
“He hasn’t spoken to Corinne ahead of the taping, and he’s not worried about seeing her.”
Olympios refused to go back to the show after accusing Jackson of sexually assaulting her, yet she recently announced that she will in fact be present for the reunion.
