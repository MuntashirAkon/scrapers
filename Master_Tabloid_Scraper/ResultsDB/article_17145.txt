As Radar readers know, Fisher suffered a massive heart attack on a United Airlines flight from London to Los Angeles, eventually losing her life at the age of 60.
The very next day, while planning Carrie’s funeral, Reynolds died after suffering a series of strokes.
Fisher’s brother Todd told Entertainment Tonight that his mother’s last words to him were about how much she missed Carrie.

“She missed her daughter and wanted to very much be with her,” he said. “She had been very strong the last several days. [There was] enormous stress on her, obviously. And this morning she said those words to me and 15 minutes later she had a stroke and virtually left.”
