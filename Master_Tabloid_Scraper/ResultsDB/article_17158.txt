Spoiler alert of the century: Rachel Lindsay, this season’s Bachelorette, finds love on the show…which doesn’t kick off until next week.

Lindsay revealed that she is engaged to be married on a conference call with reporters on Thursday (May 18, 2017) ahead of the show’s premiere on May 22.
“I am very much so in love and very much so engaged,” shared Lindsay. “I am getting my happy ending!”
Most frontrunners of the show choose to keep the outcome of their journey under wraps to, you know, maintain suspense over the season. This candid news sets up a whole new precedent for what’s to come.
Lindsay participated in Nick Viall’s season of The Bachelor just last year before she was selected as the headlining name of season 13 of the series. Host Chris Harrison said that viewers can expect a mix of characters who will be competing for her heart.

“You have all these Type A personalities, some older guys, more professional, because of who Rachel is,” Harrison explained [via E! News]. “These guys are used to being successful, and good at what they do. And they’re not used to having people getting in their face, and so there’s some conflict.”
Catch the first episode of The Bachelorette on Monday, May 22, at 9 p.m. on ABC.
