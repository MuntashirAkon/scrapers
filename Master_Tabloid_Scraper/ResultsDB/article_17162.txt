Video of Harrison Ford’s near-collision with a passenger plane has surfaced.

In a clip obtained by the Associated Press, the Star Wars actor’s Aviat Husky is seen flying just above a taxing airliner as it tries to land on runway at the John Wayne Airport near California’s Orange County. The yellow, single-engine plane narrowly misses an American Airlines 737 and casts a large shadow over the passenger jet as it flies over it.
As previously reported, Ford had mistakenly aimed for the airport’s taxiway instead a runway that ran parallel to it during his landing. In an air traffic control recording, Ford was recorded asking, “Was that airliner meant to be underneath me?”
At the time, the American Airlines plane was loaded with 110 passengers and a six-person crew at the time. It departed safely to Dallas a few minutes later.
The Federal Aviation Administration is now investigating the Feb. 13 incident, saying that controllers gave Ford the proper landing instructions and that he correctly read them back.
Landing on a taxiway is a violation of FAA safety guidelines and violators could have their pilot’s license revoked.
