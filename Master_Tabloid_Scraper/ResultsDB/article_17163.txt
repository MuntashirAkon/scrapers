Harrison Ford just had another near-death experience.

The Star Wars alum’s private plane nearly collided with a passenger jet on Monday (Feb. 13, 2017) while landing at the John Wayne Airport near California’s Orange County. Piloting a single-engine Aviat Husky, Ford mistakenly aimed for a taxiway instead the runway that ran parallel to it, NBC News reports.
As the 74-year-old was landing, his plane narrowly passed over the top of an American Airlines 737, which was loaded with 110 passengers and a six-person crew at the time. In an air traffic control recording, Ford was recorded asking, “Was that airliner meant to be underneath me?”
The Federal Aviation Administration, which is now investigating the incident, since released a statement saying the controllers gave Ford the proper landing instructions and that he had correctly read back the clearance.
Landing on a taxiway is a violation of FAA safety guidelines and violators could have their pilot’s license revoked.
In 2015, Ford crashed a vintage two-seater fighter plane he was piloting in a Venice, Calif. golf course after its engine had failed. The actor sustained moderate injuries, but was conscious and breathing when paramedics arrived at the scene.
Ford also survived scary helicopter crash in Santa Clarita, Calif. back in 1999.
