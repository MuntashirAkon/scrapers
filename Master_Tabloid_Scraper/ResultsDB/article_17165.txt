The death certificates for Debbie Reynolds and Carrie Fisher have been released, confirming that the mother-and-daughter duo died of a fatal stroke and cardiac arrest respectively.

According to documents obtained by TMZ, Reynolds passed away from a “intracerebral hemorrhage” caused by high blood pressure. The report also listed hypertension as an underlying cause of the stroke.
On the other hand, the report for Fisher, who died a day before Reynolds, listed “cardiac arrest” as the cause of the death. However, the L.A. County Coroner’s Office also noted that their official ruling must be “deferred” as more tests are needed in order to identify the trigger for the massive heart attack the Star Wars actress suffered shortly before her death.
As previously reported, Fisher suffered a cardiac arrest and stopped breathing aboard a transatlantic flight from London to Los Angeles on Dec. 23, 2016. Four days later, she passed away at the age of 60.
While making funeral arrangements for her daughter on Dec. 24, 2016, Reynolds, suffered a stroke. According to the Singin’ in the Rain star’s son, the 84-year-old’s last words were: “I want to be with Carrie.”
Fisher and Reynolds were buried side-by-side at Forest Lawn Memorial Park on Jan. 6, 2017.
