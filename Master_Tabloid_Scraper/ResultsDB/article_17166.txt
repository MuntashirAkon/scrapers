What’s more awkward than running into one ex-girlfriend? Running into two ex-girlfriend on live TV.

The Bachelor star Nick Viall did just that when he appeared on Monday’s episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live! with ex-girlfriends Andi Dorfman and Kaitlyn Bristowe, the former contestants who dumped him for other men. As they shifted uncomfortably in their seats, Dorfman blurted out, “This is so awkward!”
“Can I just say thank you for not picking me?” Viall, the subject on this season of the ABC dating show, told his exes.
“We’ve run into each other,” the 36-year-old, when grilled about how often he’d see his former flames, admitted. He then hesitantly asked Dorfman, “We’re friends?”
“Not friends like we are,” the attorney interjected, hugging Bristowe.
“We’re friendly,” quipped Viall, who infamously called out Dorfman for having sex with him in the Fantasy Suite  during an After the Final Rose live special. Needless to say, their exchange became even more cringe-worthy after that statement.
