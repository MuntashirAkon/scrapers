President Trump’s announcement that the U.S. will no longer “accept or allow” transgender people to serve in the military drew fierce criticism Wednesday from advocacy groups, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, celebrities, and ordinary citizens, and the controversy reverberated through the late-night scene.
On The Tonight Show, Jimmy Fallon opened up his monologue to Patti Harrison, a transgender comedian, to share her thoughts on Trump’s surprise declaration.
“As a trans person, it’s hard to articulate exactly how I feel,” she said. “I guess if I had to describe it, I’d say, ‘Donald, you’re so stupid. You are so stupid. You’re lucky you’re so hot.’”
Harrison was willing to cut Trump some slack: “You know, I don’t even think Trump knows what ‘transgender’ means,” she said. “He probably thinks transgender people are those cars that turn into robots.”

But Harrison also asserted that “there are amazingly brave trans people who should be allowed to serve, like Kristin Beck, a retired Navy SEAL with a Purple Heart, Bronze Star, and countless service medals. And yet Trump says transgender people in the military would be a tremendous disruption.
“I get it,” Harrison continued. “If you constantly draw attention to yourself, spend all day distracting everyone, and cost taxpayers millions of dollars, the perfect job for you isn’t the military — it’s the President of the United States.”
