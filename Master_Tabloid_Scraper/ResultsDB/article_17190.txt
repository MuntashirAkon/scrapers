'Pawn Stars' Rick Harrison Says Don't Invest In O.J. Simpson Stuff /nNothing hurts the value of an autograph like murder ... which is why O.J. Simpson's got a big problem on his hands, so says  "Pawn Stars " honcho Rick Harrison. With Simpson arguably more famous now than ever before, the guys on the  "TMZ Sports " TV show (airs weeknights on FS1) asked Harrison if he expects a spike in demand for O.J. stuff. But Harrison says the exact opposite will happen -- and says if Juice is planning on making crazy money doing autograph signings at sports collectors shows ... he's BADLY mistaken./n
