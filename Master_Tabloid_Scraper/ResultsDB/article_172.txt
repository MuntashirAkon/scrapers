Tamblyn gave birth to Marlow in February. Her birth announcement caused a bit of a stir when Tamblyn and Cross joked that her name was “Dauphinoise Petunia Brittany Scheherazade Von Funkinstein Mustard Witch RBG Cross Tamblyn-Bey jr.” They revealed Marlow’s real name later in an Instagram post showing a personalized letter from Hillary Clinton.
“Dear Marlow, Happy Birthday! Your birth has been a source of great joy for your parents, Amber and David, and your vast community of admirers and champions,” Clinton wrote. “I send my best wishes to you for a lifetime of amazing accomplishments and adventures, full of love, learning, and friendship. With warm regards, I am Sincerely yours, Hillary Rodham Clinton.”
