That brings the death total to three, including gunman Cedric Amperson (53) and his wife, Karen Smith (53), a teacher who was the only intended target of the shooting.
Hospital personnel say the other young victim, who has not been identified, has been "stabilized."
Police Chief Jarrod Burguan (above) confirmed both boys were standing behind Smith when her husband showed up to "drop something off" but instead opened fire with a .357 without saying a word.
Burguan says though Amperson likely didn't intend to harm any of the students, he did reload once during the shooting.
Just horrible.
