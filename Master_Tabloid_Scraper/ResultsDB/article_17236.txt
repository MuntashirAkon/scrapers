Police Say Children Were Not The Target In The San Bernardino Elementary School Shooting — Get The Latest From The Press Conference/n

Only one person was targeted in the latest San Bernardino shooting, police say.
Earlier Monday, we reported that two adults were killed and two children injured in a shooting at North Park Elementary School in California.
But according to the San Bernardino Police Department, the two children caught in the line of fire were not believed to be the targets of the apparent murder-suicide.

Authorities say the unidentified shooter reportedly checked in the front school office and signed in where he was known by school staff. He was given permission by the teacher to enter the classroom.
The man then shot the female teacher with a handgun in the classroom, where two students were unfortunately standing too close.
Police Capt. Ron Maass said at a press conference: 
"The children we do not believe were targeted. The suspect had come to the classroom to visit. The adult female was in the classroom… We believe the two children were the unfortunate recipients of injuries by being in the proximity to the female at the time of the incident."
The latest reports say the two children are in critical condition, while the shooter reportedly died of self-inflicted gun wounds. As we reported, the incident may have stemmed from a domestic violence ordeal.
Officials also noted that President Donald Trump called the San Bernardino Mayor Carey Davis and "offered his condolences."
The school will remain closed for the next two days.
