Catherine Zeta-Jones Has $2,600 Worth of Skin Care Inside Her Bathroom Cabinet Learning #3: If you like something a lot and it works, stock up on it. While we have our favorite makeup removers, Catherine has three Lancôme BI-FACIL - Double-A.../n
Learning #1: While many celeb skin-care go-tos are present (Charlotte Tilbury, Cle de Peau, Dior), the star has a penchant for lesser known brands as well, including Rhonda Allison, Elemis and Vanessa Megan. Catherine is probably a frequent spa-goer, as these less mainstream brands are typically only sold at places where you get a massage or facial or through independent online retailers. Learning #2: Like many celebs, Michael Douglas better half is a fan of the Icelandic beauty trend right now, owning several products from Skyn Iceland. Nordic waters, especially near the volcanic areas of Iceland, are said to have healing and impurity-removing properties. 

Learning #3: If you like something a lot and it works, stock up on it. While we have our favorite makeup removers, Catherine has three Lancôme BI-FACIL - Double-Action Eye Makeup Remover bottles waiting to be used. Learning #4: You can never have enough anti-wrinkle creams and serums. The actress did mention in her Instagram post that she doesn't use all these products at once. That would be moisture overload, but she does like to experiment with different luxury brands and they all need to address anti-aging. Learning #5: If there's one drugstore product she relies on, it's deodorant. It's hot under those harsh set lights—Catherine keeps in cool with a $7 Certain Dri product. Hey, you can't be fancy all the time.Scroll below to shop what we can spot from the actress' beauty closet.
