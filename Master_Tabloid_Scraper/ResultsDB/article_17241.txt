Prince Harry took part in a ceremony honoring the 650 officers and member of the staff who have died in service of the Metropolitan Police.

The prince laid a wreath in the Memorial Garden at the Metropolitan Police training facility in Northwest London, according to a report in People. He then planted a cherry tree before speaking with the family members of fallen officers.
“We feel privileged to have Prince Harry here today to share this experience with the families and colleagues of those officers who have given their lives in the line of duty,” said police commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe.
One of the family members the prince spoke with was retired chief superintendent Sid MacKay, whose daughter, also a police officer, was killed while making an arrest in 1997.
“I spoke to Prince Harry and I found him to be caring and interested,” said MacKay, “he had a sense of compassion and understanding.”
