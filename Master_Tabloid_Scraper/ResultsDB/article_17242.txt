The Real Housewives of New York starlet and her ex have made it official after four years of drama.

Today is a big day for Bethenny Frankel; she and Jason Hoppy have finalized their divorce, putting an end to years of bitter negotiations.
“Jason is thrilled that this chapter of his life is over; he is extremely pleased with the settlement that was reached,” Hoppy’s lawyer Bernard Clair said in a statement to People. “Jason looks forward to the future and enjoying that time privately with family, friends and most important to him, his daughter.”
Frankel and Hoppy announced their separation in Dec. 2012, after three years of marriage. The former couple reached a custody agreement for their six-year-old daughter Bryn Hoppy in 2013, but finalizing their divorce didn’t go so smoothly.
