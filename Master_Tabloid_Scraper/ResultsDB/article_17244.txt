Jennifer Hudson is about to bring the house down as Shug Avery in The Color Purple.

A revival of Alice Walker’s classic epistolary novel-turned-Broadway show will open in the Big Apple this fall at the Bernard B. Jacobs Theatre. The Color Purple interweaves the personal stories of African-American women who are struggling to survive in rural Georgia during the early twentieth century.
Hudson is headlining the show as Shug Avery, a sultry blues singer and mentor to the story’s tragic heroine, Celie. She will be joined by London stage actress Cynthia Erivo (Celie) and Danielle Brooks (Sofia), who is more commonly known as Orange is the New Black’s Taystee.

Hudson shared in an exclusive interview with BuzzFeed that she is ecstatic to open her performance to the public. “I’m ready for the journey,” she proclaims.

“I’m ready to get to New York and work hard. I’m ready to create something with a special group of people. The feeling of butterflies that comes with it, that’s empowering and it’s something I will use every night on the stage.”

She calls Shug “a force”, witnessing traces of herself in her character. “I admire her depth of love and her ability to see past fear with courage and bravery.”
