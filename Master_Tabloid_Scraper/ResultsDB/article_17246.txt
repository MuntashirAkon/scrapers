British actor John Hurt reveals that he has been diagnosed pancreatic cancer.

The 75-year-old, who has appeared in a plethora of films including The Elephant Man, Alien, V for Vendetta, and the last two Harry Potter movies, told the Associated Press on Tuesday that he is undergoing treatment for early stages of the disease.
“I have always been open about the way in which I conduct my life and in that spirit I would like to make a statement,” his statement read. “I have recently been diagnosed with early stage pancreatic cancer. I am undergoing treatment and am more than optimistic about a satisfactory outcome, as indeed is the medical team.”
He added, “I am continuing to focus on my professional commitments and will shortly be recording Jeffrey Bernard Is Unwell (one of life’s small ironies!) for BBC Radio 4.”
As four-time BAFTA Award winner and two-time Oscar nominee during his career spanning over six decades, Hurt was recently knighted for his services to drama.
