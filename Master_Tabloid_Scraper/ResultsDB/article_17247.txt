Everyone’s favorite 90’s rom-com starring Freddie Prinze Jr. and Rachael Leigh Cooke, She’s All That, is getting a total remake.

While the 1999 flick is perfect as is, we can’t help but be a wee bit excited with the revamp.
A modern adaption of George Cukor’s 1964 film My Fair Lady and George Bernard Shaw’s play Pygmalion, the remake will be directed by Kenny Leon and produced by Tonya Lewis Lee (Spike Lee’s wife), but no word yet on casting.

Nonetheless, let us relive some of the best scenes with Zack Siler and Laney Boggs from the original movie, also starring the late Paul Walker (*tears* and RIP), Anna Paquin, Matthew Lillard, Kevin Pollak, Jodi Lyn O’Keefe, Usher, Lil’ Kim and Gabrielle Union and many more.

This is what Prinze had to say about the news of the remake:
