 Happy #ThrowbackThursday! The boys of Laguna Beach just had a little reunion!
A few of the original guys from the former MTV reality show just got together and recreated their senior prom photo! Stephen Colletti and Dieter Schmitz both posted photos of the event on Instagram. So cute! Now all we need is to get the entire cast to reunite, live on MTV!
The guys of Laguna Beach, including Trey Phillips, reunited last weekend for a friend’s wedding and decided to recreate the picture. Stephen captioned his photo, “From wine coolers to fine wine, a work in progress… 2004–>2014.” Can you believe it’s been 10 years?!

Dieter captioned his photo, “From senior prom to 10 years later for the first wedding last weekend for Ben. @benjammin2686 @jonathonbernard @stephencolletti @treyphillips lucky to have such great friends my whole life.”

Do you remember the season one prom episode of Laguna Beach? Stephen went with Kristin Cavallari, and then Lauren Conrad went with someone who wasn’t Stephen. Sigh, we thought Lauren and Stephen would end up together, but she moved on and got married! Kristin also moved on, she’s now married and a mom of two!
Now that this mini-reunion happened, we think it’s time for a full cast reunion. What do you think? Are you a Laguna Beach fan? Sound off in the comments!
