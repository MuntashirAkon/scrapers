Catherine Zeta-Jones' Kids Want to Go Into Show Business/n
"When I was less pregnant, they invited me to sing live with Queen Latifah—one of the original songs. I thought it was a wonderful idea and a real honor, until 10 days before I was just about to give birth, I'm on a hydraulic lift going up, going, 'What the [heck] was I thinking?' I got through it, though. It's nerve-wracking," Catherine, 47, admitted. "I've got to say, it's terrifying."

Catherine and Michael Douglas' children, Dylan Douglas, 16, and Carys Douglas, 13, want to become actors, too. "You know, I know it's going to be hard for them, because they've got their grandfather, Kirk [Douglas], they've got me, they have Michael, but they so inherently love it and they're good!" the New York-based actress raved. "They go to summer camp every year—they do like three musicals and straight plays—and they love it. I've had a wonderful life in this business, so if they want to do it, they know the hardships and the percentages of who makes it and who doesn't, so I just think that they've got the talent and I know that they have the drive."Of course, the nature of show business has changed over the years.

And Kirk would know. As Catherine said, "I really could sit there for hours with him."
