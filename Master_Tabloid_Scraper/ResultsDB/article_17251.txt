L’Wren Scott Laid to Rest in Los Angeles/n
L’Wren Scott was remembered by friends and family Tuesday at her funeral attended by longtime partner Mick Jagger and their celebrity pals, including Ellen Barkin, at the Hollywood Forever Funeral Home.
The private funeral service comes just one week after the fashion designer was found dead in her New York City apartment after taking her own life.

A grieving Jagger, who dated the Scott for 12 years, was surrounded by family members, including daughters Elizabeth, 30, Georgia, 22, and sons James, 28, and Gabriel, 16. Other children of the Rolling Stones frontman spoke touching words, including his daughter Karis, 43, who read a poem; daughter Jade, 42, who read Psalm 139, grandchildren Mazie and Zak read Psalm 23, and Scott’s niece Hannah Bambrough read Shakespeare Sonnet 18, according to PEOPLE.
Reverend Ed Bacon from the All Saints Church in Pasadena, Calif., presided over the memorial with Jagger, Scott’s brother Randall Bambrough, talent agent Justinian Kfoury, costume designer Ira M. Hammons-Glass, and creative director Adam Glassman also sharing their special memories of the 49-year-old former model.
Other tributes came from Rolling Stones backup singer Bernard Fowler, who sang “Will the Circle Be Unbroken,” and was accompanied by Eurythmics guitarist Dave Stewart.
Los Angeles has many special meanings for the late designer, who started her career in show business on the West Coast. Not only is it the place where Scott began her work as a costume designer, but it’s also where she met her longtime love, Jagger, while working as a stylist on a shoot in 2001.
