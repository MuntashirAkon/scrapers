WATCH: Boy, Look at All These St. Bernards Just Slobbering Around in a Forest/n

There’s some rustling, a lot of heavy breathing and an innumerable amount of four-legged shapes traipsing through the wilderness.
No, it’s not a new horror movie, but if it was, it would be the most adorable one ever. This video, of a hoard of large dogs wandering around Lasquiti Island in British Columbia, Canada, comes to us courtesy of Lasquite’s Saint Bernards, a kennel run by breeder/owner/handler Tikki Smith.
The video helpfully explains that there are 38 dogs, ranging from 6 months to 9 years, who get to roam the forest on the island freely. There’s also quite a bit of information about their stretch of awards show domination on the Lasquite site, but frankly it’s more fun to just watch the video on repeat. You can put “When the Saints Go Marching In” on while you do it.
Go ahead, it’s fun.
