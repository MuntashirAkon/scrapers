Maryland Rescuers Save St. Bernard Stuck in 30-Foot Dry Well

Mabel was running in circles after her rescue — which makes total sense since she was saved from the bottom of a dry 30-foot circular well.
A team of rescuers from Harford County saved the pooch on Sunday after she apparently fell all the way to the bottom of the well in Perryman, Maryland. And judging by the pics, it was a long, long way down.
“The dog has been removed from the well … alive and well,” said a message on the Harford County Md Fire & EMS Facebook page on Sunday. One of the two photos shared there shows rescuers using ropes and a lot of manpower to get the pooch out.

A later Facebook message remarked on Mabel’s adorable victory dance — which we really wish someone had captured on video.
“Mabel was seen running in circles after she was pulled from the hole,” it said. “She will be taken to a vet to be checked out.”
