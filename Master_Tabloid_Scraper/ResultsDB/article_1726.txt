The Bachelor's Sean and Catherine Lowe Celebrate Their Son's First Birthday/n
In addition to launching a furniture line with Wayfair, the couple has had plenty of time to savor their child's year of firsts. Lucky for fans, they've been able to experience a few on social media as well."This past year has been filled with so many firsts—from first outfits to first baths to first solid foods (none of which actually got in Samuel's mouth—thanks @Dreft Active Baby for tackling that mess!) and everything in between, every moment has been so incredibly special," Sean wrote on Instagram. "Can't wait to see what the future holds for you, my sweet baby boy!"
