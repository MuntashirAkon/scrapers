Bernard Shaw: Adios, CNN/n
Perhaps he just got tired of waiting for the Florida ballots to be counted. But Bernard Shaw, CNN's chief anchorman for much of its 20-year history, is calling it quits.                   The steadfast, mustachioed newsman, who helped establish the 24-hour network and reported on most of its major stories, says he will leave early next year to write books and spend more time with his family.                   Shaw, 60, was expected to officially announce his decision to viewers Friday, at the end of Inside Politics, the show he hosts with Judy Woodruff. (It airs from 5 p.m. to 6 p.m. ET.) But he's hesitating to call it a full-scale retirement.                   "I'm not retiring," he tells the Associated Press. "I'm stepping back."                  Shaw--along with elder squawker Larry King and international news mainstay Christiane Amanpour--has been one of CNN's most visible and recognized personalities during the cable network's influential lifespan. He left his reporting job at ABC News to join CNN in 1980, before the network launched. And he's been there ever since--through the Gulf War and through O.J.--and through this week's historically close, and historically confusing, presidential election.                  "Harder than entering this business is leaving it and leaving CNN," he said. "But you know, some roses are so fragrant. And as a gardener, I want to grow and smell them more, when I'm not writing."                  Shaw will leave when his contract expires February 28, 2001. He currently anchors Inside Politics, CNN World View and the 6 p.m. evening news broadcasts. Shaw hasn't ruled out occasional on-air work, to which CNN founder Ted Turner said Shaw "will always have a home" at the network.                  "Bernie Shaw is one of a handful of CNN 'founders' who helped take 24-hour news from an exciting concept 20 years ago to a fact of life for one billion people around the globe today," Turner said.                  Shaw said his first book will be an autobiography (according to Inside.com, he's signed a deal with Random House). But he also says he'd like to write fiction, as well as a book of essays and a journalism primer.                   This week also no doubt gave him some perspective on his personal life: After working a 16-hour on-air shift during the election, he said he looked forward to not having to put off his personal life for breaking stories.                  Shaw grew up in Chicago and wanted to be a journalist since he was 13. He was a correspondent for CBS in Washington from 1971 to 1977, before leaving to ABC, and then on to CNN, where his presence lent a much-needed dose of credibility to the then-infant news channel.                   He and the network later achieved worldwide fame for their coverage of the Gulf War, as Shaw was one of three reporters dispatched to Baghdad in 1991.                    But lately, CNN's been under fire on the homefront, facing sagging ratings and increased competition from newsie upstarts like MSNBC and Fox News Channel. However, CNN now claims a billion viewers worldwide, and it got a boost this week from its round-the-clock election coverage. Though some critics say CNN's reporting was flat, the network still drew some 5.8 million viewers, putting it in fourth place behind the major networks.                  Shaw, meanwhile, insists his reasons for leaving were personal, and in a statement to colleagues, he said, "I am leaving to give back to my wifely friend, Linda, her husband, and to our adult daughter and son their father. Their sacrifices have kept me here this long."
