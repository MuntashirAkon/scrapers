Chalk it up to "Crazy Stupid Love."British pop star Cheryl Cole revealed Sunday that she secretly wed Frenchman Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini. In a statement posted to her website and various social media accounts, she wrote, "I usually do not discuss my personal life but to stop the speculation I want to share my happy news...Jean-Bernard and I married on 7/7/14. We are very happy and excited to move forward with our lives together."The X Factor U.K. judge included a close-up picture of her wedding rings with the statement.The Girls Aloud singer, 31, and the restaurateur, 33, reportedly tied the knot on a beach in Mustique. Per the European media, four guests attended the ceremony, including Cole's mother, Joan Callaghan.The couple began dating in April and made their public debut at the Cannes Film Festival in May.

Jean-Bernard, who once studied business administration at New York University, was reportedly eager to marry the "Fight for This Love" chart topper just two months into their relationship. Moving into Cheryl's U.K. pad last month fueled that fire. "He's a very impulsive guy," a source told The Mirror. "He thinks the two of them are perfect together and would love to marry her. To people who don't know him it might seem rushed, but he's a passionate Frenchman—he wears his heart on his sleeve."Apparently so!

Prior to romancing Jean-Bernard, Cheryl dated dancer Tre Holloway, but they broke up in October 2013. The "Call My Name" singer was previously married to soccer player Ashley Cole from 2006 to 2010.When Cheryl turned 30, she had an epiphany. "I thought I had every box ticked, career and personal. I was the first to get married. I was the one everyone thought would be the first to have a baby," she recently told Elle U.K. "And then the rug got pulled out from under me. I've learned there is no such thing as a plan. You can't make them. I'm just enjoying finding out who I am. That's good enough right now."
