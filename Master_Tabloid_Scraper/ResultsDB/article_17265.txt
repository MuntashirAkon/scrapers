Kendall Jenner is feeling the (puppy) love.The E! star took to Twitter Thursday to share a photo of an adorable pup, which caught the attention of big sis Khloé Kardashian Odom, who encouraged K.J.'s puppy fever on the social media site."Ugh Kenny let's get one," the reality star wrote, retweeting the photo Kendall shared via the handle @CuteEmergency (which it most certainly is). 

We're pretty sure the 17-year-old stunner needs approval from mom Kris Jenner, but lucky for Kendall, she can hang with Khloé and Lamar's boxer Bernard any time she needs a puppy fix.But as cute as Bernard can be, caring for a pet can be time consuming, and Khloé took to Twitter to tease about her pup's sleeping habits. "Bernard snores soooooo very loud LOL," the 28-year-old former X Factor judge posted on her micro-blogging page. Sounds pretty adorable, Khlo. Care to keek the moment for us all to see?
