Bernard Hopkins Blasts Conor McGregor, 'It's a Fake News Fight' /nShots fired from boxing legend Bernard Hopkins -- who's dissing McGregor vs. Mayweather in a BIG way ... saying the whole thing is a  "fake news " fight.  FYI, B-Hop works for Golden Boy Promotions and is hyping the other superfight of the year -- Canelo vs. GGG ... a fight Hopkins says is undoubtedly the superior event.  In fact, he has a message to people leaning toward buying the MayMac PPV over the Canelo fight.   "You got a chance to get in a Ferrari but you choose the Pontiac?!? "  Yeah ... he's not holding back. In fact, he won't even say Conor's full name.  Ouch. /n
