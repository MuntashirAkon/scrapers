Canelo Alvarez: I Guarantee GGG's Gettin' Knocked Out!!  /nCanelo Alvarez says there's only ONE way his fight with Gennady Golovkin's gonna end -- with GGG getting KNOCKED THE HELL OUT!  The boxing superstar tells TMZ Sports there's a ZERO percent chance their superfight goes the distance -- and there's  "no doubt " Golovkin will hit the canvas for the first time in his career.  Canelo also says he ain't losing sleep over the Mayweather vs. McGregor fight being booked 3 weeks before his Sept. 16th brawl ... but says the move was straight disrespectful.  As for Bernard Hopkins, who told TMZ Sports Canelo will win by decision -- Alvarez has a message for him too. /n
