Bernard Hopkins -- 'Avocados Are Overrated' /nWhat's tiny and green and SUCKS??? Avocados ... so says boxing champ Bernard Hopkins. We were out in NYC talking to the 49-year-old legend about his upcoming fight with Sergey Kovalev ... when we asked the nutrition-conscious athlete if there was a food he's eliminated from his diet. And that's when B-Hop UNLOADED on the avocado ... calling it  "overrated. " In fact, Hopkins says he'd rather put it on his toenails that in his mouth (apparently, some people use avocado oil for luxuriously soft cuticles). But avocados aren't the only item to draw Bernard's ire ... check out the clip to find out what drink The Alien could do without. /n
