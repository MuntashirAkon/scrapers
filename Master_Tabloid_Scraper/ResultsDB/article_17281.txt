Kristin Cavallari -- You're Bernard Hopkins? I'm Not Impressed. /nThe Mission: Boxing legend Bernard Hopkins wanted to take a stab at being a TMZ paparazzi on the streets of NYC today. The Target: MTV star Kristin Cavallari ... who also happens to be married to Chicago Bears QB Jay Cutler. The Result: Bernard started off strong ... but things fizzled pretty quickly when it became clear Kristin had no idea who he was.  The Best Part: Bernard's post-shoot analysis ... where he talks about his paparazzi strengths and weaknesses ... and reminds us that Kristin's smokin' hot. Ya gotta watch the clip -- B-Hop could have a stellar career behind the camera if the whole boxing thing doesn't work out./n
