Stitches: No More Excuses, Game ... Fight Me in Legit Boxing Ring/nThe Game can finally settle his beef with Stitches without risk of ending up in jail -- he has an offer to step into a boxing ring ... and Stitches has already signed on the dotted line. Damon Feldman is promoting the celebrity boxing event and tells us the fight would be 3 rounds, each being 90 seconds long. After the Miami K.O. of Stitches ... Feldman thinks there's enough interest that the purse could be as high as 7 figures. Game has said the fact he's on probation is why his pal Wack 100 stepped in to take down Stitches the first time, but a celeb boxing match would keep him on the right side of the law.  No date yet for the fight, and no word if Game will bite.  It's hardly a rematch since Stitches barely got a step in, much less a punch -- but we're told he's taking the opportunity seriously, and might hire ex-champ Bernard Hopkins as his trainer. He'll have his work cut out for him. /n
