Jodie & Her 'Beautiful Cydney' Step Out/nNine days after breaking her silence of the lambs by referring to her longtime gal pal Cydney Bernard as  "my beautiful Cydney, " Jodie Foster made a very public appearance with Bernard outside paparazzi magnet Il Sole on Thursday.  While you can hear someone say  "I'd kiss you, " it's unclear who says it. Silence, Clarice! Jodie then fakes out the paps by acting like she isn't going to ride in Cydney's SUV, but hops in at the last second and orders her to  "go,go,go! " The dynamic duo then rode off into the night together./n
