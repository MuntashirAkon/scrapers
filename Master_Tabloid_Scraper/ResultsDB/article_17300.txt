Get Some Footzyrolls!/n
Don’t footsie around (sorry). Every gal needs a pair of these rollable ballet flats in their purse, for when you’ve worn the wrong shoes (i.e. stilettos) or your poor feet just need a break.
Footzyrolls roll up to fit almost anywhere and come in a handy silk bag, which makes them a perfect gift for your besties.
Celebrities who have already gotten their hands (and feet) on Footzyrolls include Blake Lively, Adrienne Bailon, Kristen Bell, Tyra Banks, Kim Kardashian, Audrina Patridge, Christina Ricci, Claire Danes and model Jessica Hart. Footzyrolls are just as popular amongst insiders; celebrity stylist Rachel Zoe recently included them in her Jet Set Summer Guide as one of her “20 Style Savvy Suggestions” and Sex and the City 2 partnered with Footzyrolls for a special edition shoe made just for the premiere. $12.99 to $30.
You can buy Footzyrolls in major department stores such as Bloomingdales and Lord & Taylor, as well as over 1,000 other retail stores, or just check them out online at Footzyroll.
