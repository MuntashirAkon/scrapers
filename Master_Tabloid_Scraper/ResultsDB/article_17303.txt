Meet Flossie Dickey, an Unimpressed, Pie-and-Whiskey-Loving 110-Year-Old Who's Our New Hero/n

Flossie Dickey seems like she’s too good to be true, but she’s very real.   
The 110-year-old was the main point of one of those local news segments where the extremely chipper anchor goes to a local nursing home and interviews their oldest resident, in this case, Cheney, Washington’s Dickey.  
Flossie, who’s lived too long to mince words, wasn’t having it. A sample of her interview: “My grandkids, they say there’s 50 of them. I don’t know.”  
And the pie-and-whiskey-loving centenarian apparently kept falling asleep before her interview, according to KHQ’s Nichole Mischke. “How do you think you’d feel if you were 110?” Flossie told her.  
Bless up, Flossie Dickey. You’re a Real American Hero.
