WATCH: Boy with Autism Who Reunites with His Lost Cat Will Make You 'Aww'
/n

A video of a boy reuniting with his lost cat is the cry you’ve been needing this week. (Summer is over, after all).
It starts with a boy being filmed as he sits quietly on a couch and the title of the video says the youngster is autistic.
“This is the video of my brother seeing his cat Dave for the first time in three months,” says the caption for the YouTube clip, shared by Flossie Sweeto on Thursday. “So many tears shed!”
Suddenly, “mummy” is home with a surprise for the child, and the boy stands and then pauses, overcome with emotion over Dave returning home.
“Somebody handed him into the vet,” says the woman to the crying boy, “and I went and got him.”
The cat comes out of the carrier and into the arms of the boy, at which point you may drown in a puddle of tears. Don’t say we didn’t warn you.
