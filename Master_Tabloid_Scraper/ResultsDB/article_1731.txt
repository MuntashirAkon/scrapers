Combine the desert and some rock 'n' roll and you get one unforgettable road trip.Instead of staying home and enjoying a peaceful, quiet weekend, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas decided to switch things up a bit. How does a getaway to the Desert Trip Festival—also known as Oldchella—sound?With their children Carys and Dylan tagging along, the family of four traveled to Indio, Calif., where they immediately got to experience some world-famous bands."So excited. Tickets ready. A Friday night with Bob Dylan and The Rolling Stones!!!" the actress shared on Instagram. "Can't breathe with excitement!!! A #DesertTrip of a lifetime!"With a few VIP passes in hand and some festival-approved attire (we see your florals Catherine) the family was able to rock out under the stars.

"This says it all. Watching my son see his idols for the first time. Made this night for me," Catherine shared on Instagram. "#TheRollingStones #DesertTrip."Busy Phillips, Rob Lowe, Kyle Richards and Vanderpump Rules star Tom Sandoval were also spotted attending the three-day festival.On Saturday night, Paul McCartney and Neil Young are scheduled to perform while Roger Waters and The Who will shut things down Sunday evening.

The trip comes just a few short months after Michael and Catherine enjoyed a more romantic vacation to Aspen. While some may have thought it was just a snowy wonderland, fans later found out it was the exact spot where Michael got down on one knee."16 years ago, this was the spot where my husband proposed," Catherine captioned the picture. Awww.Will there be some romance in the air this weekend? Stay tuned.
