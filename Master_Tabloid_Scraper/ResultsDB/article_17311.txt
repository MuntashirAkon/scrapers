VIDEO: Drew Barrymore's New Dog Is the 'Best Little Cuddler' in the World/n
Drew Barrymore and her pooch Flossie had a lot of good times. The chow-yellow Lab mix, a rescue dog, even saved the actress and then-boyfriend Tom Green in 1998, when their home caught fire. But sadly, the pup died last month at age 16.
“She had a good life,” Barrymore told David Letterman on Tuesday’s Late Show. “What more can you ask for, 16 years with your soulmate sidekick?”
Though the Going the Distance star is still mourning her beloved pooch, she has opened her home to another furry friend: dog Douglas. “His proper name is Douglas Fairbanks Barrymore,” she joked. Brought to the pound when he was just 2 weeks old, the 6-month-old mixed-breed pooch is now spending his nights with the actress in her L.A. home. “He’s struck gold. He’s got the life,” she said. “And he’s the best little cuddler in the world!”
