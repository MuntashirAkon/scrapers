Beyoncé can make anything look cool, even flossing.The Grammy-winning songstress posted a selfie on Instagram with her adorable daughter Blue Ivy that showed the two cleaning their pearly whites with little floss swords.Both mother and daughter looked fierce in matching Sunday Somewhere sunglasses, and little BIC even donned her famous mama's chain necklace for the pic!We get it, remembering all the proper steps for oral hygiene is kind of a drag sometimes, but if Bey can find the time, so can you.

The "Drunk In Love" singer was out and about last night without her little one, first with a trip to the latest Chanel collection preview followed by a romantic date night with hubby Jay-Z.Yoncé sported a leather maroon skirt that highlighted her killer gams, a matching Chanel bag, white ankle boots and an oversized jacket to stay warm during their sushi stop, while Jay opted for an all-black outfit.And it's been nothing short of a whirlwind week for the Carter family.Just a few days ago, the rapper announced his new music streaming service, Tidal, with the support of several famous faces.Nicki Minaj, Kanye West, Rihanna, Chris Martin, Daft Punk, Madonna and many more were on hand for the New York City announcement that's promised to change the music industry forever.Sounds like a fun-filled few days!
