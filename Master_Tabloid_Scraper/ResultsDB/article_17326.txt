He said there were no hard feelings whatsoever about the change in start times, and expanded comment that O’Brien was not “Leno-ing” him.
Lopez defined “Leno-ing” as “someone who appears to be supportive, but is out for himself, and would use you as a stepping place for a destination.”

“I believe that she is doing fine,” he said. “I would not have had an opportunity to create in this business if not for Sandra. So, aside from anything that’s happened to her in personal life, I’ve always loved her and I’m a huge fan of hers. And she’s strong and she’ll be OK.”
