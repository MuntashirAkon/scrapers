It was a day at the fair for a slew of celebrities attending Disney’s A Time For Heroes in Los Angeles Sunday afternoon as they helped raise money for The Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation.  
Miley Cyrus performed, but before she hit the stage, she visited RadarOnline.com to discuss her own personal hero.  “I would say my mom, she’s the one who helps me get involved with everything.”
Hills star Lauren Conrad also gives respect to her parents saying, “They were great. They were such great role models, and they are people I look up to and aspire to.”  
Mark Wahlberg told us Jesus was his hero, while My Name Is Earl star Jaime Pressly took another route, and claimed Lucille Ball as her biggest role model.  When it comes to super powers, Miley wants invisibility, while Tony Hawk wants to be able to transport himself. /n
