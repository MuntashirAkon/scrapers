Miley Cyrus’s Reveals Her New Talent and Celebrity Crush/n
You can take the girl out of Nashville but you can’t take Nashville out of the girl. Miley Cyrus may be on the A-list, but she still can’t shake her down-home ways. The teen confessed to stealing a chicken from the set of her new movie, shared her new money-saving skill, and owned up to her need for spell check. 
“Chickens do not want to be actors, I just know that,” she said on the Rachael Ray show. “So I took the chicken and its name is Lucille and I have it in Nashville.” One new thing Cyrus has incorporated which is steal-worthy is her cost-cutting tip: “I just learned how to color my own hair…Dude if it’s going to be between $8 and $800 at the Right Aid which is right by my house that I can bike to it’s a good idea.”

On the episode airing April 10, Cyrus also dished on a fashionista faux pas. “My very first time going into a Chanel store they said ‘hey we have a bunch of people, and we never really ask for autographs, but they would love to have an autograph’…So I’m writing down Chanel, and I’m like oh my gosh this is so cool you know.  And the lady looks at me and goes ‘You obviously don’t come in here often.’ And I was like, what do you mean?  “You spelled it channel.” And I was like dang it!  So I totally spelled Chanel channel, instead.  But, whatever I’m from Tennessee I don’t know how to spell half the things. 
Her last juicy confession on the Emmy winning show? Her latest celebrity crush: “James Franco…I watched Spiderman 3 yesterday, and I saw him I was like dang he is just so good looking.  So he is really cute. He’s so funny, and can be really serious. I think he’s awesome.” /n
