New Walking Dead Set Photos Reveal THREE Survivors Of The Cliffhanger Finale! Find Out Who Negan Didn't Kill!/n

We're still recovering from the frustrating season finale of The Walking Dead, and we're more than ready to find out who Negan savagely beat to death with Lucille in the Season 6 cliffhanger.
Thankfully, the AMC horror hit is finally filming the seventh season, and new set photos have revealed at least a few characters who survived the wrath of Jeffrey Dean Morgan's killer debut.

[SPOILERS, DUH!!!]
The latest pics from the Senoia, Georgia set show  Andrew Lincoln, Danai Gurira, and Ross Marquand in costume and walking (in the good way) on set — meaning Rick, Michonne, and Aaron are (most likely) safe! Phew!
With those three off the chopping block, that narrows down the list to: Carl (Chandler Riggs), Glenn (Steven Yeun), Daryl (Norman Reedus), Rosita (Christian Serratos), Abraham (Michael Cudlitz), Maggie (Sonequa Martin-Green), or Eugene (Josh McDermitt).
Of course, the scene caught on camera by the paps could always be a flashback — director Greg Nicotero previously teased that the series could even be filming out of order to misdirect fans (as if we haven't been toyed around with enough already).
Who do YOU think is getting whacked?
Either way, prepare to say goodbye to yet another beloved character when The Walking Dead returns for Season 7 on October 23 at 9 PM ET on AMC.
