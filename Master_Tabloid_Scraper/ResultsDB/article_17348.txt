Say it ain’t so!

As speculation continues to swirl as to who exactly died in last season’s excruciating Walking Dead finale, a new interview has come to light that’s opened a whole new can of worms.
In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, the director Greg Nicotero discussed that fateful scene in which Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) makes his grand introduction by taking vengeance on one of Rick’s (Andrew Lincoln) people. And during the chat, Nicotero said something that needs some examination.
“I would have still supported doing it the way that we did it, because of the fact that the story doesn’t end there,” he said when discussing fans’ outrage concerning the Season 6 cliffhanger. “If we would have shown the deaths, then they wouldn’t have felt our characters in season 7 the way they need to. And the thing that I think a lot of people will get out of it is how that moment changes the entire makeup of our universe within a split second. And it’s that moment that launches our entire season 7 into that direction.”
You read that correctly. He said “deaths.”
Now, the subject of this EW article is the lengths that AMC is going to keep Negan’s victim (or victims) a secret, so it’s very possible this is some misdirection. But, regardless, that has to send a shiver up the fandom’s spine.
The Walking Dead returns Oct. 23, 2016 on AMC.
