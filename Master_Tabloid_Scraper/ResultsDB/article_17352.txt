The new mom took to Instagram to share in the couple’s joy, posting a photo of herself snuggling her new little lady — and sporting a gold necklace reading “Lucille.”
“Lucille Ruby Odom came into this world on Sunday, April 23rd, 2017. 💕 She is the love + light of our lives and she’s teaching us so much already… Our sweet Lucy 🌻 ,” Robinson captioned the serene moment.
“Mommy & Daddy couldn’t be happier,” she continued.

“Little one, you’re on our mind all the time. Keep eating and growing!” Odom wrote on Instagram in October by way of announcing he was going to be a dad for the first time. “We love you and we’re already so proud of you! Love, your mom and dad.”
Robinson posted a similar photo of the couple sitting underneath huge gold balloons spelling out “BABY,” adding the caption, “One of the greatest gifts we could ever ask for. Leslie and I are so excited to share the news that we have a sweet baby on the way. #pregnant.”

The couple spent their anniversary weekend on a romantic trip to Paris in December, taking photos in front of the Eiffel Tower and leaving sweet captions for each other and their little one on their respective snaps.
“Oh hi, little baby! I think my belly has officially popped. #babydoesEurope,” Robinson wrote next to a baby-belly shot of herself in front of a window, where festive holiday lights can be seen outside.

“It’s exciting,” Robinson told PEOPLE of her pregnancy in October. “It’s a whirlwind. We’re very grateful and we’re learning each step.”
Added Odom, “I take all the advice … The one that I keep hearing again and again is to clear everything out of the way, that kids really only care about you being there.”
“You really don’t have to think about anything else. They just want you there. So that simplifies it down for me. I appreciate that every time I hear it.”

Odom continued, “And I’ll say this: Even more than what I’m looking forward to handing down and teaching a child, I’m looking forward to what the child teaches me — maybe they’re gonna get me into stuff that I never thought I’d be into. I’m looking forward to that, too.”
New mom Robinson is known for her roles on The Affair, Hart of Dixie and Perfect Couples. Shortly before his departure from Hamilton, last June, Odom re-released his first, self-titled jazz album.
The actor and singer’s newest album, a holiday compilation called Simply Christmas, debuted in November.
