So Long, 'Scary Lucy'! Replacement Lucille Ball Statue to Be Unveiled on What Would Have Been the Star's 105th Birthday/n
Residents of Celoron, New York, can officially rest easy – that “Scary Lucy” statue is on its way out.
The now-notorious life-size bronze statue of Lucille Ball, erected in 2009, became a viral sensation last year after being mocked for its eerie stare, toothy grin and general lack of likeness to the actress – hence earning it the nickname “Scary Lucy” and “Ugly Lucy.”
Now, a less frightening statue of the star is set to replace the original in her hometown of Celoron, with an unveiling this Saturday on what would have been Ball’s 105th birthday.
Dave Poulin’s sculpture of Lucille BallThe Post-Journal/APAccording to Entertainment Weekly, the new statue, which stands 6 ft. tall, was created by artist Carolyn Palmer, who was unanimously selected from a national competition of more than 65 sculptors.
Palmer spent nine months studying Ball, watching I Love Lucy, working with models and crafting the sculpture.
“I not only wanted to portray the playful, animated and spontaneous Lucy, but also the glamorous Hollywood icon,” Palmer said in a statement obtained by EW. “I just hope that all the Lucy fans are pleased and that Lucille Ball herself would have enjoyed this image of her.”

“[I] have always believed it to be by far my most unsettling sculpture, not befitting of Lucy’s beauty or my ability as a sculptor,” Poulin said at the time. “Yes, in retrospect, it should have never been cast in bronze and made public, and I take complete ownership of that poor decision.”
