The two funny-gals became such good friends that Ball eventually threw her a baby shower!   
“It was a black-tie baby shower, with men attending!” Burnett said. “Her husband was comedian Gary Morton. He opened up the baby gifts and he did routines on everything.”   
“It was one of the funniest things ever,” the actress added.
