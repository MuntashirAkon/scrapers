Cate Blanchett to Play Lucille Ball in Aaron Sorkin-Penned Biopic/n
Cate Blanchett is set to play the lead role in an upcoming biopic about I Love Lucy star Lucille Ball, The Wrap reports. Newsroom creator Aaron Sorkin is writing the script for the film, which has been authorized by Ball’s family. Her children, Lucie Arnaz and Desi Arnaz Jr., will co-produce.  
In addition to I Love Lucy, Ball also starred in The Lucy Show, Life With Lucy and other TV series, as well as in a number of films. In 1962, two years after her divorce from Desi Arnaz, Ball bought out Arnaz’s ownership stake in Desilu Productions, making her the first woman to run a major Hollywood production company. The original Star Trek and Mission: Impossible TV series were both Desilu productions. Ball died in 1989 at 77.
