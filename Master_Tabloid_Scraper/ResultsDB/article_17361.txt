UPDATE: AMC has finally released the first official photo of Negan and, while we still can't see the guy's face, his trusty Lucille is front and center. She's got a very important date with someone we love this Sunday. We're already in a panic.________"Hi. I'm Negan." And then millions of The Walking Dead fans lost their collective chill after hearing that line in the European promo for The Walking Dead season six finale below.The promo, which AMC just posted to YouTube, features your favorite zombie apocalypse survivors equipped with guns (in their natural, sweaty and dirty state) facing off with some of Negan's saviors. Rick's (Andrew Lincoln) is ready to make a deal—somebody tell Wayne Brady! OK, that's a poor excuse of a TV joke. Moving on…We get flashes of zombies, duh, and guns, Carol's (Melissa McBride) rosary beads, the gang carrying somebody and then, Negan. Jeffrey Dean Morgan is Negan and he's here with Lucille (his bat covered in barbed wire). Be afraid.
