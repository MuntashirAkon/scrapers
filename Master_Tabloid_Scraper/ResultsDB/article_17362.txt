Happy 100th Birthday, Lucille Ball!/n
Let's run through the numbers real quick: Lucille was born 100 years ago today, August 6, 1911.New episodes of her hit series, I Love Lucy, haven't been made in over 50 years but the comedy still finds a spot on-air for each generation to giggle along with—as it should, there are nearly 200 episodes of the show—and that's not counting any spin-offs and other sitcoms that the Queen of TV starred in until her death on April 26, 1989.And then there's everything Lucille was that can't be captured in digits: mostly, the laughter.Whether she was trying to hawk inedible vitamins or having issues wrapping chocolate with her BFF Ethel, Lucille defined what it meant to be a funny lady and paved the way for nearly every comedic chick that came after her.And though she was often imitated, she could never be replaced.So take a few minutes and YouTube your favorite I Love Lucy moments and let us know what they were. Today, it's as simple as a stop by Google, since the swanky search engine flaunts a tribute to Lucille and her namesake series.That's one sweet century.
