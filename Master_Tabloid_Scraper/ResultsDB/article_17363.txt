UPDATE: In a letter to The Hollywood Reporter, artist Dave Poulin wrote that he takes full responsibility for the "Scary Lucy" statue. "From the day of its installation, I have shared my disappointment in the final outcome and have always believed it to be by far my most unsettling sculpture, not befitting of Lucy's beauty or my ability as a sculptor," he wrote. "Yes, in retrospect, it should have never been cast in bronze and made public, and I take complete ownership of that poor decision." _____________________"Lucy, I'm ahhhhhhh!"That's what Ricky would say if he came home to his beautiful, adoring wife only to see this statue staring him in the face.A statue of TV icon Lucille Ball was erected in her hometown of Celoron, New York in 2009. But residents are still pissed about it because—holy crap!—it is actually frightening to look at. And they want it gone.Instead of looking like the gorgeous, one-and-only Lucille Ball, this statue looks like a ghost that haunts the rafters of a mental institution that used to perform satanic rituals. Basically, it looks like Ryan Murphy will be casting it in the next season of American Horror Story.

"Lucille Ball was not only an amazing comedienne, but she was a stunning beauty," a self-proclaimed I Love Lucy super fan told Yahoo. "Her sense of humor only made her more beautiful. This statue looks nothing like the beautiful Lucy we all know. If for no other reason than that... the statue should go."He even started a Facebook page titled "We Love Lucy! Get Rid of this Statue" that currently has over just over 1,900 likes."I think it looks like a monster. That is just my opinion. When you see it at night, it is frightening," he said, adding that he doesn't mean to criticize the artist Dave Poulin.Scott Schrecengost, the mayor of Celoron, told the Jamestown Post-Journal that it would be very expensive, between $8,000 and $10,000, to have the original artist re-do the statue.Well, Celoron residents know what to do next. It's the age of the Internet so…Kickstarter time!(Originally published on Fri., Apr. 3, at 2:02 PM PDT)
