Adorable 103-Year-Old Woman ... Tosses Out First Pitch For Texas Rangers/nLucille Fleming doesn't have a cannon for an arm ... but she does have the guts to stand in front of thousands of people and throw out the first pitch for the Texas Rangers. After recovering from a serious hospital visit -- in which she died for 3 minutes -- the 103-year-old fan got the opportunity of a lifetime to toss the opening pitch for her favorite team on August 26.Â  Pretty good for someone who cracked the century mark ... and still better than 50 Cent's./n
