B.B. King Dies -- Blues Guitar Legend Dead at 89/nLegendary guitarist B.B. King died Thursday at home in Las Vegas ... according to his attorney. King brought Mississippi Delta blues to the mainstream with his hit 1970 version of  "The Thrill Is Gone. " He also recorded countless collaborations with other superstars ... such as Carlos Santana, Eric Clapton, U2, and Sheryl Crow. TMZ broke the story ... some of B.B.'s children had recently battled his longtime manager Laverne Toney about his medical care and finances. Earlier this month, Patty King accused Toney of elder abuse ... a claim that was eventually shot down in court. King, who was 89 ... had been at home in hospice care since May 1.  B.B. toured almost non-stop for more than 60 years with his black Gibson guitars  ... which he famously named Lucille. Due to his health issues -- in addition to his age, he was diabetic -- B.B. finally backed off his road schedule last year.   He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987, and won 15 Grammys ... as well as a Presidential Medal of Arts, and a Presidential Medal of Freedom.  It's remarkably sad -- within a month, the singers of  "When a Man Loves a Woman, "  "Stand by Me " ... and  "The Thrill Is Gone " have all passed away. #RIPLegends /n
