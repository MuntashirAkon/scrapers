David Cross on New 'Arrested Development' Eps -- 'Tears, Laughter, Diarrhea' /nT-minus 20 days until the long awaited return of  "Arrested Development " ... and this weekend, David Cross gave us a little teaser about what we can expect in the new eps -- tears, laughter and diarrhea. Clearly, Buster will shed the tears ... and the laughter belongs to Gob ... but who will have the diarrhea????WHO?!?!?!?!?Whatever, doesn't even matter ... just give us some chicken dance ... and frozen bananas ... and drunk Lucille ... and cut-off jean shorts ... and some analrapist ... and some Scott Baio. Please./n
