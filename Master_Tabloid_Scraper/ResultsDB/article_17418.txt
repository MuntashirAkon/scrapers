13. Drake has rapped about her before. He refers to her in his song the song “Odio” saying: “You look like you drawn by an artist / No, you, you look like Bernice and Yaris / But both put together, those are some girls that I know from back home.” (Scroll to the 2:46 mark).






Neither Drake nor Burgos have responded to the rumors.
The last dating rumors surrounding the rapper stemmed from his on-and-off relationship with Rihanna. The duo was last seen together in Aug. 2014.
