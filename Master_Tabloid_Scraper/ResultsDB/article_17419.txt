 The easiest way to shine during the holidays? Sport a shimmery style embellished with sequins, glitter or a coat of metallic sheen.
From gorgeous evening gowns to flirty frocks, stars like Kate Bosworth, Blake Lively and Halle Berry, have been sparkling on the red carpet this season.
And we’ve got the tricks to pulling off the high-wattage look.

Whether you choose a mini, gown or blouse, a shiny piece instantly lends a festive feel to any outfit.
Follow Alessandra Ambrosio’s lead, and go for head-to-toe sparkle with a sequined cocktail dress and silver or gold shoes for major star power, or opt for a more subtle way to shine with glittery or metallic accessories.
