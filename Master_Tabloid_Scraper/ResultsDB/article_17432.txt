Melissa McCarthy had a pretty scary encounter when she first moved to L.A. over a decade ago!On last night's Jimmy Kimmel Live, the 44-year-oldÂ Mike & Molly star recounted a story that happened long before she made it big in Hollywood."I worked at a dry cleaner's on like 3rd and Wilshire, where I was actually held up," the funnylady dished, adding, "At 3 o'clock in the afternoon, on Wilshire Avenue and 3rd, which is like sunny and bright and people are out walking. I walked in and there was a guy behind the register and I was like, 'Oh that's weird. Has he lost his ticket?' Then I see a gun and I was like, 'Oh my god!'"

But it wasn't the store's register she was worried about. "He had my backpack, which was like, my license, my keys, my makeup," she continued. "I didn't have a dime, I was like, 'I can't replace mascara! I don't have any money!' I just kept crying and going, 'You have my bag! It has my makeup in it! You have my bag!'" LOL!A few years later, McCarthy was living on the same block as Adam Levine. One Halloween, McCarthy attended the Maroon 5 singer's annual Halloween party with pal Jennifer Esposito."I'm sure we got a pity invite just so we didn't call the cops," she joked. As for her costume choice that year, McCarthy went as a goofy version of her "Aunt Bernice.""Every single woman was in a different kind of bikini...Literally people were like, 'What are you?!" McCarthy said of Levine's bash. "They were like, 'Why would you do that?' They were so horrified that I looked like that.'"
