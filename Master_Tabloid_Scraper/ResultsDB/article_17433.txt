Though R&B sensation Beyoncé’s latest album I Am…Sasha Fierce won’t be available in stores until next week, tracks from the singer’s two-disc release are attracting droves of fans to her Myspace page, where the singer explains the title. “Sasha Fierce is my alter ego…the fun, more sensual, more aggressive, more outspoken side and more glamorous side that comes out when I'm working and when I'm on the stage.”Perhaps, but a resident of Miami begs to differ. “I am Sasha Fierce, and that’s that,” states 78-year-old Fierce, who moved to Florida from New Jersey with her late husband Chaim Fierce some 15 years ago. “I’ve seen pictures of this Beyoncé; she looks like a nice girl.

She lives across the hall, and she’s always looking for attention.”
