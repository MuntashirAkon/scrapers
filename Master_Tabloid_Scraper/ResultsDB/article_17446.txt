Drake -- Loving Life Down Under ... A Hot Chick's Bikini/nDrake did a little importing for his Australian tour -- flying in a hot chick -- from NY to keep him company.   The  "If You're Reading This It's Too Late " rapper was chilling at his hotel pool in Perth, Australia, wearing a smoking babe in a bikini, named Bernice Burgos. We're told they met back in NYC, and they've been  "knowing " each other since 2012. Drizzy immortalized her in his verse for the song,  "Odio. " She's clearly hot enough to warrant a plane ticket half way around the world.  By the way, rare shots of Drake shirtless. He ain't hardcore, but he's looking ... fit./n
