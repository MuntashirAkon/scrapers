Porn Star Who Claims She Had Sex With Sheen Hires Criminal Defense Attorney/n
Charlie Sheen has said that he is done paying shakedown money to those who tried to blackmail him over his HIV positive status, but RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned that a porn star who claims she had sex with him and supplied him with women has hired a criminal defense attorney.
The Los Angeles based XXX film star went into a panic after The National ENQUIRER broke details of the cover-up scandal on Monday, November 16, 2015, a source told Radar.
After being contacted by Radar for details about her relationship with Sheen as well as details about the women she arranged to have sex with him, she contacted Todd Spodek, the New York attorney who represented Genevieve Sabourin, Alec Baldwin‘s stalker who served six months in Rikers Island Prison.

“She’s freaked out by this whole thing,” Spodek told Radar. He insisted that she does not want her name to be publicized in connection with Sheen.
Legal eagle Gloria Allred announced that she also has been contacted by women “with reference to Charlie Sheen and their rights.”
Radar spoke to a legal source with knowledge of the situation who said one top L.A. lawyer had secretly settled at least 12 — and possibly up to 24 — cases brought against Sheen by people he exposed to the virus.

Spodek would not comment on plans that his client has with regards to Sheen, but he told Radar that she is “not concerned about her culpability,” in the situation. /n
