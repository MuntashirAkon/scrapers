On Friday, the 42-year-old Canadian actress allegedly violated an order of protection that bars her from going near Baldwin. Sabourin was not arrested and Baldwin declined to comment.
As RadarOnline.com has reported, Sabourin said she is “still seeking closure” after romantically pursuing the 30 Rock star. The two met on the set of the 2002 film The Adventures of Pluto Nash.
