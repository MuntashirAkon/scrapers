“I think it’s a very offensive offer,” Sabourin told reporters outside court, according to the New York Post.
“I’ve spent my retirement plan,” on travel and legal expenses, she added. “My house is gone. I’m homeless right now.”
Sabourin said she wants a jury acquittal in order to “get my life back.”

In court papers, the 30 Rock actor admitted he had contact with Sabourin, 40, but insisted it was only a dinner as a favor to a mutual friend.
Instead, he alleged Sabourin turned up uninvited multiple times at the Greenwich Village apartment he shares with his yoga instructor wife Hilaria and their East Hampton mansion.

And in emails and texts, Sabourin allegedly told the star, 55, she wanted to have his baby and threatened to start a “massive destructive war” is he didn’t speak to her.
“I need to start my new life, with my new name, with my new carrier[sic] in my new country help my newly husband, you!” she emailed him, according to court papers.

According to Sabourin’s new lawyer, a third in the case, the incident was nothing more than a “bad breakup.”
“We believe the charges are baseless and we expect a full exoneration” at trial, said attorney Todd Spodek outside court on Monday.
