Jackson Kids Enjoy A Day At Disneyland/n
By Radar Staff
It’s no Neverland, but it’ll do.
Paris, Prince and Blanket Jackson enjoyed a fun time at the Happiest Place on Earth — Disneyland — in Anaheim, California with friends and family Sunday, and we’ve got the just-received shots for you right here on RadarOnline.com.

The outspoken 14-year-old Paris wore a furry blue novelty cap, white vest and a denim jacket-pants combo to the world famous amusement park, flanked by a few of her high school pals. Long-haired, solemn-faced Blanket, 10, wore a hoodie with a red shirt bearing his late father Michael‘s image. The kids went on rides such as the Matterhorn, Splash Mountain and Jungle Cruise.
Family matriarch Katherine and the kids’ cousins Genevieve, Jermajesty, Royal, Tarryl, and (co-guardian) T.J all came along for the trip, and it seems that the family tumult that dominated the headlines this summer has faded as the holidays approach.

As we previously reported, the family was feuding in July after Katherine abruptly disappeared (to a Tucson, Arizona resort) in the midst of a power struggle between her kids Janet, (Rebbie, Tito, Randy, and Jermaine) and the executors of Michael’s estate, John Branca and John McClain.
Cousin T.J. Jackson filed a police report claiming she was missing, and her guardianship of the three kids was eventually modified into a timeshare with him.

Fun fact: Michael Jackson starred in Disney’s 3-D mini feature Captain EO, which played at the park from 1986 until 1996, and was revived after the singer’s 2009 death.
