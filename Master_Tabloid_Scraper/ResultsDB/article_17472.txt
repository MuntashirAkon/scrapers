The Gilmore Girls alum dropped the baby bomb on Kelly Ripa and guest cohost Richard Curtis, saying:

"When I started [Supernatural], I was 22 years old, I was a single guy, kind of doing my thing. Now, I'm 12 years older, father of two, about to be father of three in March."
Way to casually sneak that in there, Jared! LOLz! But, luckily, Kelly's cameras were able to cut to the expecting momma waiting in the wings, showing off her slight baby bump!
How exciting!
The 34-year-old also opened up to the talk show host and the Pennsylvania high school teacher about how he and his longtime love first met.
Buuuuuut, the actor admitted he tends to fudge the truth a little bit, saying: 

"It was really special and unexpected. The story I tell amongst my friends is that she wouldn't leave me alone. So finally I was like, 'Fine, I'll go on a date with you.'"
However, here's what actually happened when their paths first crossed on set:

"I thought she was cute and smart and she would always read books. It turned into hanging out, talking about traveling, and [then] turned into dinner."
The famous father confessed that he would always interrupt her while she was reading, even though that's his biggest pet peeve! Ha!
See Jared make his big announcement and retell their love story in this cute clip (below)!
