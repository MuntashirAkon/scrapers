Adele Meets The Book Of Mormon In This Fantastic New Hello Parody!/n

This is like the smartest, best, most deserving parody we've ever seen!
Seeing as it's 2016 and Hello is no longer the only song played on the radio, you would think that Adele parodies would be played out by now â€” but you'd be wrong.
That's because a brand-new Mormon version of the song just made its way onto YouTube on Tuesday, and it's already going viral!

Brigham Young University students Marcus Joseph and Korey Smith teamed up for the religious cover, and while it's not quite HIGHlarious since they're being serious, the production quality is quite exceptional.
If you like The Book of Mormon, then you'll love this!
Ch-ch-check out Joseph & Smith's Mormonic version of Hello (below)!!!
