Jared Padalecki revealed that he and his wife Genevieve Cortese are expecting their third child.
The actor announced the happy news on Monday (Nov. 7, 2016) during an appearance on Live with Kelly!. “When I started the show [Supernatural], I was 22 years old, I was a single guy, kind of doing my thing,” he said. “Now, I’m 12 years older, father of two, about to be father of three in March.”

The couple, who got married in February 2010, are already parents to Thomas, 4, and Austin, 2. Also, the timing of the pregnancy could not be more perfect since Padalecki’s co-star Jensen Ackles announced back in August that he’s expecting twins with his wife, too.



My sons are too cool to take a picture with daddy…. *sigh….
