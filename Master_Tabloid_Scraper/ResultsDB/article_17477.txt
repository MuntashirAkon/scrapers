Everything You Need To Know About ‘Good Girls Revolt’/n
If the 1960’s were a time of peace, love and sticking it to the man, then 2016 is the time for celebrating the progress we’ve made and pushing the boundaries one step further for a more equal world.
In Amazon’s new series, Good Girls Revolt, they do just that.





Here’s the scoop:
Who’s in it?
Amazon places a crew of whip-smart women at the center of this inspired-by-a-true-story series based on Lynn Povich’s book, The Good Girls Revolt: How the Women of Newsweek Sued their Bosses and Changed the Workplace. The show stars Genevieve Angelson as the impulsive and determined Patti Robinson, Anna Camp as the charming and clever Jane Hollander, Erin Darke as the shy and sometimes awkward Cindy Reston, Joy Bryant as the empowered and brilliant Eleanor Holmes Norton, and Grace Gummer as the passionate and kick-ass Nora Ephron.
What’s it about?
This series takes place in a 1960’s New York City newsroom (dubbed News of the Week magazine on the show) where women do the research and men get the byline. All is smooth sailing, until a young Nora Ephron starts at the magazine and begins to question the very core of the company, much to the leadership’s dismay.
Why should I care?
In a year where female empowerment has led to the first female presidential nominee of a major party, it’s important to remember the boundary-pushing women who made it all possible. This series focuses on the start of a revolution, starting with one simple question: Why not?
Good Girls Revolt is now streaming on Amazon Prime Video.
