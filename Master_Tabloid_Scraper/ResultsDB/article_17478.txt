Katie Holmes donned a pin-straight Zac Posen gown to the 2016 Met Gala that was only rivaled in length by her wispy locks. Posen posted a photo of the actress on a rooftop, mentioning her Cartier jewels, while Holmes opted for an ominous photo of only her eyes that were accessorized by Ardell Lashes.
