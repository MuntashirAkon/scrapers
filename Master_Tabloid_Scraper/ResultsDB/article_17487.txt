 Showtime’s The Big C has partnered with the American Cancer Society on a new campaign to help create a world with less cancer and more birthdays!
Celebrities supporters including David Duchovny, Colbie Caillat, Dave and Odette Annable,  Julie Benz, Chef Gordon Ramsay, Parker Posey, Hunter Parrish, Tyler Labine, Francois Arnaud, Kevin Nealon, Simone I. Smith,  and Genevieve Farrell among others have already joined the campaign to encourage fans to “C Yourself” to help the cause.
So, how can you lend a hand? 

Head on over to The Big C’s Facebook application page to upload a photo of yourself making the “C”. 
Simple, right? For each “C” uploaded, Showtime will donate $5 to the American Cancer Society! It’s a great cause that will only take you a couple of minutes to help out! You can follow the American Cancer Society’s Twitter page to get the latest updates on the ‘C Yourself’ campaign.
