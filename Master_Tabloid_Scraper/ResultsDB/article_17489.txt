Congratulations are in order!Jared Padalecki and his wife Genevieve Cortese are expecting their third child. The Gilmore Girls actor announced the news on Live! With Kelly Monday morning. "I'm a father of two now about to be a father of three in March," he spilled.His wife, who also doubles as his Supernatural co-star, was waiting backstage with an ear-to-ear grin on her face.The couple's newborn will join big brothers Tom, 4, and Shepherd, 2. But there must be something in the Supernatural air because Jared's co-star Jensen Ackles also announced that he and his wife are expecting twins. They're already parents to a three-year-old daughter named Justice.Â 

Congratulations to the happy couple and growing family!
