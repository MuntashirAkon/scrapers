(Melrose Place star Katie Cassidy played Ruby's first iteration.)So how did this happen, and when's the big day?

The couple, whose characters shared some superhot sex scenes and a dysfunctional but intense relationship during their time together on the show, have been dating very, very stealthily.Padalecki's reps declined to confirm Internet reports of a late-winter wedding date.Jensen Ackles, who plays Padalecki's onscreen older brother Dean Winchester, got engaged in fall 2009 to Danneel Harris.
