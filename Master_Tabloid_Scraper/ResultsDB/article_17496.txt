Summer is basically here and that means one thing: new seasonally-appropriate shoes.Correct us if we're wrong, but warmer weather certainly calls for different footwear. For instance a snazzy new pair of embroidered sneakers is the ideal way to dress up you denim cutoffs. Or if you're going for something a little more sophisticated for weekend brunch, a chic pair of espadrilles are just upscale enough. But just because you know you need a few pairs of goes-with-everything summer shoes, it doesn't mean you have tons of money to blow. Or maybe you actually want to splurge for once. Whatever your budget (and shoe style preference), there's a summer shoe for everyone.
