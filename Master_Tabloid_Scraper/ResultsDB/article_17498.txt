Our hearts are melting!Jared Padalecki took to Instagram to celebrate Throwback Thursday in the most adorable way, sharing a photo of him and wife Genevieve Cortes in a sweet embrace on their wedding day. The couple met on the set of Supernatural and married in 2010 in Cortes' snowy hometown of Sun Valley, Idaho. The winter wonderland of a wedding looked absolutely perfect, with Genevieve stunning in a Monique Lhuillier lace gown with her man by her side. Fast-forward five years and the onetime co-stars are parents to two sons, Shepherd, 1 1/2, and Thomas, 3.

Padalecki, 33, has never been shy about his personal life.Earlier this year, the hunky actor discussed his struggle with anxiety and depression with E! News, saying that as a young Hollywood newbie he dealt with stress by "working and [keeping] my head down. Just work, work, work. Read, study, go to class. Go to auditions, meet with agents. And finally it all caught up."Since then, Jared says he's "really trying to focus lately on enjoying the here and now," and he recently launched a charity T-shirt campaign to benefit mental health organization To Write Love On Her Arms. Supernatural die-hards are currently looking forward to seeing Padalecki's return to the small screen when season 11 of the popular series premieres Oct. 7 on the CW.
