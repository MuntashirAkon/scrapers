Christian McCaffrey: Advice From SI Swimsuit Hottie ... Football > Modeling/nListen up,Â Christian McCaffrey ... a (smoking hot) modeling vet has some advice for you ... STICK TO FOOTBALL ... saying there's waaaaay more money in catching passes than catwalks. We got former SI Swimsuit model Genevieve Morton out in L.A. and asked her professional opinion of Christian's shirtless look ... the one that's been driving the ladies (and some fellas) crazy all week. The thirst fest has been so rampant that it's made some people wonder if Christian has a future off the gridiron as the next big thing in the modeling world. Check out the clip -- Genevieve thinks that's a BAD IDEA ... telling our guy that Christian could definitely model if he wanted to ... but he needs to keep his (hot) ass on the field if he wants to make big cash. BTW ... Christian, if you're reading this she seems totally down ... might be worth a DM ... just sayin'./n
