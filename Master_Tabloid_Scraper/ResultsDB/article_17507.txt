Michael Jackson's Nephews Face Eviction ... God Save Jermajesty!/nMichael Jackson's niece and 4 nephews may be out on the streets, because they're about to be evicted from their home. You may remember Jaafar ... he's the son of Jermaine andÂ Alejandra Jackson, who got in trouble in 2010 when he bought a stun gun and terrorized Michael's son Blanket. Now Jafaar, along with his brothers Jermajesty, Dante, Randy and sister Genevieve may be without a roof over their heads because their mom's landlord says she's $124,000 behind in rent and has filed legal docs to evict her. Here's the weird part of the story ... Alejandra was a squatter in the MJ family home on Hayvenhurst in Encino, refusing to leave when Katherine wanted to renovate the estate. Last we heard, Katherine offered to get a modest condo for Alejandra and her kids. So how, pray tell, did Alejandra and her children end up in a $15,000 a month, 7,000 square foot Mediterranean mansion on 24 acres in Malibu with an 180 degree ocean view? Apparently the landlord has the same question, because he says Alejandra hasn't paid rent for 8 months. We could not reach Alejandra for comment./n
