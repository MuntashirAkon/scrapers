Zoe Kravitz: Cops Tried to Shut Down My Sunset Strip Gig/nZoe Kravitz packed 'em in for her performance at a YSL launch party on the Sunset Strip -- and while the famous guests loved the action ... the neighbors did not. Kelly Osbourne, Hailee Steinfeld, EJ Johnson and model Genevieve MortonÂ (yeah, the hot one in white) were just a few of the celebs there when about 4 cop cars pulled up to the old Tower Records building at 10:30 PM. We're told at least one normie living in the area wasn't happy about the noise from the event. Too bad for that person -- YSL had a permit to party until 11 PM ... and they did. Earplugs, bro. Earplugs./n
