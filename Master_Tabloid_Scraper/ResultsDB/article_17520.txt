Carl's Jr. -- They Do 3-Ways Right!!! (PHOTOS + VIDEO)/nCarl's Jr. knows how to sell it, and they've done it again with 3 super hot models diving into the same burger at the same time. We got pics from the latest C.J. offering ... a Bacon 3-Way Burger ... loaded with thick cut, Applewood-smoked bacon strips, crumbled bacon and bacon jam. The bacon booty sits atop a patty weighing in at 1 /3 of a lb.    Genevieve Morton -- the one in the photo with the burger -- was out and about in L.A. Thursday when our photog asked what we all wanted to know ... how much burger-munching on the set? She even shows us how it's done! From babe ... to babes./n
