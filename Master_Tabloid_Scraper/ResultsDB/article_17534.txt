Kim Kardashian has admitted to Botox and butt injections, but many fans and surgeons alike believe that she’s had a whole lot more done to her face and frame – and this shocking video could be the proof!
Never-before-seen home videos of Kardashian frolicking with then-boyfriend Ray J in Cabo San Lucas for her 23rd birthday seem to show an entirely different girl.
With close-ups and wide-shots showing her shape before the surgery rumors began, did Ray J reveal her secret?

In recent years, the transformation has been striking. “One thing that is very striking is the accentuation of her cheekbones,” Dr. Michael Obeng, who has not treated Kardashian, previously told Radar.
“This could have been achieved with either implants or filler.”
Today, “Her chin is also very defined,” Anthony Youn, M.D., F.A.C.S., told Radar.

Dr. Youn, who has not treated Kardashian, said it “could have been subtly enhanced with a filler like Restylane.”
As for her body, Kardashian’s bottom line has clearly grown over the past ten years.
She’s admitted to injections, but insists her curves are all natural and she only went under the needle to treat her psoriasis.
