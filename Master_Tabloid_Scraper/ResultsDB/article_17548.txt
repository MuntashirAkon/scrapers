La La Anthony has put her divorce plans on hold.

Just two months after splitting with Carmelo Anthony, the Power star revealed she is not divorcing her husband of seven years. While appearing on The Wendy Williams Show this week, La La opened up about her relationship with the NBA star.
When asked if she was divorcing Carmelo, the actress simply replied, “Not right now.”
“You know marriages are tough, and you know that. We all know that. It’s filled with ups and downs. We are just going through a time right now,” she explained. “Him and I are the best of friends and our No. 1 commitment is to our son Kiyan, and we have to set an example for Kiyan and that’s what’s most important to me.”
She added, “That’s my son’s father and he is an amazing dad.”

Though La La may not be divorcing Carmelo any time soon, she’s still uncertain if they will get back together. “I don’t know what the future holds. I just know that we are doing an incredible job again being parents to our son,” she said. “We are the best of friends. I’ve been with Melo since he was 19 years old. You’re not with somebody that long, and it just goes out the window. I love him with all my heart, and we are the best of friends.”
La La was just 24 when she started dating Carmelo, who was 19 at the time. They were together for 12 years.
“I’m trying to get myself in order,” she shared. “I’m in the gym every day. I’m eating right. I’m taking out all the bad stuff in my life and just really dating and focusing on myself, which is something women need to do more often, put ourselves first.”
