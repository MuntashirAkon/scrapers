Huma Abedin is officially ending her marriage with Anthony Weiner.

Abedin filed her divorce documents in New York City. This news arrives hours after Weiner pled guilty to sexting with a 15-year-old girl and struck a plea deal.
TMZ reports:
Hillary Clinton’s trusted aide first left Weiner back in August 2016. They separated after he was caught in his second sexting scandal. As she put it then, “After long and painful consideration and work on my marriage, I have made the decision to separate from my husband.”
