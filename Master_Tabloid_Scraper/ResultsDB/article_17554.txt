Alex Rodriguez and Jennifer Lopez partied it up in the Dominican Republic over the weekend, and there’s footage to prove it.

Rodriguez and Lopez hit the dance floor on Saturday night (Apr. 15, 2017) after Lopez performed with her ex-husband Marc Anthony at their sold-out show at the Altos de Chavón Amphitheater at Casa de Campo Resort and Villas. The after-party took place in the $10,000 luxury villa that Lopez and Rodriguez shared over the weekend, which has six bedrooms, a state-of-the-art kitchen, private pool and gazebo, and views of the ocean. It’s also where they hosted an Easter brunch on Sunday.
