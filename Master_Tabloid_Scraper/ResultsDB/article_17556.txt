Jennifer Lopez fielded an awkward question about her past relationship with Drake during an appearance on Wednesday’s Watch What Happens Live.

Joined by Shades of Blue co-star Ray Liotta, Lopez played “Plead the Fifth” with Andy Cohen.
“Jennifer, you said in an interview that you were proposed to five times in your life,” Cohen teased. “Name someone who you turned down.”
Liotta suggested, “Drake, right?”
“Shh, no! Oh my God. Um…someone…ugh, I can’t. I can’t do it,” Lopez responded. “Plead the Fifth.”

Lopez was previously married to Ojani Noa, Cris Judd, and Marc Anthony. She was also engaged to Ben Affleck, but the fifth suitor is still unknown.
Just before romance rumors about Lopez and Alex Rodriguez started circulating on Wednesday, Lopez liked the baseball player’s post on Instagram about his new full-time job as a game analyst for select FOX MLB telecasts.



I’m excited to continue working with the @FOXSports family. It’ll be great to get back on the set with the guys for the regular season and postseason, especially the All-Star Game in my hometown of Miami. (📸: @nytimes)
