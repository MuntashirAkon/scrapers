Ben Affleck Isn’t Jennifer Lopez’s Favorite Onscreen Kiss/n
Though things may be good between Jennifer Lopez and ex-boyfriend Ben Affleck, their onscreen chemistry is a different story.

Apparently, Affleck’s kissing skills didn’t leave that good of an impression on Lopez. When asked about her favorite onscreen smooch during her latest appearance on Today, the “Ain’t Your Mama” singer revealed that her former real-life beau wasn’t her top choice.
For Lopez, the top honor goes to Josh Lucas.

“It was Josh Lucas,” Lopez confessed, after politely rejecting the suggestion that the best lip-lock was from The Wedding Planner co-star Matthew McConaughey. “It was called An Unfinished Life, with Robert Redford and Morgan Freeman.”
It seems the feeling is mutual. In 2015, Lucas raved about his scenes with Lopez in the 2005 drama.
“She was phenomenal in many ways in that way,” he said during an episode of Watch What Happens Live. “We have a phenomenal sex scene in a car that was so good [that] I guess it was cut out. They needed to get it a rating that was a little more PG. It was fantastic.”
Sorry, Gigli. You’re still kind of the worst.
