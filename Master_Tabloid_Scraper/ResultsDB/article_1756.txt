A Quarter Century Never Looked So Good/nOn September 25, 1969 in Swansea, Wales Catherine Zeta-Jones was being delivered from her mother's womb into the world. On that same day, her husband Michael Douglas was celebrating his 25th birthday.On Sunday, Michael and Catherine commemorated the eve of their shared birthdays by having dinner at London's Wolseley Restaurant.Monday also marked an extra special day for Michael because besides turning 62, he is now eligible to start receiving his federal retirement benefits. Obviously, Catherine still has a ways to go as she's only 37.While there's no word on how the duo will spend their day, one thing's for sure, with 99 candles between them, they're going to need one mighty large cake.Despite their quarter century age difference, the Oscar-winning actors have been happily married for nearly six years and have two children together./n
