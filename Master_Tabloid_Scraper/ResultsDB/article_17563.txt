The Mooch will match wits with Stephen Colbert on Monday.
The host of CBS’ The Late Show announced the news of booking Anthony Scaramucci — the man who held the White House communications director job for 10 days before being ousted — on Wednesday afternoon. The interview will mark Scaramucci’s first big TV appearance since his exit.
“On Monday 8/14 Anthony Scaramucci will be my guest on @colbertlateshow,” Colbert tweeted. “This is just a heads up for our censors to get ready! #themooch.”

Scaramucci departed his White House position shortly after the publication of an explosive, expletive-filled interview with a New Yorker reporter — one in which he blasted other members of Donald Trump’s administration, including then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus. Trump announced Priebus’ resignation the next day on Twitter, as well as the appointment of John Kelly as the new chief of staff. Three days later, Scaramucci’s exit was announced. “Mr. Scaramucci felt it was best to give Chief of Staff John Kelly a clean slate and the ability to build his own team,” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement at the time.

Many late-night comedians had a field day with the mess, and faux-lamented the departure of a man sure to deliver much material to them. When the news broke of Scaramucci’s departure, Colbert called him a “broken man,” and said, “The front stabber has been back stabbed. He said he was going to fire everybody, and I gotta admit, he delivered.”
The Late Show airs weeknights on CBS at 11:35 p.m. ET/PT.
