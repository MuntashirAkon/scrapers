Marc Anthony's Love Life Is Becoming One Giant Mystery/n
Marc Anthony, who recently became a single man, is living it up as a bachelor. The question is, with who? Just this past weekend, the 48-year-old performer, posted a photo of himself with Italian model Raffaella Modugno. "Making memories. Happy Memorial Day weekend. Wishing you the best!" he captioned the pic. But wait, what about Mariana Downing?In March, Marc and the 21-year-old model made their red carpet debut. 

At the time, E! News learned that the two had been dating for a few months. They had already done a bit of traveling together, and they were in love. But given her busy modeling schedule, they didn't see each other all of the time. When Downing's schedule permitted, she traveled to be with the artist.

Then this past weekend, there was a plot twist. After Marc had shared the post with Modugno, photos surfaced of him and Shannon de Lima. Yes, his ex-wife. In the pics, the two seem flirty as they enjoy a Miami day aboard a gorgeous yacht. Oddly enough, the pics weren't taken over the Memorial Day weekend. Instead, Telemundo reports that they're from about a month ago. 

E! News reported in November 2016 that Anthony and De Lima decided to split, and one month later they made an official announcement."After much consideration, we have mutually and amicably decided to end our two-year marriage," the two said in a statement to E! News. "We ask for privacy during this difficult process, and no further comments will be made from either one of us about this personal matter."They have no children together and officially divorced in 2017.
