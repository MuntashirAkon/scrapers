Gronk Scores Cameo In Katy Perry Video, Ditto for Karl-Anthony Towns/nKaty Perry just hired a bunch of HUGE athletes for her new music video -- everyone from Rob Gronkowski to Karl-Anthony Towns ... even Joey Chestnut!!! It's all for Katy's new  "Swish Swish " video -- which all takes place at a basketball game, with Bill Walton and Rich Eisen announcing.   Some of the highlights ... Katy  "Kobe " Perry takes on the guy who plays The Mountain on  "Game of Thrones " while Chestnut slams down hot dogs in the crowd.   Gronk holds a sign. Karl-Anthony busts out the  "Backpack Kid " dance.  Good times. /n
