Anthony Scaramucci Spoofed by Bill Hader on SNL's 'Weekend Update: Summer Edition'/nAnthony Scaramucci belatedly got the 'SNL' treatment courtesy of 'SNL' alum, Bill Hader ... and it was, well, a day too late. It kinda felt like calling Scaramucci  "The Mooch " was a new thing, even though it was kinda played out a couple weeks ago. And the Steve Bannon autofellatio gag was last month's news cycle. Nevertheless, Hader did a good impression. And, the last joke is pretty funny. One thing's clear ... the 'SNL' folks must have been apoplectic when the Mooch resigned 11 days in./n
