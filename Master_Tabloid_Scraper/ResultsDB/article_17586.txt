Anthony Scaramucci's New Project, 'Attack of the Swamp Monsters!'/nAnthony Scaramucci is making the most of his 10 days as White House Communications Director, because we've learned he wants to turn his moment in the sun into a TV series or feature film. We've learned a major Hollywood producer has been in touch with Scaramucci to produce a White House version of  "Spin City. " There are 2 working titles --  "10 Days in July " and  "Attack of the Swamp Monsters. " Our vote is #2. We're told the initial feeling is the concept could work as a sitcom series or a feature. The concept is an outsider assuming power in D.C. to the great dismay of longtime political hacks who go straight for the jugular./n
