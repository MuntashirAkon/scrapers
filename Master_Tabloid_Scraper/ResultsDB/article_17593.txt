Anthony Scaramucci Wife Reportedly Files for Divorce/nAnthony Scaramucci might wanna learn something from Steve Bannon, after all -- Mrs. 'Mooch' is reportedly filing for divorce. The new White House Communications Director had been married for about 3 years to Deidre Ball, but according to the NY Post ... she got fed up with his Washington, D.C. ambitions and decided to leave him. Ball had been a VP at SkyBridge Capital, the investment firm Scaramucci founded. The Post reports there's been tension in the marriage because Deidre isn't a Trump fan, and did not support Anthony's desire to land a White House post. We've reached out to Scaramucci's office, but no word back. He seemed to reference the split on Twitter.  Leave civilians out of this. I can take the hits, but I would ask that you would put my family in your thoughts and prayers & nothing more. â€” Anthony Scaramucci (@Scaramucci) July 28, 2017/n
