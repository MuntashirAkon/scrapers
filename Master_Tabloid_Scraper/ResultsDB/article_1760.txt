“After much thought and reflection, and after being married for over a year, we have decided to file for a divorce,” they told People. “This was not an easy decision for either of us because we do love each other very much but sometimes God has other plans. This is the route we have decided to take, and all we request is that you respect our privacy in this delicate matter. Divorce is never easy for anyone, especially not such a public one.”
Their split came after Nick Pendergrast and Sonia Granados’ divorce was finalized in April.
Pendergrast moved on fast, as he’s currently expecting twins with girlfriend Heather Yerrid. He reached out to the AfterBuzz TV host, who is also a love and relationship coach, three months before he met her in May to seek help.
