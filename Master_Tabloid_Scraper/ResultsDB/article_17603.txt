Steven Adams: Melo to OKC Would Be 'Awesome,' But ... /nOKC center Steven Adams says he's ALL ABOUT playing with Carmelo Anthony -- but warns that talk of Melo being signed by the Thunder is still just a fantasy.  The 7-footer was flying out of LAX when we asked about the possible move.   "That's just like saying if Michael Jordan could play for us. That would be awesome too. " He added that the rumblings don't really matter right now --  "It's all just like fantasizing. "  Speaking of which, Adams says he's a hardcore video gamer -- particularly when it comes to  "Dota 2. " And, with so many athletes investing in eSports, we had to ask if he'd ever try to go pro in the digital world./n
