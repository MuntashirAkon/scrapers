 Another ‘MAFS’ Divorce? Danielle Admits There Is No ‘Chemistry’ With Husband Cody.../n
The honeymoon is officially over for Danielle DeGroot and Cody Knapek. In an exclusive Married at First Sight sneak peek, Danielle reveals that she hasn’t been intimate with her husband since their honeymoon.
“When we first met it was like, ‘Oh here’s my husband, he’s cute!’” she told expert Rachel DeAlto. “And so we were making out and we were having a good time. There hasn’t been much of anything since the honeymoon. I haven’t felt that spark.”

Danielle continued that their biggest hurdle is that they’re not romantic with one another.
“That holds us back from feeling like husband and wife,” she said. “I want to get there. I want that organic feeling.”
Although she explained that she cares about Cody, she wishes she cared about him in a more romantic way.

“I am really worried we can’t get to a place where there is a physical attraction or chemistry,” she said.
Danielle and Cody’s marital issues come after Tom Wilson and Lillian Vilchez announced their divorce after 14 months of marriage.
“After much thought and reflection, and after being married for over a year, we have decided to file for a divorce,” they said in a joint statement. “This was not an easy decision for either of us because we do love each other very much but sometimes God has other plans. This is the route we have decided to take, and all we request is that you respect our privacy in this delicate matter.”
Married at First Sight airs Thursdays at 9/8c on Lifetime.
