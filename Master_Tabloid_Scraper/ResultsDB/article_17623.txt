The things people will do to get famousâ€¦
On Monday night, 19-year-old Monalisa Perez from Halstad, Minnesota shot and killed her boyfriend Pedro Ruiz when the two tried to film a YouTube video for notoriety.
According to the criminal complaint, Ruiz persuaded his pregnant girlfriend to shoot a book held to his chest, believing the book would catch the bullet. Sadly, when Perez fired the 50 caliber handgun, it ended up striking the 22-year-old while the couple's 3-year-old daughter watched on.

Pedro was pronounced dead at the scene.
The soon-to-be-mother of a boy was charged with manslaughter, and is expected to make an appearance at the Norman County District Court on Wednesday afternoon.
Ruiz's aunt Claudia Ruiz told Valley News Live the couple were trying to become viral stars, and progressively upped the ante with their stunts.
"He had told me about an idea. I said, 'Don't do it, don't do it. Why are you going to use a gun? Why?' Because, we want more viewers."'
Absolutely devastating. Be safe out there, YouTubers!
