Hell Hath Frozen Over — Donald Trump Agrees With Rosie O'Donnell!/n

This isn't the Twitter Twilight Zone…
Donald Trump really did retweet and agree with sworn enemy Rosie O'Donnell.
President baby hands unearthed the James Comey tweet (from 2016, supposedly after supporters posted it on the The_Donald subreddit following his firing) to deflect eyes from the shit storm that is his time in office, the Russia investigation, among other fuckery.

Wonder if our Prez will reply to this?
Probably, to make a new headline about how he always wanted to fire Comey! Double down, Donny!
