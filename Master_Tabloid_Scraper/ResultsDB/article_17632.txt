Gwyneth Paltrow may like a good vagina-steaming, but Khloé Kardashian has other things in mind for your ladyparts.

According to the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star, Vitamin E does wonders for the vajayjay. In a new post on her app, she swears by the health benefits of Vitamin E oil and reveals that she uses it almost everyday.
“Vitamin E has been a part of my daily routine forever. If you’re not using it already, you need to start!!!” Kardashian writes, adding that she incorporates it into her beauty routine and diet. She recommends using soft gel tablets — like the ones from Nature Made.
“Slather Vitamin E oil on your face at night. It fights wrinkles, inflammation and redness—and it’s great for acne scars! I put Vitamin E oil on my lashes every night, too, to keep them super-soft,” she advises. “Add Vitamin E capsules to your daily vitamin list to balance cholesterol levels, ease PMS symptoms, and improve muscle strength.”
As for using Vitamin E in your neither regions, Kardashian is all for it.
“No joke: Vitamin E may strengthen vaginal lining!!!” she notes, citing antioxidant properties. “Moisturize your labia and vagina with Vitamin E oil to combat dryness and soothe irritation.”
Yep. All this coming from the girl who gave her camel toe a name.
