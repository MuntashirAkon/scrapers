Dax Shepard is opening up about a dark time in his past.

Wile speaking with Sirius XM’s The Jason Ellis Show, the 41-year-old revealed that he was sexually abused when he was a child. According to the actor, the incident occurred when he was 7 and that the molester was his 18-year-old neighbor.
“It took me 12 years to tell anyone,” he said, noting that the abuse was “minimal” but stayed with him for years.
Shepard, who is now happily married to actress Kristen Bell, explained that he kept thinking it was his fault and that he was gay because ‘I must have manifested this because I’m secretly gay.’ He added, “I had all these insane thoughts for 11 years or 12 years.”
“If you’ve been molested, you only have a 20 percent chance of not being an addict,” Shepard, who struggled with addiction issues in the past, continued.
“And I was like, ‘Hm, interesting,’ because in my mind I just like to have a fucking great time,” he said. “But when you hear a statistic like that, I’m like, ‘Oh no, I was going to be an addict. Period.'”
