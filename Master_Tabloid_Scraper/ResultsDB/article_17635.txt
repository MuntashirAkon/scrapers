Tyga’s personal bodyguard has been killed after being struck by a car.

Arlester “Punch” Henderson was driving on 10 freeway just before 6 a.m. Wednesday (Mar. 31, 2016) when he collided with another vehicle. Though Henderson, 29, survived the initial crash, he was hit by an oncoming Mercedes C230 when he got out of his car to check on the other driver. He was pronounced dead at the scene.
A rep for Tyga tells TMZ the rapper is “devastated, shocked and heartbroken” by the loss.
That same day, Tyga took to Instagram to pay tribute to his fallen friend, writing, “I know you looking down from a better place.”



Rip Punch🙏🏾🙏🏾 I know you looking down from a better place.
