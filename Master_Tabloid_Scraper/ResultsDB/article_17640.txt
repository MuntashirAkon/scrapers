“That’s his schtick.”

Stand-up comedienne Chelsea Handler opened up about her worst celebrity interview of all time at Variety’s Sundance Film Festival Studio over the weekend, highlighting Sir Justin Bieber. “He was trying to flirt with me and it was so uncomfortable,” she said, while promoting her new Netflix series. “Like that’s his schtick. Like he would come on and flirt with you and just felt like a child molester right away, and I was like, ‘I don’t wanna feel that way.'”
Handler’s career is taking a turn away from chatting with pop stars, instead interviewing non-celebrities in her four-part documentary series, Chelsea Does. The Netflix series explores topics of marriage, drugs, race and Silicon Valley. “I want to get good at something else,” she says of abandoning Hollywood as a focus. “When you interview celebrities, they’re so guarded so many times and they can’t reveal anything …. and so when you talk to real people who are opinionated, I always think that’s interesting whether I agree with their opinion or not.”

Handler experiments with mixing prescription pills and alcohol in the “drugs” episode of Chelsea Does in lieu of doing heroin under the supervision of a medical doctor. “No one’s gonna supervise that,” her producers regretfully informed her. “It’s illegal!”
