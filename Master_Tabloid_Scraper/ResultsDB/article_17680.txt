Katie Couric -- Brings the Girls Out In Barbados/nThis just in from Katie Couric ... America's sweetheart has cleavage and she ain't afraid to show it off ... even at 58. The former TV host /anchor was looking good in a low-cut one piece down in Barbados. She hit the beach with new hubby John Molner -- and even got a little frisky in the water.  There's some buzz Katie might be up for Brian Wiliams' job at NBC -- but it looks like she has better things to do for now./n
