Lester Holt -- So What Happens if Brian Williams Returns? [Video]/nLester Holt gets the game ... he answered our photog's goofy question about the whole Brian Williams thing perfectly ... with a laugh. Lester was leaving 30 Rock after anchoring  "NBC Nightly News " when our photog tried projecting 6 months into the future, wondering if he would duke it out with Williams for the job. There's something about the way he handled it ... he didn't answer but he didn't scoff either ... perfect. Conventional wisdom is ... it's a long shot that Williams will return. Our NBC sources say Lester's contract allows him to walk if he's passed over for permanent anchor if Williams leaves. Advantage Holt.Â /n
