Brian Williams -- You Can Trust Me, America ... I Have a Puppy! (PHOTO)/nSuspended NBC newsman Brian Williams did some serious damage control in New York City by strolling with his wife, his daughter Allison, and most importantly ... Allison's adorable new dog! Williams has been laying very low since NBC took him off the air back in February for lying about being shot at in a helicopter.   Brian had to know a few paparazzi shots of him snuggling Moxie -- a golden retriever puppy -- would look really good. Especially since ABC's World News Tonight just beat NBC Nightly News for the first time in a long time. Williams' return is by no means a sure thing, but co-anchoring with Moxie could go a long way./n
