Hulk Hogan -- THREATENED BY OLD RIVAL ... I Want a Rematch!!!/nHulk Hogan ... you might get KNOCKED THE F OUT ... because the guy who played Deebo in  "Friday " wants a piece of you in the ring ... AGAIN.Of course, wrestle-a-holics know ... before he terrorized Ice Cube, Tiny Lister played Zeus in the 1989 wrestling flick  "No Holds Barred " ... where he battled the Hulkster for the first time. After the movie, the two wrestled in the WWF a couple of times ... with  "Zeus " losing every match. Now, with Hulk gearing up for his  "comeback " ... Lister says he wants the first shot -- saying,  "We got some unfinished business!!! "Lister is 55. Hulk 60 -- hopefully, no one breaks a hip./n
