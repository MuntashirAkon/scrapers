 Pay Up! Pharrell Williams & Robin Thicke ‘Extremely Disappointed’ After Losing.../n
A Los Angeles jury has decided that Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams ripped off a substantial portion of Marvin Gaye’s popular 1977 song “Got to Give It Up” for use in their own hit, “Blurred Lines.”
The two singers must now pay Gaye’s estate a whopping $7.3 million in damages as a result, reports Variety.
As RadarOnline.com reported, Gaye’s family countersued Thicke, 38, Williams and Clifford Harris Jr., also known as T.I., for $25 million after the three preemptively petitioned for a jury to decide whether or not their 2013 song violated copyright laws following accusations of infringement.

“Right now, I feel free,” Gaye’s daughter Nona said of the jury’s decision. “Free from… Pharrell Williams and Robin Thicke’s chains and what they tried to keep on us and the lies that were told.”
“While we respect the judicial process, we are extremely disappointed in the ruling made today, which sets a horrible precedent for music and creativity going forward,” a spokesperson for 41-year-old Williams told Rolling Stone in a statement.
“Pharrell created ‘Blurred Lines’ from his heart, mind and soul and the song was not taken from anyone or anywhere else. We are reviewing the decision, considering our options and you will hear more from us soon about this matter.” /n
