According to paperwork filed on October 13, T.I.’s attorneys argued that they “reviewed over 150 supervised release or probation revocation proceedings in the Northern District of Georgia between 2000 and 2010” and “did not locate a single case” in which the person “was sentenced to a term of imprisonment.”
T.I. – real name Clifford Harris, Jr. – previously served nine months in jail on federal weapons possession charges and was on probation when he and his wife, Tameka Cottle, were arrested in September on drug possession charges in Los Angeles.

Over 20 cases were presented by T.I.’s attorneys as evidence that “a defendant, who is charged with possessing a ‘user amount’ of a controlled substance or who tests positive for drug use on a first occasion, is not imprisoned.”
“All the judges in this district have uniformly applied this approach,” they go on to state as evidence.
