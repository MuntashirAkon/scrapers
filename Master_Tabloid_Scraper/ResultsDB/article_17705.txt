The 29-year-old Whatever You Like singer and his wife, 36, were pulled over on a traffic stop in the 9200 block of Sunset Boulevard on Wednesday, when authorities noticed the smell of marijuana.
Police also found pills in their car, and the pills are being tested to see if they are the drug Ecstasy.
At this time, the couple has not been charged with any crime, pending the results of tests on the pills.
Authorities also say no other possible drugs were found in the car.
They were subsequently booked into the West Hollywood sheriffâ€™s station and later released on $10,000 bond each.
T.I., whose real name is Clifford Harris Jr., married Cottle July 30 in Miami Beach. The Grammy-winner is no stranger to legal troubles, as he was released from prison late last year after serving time on an illegal firearms possession conviction.
 T.I. currently can be seen in the box office hit Takers.  /n
