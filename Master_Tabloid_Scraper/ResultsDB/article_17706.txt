This Halloween-Themed 'Dripping Blood' Choker Proves The Internet Has A Dirty Mind Once & For All/n

While most companies are busting out their witch hats and vampire fangs â€” this Halloween-themed accessory from Asos is getting a lot of attentionâ€¦ and definitely not for the right reasons.
The site posted their "dripping blood" choker (above) in honor of the spooky holiday, but it looks likeâ€¦ something different.
It didn't take long before the Internet catch wind and immediately point out how much the "blood dripping" looks a lot like, well, a pearl necklace. And not the kind your grandmother wears.
They know blood is red, right?!

Needless to say, people on Reddit had a field day with this saying things like:

"Oh cum on."
"That's hardly appropriate"
"Hey ladies I'm making blood necklaces all night!"
"That's why she's winking"
WAAAHHH. Gross.
Are people's minds in the gutter or is this just a slip-up?? SOUND OFF in the comments!
