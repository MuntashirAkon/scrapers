It all started after the Biebs got upset over the comments he was receiving on a series of selfies he shared with 17-year-old Sofia Richie, his friend (and yes, the daughter of Lionel Richie). 
As fans began to comment in droves about Richie, the pair's potential relationship statuses, and more, the Biebs lashed out and posted the following pic (and note the caption, below)!!! 




I'm gonna make my Instagram private if you guys don't stop the hate this is getting out of hand, if you guys are really fans you wouldn't be so mean to people that I likeA photo posted by Justin Bieber (@justinbieber) on Aug 13, 2016 at 10:34pm PDT


Whoa!!!
Obviously with this caption (below) the Biebs is NOT playing around:

"I'm gonna make my Instagram private if you guys don't stop the hate this is getting out of hand, if you guys are really fans you wouldn't be so mean to people that I like."

That sent fans on Twitter into a tizzy all day, with "#RIPBeliebers" trending all over the world, including some of the reactions (below):
