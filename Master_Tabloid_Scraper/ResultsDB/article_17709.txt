Roseanne, Paul Walker, & Porno! Here's What's Coming & Going On Netflix This August!/n

Our TVs are ready!
With each passing month, Netflix gets bigger and better while cord-cutters continue to cut down classic cable television — and this August is no different.
That's because after a month that gave us new seasons of BoJack Horseman, Between, and Stranger Things, we've got 72 new additions to the streaming service to look forward to!
Quiz: Which Orange Is The New Black Inmate Are You??
We're talking classics like Roseanne, The Fast and the Furious, Sleepy Hollow, NCIS, and even Zack and Miri Make a Porno in just a few days!
Unfortunately, that also means we have to say say goodbye to a few favorites… but we're sure we'll see them available again in no time.
Ch-ch-check out everything coming to and leaving from Netflix this August (below)!!!
