Sinead O'Connor Missing & Possibly Suicidal Following Emotional Online Behavior/n

Well, this is certainly troubling.
On Monday, it was revealed the police in Wilmette, Illinois are looking for Sinead O'Connor in order to confirm her well being. Reportedly, the Nothing Compares 2 U singer went for a bike ride around 6 a.m. on Sunday and has not been seen since. Oh no!
It's said that the 49-year-old has been listed as "missing suicidal."

What's most concerning is that Miz O'Connor penned an emotional note on Friday to her son Shane, who is currently out of her custody. She posted: 

Whoa. Not to mention, Sinead followed up this post with another message where she requested that her older son Jake take custody of his brother.

Now that's a guilt trip. Still, while the controversial celeb has caused concern for the police, the A-lister previously told fans over the weekend she was "heading down South" to North Carolina for several weeks. How cryptic!
Unfortunately, this isn't the first time the songstress has been erratic online as she shared a suicide note on the social media site back in November and by December was begging for her children to come visit her. So sad!
Most recently, Sinead got herself mixed up in a legal battle with Arsenio Hall when she declared that it was the former late night host that allegedly got Prince hooked on drugs. Who knows, maybe O'Connor is just trying to lay low amid her many dramas.
