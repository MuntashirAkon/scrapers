Apparently 6 Seconds of Summer is too hot to handle for guitarist Michael Clifford.

5 Seconds of Summer was rocking out to a final song in their line-up when pyrotechnics set their guitar hero’s hair ablaze. A sold-out Wembley Arena watched as Clifford put out the fire with a towel that was handy on stage.

The Aussie ran off to receive medical attention while his band mates finished the set.

Ashton Irwin, the boy band’s drummer, later announced to the London crowd that Clifford would not be returning to perform. As a result, #GetWellSoonMichael began trending on Twitter with well wishes rolling in from his fans.

Clifford reassured social media that he was doing just fine with a giant thumbs up in this bandaged selfie:

5SOS is set to play Wembley Arena this evening for a third performance at the venue during their tour. It appears that their guitarist is back in fighting shape to bring the house down in flames.

Rock on, Michael, but consider maybe wearing a bonnet the next time you plan to dance around fire. \m/
