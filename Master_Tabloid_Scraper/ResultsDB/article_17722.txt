 What did Taylor Swift ever do to Abigail Breslin?
18-year-old actress tweeted this week, “Cuz darling I’m a nightmare dressed like an emotionally unstable cat lady.”

The post, a slightly modified line from Swift’s latest hit, “Blank Space,” is an apparent dig at the country/pop star, who’ll turn 25 on Saturday — and who rarely travels without her cat, Olivia Benson.
The original line from the song reads: “‘Cause darling I’m a nightmare dressed like a daydream.”
The possible jab was rumored to center around a flirty Twitter exchange that took place on Dec. 1 between Taylor and the August: Osage County star’s ex-boyfriend, 5 Seconds of Summer’s Michael Clifford.
“Forgot to mention, congrats on the other night…” Swift wrote, referring to the band’s recent New Artist of the Year win at last month’s American Music Awards.
Clifford replied: “Thank you your performance of blank space was sweet.” He added a silly YouTube video and quipped: “I cried like this guy.”
Well, late last night Abigail cleared things up with this tweet:
to clarify: my tweet earlier quoting a taylor swift lyric was me saying I AM AN EMOTIONALLY UNSTABLE CAT LADY. NOT TAYLOR. JSYK.
