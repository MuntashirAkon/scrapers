5 Seconds of Summer's Michael Clifford Goes Clubbing One Day After Being Burned Onstage (PHOTO)/n
Michael Clifford was spotted clubbing in London Sunday, a day after the 5 Seconds of Summer guitarist was burned by pyrotechnics onstage.  
The guitarist, 19, was seen leaving the popular Mahiki nightclub in Mayfair, London, around 4 o’clock Monday morning.  
Clifford covered his head as he left the club – which he hit up with bandmates Luke Hemmings and Calum Hood – but the black jacket and his hair couldn’t hide a red scar by his left eye.   
Still, it was a quick and welcome recovery for the Aussie rocker, whose face was wrapped in bandages only 24 hours earlier.  
The band was performing at Wembley Stadium in London Saturday when Clifford walked too close to a jet of fire on the stage floor, singeing his head and face, which appeared to be smoking, per clips posted by concertgoers.  
The Saturday show ended early, but Clifford recovered quickly, and 5SOS played its third Wembley set as part of ROWYSO Tour, which concluded its European leg Sunday.  
“There’s been a lot of love spread around lately, thank you all so much,” Clifford Tweeted following his injury.  
Early Monday morning, Clifford Tweeted a snoozing emoticon, indicating the guitarist was finally getting some sleep.
