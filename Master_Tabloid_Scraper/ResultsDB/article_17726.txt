5 Seconds of Summer's Michael Clifford Burned But 'Fine' After Pyrotechnics Accident/n
Michael Clifford, guitarist for pop-rockers 5 Seconds of Summer, was injured during the band‚Äôs Saturday night performance after it appears he walked into one of the pyrotechnics on stage.  
‚ÄúWhat the f‚Äî- up. sorry I couldnt finish the encore, but at least I look like two face. thanks for worrying every1,‚Äù Clifford Tweeted Saturday, alongside of a photo of him giving a thumbs-up, his face wrapped in bandages.  
The band, known as 5SOS, was performing at Wembley Arena in London when Clifford seemed to walked too close to a jet of fire from the stage floor, singing his head and face, which can be seen smoking in video posted by audience members.  
In the video, he walks quickly off stage, rubbing at his head with a towel.

Band mate Ashton Irwin soon announced Clifford‚Äôs injury to the audience, and ended the show: ‚ÄúMichael has hurt himself so we will not be continuing the show right now.‚Äù  
Sunday morning, Irwin Tweeted: ‚ÄúEarly morning breaths‚Ä¶ Today we are playing wembley for the 3rd time! Last night was crazy, happy my dude is ok‚Ä¶‚Äù

He did have one request.
