Kool and the Gang trombonist Clifford Adams passed away Monday. He was 62.Adams had been suffering from liver cancer for about a year, but didn't have health insurance to cover the costs of medical care. While hospitalized at Capital Health Regional Medical Center in Trenton, NJ, the famed jazz performer's family and friends held fundraisers to try and pay for a liver transplant. He received help from Jazz Bridge, a nonprofit created to help jazz musicians through hard times.Best known for his time spent with Kool and the Gang, Adams also played with The Stylistics, Patti Labelle and the Bluebells.

Michael Ray, who played trumpet in Kool and the Gang and was a longtime friend of Adams, previously told NJ.com that Adams was an amazing man and father."He is my oldest friend in life and he has put two kids through college playing the trombone, which is a miracle," Ray said.Â Our thoughts and prayers go out to his family.
