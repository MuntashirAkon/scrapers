So what does Michael Clifford have to say about ex Abigail Breslin maybe saying that he sucks? Not much.The 5 Seconds of Summer guitarist was rumored to be the inspiration behind the actress's debut music video "You Suck," and yes, as you can imagine from the title, it wasn't exactly praising her ex-boyfriend.Clifford was asked about the interesting release during an Australian radio interview on Nova FM recently. "I haven't spoken to her in a year," Clifford shyly told host Kent "Smallzy" Small, noting that he does have tattoos and dyed hair as mentioned in the lyrics.

Smallzy did warn Clifford about constantly bleaching his hair, telling the young musician that his locks will eventually fall out. "That's the one lesson learned," Michael joked.Bandmate Luke Hemmings did offer the argument that Breslin's song may not be about his pal. "We don't know for sure that it's about Michael," he (maybe sarcastically) said. "It could be about anyone."Whether Luke was mocking the situation or not, there was some speculation that "You Suck" may have been about Breslin's other ex-boyfriend Jack Barakat (who also has bleached hair and tattoos). She also sings that the guy in question "sounds like All Time Low," which points the finger at Barakat because that's the name of his band.Who do you think the song is about?
