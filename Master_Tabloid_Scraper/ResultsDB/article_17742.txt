A music feud right in the middle of the holidays? Say it ain't so, folks!  Fans couldn't stop buzzing after 5 Seconds of Summer appeared in the latest issue of Rolling Stone where the topic of Justin Bieber came up."I think he hates us," Michael Clifford shared with the publication after detailing a party thrown by the "Sorry" singer at the Nice Guy. "It was f--king crazy, people standing on tables and s--t. I probably shouldn't say this, but he had his own album on loop for, like, two or three hours."As soon as the interview was posted over the weekend, Bieber took to Twitter to set the record straight. And while he deleted all his messages, fans were still able to capture it all online.

This isn't the first time Clifford has spoken out about the issue. After the article featured quotes from the guys on their respective sex lives on tour, the 20-year-old told his followers, "I hate when people include everything in an article EXCEPT the reason we're a band; the fans."Fellow band member Luke Hemmings added (then deleted), "How about we talk about the music and the fans…the only reason a band is a band."You can read the full Rolling Stones article that features the guys' naked cover online now.
