'Br√ºno' -- Photog Drops Case Over Gay Rally Attack/nSacha Baron Cohen is in the clear over an alleged attack on a gay cameraman at a gay rights rally in 2008 -- TMZ has learned the photog has dropped the case citing his own  "emotional well being. "The cameraman -- Mike Skiff -- filed a lawsuit against Cohen and the people behind the movie  "Bruno " last month ... claiming he was attacked by crew members while covering a Prop 8 rally in West Hollywood. Skiff insisted that he was targeted because he had recognized Sacha in his Bruno costume ... just as Sacha and company began  "inciting " the crowd. But last week, Skiff suddenly decided to call off his legal war -- filing a request for dismissal with the L.A. County Superior Court. His lawyer tells us the matter  "had become too difficult [for Skiff] to deal with. " The lawyer, Clifford Scherer, adds,  "Mike is satisfied with the statements he made, and satisfied that people were made aware of the situation. "UPDATE: Skiff has now issued a statement on the situation./n
