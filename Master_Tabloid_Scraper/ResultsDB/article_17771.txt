Sam Shepard has long been a hero of mine. A versatile artist with an unflinching style entirely his own. A renegade renaissance man. RIP.

Earlier this year I worked on Sam Shepard's True West. His words and characters gave an actor countless gifts to play with.
He was a master.

Sadly, Sam is just one of the latest fallen stars this year. Just this morning we also lost French New Wave actress Jeanne Moreau, star of Jules et Jim.
It's been a tough year so far.
See who else we've had to say goodbye to this yearâ€¦
