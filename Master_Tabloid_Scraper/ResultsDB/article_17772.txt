Oprah Winfrey Confirms Mindy Kaling's Baby News As She Reveals The Very Public Place She Learned The Secret!/n

Mindy Kaling knows how to keep a secret!
We mean, The Mindy Project star left her Wrinkle In Time costar Oprah Winfrey practically speechless when she informed the icon about her pregnancy. This juicy tidbit was dished by non-other than Oprah herself, as she confirmed The Office alum's baby news and opened up about how she learned the scoop.

According to the media mogul, the 38-year-old broke the news to her while they were standing in line to do press at Disney's D23 expo earlier this month. The 63-year-old shared: 

"That's when she told me. My mouth dropped. ‘What did you just say?' she said, ‘Oh, Oprah, I don't think you know. I'm 5 months pregnant.' And I said, ‘WHAAAAT?!'"
We wish we could've been a fly on the wall for THAT conversation. And Winfrey wasn't the only one from the AWIT fam to be blindsided by the news as Reese Witherspoon and Ava DuVernay also learned the truth that day too. Oprah continued:

"That was it, and we just kept smiling. And then I said to [Reese Witherspoon], ‘Did you know?' and she said, ‘I just found out, too.' And then I said to [Wrinkle director Ava DuVernay], ‘Did you know?' And she said, ‘I just found out.' "
Talk about a truth bomb! Per the TV goddess, "none" of the Wrinkle team knew about the pregnancy until that very moment. Regardless, the businesswoman quipped:

"I'm excited for her."
Same, girl. Same.
Now we just need Oprah to pry the identity of the baby daddy out of Mindy. Don't worry, we'll wait…
