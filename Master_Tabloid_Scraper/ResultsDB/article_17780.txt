Ava DuVernay Finally Reveals Inside Details on President Obama's White House Birthday Bash/n

President Barack Obama‘s star-studded 55th birthday party at the White House last month was such a private affair that even the most famous guests were asked to check their cell phones at the door. 
But now Selma director Ava DuVernay is spilling some details from the
“top-secret” bash. 
During an appearance on The Late Show Tuesday night, DuVernay chatted with host and fellow partygoer Stephen Colbert about a “dance battle” that broke out between Usher and Janelle Monae. 
“And you’re watching and you’re thinking, ‘Can this be?’ ” DuVernay said. “And so they’re dancing … and I’m like, ‘It can’t get better than this.’ Then on the periphery you see POTUS and FLOTUS, they’re getting into it, and you’re like, ‘It can’t get better than this.’ ”

Not to be outdone, Ellen DeGeneres, Paul McCartney and Chance the Rapper eventually jumped in, and DuVernay was done. “Epic,” she said. 
“It was a peak feeling,” Colbert admitted. “When Janelle Monae put her hat on my head and we started trading off moves, I had a brief – I had a flirtation with cool.”
Now if only there was cell phone footage of the dance battle, we could all enjoy a brief flirtation with cool.
