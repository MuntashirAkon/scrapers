Oprah Winfrey Says She's Lost Enough Weight that Stedman 'Can Pick Me Up and Carry Me to the Pool'/n
Oprah Winfrey has a special job in mind for her longtime beau Stedman Graham. 
Nearly a year after she became the spokesperson and a shareholder in Weight Watchers, Winfrey is loving her slender frame. But what does the mogul’s fit figure mean for Graham?
“I would like him to pick me up and carry me to the pool,” she joked to PEOPLE Monday at the premiere of OWN’s new original drama series Queen Sugar. “I’ve lost enough weight, he can pick me up and carry me to the pool. I can straddle him without breaking his back.”
Oprah WinfreyJason LaVeris/FilmMagicWinfrey, 62, has yet to reveal her total weight loss, but she said in January that she had lost 26 lbs. And in May, the TV mogul said Weight Watchers has been a true lifestyle change.
“I don’t feel like I’m on a diet that I’m ever going to go off again,” she said. “I feel like I’ll be counting points for the rest of my life.”
Winfrey stunned at Monday’s event in a dark, form-fitting dress with elbow-length sleeves. She wore her hair in a slick ponytail and topped off the look with black heels.

“I’m partnering with somebody who is not only this incredible talent for our time, Ava DuVernay, [but] you’re going to see her rise and rise and rise,” she said at the event. “Her future’s so bright it is burning our eyes already.”

She spoke about her personal relationship with DuVernay, calling her a “great friend and sister.”
“We separate our business talks from our friend talks because we can talk for [hours],” she said.
