Oh baby! 16 and Pregnant star Ashley Salazar — who infamously gave up her baby for adoption when she was in high school — is pregnant for the second time and RadarOnlie.com has the exclusive photos of her baby bump!
The former MTV star, now 21, is in her first trimester but is eagerly planning the arrival of her new baby.
“I’m really excited about the baby,” Salazar gushed in an exclusive interview to Radar.
“But I’m nervous about what Callie will think in the future. We really care about her we don’t want her to be mad at us about what we did when were really young, just teenagers and we didn’t know.”

She said, “We don’t know what we’re going to tell Callie, she’s so young, but we want to respect my aunt and uncle so that they understand how much we love everyone.”
As for plans to tie the knot, Radar has learned Salazar would love to be engaged but definitely wants to get married AFTER she gives birth!
