Grey’s Anatomy stunner Sara Ramirez will soon be trading her surgical mask for a wedding veil. 
The 35-year-old actress on Thursday announced her engagement to longtime love Ryan Debolt. According to her rep, their engagement “took place in Paris, France, on June 17.”

The irony here is that Sara’s character on the ABC medical hit, orthopedic surgeon Callie Torres, tied the knot on the show this past season – although, to a woman.
Fun facts: Ramirez was a member of the female ensemble in the Oscar-winning 2002 hit, Chicago, and later won a Tony for her show-stopping portrayal of the Lady of the Lake in the 2005 Broadway musical Spamalot.
