“I have made threatening comments before yes…but the last time was a year ago,” Gary wrote on his Facebook wall.
“I have grown since and I really realized how much it hurts a mother and I’m deeply sorry for that.”

A source close to the couple exclusively revealed to RadarOnline.com that Gary is “trying to keep his mind off stuff with Amber by filling his time with friends” and that he joined a couple buddies for drinks at a local bar on Friday night in Indiana.
“I re-watch this stuff it kills me to see things I say or do and how childish-immature I look. I’m very pro-Amber,” Gary said of his baby mama.

Amber was taken to St. John’s hospital in Anderson, Indiana on Tuesday after Gary called 911 claiming the mother of his two-year-old daughter, Leah, had threatened to take her own life.
After being held at St. Johns Hospital on a 72-hour “psychiatric evaluation” Amber was released on Friday and is recovering at home.
