TV: Thursday Hot List/n
We have some truly amazing news. After the poor, poor decision on NBC’s part to hold off on bringing back new episodes of 30 Rock until JANUARY—they came to their senses and realized that it was too mean to make us wait. So, we are happy to reveal that new episodes start tonight! We’re pretty sure that Emmy win for Best Comedy they scored a few weeks ago had a lot to do with this smart, smart move!  Season four kicks off with Jack deciding that changes are needed at TGS to stay on top during the recession, Jenna making over her image, Tracy reacing out to the common man and Kenneth leading a page strike. We are just psyched to have the gang back ahead of schedule!
And Grey’s Anatomy heats up tonight as the merger between Seattle Grace and Mercy West begins and it’s every doctor for his or her self. While all that’s going on—Arizona and Callie weather yet another hurdle in their relationship when Callie’s dad arrives with a priest to talk to Callie about dating men instead of women.
There’s also a familiar face on Private Practice when Dr. Miranda Baily comes to Oceanside Wellness with a patient. Apparently, her old friend Addison is not the only one who is happy to see her!
