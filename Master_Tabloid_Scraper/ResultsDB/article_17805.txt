Khloé Kardashian Proves She Takes Revenge Body Seriously By Kicking Off A Slacking Contestant!/n

Byeee!
Khloé Kardashian proved she's not fucking around when it comes to the art of the Revenge Body when she staged an intervention with contestant Brittany McCalipp during the E! series Thursday night.
Apparently, Miz McCalipp failed to hit her weight loss goals and didn't seem to be taking the process seriously as she continued smoking weed multiple times a day and her body fat had increased from 30.5 percent to 33.5 percent — despite being hooked up with the celeb trainer Gunnar Peterson and nutritionist Dr. Philip Goglia.

The KUWTK star told the contestant: 

"You have the best of the best at your fingertips. Take advantage of it! It's only a few weeks and it will change your life forever."
But ultimately, Brittany's lack of effort just wasn't cutting it.
Meanwhile, fellow contestant Ranella Ferrer was slaying it by losing 40 pounds with the help of her trainer, Corey Calliet.
She gushed of her progress:

"I know I can't blame anyone else for what happened to me. I can only blame myself for everything I did. She was just telling me truth. Twelve weeks ago, looking at myself in the mirror was embarrassing. Now when I look in the mirror, I'm really, really happy."
Yay! That's just proof that this CAN work!
