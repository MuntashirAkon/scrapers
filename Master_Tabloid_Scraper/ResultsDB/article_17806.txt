Girl Power! Look At All These Celebs Attending The Women's March On Washington!!/n

Hey Donald Trump — THIS is what an A-list set of stars looks like… because, ya know, you have no idea about that since your Inauguration Day events couldn't do better than Three Doors Down and Jackie Evancho!
At the Women's March on Washington, D.C. this morning, dozens of celebs came out to support the cause, put The Donald on notice, and help the event grow into a MASSIVE thing — maybe even bigger than Trump's inauguration yesterday!!

Marching with SO many sisters today but my heart is most proud to march with my blood sister, Angela, who has always been my guardian angel. We should all be guardians for each other. I march today because I am not afraid anymore and I hope I can be an example of fearlessness and resilience. I will not let anyone suppress me, silence me or clip my wings. For a long time I misunderstood the true definition of being a feminist, but now that I know, I am empowered! I am indisputably a feminist. I am here today to break the cycle of suppression and inequality. I stand with you all! ❤#whyimarch @womensmarchA photo posted by KATY PERRY (@katyperry) on Jan 21, 2017 at 6:26am PST
