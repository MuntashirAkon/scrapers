Shortly after the report became public, the Soundgarden and Audioslave frontman's widow Vicky Karayiannis Cornell released an emotional statement regarding the shocking news.
She wrote: 

"Many of us who know Chris well, noticed that he wasn't himself during his final hours and that something was very off… We have learned from this report that several substances were found in his system. After so many years of sobriety, this moment of terrible judgement seems to have completely impaired and altered his state of mind. Something clearly went terribly wrong and my children and I are heartbroken and are devastated that this moment can never be taken back… We very much appreciate all of the love we have received during this extremely difficult time and are dedicated to helping others in preventing this type of tragedy."
The couple married in 2004 and have two children: 12-year-old daughter Toni and 11-year-old son Christopher. Chris also has 17-year-old Lillian from a previous marriage.
The musician was 52-years-old.
