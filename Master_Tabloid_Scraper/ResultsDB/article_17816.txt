NBC News reports:
“The incident came after Meat Loaf canceled a concert in Calgary on Monday due to illness. He is on a Canadian tour that wraps up in July, according to his website.’For the whole show Meat Loaf seemed a little out of it,’ said Callie Young, 29, who was in the 8th row at the concert. ‘I actually told my boyfriend I was having a hard time enjoying the concert because I was concerned for his health.'”
“In 2013, Meat Loaf told the news agency Reuters that he did not want to travel anymore, during what he then called his final tour. He collapsed on stage in 2011, and later blamed past concussions and complications from asthma, Reuters reported.Meat Loaf has seven more concerts in Canada through July 2, according to a show list posted on his website. The next concert is scheduled for Saturday in Cold Lake in northern Alberta.”
