Holy biceps. 
Michael B. Jordan shows off his incredible physique on the latest cover of Men’s Health. The actor trained hard for his role in his new film Creed, and it definitely shows. He told the publication that he had to gain 24 pounds in order to play Apollo Creed’s son, opposite Sylvester Stallone.
His trainer, Corey Calliet, admits that he’s come a long way. “When we first started he could barely bench 20 pounds. His legs were flailing everywhere…he had nothing.”

And the Fantastic Four star agrees.
No, he’s right…I hated it. You know, at first you feel like sh-t, you’re hurting. When things start getting a little easier, when you start lifting weight you never lifted before, when you start bench-pressing 225 pounds 10 times and it ain’t nothing, and then you start giving hugs to girls and they’re, like, feeling you up a little and you think, ‘What’s this?’—then it’s, ‘This is all right.’
But that didn’t stop him from having a few cheat days. On those days, he admits he’d have everything from French toast to Philly cheesesteaks no matter what time of day it was. However, by the looks of his cover below, it’s safe to say the hard work paid off in the end.
