Grey's Anatomy Sneak Peek: Arizona Must Make a Bittersweet Choice in Her Custody Battle Against Callie/n
Save a life or fight for her child?  
Arizona (Jessica Capshaw) faces a life-changing choice in an exclusive sneak peek at Thursday’s episode of Grey’s Anatomy.  
In the clip, Arizona has to take the stand in family court to face off against her ex Callie (Sara Ramirez) over custody of their daughter Sofia (Eva Ariel Binder).
When questioned as to whether she is the “real” mother of Sofia (whom she adopted), Arizona tells the counselor: “I’m going to have to stop you before you continue for your own sake. You’re not going to imply that I’m any less Sofia’s mother because we don’t share the same DNA. Because that would be offensive – it would be offensive to anyone in the room who has an adopted child or is an adopted child.”   

Though her phone is ringing throughout, Arizona is steely in her defense: “I chose to be Sofia’s mother,” she says. “It did not fall into my lap. There was a choice, and I could stay or I could run, and I chose motherhood. And it was the best choice that I ever made.”  
When she’s given a chance, still on the stand to see who’s calling, she spots April’s (Sarah Drew) name on the caller ID and knows she must go to save a young pregnant girl’s life.  
“I love my child, and I want her with me, but I know that no matter how this ends she’ll survive,” she says with resignation. “She’ll be healthy and safe and well taken care of and loved – because we are her mothers.”  
“Mama Tried,” directed by Grey’s Anatomy‘s own Kevin McKidd airs Thursday at 8 p.m. ET on ABC.
