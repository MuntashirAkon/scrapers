Adopt Me! Little Callie Has Lots of Love to Give/n
Home. Some pets never have one to call their own. We’d like to help change that by introducing you to extraordinary adoptable pets every week. Meet Little Callie, an elderly feline who is best described as a clotheshorse – yep, you read that right.  
This very sweet lap cat with mild food allergies “has her own wardrobe,” says adoption manager Kristi Littrell of the Best Friends Animal Society in Kanab, Utah. “The clothes keep her from scratching herself.”


Talkative, affectionate and great with children, Callie came to Best Friends five years ago after her owner fell ill and could no longer care for her. The loveable 13-year-old kitty hasn’t let her bad luck get her down. She adores snuggling, being held and gets along with just about every cat or dog she’s ever come in contact with.  
During her time at the sanctuary, Callie’s really expanded her wardrobe. Her closet is filled with at least 15 sweatshirts and long-sleeve T-shirts. Her favorite? “She’s probably most comfortable,” says Littrell, “in her Best Friends sweatshirt.”  

If you think Little Callie is the sweet soul you’ve been looking for, contact Best Friends at catadoptions@bestfriends.org.

Adopting a pet is an amazing experience – and a big decision! Before bringing a pet into your home it’s important to consider your family circumstances and do your research on breeds.
