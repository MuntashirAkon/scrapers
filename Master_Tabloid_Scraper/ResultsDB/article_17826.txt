Adopt Me!  Little Callie Adores Being Around People/n
Home. Some pets never have one to call their own. We’d like to help change that by introducing you to an extraordinary adoptable pet every week. Meet Little Callie, an affectionate senior cat who’d love a home for the holidays.  
For the past four years, this 12-year-old feline has called the Best Friends Animal Sanctuary home. Though she’s happy and well taken care of, a real home would be the best thing for her.  
Given up when her ailing owner could no longer keep her, Little Callie just wants to be around people. She loves to be held, petted and curl up on a comfortable lap. She’s very talkative and would probably even strike up a conversation with a dog.


“She falls in love with everyone who comes to visit and would be fine in a home with dogs,” reads her bio. “She’ll never stop loving you if you take her in.”  

Even though she has mild food allergies, which require special food, nothing seems to get this spunky elderly kitty down. And, because it’s Senior Pet Month, this adorable little lady is free to a good home through the month of November – won’t you hang a Christmas stocking for her?  
If you think Little Callie is the kitty for you, fill out an adoption application via the Best Friends’ website.  
See a video of Little Callie in action below.

Adopting a pet is an amazing experience – and a big decision! Before bringing a pet into your home it’s important to consider your family circumstances and do your research on breeds.
