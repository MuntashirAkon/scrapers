Animal D'Oh! Callie the Cat Thinks She's a Soda Can!/n
Just what we’re looking for when we’re in need of a thirst quencher: a really cute cat pretending to be a can of Diet Coke! Yesss. In some bizarre form of synchronicity, Callie the cat (and as we all know, cats love refrigerators) also happens to be obsessed with soda can fridge packs!
Lauren Devita’s domestic long hair was just “this small furball of skin and bones” when Devita adopted Callie through Petfinder.com. It took Devita six months to nurse the kitten back to health, but Callie soon became “the most loving and cuddly kitten ever!” 
Two years later, little Callie loves playing with her sister Willow, but she mostly prefers playing in all of Devita’s discarded cardboard boxes. “She seems to be partial to Diet Coke,” Devita tells PEOPLEPets.com. 
Callie dives into the fridge packs and looks out through the open holes, hoping to attack an unsuspecting victim outside – watch out!
