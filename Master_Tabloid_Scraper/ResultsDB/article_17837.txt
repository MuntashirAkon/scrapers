ABC FAMILY/Eric McCandless

ABC Family's most heart-warming drama is almost back in our lives.The Fosters returns with a brand-new batch of episodes on Monday, Jan. 13 and we cannot wait to be reunited with our favorite modern family.When we last saw Callie (Maia Mitchell), she left the wedding of the season after a short but sweet smooch with her foster brother Brandon (David Lambert). Yikes! To make matters even more complicated, our tough-as-nails orphan has decided to run away from her problems—yet again.  To get you pumped for the winter premiere, we've snagged your exclusive first look at where Callie is now and how her bestie/ex-boyfriend Wyatt (Alex Saxon) is helping her get through this these troubling times.

Nothing says road trip like a gas station in the middle of nowhere. Even though Callie is desperate to put as much distance as possible between her and her relatively new foster fam, Wyatt is not too convinced she should be leaving it all behind."Things just weren't working out, OK?" Callie emotionally explains to her friend in the car. "I was probably going to be sent to another foster home and I can't do it anymore. I need to be in charge of my own life for once."Take a look at the full scene above and then tune into The Fosters' winter premiere Monday, Jan. 13 at 9 p.m. on ABC Family.
