It was the "noooooo" heard around Grey's Anatomy fans' living rooms when we saw that Arizona (Jessica Capshaw) was left with one leg post-plane crash and that wife Callie (Sara Ramirez) was the one who most likely amputated it.So is one of TV's most beloved couples in trouble this season? We talked to Jessica, who dished about Arizona and Callie's rocky road ahead:

"It's going to be tough in the beginning," Jessica confirmed (ugh!). "The first couple of episodes deal with how the leg came to be taken, who took it, and not only who is to blame, but who is responsible."Judging by what Jessica had to say next, our bets are still on Callie. "The worst thing happens to you, and you think it happens at the hands of the person who is supposed to be the best thing that ever happened to you, so it's a tough dilemma."

"But, you have to kind of lean into it," continued Jessica. "I mean, I have such a gift—I got to play this person that was just sunshine, light and everything good in the world, and now it's come to pass that there are opposites in life, and you have to be able to see what the other side of her is. And you will!"There is no way Shonda Rhimes would take Eric Dane from us then break up Callie and Arizona, right? Right?!Grey's Anatomy airs tonight on ABC at 9 p.m.
