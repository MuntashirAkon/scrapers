Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt Keeps Its Charm While Losing A Few Characters â€” Watch The Season Two Trailer!/n

We hope you didn't already do something today, because we need your undivided attention!
Netflix has been killing it so far in 2016 thanks to Fuller House, House of Cards, and Love, but it looks like they're ready to get back in touch with one of their funniest shows yet.
The streaming service finally dropped the trailer for Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt's second season on Monday, and things look just as charming as ever without giving too much of the plot away!

All we can tell from the teaser is that Kimmy (Ellie Kemper) gets a new job as Santa's helper at a Christmas-all-year store, and that she's still learning basic social skills from Titus (Tituss Burgess.)
While there's no evidence that Dong (Ki Hong Lee) or Xan (Dylan Gelula) will be coming back for more of the Tina Fey comedy, we're happy to see that Lillian (Carol Kane) and Jacqueline (Jane Krakowski) are still there!
