Horrific Stroke Leaves Loretta Lynn Speechless/n
A horrific stroke may have permanently silenced beloved country music legend Loretta Lynn
as friends fear the ailing icon will never sing again!
Since being stricken on May 4, the 85-year-old Coal Miner’s Daughter remains hospitalized,
and a source tells Radar Loretta has been struggling to speak — much less sing — since the heartbreaking catastrophe.
“This is just the cruelest blow for Loretta,” confesses the source.
“Singing is not only her life’s work, but her life’s love. For her to be robbed of that is just beyond devastating!”
Another insider dishes to Radar that Loretta “has always been a battler”
and recovered from a bout of pneumonia in 2001 and a broken left shoulder in 2006 —
but sadly adds “the prospects of her ever being able to take the stage again are grim. We’re praying for a miracle!” /n
