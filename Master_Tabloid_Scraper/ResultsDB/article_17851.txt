Mother Of Kidnapped Sherri Papini Claims She Once Blamed Her For Self-Harm Injuries/n
Sherri Papini faced hoax rumors when she was abducted in November before being found weeks later – and her mother alleged Papini previously made false accusations against her.
Papini’s mom, Loretta Graeff, told police in December 2003 that the then-21-year-old was “harming herself and blaming the injuries on [her],” an incident report obtained by the Sacramento Bee reads.
In a 2000 incident, Papini’s father accused her of burglary. In another call that year, her sister believed she kicked in her back door while trying to break into her home.

Lt. Pat Kropholler told People the first report was cleared as vandalism, while in the second report nothing appeared to be missing when Papini allegedly broke in.
Then in 2003, her father claimed she had an unauthorized withdrawal from his checking account.
The funds were later returned.

“This really doesn’t have any bearing on her case,” Lt. Kropholler said. “There is no evidence here that shows this is a hoax or this didn’t occur.”
Papini claimed two Hispanic women abducted her at gunpoint during a morning jog on November 2 near her home in Redding, California.
Her husband claimed she was beaten and branded during her 22 days of captivity during an interview with People.
