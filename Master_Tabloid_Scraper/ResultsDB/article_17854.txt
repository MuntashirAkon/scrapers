Why The Dept. Of Justice REJECTED FBI's Clinton Foundation Probe/n
The FBI requested to open an investigation into the Clinton Foundation, but the Department of Justice mysteriously refused it, a bombshell new report claims.
CNN reported that the reason behind the declined request was that the Justice Department has investigated the Clinton Foundation a year prior and had not collected enough evidence to justify an official probe at that time.
Not long after, Attorney General Loretta Lynch was caught in the crossfire of Hillary‘s scandal after she held a secret meeting with Bill in a parked private plane in Phoenix last June, while Hillary was under federal investigation for the alleged mismanagement of her private email server.

In one of the newly leaked emails released this week by Judicial Watch, the former head of the Clinton Foundation, Doug Band told State Department aides that it was “important to take care of” a redacted name.
In another email, Band “requests that Abedin and Mills put Gilbert Chagoury, a longtime buddy of Bill Clinton’s who donated millions to the Clinton Foundation, in touch with ‘the substance person re Lebanon’ at the State Department,” the Daily Mail reported.
The emails reveal how intertwined the Clinton Foundation was with the State Department while Hillary served as secretary of state. /n
