One week after the most deadly shooting in American History, authorities have announced plans to release a partial transcript of 911 calls placed by murderer Omar Mateen.

When pressed on what was going to be left out of the transcripts, Lynch replied that authorities were dedicated to providing answers, while also denying Mateen the opportunity to “further proclaim this individual’s pledges of allegiance to terrorist groups and further his propaganda.”
