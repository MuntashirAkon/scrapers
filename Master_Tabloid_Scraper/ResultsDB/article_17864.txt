Happy Birthday To Those Legs!!!/n

HBD Carrie Underwood!!!
It's one of our fave leggy starlets birthdays today… and it looks like she's already ringing in the big 3-4 in a major way!
First, the momma-of-one got a special phone call from none other than legend Loretta Lynn:

Ummm… @LorettaLynn just called and sang me happy birthday! How is this my life? #bestpresentever #happybirthdaytome #legend
