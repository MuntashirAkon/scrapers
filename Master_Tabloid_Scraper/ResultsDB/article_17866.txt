Sally Yates Is On The RIGHT SIDE Of History!/n

Our hearts go out to you, Sally Yates.
The acting attorney general was fired by President Donald Trump after she refused to defend his new immigrant ban targeting seven Muslim-majority nations.
On Monday, the top federal government lawyer said the Justice Department would not defend the executive order against court challenges.
Yates said she did not believe the order — which has sparked airport protests and nationwide chaos — would be "consistent with this institution's solemn obligation to always seek justice and stand for what is right."
While we couldn't love Yates more for standing up to the bronzed businessman's hasty administration, her victory was short lived — and she was fired just hours later.

In a response statement, the White House said Yates, who had served as deputy attorney general under Barack Obama, "has betrayed the Department of Justice by refusing to enforce a legal order designed to protect the citizens of the United States."
Um… she was actually doing just the opposite, but then again we're talking about President Alternative Facts here.
Trump replaced Yates with Dana J. Boente, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, saying he would serve as interim attorney general until Congress approves Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions.
Ironically, it was Sessions who actually  encouraged Yates to be prepared to stand up to the president just over a year ago.

During Yates' Senate confirmation hearing in 2015, the Republican Senator advised the deputy attorney general to "watch out, because people will be asking you to do things that you just need to say no about."
The full exchange is quite eerie given the events of this week:
Sessions: You have to watch out, because people will be asking you to do things that you just need to say no about. Do you think the attorney general has a responsibility to say no to the president if he asks for something that's improper? A lot of people defended the [Loretta] Lynch nomination by saying well, [then-President Obama] appoints somebody who's going to execute his views. What's wrong with that? But if the views that the president wants to execute are unlawful, should the attorney general or the deputy attorney general say no?
Yates: Senator, I believe that the attorney general or the deputy attorney general has an obligation to follow the law and the Constitution, and to give their independent legal advice to the president.
Of course, Sessions was encouraging Yates to go against Obama, an actual fit president, instead of the walking Saturday Night Live sketch currently in office.
While she may not be acting attorney general anymore, Yates' is getting a lot of praise on Twitter for defying the orange dictator POTUS:

Surely, Sally is on the right side of history; and we have a feeling she'll come out of this hot mess on top.
As for Trump, he's bordering on straight up tyranny, y'all!
