Could this decision effect the general election?

Today (July 5, 2016), FBI Director James Comey held a press conference to announce that, after a thorough investigation, he recommends no charges be brought against Hillary Clinton, the presumptive democratic presidential nominee, by the bureau.
“Although there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information, our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case,” Comey told those in attendance. “In looking back at our investigations into the mishandling or removal of classified information, we cannot find a case that would support bringing criminal charges on these facts.”

Clinton’s alleged use of her private email server instead of secure government servers has been a hot-button issue on the campaign trail this election cycle.
Now, the case goes to the Justice Department where they will decide whether or not to file charges. However, Attorney General Loretta Lynch said last week that she would accept the FBI’s recommendation.
Here’s an excerpt from the press conference:
