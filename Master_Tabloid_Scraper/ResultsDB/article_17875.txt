Miley Cyrus Gets a Tattoo of Her Grandma From Kat Von D/n
Miley Cyrus’ grandmother will now be forever watching over all of her crazy antics. Like, literally.
The “We Can’t Stop” crooner took to her Instagram Tuesday to show off her new tattoo of her maternal grandma, Loretta Findley. Inked by Kat Von D, the black-and-white portrait sits on the singer’s right forearm.

“Because I am her favorite & she is mine,” Cyrus wrote alongside a snapshot of her new tattoo. For those who are keeping count, this is the 20-year-old’s 21st piece and her third tatted by LA Ink star.
