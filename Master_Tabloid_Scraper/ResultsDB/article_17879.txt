 It was Homeland, not Mad Men or Downton Abbey, that dominated the 64th Annual Emmy Awards on Sunday.
The freshman Showtime series took home multiple awards throughout the evening, including the coveted prize for Best Drama Series.
Also winning big for Homeland: stars Claire Danes and Damian Lewis, who won for Outstanding Leading Actor and Leading Actress, respectively; and writers Alex Gansa, Howard Gordon and Gideon Raff, for the show’s pilot.
