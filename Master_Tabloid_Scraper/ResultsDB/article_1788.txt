3. Vacu Vin Wine Saver Pump with 2 x Vacuum Bottle Stoppers





The idea for the Vacu Vin Wine Saver emanated directly from the taste of spoiled wine – something that its inventors wanted to prevent once a bottle had been opened. The device was the first of its kind within the international market and has revolutionised the wine preservation process. It is now used in over 35 million households and more than 80 countries throughout the world.
The Wine Saver is a vacuum pump that extracts the air from an opened wine bottle and re-seals it using a rubber stopper. The airtight vacuum inhibits the oxidation process that is responsible for the deterioration of wine. The vacuum is created by placing a stopper into the neck of the opened bottle and pumping it until resistance is detectable. The pump incorporates a patented ‘click’ mechanism that indicates when a sufficient airtight environment has been established. (List price, $12.99)
