“Loretta, who just celebrated her 85th birthday, has been advised by her doctors to stay off the road while she is recuperating,” the statement read.
“Many of you have heard that my sister, Loretta Lynn, had a stroke. She’s a strong woman and I know she’ll come out of this. Our family appreciates your prayers, love and support. We pray for a speedy recovery,” Lynn’s sister, singer Crystal Gayle, said in a statement emailed by her publicist, which was obtained by ABC News.
Fans flocked to Lynn’s official Facebook page to send their well wishes.

Last September, Lynn announced she was recovering after a fall forced her to cancel her annual Labor Day concert at her Hurricane Mills, Tennessee ranch.
“I don’t have to work now. I don’t have to, but I love to,” Lynn, whose long list of awards and accomplishments include three Grammys, eight Country Music Association Awards (including the very first female vocalist award in 1967) and a Kennedy Center Honor, told PEOPLE in December. But she’s not done yet.
“I can probably outwork anyone in Nashville. I ain’t ready to lay down and die,” she says. “I don’t see no reason to quit right now.”
