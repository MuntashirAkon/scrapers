Loretta Lynn in Sick Bay/n
       Loretta Lynn ain't feeling so hot these days.              The undisputed queen of country music had to postpone three upcoming concerts, including a weekend show at her Hurricane Mills, Tennessee, dude ranch, after being sidelined with double pneumonia, according to her Website.               The illness forced the 69-year-old Lynn to seek treatment at a local hospital and put off July 9 and 10 appearances at Falls View Casino in Niagara Falls, New York. She's now resting comfortably at her home in Hurricane Mills, 50 miles west of Nashville.              "Loretta sends her heartfelt thanks to all of her fans for their love and support and looks forward to seeing them on the road again soon," reads a statement on LorettaLynn.com.              Not wanting to disappoint the hometown crowd, however, it was announced that Lynn's twin daughters, Peggy and Patsy (who perform as the Lynns)--along with Loretta's band, the Coal Miners--will appear in her stead at the Hurricane Mills ranch on Saturday.              Fans who purchased tickets to Lynn's performances can obtain refunds at their point of purchase. No word yet when the dates will be rescheduled.              June hasn't been so kind to the Honky Tonk Girl. Earlier this month, an aching back led her to cancel a midwestern swing that would have taken the native Kentuckian to venues in Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Missouri, Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana.              Lynn has beaten pneumonia before. In April 2001, just days after appearing as a guest on A&E;'s Live By Request, the country songbird was hospitalized with pneumonia for nearly two weeks. That 2001 illness led her to cancel several appearances, but she eventually made a full recovery.              Lynn rose to Nashville stardom in the '60s and '70s with hits like "You Ain't Woman Enough," "Blue Kentucky Girl," "Woman of the World," "The Pill" and a series of duets with Ernest Tubb and Conway Twitty. Hollywood immortalized her life story (and borrowed the title of her signature song) for the Oscar-winning 1980 movie Coal Miner's Daughter, starring Sissy Spacek and Tommy Lee Jones.              Lynn's latest album, the Jack White-produced Van Lear Rose, opened on the Billboard charts last month at number 24--her highest debut ever.
