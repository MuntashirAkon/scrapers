Loretta Lynn Hospitalized/n
The undisputed queen of country music has been sidelined with pneumonia.              Loretta Lynn, the irrepressible "Coal Miner's Daughter,"  was admitted Tuesday to an undisclosed hospital near her home in Hurricane Mills, Tennessee (about 50 miles west of Nashville), where she runs a dude ranch.              The 65-year-old songbird apparently came down with the illness just days after headlining an episode of A&E;'s  Live By Request and helping to announce the birth of Dixie Chick Natalie Maine's baby daughter during a phone-in chat session on Lynn's radio show.              According to her publicist, Lynn was in good shape the night of the show, except for complaining about ear problems that had been bothering her. She felt some discomfort in her chest over the weekend and checked herself into the hospital, where she was diagnosed with pneumonia.              "She is in good condition, but the doctors are watching her closely," says spokeswoman Schatzi Hageman. No immediate word on when Lynn will be discharged.              The illness has forced Lynn to scrap several planned appearances, including a benefit concert and tribute to her friend Johnny Russell scheduled for Thursday, as well as the Grand Ole Opry radio show on Saturday.              Lynn, who rose from humble beginnings in the mining country of Kentucky, became a Nashville star with tunes like and "You Ain't Woman Enough," "Blue Kentucky Girl," "Woman of the World" and "The Pill" and her duets with Ernest Tubb and  Conway Twitty. Hollywood borrowed her life story and the title of her signature song for the Oscar-winning 1980 movie, Coal Miner's Daughter, starring Sissy Spacek and Tommy Lee Jones.          In 2000, Lynn released Still Country, her first solo album of new material in 12 years.
