Loretta Lynn Released from Hospital/n
Loretta Lynn wants her fans to know you can't keep a good woman down.        The beloved country music queen was released from the hospital Saturday after spending nearly two weeks being treated for pneumonia.  She's now resting comfortably at her home in Hurricane Mills, Tennesee, about 50 miles west of Nashville.        "[The doctors] let her go Saturday but they're still going to keep a close monitor on her," her publicist, Shatzi Hageman, said Monday.  "They want her to lay low and not do anything until after April 30."       The rep said the 65-year-old Lynn is in good spirits and thanks her fans for all their cards and good wishes.        "She's thrilled to be home and is anxious to get back to work," Hageman added.  "If you know Loretta, then you know it's hard to keep a good woman down."        The legendary singer-songwriter, best known for her hits "Coal Miner's Daughter" and "You Ain't Woman Enough," was admitted to a Nashville hospital on March 20 after coming down with pneumonia just days after she appeared as a guest on A&E;'s Live by Request.        The illness forced Lynn to scrap several planned appearances, including a benefit concert and tribute to her friend Johnny Russell scheduled last Thursday, as well as Saturday's    Grand Ole Opry radio show.         The native Kentuckyan found Nashville stardom with tunes like "You Ain't Woman Enough," "Blue Kentucky Girl," "Woman of the World" and "The Pill," as well as her duets with Ernest Tubb and Conway Twitty.  Hollywood immortalized her life story (and borrowed the title of her signature song) for the Oscar-winning 1980 movie Coal Miner's Daughter, starring Sissy Spacek and Tommy Lee Jones.         Last year, Lynn released Still Country, her first solo album of new material in 12 years.
