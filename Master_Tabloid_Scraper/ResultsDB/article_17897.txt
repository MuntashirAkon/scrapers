Strange Terrors at Loretta Lynn's Crib on Ghost Adventures/n
Apparently bored with pretending that vague farting sounds caught on a Radio Shack recorder are malevolent spirits from beyond the grave threatening to take him back to hell with them, sturdy Zak Bagans is adding a new angle to his adventuring.It's all about a kind of hallucinatory fun zone where the Zakster personally invites you, yes you, to enter your TV set and join him. At Loretta Lynn's house, in this case, which he's confused with heaven.Nothing against the Volunteer State, but we never considered Hurricane Mills, Tennessee the location of life eternal.

Hey Zak, that wasn't our hand you just grabbed. Next time, aim a little higher.
