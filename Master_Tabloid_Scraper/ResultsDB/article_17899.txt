Oscar Winner Loretta Young Dies/n
Loretta Young,      the beautiful actress whose career started in silent movies and stretched to television and film, died Saturday of ovarian cancer. She was 87.            Young, who won a Best Actress Oscar for The Farmer's Daughter, passed away at the home of her sister, Georgian Montalban, and actor Ricardo Montalban.            "She was an incredible lady," her longtime friend and agent Norman Brokaw said. "I learned from her that if you can handle yourself with class and dignity, you can work as long as you want in this business."            From 1927 to 1953, Young appeared in 88 movies, costarring with just about every leading man of Hollywood's Golden Age, including Clark Gable, James Cagney, Cary Grant and Spencer Tracy.            In the '50s, she became one of the first marquee movie names to make a successful segue into Tinseltown's then-nascent medium, television. On the small screen she appeared in more than 300 episodes of The Loretta Young Show, opening the program by sweeping through a doorway in her trademark high-style gown.             "It was a marvelous experience for an actress to do everything she had ever wanted to do. I got it out of my system," she remarked in a 1973 interview. All told, her tube work, which included several specials, earned her three Emmy Awards and two Golden Globes.            When she retired in 1963, she devoted herself to Catholic charities and producing a line of beauty products bearing her name.             Young, whose given name was Gretchen Young, was born on January 6, 1913, in Salt Lake City. By the tender age of 15, she already had a starring turn in Laugh, Clown, Laugh to her credit.            The noted beauty liked making pictures, but said in an interview that she missed communicating with the audience. "The other aspects of being a movie star I can't knock: the fame, the grand houses, the glamour, the money, friends."            In addition to her sister, Young is survived by a daughter and two sons.
