Sometimes, you just need a break.So appears to be the case for country music legend Loretta Lynn.After experiencing quite the busy schedule, the 81-year-old has decided to postpone two upcoming shows in Iowa. According to her rep, the "Coal Miner's Daughter" singer is being treated for exhaustion, but hopes to perform again very soon."Lynn started feeling poorly midway through her three week tour," the statement read on her official website. "Loretta is a pro and wants to give her fans the best show possible. She felt she physically was unable to do that."

Despite her health, Lynn is planning to reschedule both Iowa shows for a later day and hopes fans will understand her situation.This isn't the first time the singer has postponed shows to improve her heath. Last year, the singer delayed two shows to undergo physical therapy. She also took time off in 2011 when she battled pneumonia.We're wishing Loretta nothing but a quick recovery.Â
