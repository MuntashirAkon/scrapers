We've got ourselves a new attorney general, and this time the appointment is a game-changer.Loretta Lynch was sworn in this morning by Vice President Joe Biden as the country's 83rd attorney general—oh, and she also happens to be the first African-American woman to hold the position. And she's only the second female AG after Janet Reno, who served from 1993 to 2001. Reno's historic appointment was followed by almost 14 years of more men in the top judicial spot, but that all changed today.

Lynch's journey to her current job has been quite impressive. According to an NPR profile, she was born in North Carolina during an era of strong civil unrest, was named the valedictorian of her high school class, and studied at Harvard before becoming the U.S. Attorney in Brooklyn. She was nominated for the job as Attorney General by President Obama five months ago and was confirmed for the post last week by the U.S. Senate. In typical Joe Biden fashion, the V.P. praised the historic nature of her swearing in by saying "Ladies and gentleman, it's about time. It's about time this woman is being sworn in."Lynch herself added to the sentiments in a more eloquent fashion. "It seems like such an understatement to say my heart is full, but it is," she said. "I have to thank the president for his faith in me and asking me to lead the department that I love to even greater heights." The new A.G. also added that she has the desire to "leave this world a better place for us having been a part of it."Hear, hear!
