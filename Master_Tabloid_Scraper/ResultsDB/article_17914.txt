'M*A*S*H*' Star Sued -- Hot Lips Blew Us Off!/nShe was one of the BIGGEST stars of one of the BIGGEST shows of all time ... but now the woman who played  "Hot Lips " Houlihan on M*A*S*H* is in the middle of a major financial crisis. TMZ has learned ... 74-year-old Loretta Swit has been sued by a company she allegedly hired to help run her art business. According to the docs, Swit asked the company to front her more than $10k in 2010 -- which she promised to pay back once she received a $50,000 insurance settlement check she said would be arriving shortly. The company -- Heath Solutions, Inc -- says it never got its money ... and claims things got much, much worse. Heath claims Swit commissioned to perform more than $44,562.50 worth of work to help develop and manage her website ... but she never paid that either. Now, Heath wants a judge to force Hot Lips to fork over the cash, pronto. Calls and emails to Swit have not been returned./n
