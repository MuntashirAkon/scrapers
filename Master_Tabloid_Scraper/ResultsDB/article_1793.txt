Katharine McPhee and Her Married ‘Smash’ Director Call It Quits/n
In light of the photo that surfaced clearly showing Katharine McPhee and Michael Morris (who happens to be married with kids) in a parking lot lip lock, the Smash star and the director have ended their affair.

According to PEOPLE’s source, “Katharine is no longer seeing Michael — at least for now.”
Since the pic went public nearly a month ago it’s been “an incredibly hard time for Katharine,” according to the mag.
Well, another person who is probably going through a harder time is Morris’ wife, actress Mary McCormack, who apparently kicked him out of the house and has been busy taking care of their three daughters, Lillian, 2, Rose, 6½, and Margaret, 9, in the midst of the media storm.
“Mary is a strong woman,” another source told the weekly. “Her dedication to her children will remain her focus and gift.”
To be fair, the 29-year-old American Idol alum also has a ring on that finger, having said “I do” to 48-year-old Nick Cokas in 2009. The two have reportedly been separated for months, but aren’t headed for permanent Splitsville just yet: “Katharine still has no plans to move forward with divorce at the moment,” added their source, “though they are not living together.”
