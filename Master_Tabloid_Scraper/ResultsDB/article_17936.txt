Bond Girl In Sex Tape?/n
     
An explicit home movie purporting to show sexy Bond Girl Olga Kurylenko making love to an ex-boyfriend has been put on sale to the highest bidder with a starting price of $100,000
RADAR has learned that one entertainment magazine was shown the footage. The woman featured on the tape is romping naked and uncensored on board a luxury yacht.
A representative for the magazine that was shown the tape said the leading lady is a dead ringer for Olga, who stars in the new Bond flick Quantum of Solace. The tape appears to have been filmed within the last two years.
On this tape however the performer is not acting in a big budget production but simply putting on a racy show for her partnerâ€™s hand-held camcorder. The home-made movie opens on board a Sunseeker motor yacht where the stunning woman writhes naked on the bed of the master cabin. /n
