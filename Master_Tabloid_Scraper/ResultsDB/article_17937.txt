From Bondage to Bond/n
     
Quantum of Solace may be getting bad reviews, but no one’s saying the latest Bond girl, Olga Kurylenko, doesn’t fill the screen better than racing cars and speeding aircraft.
“Most ‘Bond girls’ have something left for our imagination to discover,” said a source close to the film. “But Olga had already taken things many steps further.”
He was referring to the recent action- thriller, Hitman where Olga plays a hooker who bares it all, and before that the 2006 thriller The Serpent in which Olga played a sex slave, complete with all kinds of bondage.
In an FHM interview Kurylenko brushed off any semblance of modesty. 
“Taking my bra off in a movie has never been a problem for me, as long as it makes the film more enjoyable to watch.” /n
