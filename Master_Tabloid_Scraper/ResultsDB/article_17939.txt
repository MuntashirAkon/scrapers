Joe Biden Breaks Our Hearts AGAIN!/n

Joe Biden may regret not running for President in 2016, when we needed him to defeat He Who Shall Not Be Competent. But what about round 2??
During a New Hampshire Democratic Party fundraising dinner on Sunday, the former VP took the stage to an 800-strong crowd, many of whom were chanting "Run, Joe, run!"

Unfortunately, though he had previously left the subject a little vague, Biden gave a pretty clear answer on the subject of a run in 2020. He responded simply:
"Guys, I am not running."
That answer was reportedly met with boos from the collected Dems. Joe did say he was in no way retiring and would spend his time raising money for candidates he believed in. That's all well and good, butâ€¦
Well, just think about it in four years. Maybe the decision will look different in the light of the nuclear winter.
