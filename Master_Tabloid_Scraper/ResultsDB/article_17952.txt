 We all need a good friend to hit us with a slap of reality every now and again… But are Miley Cyrus’ latest remarks about Katy Perry and John Mayer a bit too soon?

The “Wrecking Ball” singer took to Twitter today to express her feelings about bestie Katy Perry’s ex-beau:
Girl if ur worried abt where tongues have been good thing ur ex boo is ur EX BOO cause we ALL know where THAT been pic.twitter.com/IO6KwRzw2y

While the tweet definitely holds some truth (we all know John Mayor is a bit of a man-whore), it comes right on the heels of the couple’s fresh breakup and even takes a slight jab at Katy–after all, she was (is?) in love with the guy, right?
Miley and the “California Girls” singer are good friends, so she was likely just messing around, but who knows!  This might start the next big Twitter feud (a la Lady Gaga and Perez Hilton).
If so, I’m sure they’ll kiss and makeup soon… Literally.
Miley followed up her first tweet with a photo of the two pop stars locking lips at her LA Bangerz show, saying “Dontchyouuuu act like you didn’t lurvvvvv it.” (Though I’m not sure Katy really did “lurv” it, as she ended up denying Miley’s attempt to slip in some tongue).
