Anna Kendrick’s Big, Grand Plans for the 2014 Golden Globes/n
Though she won’t be attending tonight’s ceremony at the Beverly Hilton, Anna Kendrick attended many a do this weekend to celebrate the Golden Globes.
Before attending last night’s Art of Elysium HEAVEN gala (in J. Mendel), Kendrick stopped by the Colgate Optic White Beauty Bar presented by Colgate, Sexy Hair, and Lifeway at Prive Salon in West Hollywood.
Celebuzz spoke to Kendrick about her Sunday night plans at Thursday’s LOVEGOLD luncheon at Chateau Marmont.

We overheard Kendrick telling someone that she would probably dine on mac n’ cheese during the broadcast, which begs two questions: 1) Which brand? 2) Accompanied by red or white?
“Kraft over velveeta,” Kendrick said.   “But I do Annie’s White Cheddar sometimes.
Good answer, and as for our favorite topic?
“Usually I do white [instead of red] before an event because of teeth [staining],” she added.  “But with macaroni and cheese, sometimes I’ll have red.
You cray, girl!  Now let’s talk about that incredible performance at the Kennedy Center Honors last month.
“I was so nervous. It was really helpful my fellow performers were,” Kendrick said about singing and dancing along to  “It’s Not Where You Go, It’s Where You Finish” in front of a notable crow.  “We were all backstage literally coming up to each other going, ‘Wait, so is the hat on the four or on the three? Ok, ok and the foot is on two?’ We all wanted it to be perfect.”
Honoree Shirley MacLaine was impressed with what Kendrick brought to the stage.
“She wrote me a hand-written letter after,” Kendrick said.  “I’m getting it framed. It’s so incredible.”
