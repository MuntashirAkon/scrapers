Olga Fonda Engaged to Liam Waite/n
Olga Fonda is set to wed.  
The Vampire Diaries star got engaged to Liam Waite, her boyfriend of two-and-a-half years, on New Year’s Eve, her rep confirms to PEOPLE.  
Waite, 42, took Fonda, 31, to the place where they first kissed, and just before the ball dropped, got down on one knee to pop the question with a diamond ring he designed himself.  
“Then the whole city lit up with fireworks,” Fonda tells E!, who was first to report the news. “It was very romantic.”  
The Russian actress currently plays vampire Nadia Petrova on the CW series, while Waite, a former actor, is now in the hotel business.
