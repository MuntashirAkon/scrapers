Picks and Pans Review: Meet Olga Kurylenko/n
>TOM’S LEADING LADY
Dream roles
She’s been a Bond girl and a Victoria’s Secret model, and now she’s getting postapocalyptic with Tom Cruise in Oblivion. “It seems surreal,” says the Ukranian-born actress, 33. “It’s very different from the life that I could have had, but it’s lovely. Sometimes I have to pinch myself!”
Her take on Tom
He’s amazing. He came on-set in the morning and lit everyone up with his enthusiasm and his light. He’s a very energetic and generous person. [He] and his daughter, we had lunch in my trailer.”
About that rumor
No, she’s not dating Cruise. “I try not to pay attention, especially when it’s not true.”
Oh yeah, she stars with Ben too.
She plays Ben Affleck‘s wife in To the Wonder, an introspective drama that’s “very different from Oblivion,” she says. “Poor Ben. It must have been frustrating for him to play such a cold and silent man; he is the total opposite.”
