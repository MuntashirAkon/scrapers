With her turns in action flicks Quantum of Solace and Oblivion, actress Olga Kurylenko is establishing herself as a seriously bad-ass babe. But what we’re more interested in is the fact that she’s fast becoming one of our favorite stars to watch on the red carpet.
Accompanying co-star Tom Cruise on a global promotional tour for their new flick, the star has turned up in one stunning dress after another, keeping us guessing but rarely making a misstep. She tends to favor very feminine styles, but nothing too saccharine or cutesy.

We took on the tough job of choosing our five favorite looks of Kurylenko’s so far. They include: the elegant lace-trimmed, Grecian-inspired white Marchesa gown she wore to the London premiere; a light blue Elie Saab floral number that was went well with a girlie ponytail in Moscow; the deep emerald Roland Mouret gown she paired with red lipstick and slicked-back strands in Dublin; a sexy feathered Emilio Pucci white halter for (where else?) Rio de Janeiro; and, for the Vienna photocall, an Audrey Hepburn-inspired ruffled coat and cigarette pants that belong in our closet for sure.
Kurylenko couldn’t miss in these striking looks, but we’re curious to know which was your favorite. Tell us in the comments below!
