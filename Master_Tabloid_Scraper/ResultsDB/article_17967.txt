From frumpy to formal!Here's proof celebs don't just wear the ponytail to the gym. Recently, Lala Anthony, Thandie Newton and Olga Kurylenko gave the simple style three pretty updates.The VH1 reality star opted to cover her elastic tie by twisting a small section of hair around the base, giving the back a more polished effect. Similarly, the Oblivion actress also displayed twists by adding two face-framing versions on either side of her part, leaving the tail extra silky.However, not all ponytails need to be sleek to look chic. Last week, Thandie modeled a curly faux ponytail style. Instead of tying her hair at the nape of her neck, she simple pinned her curls behind her ears, allowing her ringlets to appear more voluminous.
