Well, that's one way to distract the competition at the Winter Olympics.Estonian athlete Grete Gaim rocked some seriously creepy contacts when she competed in the women's biathlon 7.5km sprint event Sunday at Sochi, showing up with a faux eye hue that made her look like something out of a scary movie.In spite of Gaim's startling appearance, her crazy didn't give her much of an edge—the athlete finished in 71st  place.Meanwhile, Olga Graf also made waves when she zipped her uniform down to her belly button…and had nothing underneath.

After taking home Russia's first medal when she won bronze in the speedskating competition Sunday, Graf realized her mistake and quickly zipped her suit back up with an embarrassed smile on her face."I totally forgot," Graf said afterwards, according to People. "We have very good suits and they are very tight. You just want to breathe and you want to take off your suit.""Only afterward did I realize that maybe this video will appear on YouTube," the Olympian said with a laugh. "But I don't think it will be so bad."Yikes!
