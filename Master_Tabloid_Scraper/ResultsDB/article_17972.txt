Bust out the Yandy swimwear and designer dresses: There's a beauty pageant headed into town.We're just days after from the Miss USA 2017 competition and E! News has your first look at the 51 contestants competing for the very special crown. Before the show goes live at the Mandalay Resort and Casino in Las Vegas Sunday night, some of the ladies are sharing their secrets to feeling their best in the competition."I'm not much of a weight-lifting person. I'm more of a cardio girl," Miss Idaho Cassie Lewis told E! News. "I teach Latin dance so I'm all about that type of movement, but getting ready for the swimsuit competition I really want to push myself and get the best body of my life so I was doing weight lifting and workouts I've never done before."And while several ladies stuck to a strict fitness regimen, everyone continued to love their body no matter what size they were.  

"When it came to the diet routine, I'm a curvier woman, I'm a curvier girl so I didn't want to send a message that you needed to drop 30 pounds to do well in a pageant," Miss Georgia Deanna Johnson shared with us. "For me, it was just about staying healthy. I didn't feel the need to lose a bunch of weight. I just loved the body I was in essentially and I love it now." Dancing With the Stars' Julianne Hough and Terrence J are set to host the 2017 Miss USA competition that will feature performances from Pitbull and Brett Eldredge. 

Expect a nail-biting Q&A with the judges panel including Carson Kressley and Jeannie Mai. And as viewers know from past beauty pageants, anything can happen when things are live.Miss USA airs Sunday night at 8 p.m. only on Fox.
