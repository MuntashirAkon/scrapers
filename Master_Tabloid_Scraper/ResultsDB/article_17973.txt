Last year, the title of Miss USA 2016 went to Deshauana Barber, the first woman to win who was actively serving in the military at the time. At the time she told E! News, "I still am waiting for someone to pinch me, I feel like I'm dreaming, I cannot believe this is happening. I broke down during the crowning when they put it on my head and touched it and said, "Ah! it's really there. So, I'm shocked."

Miss USA will air live at 8 p.m. ET on FOX.
