Why, yellow there!As if June was sunny enough, stars are kicking off the summer season with bright lemon colored frocks.Miranda Kerr made our favorite looks last week in a Reem Acra lace sheath, which she paired with black pumps while in New York City. Also opting for dark heels, Olga Kurylenko accessorized her simple sheath with strappy, navy sandals at the Magic City season 2 premiere in Los Angeles.

Going for an even brighter effect, Jessica Alba arrived at Spike TV's Guy's Choice Awards in L.A. in an Atelier Versace mini with orange Celine pumps. The zesty heels also matched her tangerine lipstick and nail polish.
