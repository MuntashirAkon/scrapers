'Bachelor in Paradise' star Grant Kemp Hangs with New Girl/n "Bachelor in Paradise " star Grant Kemp clearly has strong rebound game ... and a definite type. We saw Grant outside Bootsy Bellows in WeHo and grilled him about the smokin' hot new chick he had in tow, Olga Safari. Remember, Grant and 'BiP' co-star Lace Morris broke off their engagement just last month. Based on Olga's familiar features, you might think Grant's still got a thing for Lace. Check out what he's got to say about the new girl in town. Wonder if she'll like his tattoo./n
