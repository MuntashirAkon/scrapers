 Harvey Weinstein's 'Finding Neverland' Hits The Broadway Stage -- Matthew Morrison &.../n
Harvey Weinstein‘s Finding Neverland — starring Glee‘s Matthew Morrison and Kelsey Grammer — is on Broadway!
Based on the Academy Award®-winning film of the same name, this breathtaking show follows playwright J.M. Barrie as he summons the courage to become the writer – and the man – he yearns to be. Barrie finds the inspiration he’s been missing when he meets the beautiful widow Sylvia and her four young sons: Jack, George, Michael and Peter.
Delighted by the boys’ hilarious escapades, Barrie conjures the magical world of Neverland and writes a play unlike any the high-society London theatergoers have ever seen. It’s a tremendous risk, but as Barrie himself has discovered— when you believe, you can fly.
