The ratings of ABC’s latest drama Nashville may have gone south in its second week, but the show’s filming location is still prime real estate.
Spreading over a mammoth 20,533 square feet, the Nashville, Tennessee estate that is home to fictional character Rayna James — played by Connie Britton — is up for sale for an equally huge asking price of  $19.5 million, reported Trulia Luxe Living.

The Belle Meade property is currently owned by Sylvia Roberts, who told the Tennessean that after initially filming inside the house, the production crew then moved shooting to a local sound stage and recreated several of its rooms.
“They duplicated every brick, even the space between the brick, the pine floor, even the furniture,” said Roberts. “They even had the vase in front of my sink. It’s amazing, the detail and the time that they put into making it exact.”
