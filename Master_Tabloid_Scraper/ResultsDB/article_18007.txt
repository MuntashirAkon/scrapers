Solange Is Not Here For 'Cultural Bias' At The Grammys Following BeyoncÃ©'s Huge Upset!/n

We still can't believe BeyoncÃ© didn't take home the Album Of The Year award last night at the Grammys â€” and honestly, neither can anyone else, including Adele!
As you may remember, Frank Ocean penned a powerful message about the reason he chose to boycott "music's biggest night," calling out the showrunners' "cultural bias."
Right after Bey's snub, her little sister Solange took to Twitter with a link to the Blonde singer's rant, saying:

And if that wasn't enough shade, the 30-year-old â€” who won her first ever Grammy last night for Cranes In The Sky (but wasn't able to accept her award during the main show), also said: 

Thank you for your well wishes. Gratitude.
If I would've gotten to accept this, I would've said black girls/women ARE grammys mothafuckaaaaðŸŒ¹ pic.twitter.com/Pm1LncrIAo

Wouldn't blame BeyoncÃ© if she never bothered with this show again. #GRAMMYs

Good morning to everyone except those who don't realize BeyoncÃ© never winning AOTY is a snub no matter how many other Grammys she has.
