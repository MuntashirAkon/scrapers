Per the report, the party will be thrown by the reality star's good friend Sylvia Karapetian and NO Kardashians or Jenners will be in attendance. It's probably for the best considering there's a lot of tension going on right now.
As for the details of the event, insiders reveal there will be about sixty guests and the theme will be neutral: 

"There will be lots and lots of flowers. The theme is neutral — lots of whites and grays and greens. There will be lots of music and food and drinks."

Sounds fun! We wonder if cameras will document the bash…
But wait, that's not all! Check out the momma-to-be's low-key and pretty invitation (below): 

Cute! We're loving how the duo decided to register at Babies R Us… Rob and Chyna keep it real! 
Here's to hoping the party goes off without a hitch!
