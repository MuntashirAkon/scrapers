The acclaimed actress is going behind the camera for her next project.

The star of FX’s Fargo, Kirsten Dunst is making her feature film debut with an adaptation of Sylvia Plath’s classic novel The Bell Jar, according to Deadline. Dunst and Nellie Kim wrote the script and Dakota Fanning is attached to play the film’s lead, Esther Greenwood.
The novel is set in 1950s New York and follows Greenwood, a young woman who works at a magazine before returning to her home in Boston and struggling with mental illness. The book is largely known for its depiction of insanity. Parallels are often drawn between the book’s protagonist and Plath herself who famously battled depression.
Dunst has directed two short films before including Welcome starring John Hawkes and Winona Ryder and Bastard starring Brian Geraghty and Lukas Haas.
No released date was announced as of yet.
