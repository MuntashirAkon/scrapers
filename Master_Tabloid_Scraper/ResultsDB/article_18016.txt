Kate Middleton was joined by husband Prince William and brother-in-law Prince Harry at a memorial to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Battle of the Somme in Thiepval, France on Friday (July 1, 2016). Wearing a nude lace dress with a black inset, the Duchess of Cambridge paid tribute to those who died during the battle.

Kate, 34, accessorized her look with a Sylvia Fletcher for Lock and Company hat she wore to 2011’s Trooping the Colour, a Mulberry clutch, and a pair of black suede Gianvito Rossi heels. She also wore Annoushka pearl earring drops suspended from Kiki McDonough hoops.
When it had started to rain half way through the service, both William, 34, and Harry, 31, quickly brought out their umbrellas to shield the Kate from the rain.

According to The Mirror, Kate told some schoolchildren at the memorial that she felt quite “emotional” while touring the new museum erected in honor of the fallen soldiers.
“She said it was quite emotional being here and that they were really enjoying their visit,” one student told the publication. “She said it was very moving.”
