Rita Ora’s first-ever relationship wasn’t exactly normal.

In her upcoming biography, Hot Right Now, she reveals that she had a relationship with a 26-year-old man when she was 14. The singer says that the sexual abuse took place when she was a student at London’s Sylvia Young Theatre School. However, she doesn’t want to be regarded as a victim of child abuse because she admits that she “wanted it”.
I was 14 when I had my first relationship with a guy. I would say (he was) about 26, and you have to remember I hadn’t had a relationship before then at all. I was very new to the whole world of a man and a female.
It’s child abuse, really, isn’t it? I don’t want to say that I suffered it, because I wanted it. I don’t want to say that I was forced to do it. I don’t want people to think I was abused as a kid, but I was definitely [more] mature than I should have been at 14.

In extracts taken from the book, which have been published by The Sun, she claims that the attention she received made her feel as though she could “take over the world”.
I can’t begin to tell you how confident I felt when a man was interested in me. Like, I felt like I was sexy. I felt like I had a form of respect. I felt like he listened to me. Now I know he listened to me because he obviously wanted to have sex with me. I felt good that men fancied me so I would, you know, wear low tops, I would put red lipstick on, I would, like, make my hair blonder.
The “Body on Me” singer has previously dated Calvin Harris, Robert Kardashian, and Ricky Hilfiger. These days, she reportedly hooking up with Travis Barker.
