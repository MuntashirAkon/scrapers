Drew Barrymore is expecting another girl with husband Will Kopelman, and is celebrating her good fortune of having a family, something she didn’t experience growing up in Hollywood.
“When I was a kid, everything was so unplanned, my parents were so erratic, and my world was so inconsistent…I was 14 when I moved into my own apartment,” Barrymore said in the February issue of Marie Claire.  “I was so scared. I didn’t know anything. I didn’t know you had to throw food out when it rotted in the fridge. I was convinced someone was going to crawl through my window. I would go to the Laundromat and sit there reading Anne Sexton, Sylvia Plath.”

Because of that, Barrymore treasures her friendships.
“I hated growing up alone. I hated it…I don’t fuck anyone over. My friends are the loves my life.”
Then there was the sordid relationship Barrymore had with her mother, Jaid.
“Ugh, I mean, my relationship with my mom is so complicated that…I’ve always been empathetic toward my mom, and I was even more so when I had a kid and we had a really amazing conversation about it. However, it hasn’t enabled me to lessen the distance. It’s the hardest subject in my life. I’ve never just been angry with her. I’ve always felt guilt and empathy and utter sensitivity. But we can’t really be in each other’s lives at this point.”
Meeting Kopelman changed Barrymore’s life.
“I didn’t think I would ever get to experience that. This is so safe and positive and healthy because they have their values intact. It was huge for me. And that’s what I want for my family.”
The February issue of Marie Claire hits newsstands January 14th.
