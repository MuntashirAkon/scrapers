Grey Hair? What Grey Hair?/n
This morning, the Duchess of Cambridge joined Sophie, Countess of Wessex and Sir Timothy Laurence on the Foreign Office’s balcony for Remembrance Sunday.
This annual event pays tribute to service men and women who have died while serving their country.  Ceremonies take place across the UK and Commonwealth.

Catherine wore Temperley London’s “Noa” coat (thanks to What Kate Wore and Duchess Kate Blog for the tip) with a Sylvia Fletcher for Lock & Co hat, an accessory we’ve seen at 2013’s St. Patrick’s Day parade, as well as a visit to Leicester with Queen Elizabeth in 2012, then again this past September.
Catherine was the subject of criticism on Thursday when her roots showed grey hairs, but today the focus was instead on her long curls, which kept blowing back due to blustery temperatures in London.
Prince Harry and Duke of Cambridge joined their grandparents and Princess Anne at the Cenotaph to lay wreaths of poppies, while Prince Charles carried out a similar ceremony today during his official visit to India.
