Adopt Me! Sylvia the Cat Would Bring Fun and Cuddles to Any Family
/n

Home: Some pets never have one to call their own. We’d like to help change that by introducing you to an extraordinary, adoptable pet every week. Today, meet Sylvia, a calico cat available for adoption at the Little Shelter Animal Rescue & Adoption Center in Huntington, New York.
She’s a very cuddly girl, that’s for sure! Sylvia is also pretty shy, but at just a year-old, she may just need some time to come out of her shell.
As you can tell from the shelter’s video, she loves to get her ears rubbed. She also loves being snuggled, according to her bio, and when you are petting her, she’ll bury her head in your lap (aww!).
This sweetie also loves to play with toys, her bio says, and would be a good source of fun for any and all families. To read more about Sylvia, click here.

To meet Sylvia and more adorable cats like her, attend the shelter’s Pet-A-Palooza event from 9-6pm on Saturday and Sunday, August 20th and 21st. There will be food, live entertainment, games and adoptions.
