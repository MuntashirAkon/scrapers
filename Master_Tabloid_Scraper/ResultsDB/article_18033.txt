Picks and Pans Review: Sylvia's Family Soul Food Cookbook/n
by Sylvia Woods and Family
In this restaurant cookbook, every reference to the famous establishment is followed by “TM” (for trademark). Clearly, Sylvia’s Restaurant in Harlem, along with her Atlanta branch and her line of soul food products, is serious business. But hers is also an inspiring American success story, as hard work (and a healthy dash of hot sauce) propels Woods from rural poverty to celebrity-chef status. Woods tells the story of her extended and close-knit family and shares such fiery recipes as her Chopped Barbecued Pork and Herbert’s “Hot As You Like It” Fried Corn, perfected by her husband of 55 years. (Morrow, $25)
Bottom Line: We’re souled on Sylvia
