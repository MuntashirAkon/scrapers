Unfortunately, their happy event was dampened by the news of Kim Kardashian being held at gunpoint and robbed in Paris."Everyone at the baby shower had turned off their phones, but a few people were checking every so often," a source told E! News. "One of the guests saw an alert about what had happened and told Rob."The pair were "very concerned," said a source, adding that Rob "started to make calls to his family to find out if everyone was OK."He tried calling Kim and mom Kris Jenner, and then he "grabbed Chyna and they started to make some calls together," the source added. While it was unclear who he eventually got a hold off, we're told they were relieved to hear Kim was unharmed."They were both extremely shaken up and upset by everything, but once they discovered that Kim wasn't hurt they calmed down," an insider told us. "It was a terrifying moment for the two of then. They were so worried about Kim."
