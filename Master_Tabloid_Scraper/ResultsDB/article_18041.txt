"I have some good news. I'm getting married!"Yes, Nashville is returning with a bridal bang this Wednesday as Juliette (Hayden Panettiere) is engaged to her NFL boyfriend of a hot minute, Sean (Tilky Jones). And while Juliette seems thrilled to be tying the knot, we're not so sure her troubled mother Jolene (Sylvia Jeffries) will be so delighted by the news.Actually, we're pretty darn sure she won't be. Why? Because we've got an exclusive sneak peek at Nashville's return this Wednesday, Jan. 9, which features Juliette breaking the big news to her mother in rehab...

After breaking the news and showing off her rock, Juliette tells Jolene a little bit about Sean ("He's an amazing guy!") before adding, "We're having a big church wedding this Saturday." Well, that was quick!After seeing her mother's stunned (and so far silent) reaction, Juliette asks, "Why are you not excited for me?" "It's not right," Jolene says. "Baby, you've got a hole so deep inside of you, and I know that because I've got the same hole. And you think saying some vows to someone you hardly know is going to fill that up?" Ouch!Of course, Juliette stresses she's nothing like her mother. "I'm getting married," she says. "I'm going to have a real family." But is our country songstress really happy? Watch the clip above to judge for yourself!Nashville returns Wednesday at 10 p.m. on ABC.
