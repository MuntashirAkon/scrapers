there are more eyes than ever on the young family. Day 1: Victoria arrival and welcome • Dress: Jenny Packham bespoke = approxiately $5,000 • Hat: Sylvia Fletcher for Lock and Company, embellished with maple leaves = approximately $4,000 • S.../n
We'll be updating you on her sure-to-be-impeccable outfits every single day, but Kate is expected to pack classy and diplomatic threads, opting for some Canadian designers, while also picking fashion-forward striking colors and silhouettes (to ensure that thousands of well-wishers will be able to spot her despite the massive crowds).Her outfits will be her usual mixture of affordable fashion (she particularly loves Zara and Topshop), and bespoke pieces, portraying the perfect message that Kate is both regal and accessible.Helping her achieve that signature "effortless" style, Kate has her go-to glam squad, including stylist Natasha Archer, accompanying her on the trip. Tash, as she is known within Kensington Palace, likes to shop online for Kate's threads as well as collaborate with the duchesses' favorite designers such as Sarah Burton from McQueen (who designed Kate's wedding dress) and Jenny Packham.Also on board is Kate's hairdresser, Amanda Tucker. Mandy has been working with Kate for the past four years and has the difficult task of making sure Kate's hair retains its perfect sleek and smooth style no matter what the weather or activity (the Canadian climate isn't ideal for Kate's thick hair but Amanda's job is to keep that Chelsea blow-dry in place). Amanda was also Kate's secret weapon for looking picture-perfect on her last official trip to Bhutan when she had to hike 10,000 feet up to Tiger's Nest.Amanda charges her royal client around 300 pounds a day, but that's nothing compared to the money spent on Kate's wardrobe. Here's how much it really costs to be Kate Middleton in Canada:
