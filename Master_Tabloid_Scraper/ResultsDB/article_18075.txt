“Berenice is telling friends that they’re happy, in love and that she sees a future with Tim,” said a friend. “He has been caring and a lovely father figure to her son. She refers to Tim as her boyfriend.”
As for Carter, a source said, “She thought Tim was having a midlife crisis and gave him room to get it out of his system. But it never happened so she reluctantly decided to end things.”
Burton and Carter insist their split is amicable and they even spent Christmas together with their two children, Billy Ray, 11, and Nell, 6.
