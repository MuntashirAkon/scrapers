The former couple, who never married, met in 2001 when Burton, 56, directed Carter, 48 in Planet of the Apes and have done several movies together including Dark Shadows, Sweeney Todd and Alice and Wonderland.
In Oct. 2013, Burton was accused of cheating on Carter when photos surfaced of what appeared to be him kissing a mystery blonde. However, Carter’s rep dismissed these photos, which clearly show intimacy, by saying, “This is absolute nonsense, the pictures were taken whilst they were out and the large group includes family, friends and work colleagues.”
