Jodie Foster Remembers Richardson/n
Jodie Foster was there at the very beginning, filming Nell with Natasha Richardson and Liam Neeson before the couple tied the know. As preparations to lay Richardson to rest are being worked out, Foster remembers her friend “Tasha.”
“Natasha was brilliant, beautiful, funny, talented beyond measure, as emotionally raw as she was razor sharp.” Foster says. “Tasha loved fiercely and that love continues in all of us who knew her.”
“May Liam, her beautiful boys and her loving family hold her close as they move through this tragic moment.”
