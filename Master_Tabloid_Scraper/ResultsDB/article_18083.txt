Natasha Richardson Suffers Head Injuries In Ski Accident/n
Actress Natasha Richardson suffered traumatic head injuries in a ski accident in Montreal Monday. 
Richardson was hospitalized about 75 miles from Montreal, the New York Post reported.
What’s not clear is how severe her injuries are. The Associated Press reports she is in critical condition, while a staffer at Sacré Coeur hospital told The Montreal Gazette Richardson was in the hospital’s intensive care unit Monday night, but had left the hospital by 11 p.m.
The Tony award-winning actress, 45, is the daughter of actress Vanessa Redgrave and director Tony Richardson. She married actor Liam Neeson, who she met filming Nell, in 1994; the couple has two young sons.
Richardson’s notable film credits include include The Parent Trap, The Handmaid’s Tale and last year’s Wild Child. (Photo: WENN) /n
