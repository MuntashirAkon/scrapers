Jenelle Evans wasn’t on hand to help her son Jace ring in his 8th birthday.

According to the Teen Mom 2 star, she was forbidden to attend her firstborn’s party due to her ongoing feud with her estranged mother, Barbara Evans. Though they recently reached a custody agreement for the child, it didn’t stop Babs from banning her own daughter from the birthday bash.
Via Teen Mom Talk Now:
Barbara posted a picture of Jace’s birthday party on her Instagram, and made it very clear that she and her grandson had a great day, even though Jenelle didn’t make an appearance. She wrote, “Jace having his 8 year old Birthday Party today with his friends Great Day!!!”
