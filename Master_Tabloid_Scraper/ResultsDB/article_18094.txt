Those closest to Chester Bennington believe the singer had no intention of killing himself.

The Linkin Park frontman had big plans before his suicide, including moving his family to the California home where he tragically took his life. The late 41-year-old reportedly splashed out $2.5 million on the five-bedroom, four-bathroom house at Palos Verdes Estates just two months before his death, sparking speculation among his loved ones that something else must’ve triggered his depression instead.
Via TMZ:
The purchase falls in line with what Chester’s LP bandmates said — that he’d spoken excitedly about future plans. Buying the perfect place for his family, but then taking his life there a month later just doesn’t add up.
The Benningtons closed on the house 8 days after Chris Cornell’s suicide … leading some close friends to believe Chester’s suicide decision was sudden and fueled by his grief.
