EXCLUSIVE! Lauren Conrad Unveils Kohl's Collection Inspired by Disney's Alice in Wonderland and It's So Cute We're Going Mad/n
In a way, Lauren Conrad is painting the roses red—not pink, not green, not aquamarine. But we can't imagine the Queen of Hearts will be shouting "Off with her head!" after she sees Disney's Alice in Wonderland, a Collection by LC Lauren Conrad, available exclusively at Kohl's. In stores Apr. 25, Conrad's adorable and affordable capsule features nearly 20 pieces, all priced between $36 and $68.Disney opened its archives to Conrad when she was getting ready to design the line, and down the rabbit hole she went. "I was really, really excited about this. From day one when they said we get to work with Disney, I was like, 'Tell me we get to do Alice in Wonderland!'" she tells E! News' Catt Sadler exclusively. "They sent us all this original artwork. I'm a little bit of a Disney nerd, so it's really cool for me because I get to see where these characters come from. Seeing the initial sketches and the transom ratio, it's really cool. I feel spoiled that I get to look at it all."Conrad incorporated elements from the Queen of Hearts, the White Rabbit, the Mad Hatter and other characters from 1951's animated classic. "The books and the movies are actually a little dark," she says, "so we wanted it to be a softer version."

This wasn't Conrad's first deal with the House of Mouse, of course.The fashion mogul previously created capsules for Bambi, Cinderella and Minnie Mouse, and she is already hard at work on her next top-secret Disney collaboration.Conrad's collection comes arrives ahead of Walt Disney Pictures' Alice Through the Looking Glass, out May 27. The live-action adventure stars Sacha Baron Cohen, Helena Bonham Carter, Johnny Depp, Anne Hathaway and Mia Wasikowska.
