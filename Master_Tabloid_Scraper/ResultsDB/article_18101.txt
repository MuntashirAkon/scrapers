Ariel Winter’s love for Levi Meaden has been immortalized.

The Modern Family star got matching tattoos with her boyfriend late Wednesday night (June 14, 2017) at Dr. Woo’s Hideaway at Suite X in Los Angeles. Adding to her already-growing collection of body art, the 19-year-old had one half of a broken heart inked on her hand.
Meanwhile, her 29-year-old beau had the corresponding half tatted on his left hand.
“Me n bae,” Ariel captioned a Snapchat photo of the design.

Not to be outdone by Kylie Jenner — who many claim Ariel takes her inspiration from — and her recent matching tattoo with Travis Scott, Ariel opted to get a second one with Levi. The other design was located just inches from her new ink.
“‘Peanut butter and cheese with my love,” Ariel wrote, sharing a picture of a block of cheese tatted on the side of her finger. Levi, on the there hand, was the proud owner of a peanut butter jar tattoo.

The actress also debuted a new tattoo of a snake just above the Roman numerals — a design she shares with sister Shanelle Gray — on her forearm. The new ink joins the spade on her inner right wrist, the tiger on her upper back, the initials of her five nieces and nephews on her ribcage, and a Greek quote reading “Love risks everything and asks for nothing” across her hip.
