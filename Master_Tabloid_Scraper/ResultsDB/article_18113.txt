Coroner: Nell Died of Natural Causes/n
     Nell Carter died a natural death.          That's the news from a Los Angeles coroner who ruled on Tuesday that the 54-year-old Gimme a Break! star, who had struggled with eating disorders and drug abuse, succumbed to natural causes likely brought on by heart disease and complications from diabetes.          "Carter was listed as having probably arterial sclerotic heart disease," a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office reported, while also noting that Carter's battle with diabetes over the years was also a contributing factor.          The medical examiner reached those conclusions after conducting a thorough autopsy and toxicological tests. Today's report did not cite the two brain surgeries that Carter underwent in 1992 to fix aneurysms as a cause in her death.          "She had fully recovered from those operations," the coroner spokesman said.          Carter collapsed on the floor of her Beverly Hills home on January 23 and was discovered by one of her young sons.          A rotund entertainer blessed with booming pipes, the 4-foot-11 Carter got her start in show biz as a cabaret performer, crooning jazz, blues, rock and pop tunes on the nightclub circuit in her native Birmingham, Alabama.           Carter eventually made her way to New York where she appeared in the soap opera Ryan's Hope and the sitcom The Misadventures of Sheriff Lobo. Her sassy, Tony-winning turn in 1978's hit Fats Waller-based Broadway revue Ain't Misbehavin' launched her into the big time. A TV version of the show earned her an Emmy.          But it was her role as wisecracking housekeeper Nell Harper, who kept things lively for widowed Police Chief Car Kanisky and his three daughters on NBC's Gimme a Break! for which she'll always be remembered. The TV Land staple, which ran on the Peacock from 1981 to 1987, snagged Carter two Emmy nominations and cemented her star status.
