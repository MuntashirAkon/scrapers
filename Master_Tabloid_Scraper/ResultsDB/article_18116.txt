Project Runway is finally back.And as usual, we made the mistake of falling in love with the first designer to go home. Sure, Cha Cha's "red carpet" look wasn't one we'd choose to wear on any color of carpet, but it had a chance before he added the pink garland...which Tim Gunn had the chance to discourage, and but didn't take. The twist this season is that the models are all different sizes, from 2 to 22, and each designer will work with a different model each week. With that quest for body positivity, Batani saying her goal was to "camouflage" her model's midsection should have sent her home, along with the fact that her dress was truly ugly. Cha Cha's was fun! Cha Cha himself was fun! Cha Cha didn't deserve to go home! 

Anyway, it wouldn't be a week of Project Runway if we weren't confused and a little angry at whatever the judges had decided, because this show is at its best when it's teaching us how little we know about fashion. We're also confused about how much the judges liked what Brandon showed, which looked kind of like a mess to us, and not nearly as impressed by Deyonte's flower dress as we were by Kenya's incredible tailoring of that white gown. Those two are clearly frontrunners already, but we're kind of thinking that if Kenya can pull that kind of fit off in that amount of time, she probably has a lot more up her sleeve, too. Keep on scrolling for a look at everyone who's held the title of Project Runway winner so far...

Project Runway airs Thursdays at 8 p.m. on Lifetime.
