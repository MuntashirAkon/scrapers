Nazis Applaud Trump's Defense Of White Nationalists, Everyone Else Is LIVID! See The Shocked Reactions Of Celebs, Politicians, & More!/n

We're still processing the fact the President of the United States actually went out of his way to double back Tuesday and defend the white supremacists in Charlottesville whose rally resulted in death and dozens of injuries.
Donald Trump has said some shocking things, but straight up defending the alt-right, AKA white supremacists, AKA neo-Nazis? By creating a false equivalency in the made up "alt-left"?
Truly despicable.

Of course, some people are really happy with what he said. You know, like the Ku Klux Klan.
Sadly, that isn't a joke. The former Imperial Wizard of the KKK and current "white nationalist" David Duke wrote on Twitter: 

Thank you President Trump for your honesty & courage to tell the truth about #Charlottesville & condemn the leftist terrorists in BLM/Antifa https://t.co/tTESdV4LP0

But how about the people who AREN'T racist pieces of shit? Here's a sampling of the THOUSANDS of outraged tweets from celebs, politicians, and concerned disgusted citizens:

One of the most transparent lies Trump told today is that he likes to wait for the facts before he makes a statement. Hahahahahaahaha

The President of the United States just defended neo-Nazis and blamed those who condemn their racism and hate. This is sick.

One good thing about that abomination of a speech: it's now impossible for any Trump supporter to pretend they don't know what he is.

My heart continues to break the more I watch the news. The hate was one sided and it hurts for people to say otherwise. So much for facts.

When Trump said,
"What about the alt-left that came charging at us" he aligned himself with Nazis.

There is no, "alt-left," @realDonaldTrump There are we who believe all are equal. All souls on board are equal.

Trump is exactly, obviously who he has always been, which is the same person @SpeakerRyan and his pals sold out the country to support.

There is a Nazi sitting in a jail, charged with murder, who has every reason to think the President has his back.
— Local Milk Steak (@ZeddRebel) August 15, 2017


Nazis killed a woman in the United States and the president yelled at the people opposed to Nazis. I can't believe that's a true statement.
— Mike Ryan (@mikeryan) August 15, 2017


The President of the United States just made it clear, in case anyone was still unsure, that he is in fact a racist.
— Jon Favreau (@jonfavs) August 15, 2017


The president is unstable and supporting white supremacists. It is time for Republicans and Democrats to take action and save our country.

Unreal. The President of the United States is staging a no-holds-barred defense of the Alt Right on live television.

My Twitter just exploded. You'd think the President of the USA just revealed himself to be a Nazi sympathizer on national TV or something.
— Moshik Temkin (@moshik_temkin) August 15, 2017


The President did everything he could today to defend and deflect criticism from the Alt-right white supremacist movement. It's a disgrace.

Nazis killed a woman and the President backed them up.
What will they do now?

President Trump just referred to a group of violent white nationalists, supremacists, segregationists, and neo-Nazis as "very fine people."

There are not "many sides." The #president has one side. We saw it in the #TrumpTower lobby just now. He IS the proudly defiant White Right.

The President of the United States has just turned his face to the world to defend Nazis, fascists and racists. For shame.

It is… fascinating to see white supremacist rhetoric come out of the mouth of the president–what will congressional Republicans do now?

It's 2017 and a reporter had to ask the president of the United States how he feels about the Confederacy. Man.

BTW, the now-normal sitch in which reporters politely shout questions while the President cuts them off & sneers at them as "fake" is NUTS.

Here's the question for journos to ask every Republican: "Do you agree with the President that some Nazis are good people?"

As of today, It is clear that the Office Of the President United States is occupied by a White Supremacist.

In an alternate universe, the President would be inviting Heather Heyer's family to the WH or perhaps making plans to speak at her funeral.
