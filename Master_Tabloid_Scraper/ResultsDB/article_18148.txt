Donald Trump Just Fired Anthony Scaramucci After 11 DAYS! See The Shocked Reactions On Twitter!/n

Holy shit, that did not take long!
On his eleventh day as White House communications director, Anthony Scaramucci has already been let go!
Donald Trump said his catch phrase (that already existed long before The Apprentice BTW) to The Mooch shortly after his controversially vulgar interview about the rest of the team went viral.

Current White House press secretary (for the moment) Sarah Huckabee Sanders tried to make it seem like a reasonable thing to happen, and not an utter failure, in an official statement:

"Anthony Scaramucci will be leaving his role as White House Communications Director. Mr. Scaramucci felt it was best to give Chief of Staff John Kelly a clean slate and the ability to build his own team. We wish him all the best."
But Twitter wasn't buying it! See some of the best reactions to Trump's latest flop (below):

OMG he's gonna replace Scaramucci with OJ

So it goes @Scaramucci is OUT. Being IN at all was another stunning example of @POTUS lousy judgment. This presidency is a killing joke.

Dear @Scaramucci you set the image of Italian Americans back decades with your thug talk and "from one Italian to another" nonsense. Later! https://t.co/E5dbJDBMvC

I'd venture to say this is the very definition of comedy. https://t.co/5RoMFV9r90

Mr. Scaramucci had a good run. We‚Äôre going to miss him. Thanks to him I pulled my back out trying to suck my own cock.

I'm bummed that Scaramucci will now be just a one-episode guest role when American Crime/Horror Story does Trump.

The Mooch is out. Doesn't matter really. We're kind of rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic at this point.

You go to the toilet in DC these days & you end up missing a major Trump scandal or firing or crazy tweet. Simply can't keep up. #Scaramucci

FYI, if you bought milk the day #Scaramucci was hired, it's still good.

Even we were surprised! See, we wrote to The Mooch exactly one week ago:

You will be fired by December.

What can we say? We're the first to admit when we're wrong! Ha!
