Global treasure Vilailuck Teigen (@pepperthai2) trolled her daughter Chrissy Teigen with her new kitchen gadget: a sausage stuffer.

Things got off to a rocky start when Chrissy started documenting her mom’s sausage-making process on Snapchat. Let’s just say that her first few links needed a little encouragement.

Once enough of the sausage filling made it into its casing, Vilailuck discovered how to tie up individual sausage links.
“I swear to god I’m going to f**king barf,” Chrissy commented.

I am. Gonna barf. pic.twitter.com/wY778AqYIm

She finished tying her links and celebrated her new title as the “sausage queen,” until she discovered a snafu in one of the earlier Snapchat videos.

The process came to an epic conclusion when Pepper Thai’s creation found an unconventional resting place in Chrissy’s home.

Well, it appeared to be an epic conclusion until this notion was proved otherwise the next morning.
