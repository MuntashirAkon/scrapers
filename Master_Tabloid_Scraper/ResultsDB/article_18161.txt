Lea Michele is taking a much needed vacation.

The Scream Queen star was spotted soaking up the sun, sand and surf on Wednesday (Feb. 22, 2017) when she hit the shores of Maui, Hawaii. Clad in a black swimsuit, Michele splashed about in the waves before retreating to her lounger with a group of gal pals.

In case you didn’t know just how much of a good time she was having, the 30-year-old actress shared plenty of photos of her tropical getaway on her Instagram. She sarcastically captioned one of the shots, “Having zero fun 🌊.”
