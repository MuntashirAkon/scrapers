On Sunday (Nov. 20, 2016), Chrissy Teigen hit the red carpet at the 2016 American Music Awards in a self-described “hooha”-baring gown that set Twitter on fire.

While Teigen already jokingly apologized to anyone who was offended for her almost NSFW dress, it seems like her critics weren’t satisfied and decided to hijack her Thanksgiving-themed Q&A with remarks about the gown. But, of course, they were no match for the hilarious model.
During the Q&A, one of Teigen’s followers named Alivia pointed out that she could have “just wore pants,” and Teigen clapped back hard. “Well, Alivia, hindsight is 20/20,” she said in a video. “Just like your mom when she named you with an ‘A’ instead of an ‘O.’ ”

 Luckily, Alivia seemed to take the shade in stride, later admitting she actually loved the dress and just wanted to be “roasted by the one and only.”
Another follower told Teigen she was merely a “woman” and not a “lady” because of the way she talks and dresses, and the model’s response was dripping with sarcasm.  “Oh Sean, I wake up every day just wanting to please you,” she said. “I’m so sorry I disappointed you. I don’t know what I can say but, wow, I apologize. I didn’t mean it to happen. But sorry, Sean. Sorry.”

When Teigen wasn’t busy clapping back at haters, she took some time to poke a little fun at herself when she saw a meme featuring a photo of her in the dress next to a picture of a character from Family Guy.
