WATCH: Fleetwood Mac’s Lindsey Buckingham and Christine McVie Perform ‘Don’t Stop’ on Classroom Instruments/n

Adele, One Direction, Ed Sheeran, and Metallica all helped turn Jimmy Fallon’s Classroom Instruments segment into a crowd-pleasing affair, but it’s largely left out one thing: kids. On The Tonight Show Monday, Fallon brought aboard children from the SeriousFun organization to join The Roots and Fleetwood Mac members Lindsey Buckingham and Christine McVie to sing an uplifting rendition of “Don’t Stop.”
SeriousFun, Paul Newman’s camp for kids with serious illnesses, is designed to help them maintain independence, personal growth, and, of course, sense of fun. Fallon previously donated profits from his Ben & Jerry’s flavor, The Tonight Dough, to the charity.
Now, some of these kids picked up instruments like the kazoo and toy guitar in joining Buckingham on Ukulele and McVie on toy piano. The video was shot as SeriousFun reached $1 million in profits from The Tonight Dough sales. In a statement, CEO Blake Maher called Fallon and Ben & Jerry’s “fantastic partners whose support helps ensure that we can provide transformative camp experiences to children living with many different types of serious illnesses all around the world, totally free of charge.”

The band’s most iconic member Stevie Nicks was M.I.A. likely because this duo is promoting their new album together, Lindsey Buckingham/Christine McVie, featuring songs like “Game of Pretend” and “Sleeping Around the Corner.”
“We thought we’d go into the studio to reacquaint myself to playing in a rock band and getting the chemistry and the vibe,” McVie told EW. “We thought we’d lay down a couple of tracks; that’s all we meant to do. And then Lindsey had some [songs]. And we just started having a good time.”
