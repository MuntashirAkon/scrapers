VIDEO: Tareq Salahi - "We Did Not Party Crash The White House"/n
Tareq and Michaele Salahi, the couple that mysteriously surfaced at a White House State dinner, said their lives have been damaged and denied having shown up to the president’s home uninvited.
“This has been the most devastating thing that’s ever happened to us,” Tareq told Matt Lauer on Tuesday’s Today Show. “We’re greatly saddened by all the circumstances that have been involved in portraying my wife and I as party crashers. I can tell you we did not party crash the White House.”

Michaele Salahi told Matt Lauer that “our lives have been destroyed, everything we’ve worked for… for me, 44 years, just destroyed.”
The House Homeland Security Committee on Monday invited the Salahis and the Secret Service to attend a hearing Thursday about the securitybreach.
