Ben Stiller and Christine Taylor‘s conflicting priorities contributed to their shocking split.
While Stiller, 51, and Taylor, 45, have collaborated over the years, the actor’s hectic work schedule put a strain on the relationship.
“It gets hard — he has a very busy Hollywood career, and she’s been very focused on being a mom,” a source tells PEOPLE in this week’s issue.
Stiller and Taylor, who costarred in Zoolander, Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story, Tropic Thunder, Arrested Development and Zoolander 2, are parents to daughter Ella, 15, and son Quinlin, 11.
 
“They are a very loving family,” adds the source, who doesn’t expect a messy uncoupling. “[Taylor] and Ben respect each other and will do anything to make sure their kids are happy.”
