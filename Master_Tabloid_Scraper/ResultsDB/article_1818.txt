No Bail Reduction for Drew Peterson/n
Assistant D.A. John Connelly successfully argued in an Illinois court today that accused killer Drew Peterson’s $20 million bail should not be reduced, AP is reporting.
The decision means that the ex-cop will remain behind bars while the case against him in the death of his third wife, Kathleen Savio, proceeds.
ADA Connelly also revealed that he would be presenting evidence that Peterson had offered a would-be hit man $25,000 to kill Savio. 
She was found dead in the bath tub in the couple’s Chicago-area home in 2004.
Her death was ruled a suicide at the time but following the disappearance of Peterson’s fourth wife, Stacy, in 2007, her remains were exhumed for a new autopsy.
The results of that forensic examination changed the cause of death to “homicide” and led to the eventual murder charges against her spouse.
Stacy Peterson is still missing but skeletal remains found in a barrel found in a nearby are being examined.
“I know he killed Stacy,” Drew’s stepbrother Thomas Morphey told Good Morning America.
