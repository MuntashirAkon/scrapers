Jordan Spieth Chugs From British Open Trophy with Country Star Randy Rogers /nGolf superstar Jordan Spieth brought his 2017 British Open trophy to Dallas Tuesday night -- where he filled it with booze and chugged it onstage at the Randy Rogers concert!!!  Randy and fellow country star Wade Bowen were performing their Hold My Beer & Watch This show at the House of Blues in Dallas when Spieth made a cameo with the Claret Jug.    Everyone took turns swiggin' out of the trophy -- and the crowd went wild! No word on what was inside ... but it's a safe bet it wasn't water.  Spieth won the British Open last weekend and he's been using his trophy as a cup nonstop. Hey, it's your trophy ... do whatcha want./n
