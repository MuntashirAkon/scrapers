Chrissy Teigen -- Calls Out Racist Hater ... Get Your Stereotypes Straight!/nChrissy Teigen got into it with a racist heckler on the street -- and then gave the guy a verbal smackdown ... with the best comeback. Chrissy says she was walking in West Hollywood this morning when she dropped her sunglasses -- and some guy shouted out a racist slur for Asians, saying ...  "f**king ch**ks always dropping s**t. " She says she acknowledged the comment and the jackass responded with more racism ... or attempted racism, anyway.  We were the only ones on the block and he screamed it from 5 feet away. Then when I acknowledged it he said  "oh now the oriental can hear " â€” christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) April 16, 2015 Gotta love Chrissy's response though. She tweeted,  "like that's not even a stereotype. get your shit together. What a bad racist. " Chrissy 1, Racism 0/n
