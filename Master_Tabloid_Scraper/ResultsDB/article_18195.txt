NFL's Corey White: Yes, Cowboys Cut Me Over Clothes/nEx-Dallas Cowboys cornerback Corey White tells TMZ Sports ... the reports that he was cut for not wearing a suit on a travel day are TRUE -- though he says,  "I was wearing slacks and a button down. " White, along with running back Christine Michael, got the ax last week -- with the Dallas Morning News claiming it was all because they broke team rules by not wearing a full suit to a road game.   "I'm not angry, " White tells us ...  "It's the rules. " White says he thought his outfit would be acceptable --  "I tried to dress like a pro. " White says after he was cut, one of the coaches on the team told him it was specifically because of the dress code violation ...  "It was about what I wore. " As for his future, White says he's hopeful he'll get picked up by another team -- and next time, he'll make sure to invest in a suit./n
