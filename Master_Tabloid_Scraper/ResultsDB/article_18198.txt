2 Chainz Victorious in 'THOT' Lawsuit/nThe great 2 Chainz  "THOT " war of 2015 is officially over -- and the judge's decision might mean it's open season on THOTs everywhere.  A federal judge in North Carolina tossed out Christine Chisholm's lawsuit. As we've reported, she sued Mr. Chainz for $5 million after he called her a  "THOT " -- short for  "that ho over there " -- repeatedly in a now infamous video of her backstage. The clip went viral, naturally. In his ruling, the judge said calling someone a  "THOT " does not rise to the level of  "extreme or outrageous conduct. " Translation: Sticks and stones might break your bones, but words ... ain't gonna get you a quick $5 mil. Sorry, THOTs./n
