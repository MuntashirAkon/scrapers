Adam Levine Reignites His Feud With The MTV VMAs â€” & Wife Behati Prinsloo Joins In On The Hate Too!/n

It's no secret that Adam Levine isn't a fan of the MTV VMAs.
But, just in case we all forgot about how the Maroon 5 frontman feels, he made sure to remind us of his disdain by taking to Twitter and putting the award show on blast.

On Sunday evening, the Sugar singer wrote: 

It's always exciting to see how utterly horrible the VMAs will be. They really delivered so far this year. #HOLYFUCK

Oh snap! The Voice judge's feud with the VMAs dates back to 2011 when the hitmaker told the award show to "fuck" itself.
Adam's wife, Behati Prinsloo, also got shady about the industry event as she added:

Wow @vmas thanks for talking over then cutting to commercial half way through #juliamichaels performance. #votejuliamichaels

Whoever wrote Katy Perry's script for the #VMAs , I just want to let you know it's next level cringe worthy ðŸ˜³ #makeitstop

Hey, Behati's just saying what we were all thinking!!
As for Adam's remarks, we wouldn't say the VMAs were "utterly horrible." We mean, did you catch Kendrick Lamar's opening number???
