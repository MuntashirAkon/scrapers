Maria Shriver Puts On A Brave Face In Athens/n
by Radar Staff
Heartbroken Maria Shriver continued to show the strains of her marriage breakdown to Arnold Schwarzenegger as she attended the Special Olympics Conference in Greece, and RadarOnline.com has the photos.
With a ‘Former First Lady Of California’ pass hung around her neck, Shriver forced a smile as she greeted some of the athletes who were staying at her Athens hotel.
But while she put on a brave face to continue her duties there was no denying she appeared tired and gaunt.

The couple’s children also looked glum as they supported their mother and their uncle Tim Shriver, who was also in attendance.
Shriver – who split from Schwarzenegger after discovering he had a love child with their maid – is expected to speak at a ceremony on June 26 2011 dedicating a statue in honor of her mother, Eunice Kennedy Shriver, next to the Olympic stadium.
