Looking tired and emotional, the 55-year-old former Dateline NBC anchor candidly admitted to being ‘in transition’ and discussed how ‘so stressful not knowing what you are doing next.’ She appears helpless when asking viewers: “How did you find your transition, personal, professional, emotional, spiritual, financial, how did you get through it?’
Over the past months, in addition to a crumbling marriage and Schwarzenegger’s return to showbiz, Shriver has suffered through the deaths of both her parents, philanthropists Sargent and Eunice Shriver and her U.S. Senator uncle Ted Kennedy.
