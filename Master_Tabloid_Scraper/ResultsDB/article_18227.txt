Niemi isn’t the only celebrity on the panel, as she will join Elizabeth Edwards and Susan St. James, both mothers who had to bury their children after horrific accidents; California First Lady and Women’s Conference host Maria Shriver, whose mother Eunice and uncle Ted Kennedy died this summer, will act as the moderator.
