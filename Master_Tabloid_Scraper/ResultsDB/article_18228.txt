 Don't Dial & Drive! Arnold Warns Maria Shriver: "There's Going To Be Swift Action".../n
Busted!
California’s First Lady, journalist Maria Shriver, has been photographed once again talking on her cell phone while driving — a clear violation of California law.
Shriver was snapped Tuesday in the posh Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles, near the family’s home. When she noticed the photographer, she promptly put the phone down.

After the images hit the internet, Shriver’s (no doubt embarrassed) husband, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, posted this message on his Twitter page: “Thanks for bringing her violations to my attention… There’s going to be swift action.”
Schwarzenegger’s spokesman Aaron McLear says that by “swift action,” the governor means he’ll ask his wife not to hold the phone while driving.

The state ban on handheld cell phone use while driving went into effect July 1, 2008. It carries a fine of $20 on the first conviction and $50 on the second, not including penalties.
