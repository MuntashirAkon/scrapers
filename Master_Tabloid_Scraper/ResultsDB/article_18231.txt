Did Cristiano Ronaldo Spend Christmas In Miami So He Could Expand His Family? Deets HERE!/n

Well this is inneresting.
It turns out that Cristiano Ronaldo spent Christmas away from his son, Cristiano Jr., this year. The athlete traveled to Miami and he put his mother, Dolores, in charge of his little one while they remained in Portugal.
And now, rumors are beginning to circulate as to why the famous father didn't spend the holiday with his five-year-old.

On Wednesday, on-air presenter Eunice Cristina Morais de Carvalho — AKA Maya — revealed to the Portuguese station CMTV that the distance between the soccer star and his tiny tot was highly unusual, saying:

"Only a very strong reason led Cristiano Ronaldo to spend Christmas away from Cristianinho. Last Christmas he wasn't with his mum or his brother or sisters because he spent it with Irina [Shayk] and Irina's mum and sister but Cristianinho was with him."

Hmmmmm.
It does seem strange that the Real Madrid player would leave his son with back in Portugal with the boy's grandmother, considering he brought his child along last year to hang with his now-ex and her family.
But, Maya believes the 30-year-old went to Florida this year to expand his family, adding: 

"This year he spent Christmas alone in Miami. Doesn't Miami ring bells with anyone? Where's Cristianinho from? Cristianinho comes from Miami as everyone knows. Cristiano has repeatedly said he wants another child. Cristiano went to Miami to make arrangements for that second child."

In a recent interview, the proud poppa admitted that he wants to eventually have "fix or six" children in his brood.
Rumor has it that Cristiano Ronaldo Jr. was born through a surrogate, so Maya thinks his dad might be making a similar arrangement to provide his son with a sibling.
But what do U think, Perezcious readers?
