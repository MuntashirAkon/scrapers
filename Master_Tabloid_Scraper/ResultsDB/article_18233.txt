This is what spooky dreams are made of!!
American Horror Story creator Ryan Murphy admitted via Twitter in August that he wanted Neil Patrick Harris on last season's Coven, but his schedule didn't permit…
So now, we're thrilled to share that sources have revealed Neil will be bringing his scary talents to the hit FX series THIS SEASON — and better yet, his adorable husband David Burtka will be there, too!

Neil is set to appear in Freak Show's final two episodes as a  shifty salesman, while David's sexy finale storyline will involve Jessica Lange's character. YAS!
But that's not the only casting news… Lily Rabe has also been tapped to reprise her role as Sister Mary Eunice from Asylum!
We're so happy Ryan could nail down NPH, especially since he's hosting the Oscars and just penned a variety show with NBC.
Here's hoping for a three-way scene between Dandy, Twisty and Neil! Could you imagine the gore?!
