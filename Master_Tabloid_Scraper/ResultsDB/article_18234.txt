8 Months Old & Already 44 POUNDS?? Look At How Big This Baby Is!/n

8-month-old Santiago is tipping the scales and turning some very concerned heads!
He’s not even a year old yet and he already weighs 44 pounds!
That’s WAY over the healthy weight that he should be, with pediatricians recommending that he needs to somehow get down to 17 pounds!
The Colombian child is now being put on a special  diet of fruits and veggies.
His mother Eunice finally brought Santiago to the doctor’s because she was so concerned about the condition of her son. Folds of fat were hindering his ability to even move!
Eunice admitted:
"I’m worried about his obesity.  I don’t want him to continue like this so, God willing, the treatment they’re going to give him for his heart will work to reduce his weight.”
It is unclear what condition Santiago’s heart is in, but with that much extra stress on his small frame, it CAN’T be good!
Hopefully this big little guy can slim down!
We ALSO hope that his mama will stick to his new strict diet! An 8-month-old doesn’t feed himself!  
You hold the key to getting him healthy again!
Good luck, Santiago!
