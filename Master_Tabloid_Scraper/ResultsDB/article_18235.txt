Angelina Jolie Is NOT A Fan Of Yoga! So Why Does She Keep Doing It??/n

Angelina Jolie is no stranger to living a healthy lifestyle, and the proof is pretty much in the pudding! However, the stunning actress recently admitted that there's one exercise she can't STAND fitting into her routine.
YOGA!!
That's right! Angie revealed that she simply doesn't have the same patience as some other yoga-loving celebs out there, however, she's been finding herself doing a lot of downward dog lately!!
So why would she do a workout she obviously doesn't enjoy?? To help her fly in Maleficent, of course! She dishes:
"It's not something I do easily, because I'm not a still person. But I was forced to do yoga because [to fly] you have to have your core strength to be able to hold yourself."
Angelina says her close friend and stunt coordinator Eunice Huthart recommended she take up yoga, and while it might not be her favorite thing in the world, she says it's definitely worth the results! She goes on to say:
"I feel like the luckiest girl in the world that I get to fly. I really feel like I'm flying!"
See, Angie!! Yoga definitely has it's perks!!
Namaste, girl!!
