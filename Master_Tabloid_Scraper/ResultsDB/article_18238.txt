Matt Bomer is coming to American Horror Story: Freak Show.
Bomer will appear on the “Pink Cupcakes” episode of the FX anthology series, airing November 5, and courtesy of Out Magazine, we’ve got the first look at Matt on the show.

Matt will share the screen with Michael Chiklis, who plays the show’s resident strong man, and Dandy Motts, portrayed by the series’ breakout star Finn Wittrock.
“[He’s in] maybe one of the most disturbing things we’ve ever done and a true horror scene,” creator Ryan Murphy revealed.
Like most American Horror Story guest starring roles, there is no real information as to what sort of character Matt will be playing, but given the life expectancy of most guest stars on the show, his character on the episode may not even make it through the whole episode.
Bomer has previously appeared on Ryan Murphy’s Glee and The New Normal in addition to his Emmy Award-nominated turn in this summer’s HBO adaptation of Larry Kramer’s The Normal Heart.
Yesterday, it was officially confirmed that Neil Patrick Harris and David Burtka will also be appearing in the final episodes of the season, as well as frequent American Horror Story actress Lily Rabe, who will be reprising her Season 2 Asylum role of Sister Mary Eunice.
