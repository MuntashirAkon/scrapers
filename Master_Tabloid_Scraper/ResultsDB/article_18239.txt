Angelina Jolie’s ‘Maleficent’ Poster Will Give Kids Nightmares/n
This is a movie for kids, right? Disney just released the poster for Angelina Jolie’s new fantasy thriller Maleficent and Ms. Jolie certainly makes for an intimidating villain.
The film, slated for a May 2014 release, tells the story of Maleficent who begins her life as a “pure-hearted” young woman but her heart is turned to stone when her kingdom is invaded. She seeks revenge, and ultimately curses the infant daughter of the invading King’s successor. Aurora, the aforementioned cursed daughter is played by Elle Fanning, although Angelina’s own daughter Vivienne Jolie-Pitt makes an appearance as the young Aurora as well.
In other Angie-related news, her stunt double had her phone hacked, Reuters reports. A Rupert Murdock-owned tabloid reportedly hired a private eye to tap Eunice Huthart’s phone in 2005 and 2006, in order to get information on Angelina’s relationship with Brad Pitt.
