Eunice Kennedy Shriver Suffers Stroke/n
Eunice Kennedy Shriver, the sister of President John F. Kennedy and mother of Maria Shriver and mother-in-law of California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, has been hospitalized at the UCLA Medical Center after suffering a minor stroke, the hospital announced.   
“Doctors anticipate a short hospital stay,” UCLA Medical Center said in a statement. Shriver, 84, was admitted to the facility on Saturday, and also is being treated for a stress fracture of the left hip, reports Reuters. No further details were provided.   
Shriver is the wife of Sargent Shriver, the first director of the U.S. Peace Corps (during the 1961-63 JFK administration), and the sister of Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy.   
In a tribute to developmentally disabled sister Rosemary Kennedy, Shriver founded the Special Olympics, which seeks to empower people with intellectual disabilities to develop their skills through sports training and competition. More than 1.3 million children and adults with intellectual disabilities participate in Special Olympics in 150 countries globally, according to the group’s Web site.
