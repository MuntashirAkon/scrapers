Neil Patrick Harris has joined the Freak Show, the American Horror Story: Freak Show that is. Sources confirm to E! News that Harris and his husband David Burtka will appear at the tail end of the FX hit's current season.And that isn't the only casting news AHS fans should get excited about as Lily Rabe is set to reprise the role of  Sister Mary Eunice, from season two (aka Asylum), E! News has confirmed, with EW.com first reporting her return. Sister Eunice will reportedly appear in episode 10.Rabe is just the second actor to reprise a role from a previous installment: Naomi Grossman returned as her Asylum character Pepper, with Sister Eunice's crossover factoring into her storyline and how she ended up at Briarcliff Manor, the mental institution that served as season two's setting.Harris, who will be hosting the Oscars this year and just signed on to host a variety show at NBC, will play a salesman in the final two episodes of the year. Burtka will appear in the finale and tangle with Jessica Lange's Elsa Mars.

The How I Met Your Mother star made his American Horror Story dreams known over the summer."I wrote a letter to Ryan asking if I can be in it, even though I wasn't even available to be in it…I just love those series and Coven was fantastic…to do one that involves any kind of freak, circus nonsense is going to be so unsettling to watch," Harris said in July. "Can't wait!"Co-creator Ryan Murphy responded on Twitter and said Harris can come on down to New Orleans. This was in July. In early October Murphy told reporters he was close to nailing down the very busy Harris."I spoke to Neil a week ago," Murphy said. "He was fresh off his wedding. Obviously we have worked together before, I'm working on something and hopefully we will talk net week. He's game. He had very specific ideas of what he wanted to do, and I had very specific ideas, so we're melding them. He's awesome, one of our great entertainers, and I would love to see him and Jessica Lange go at it in some intriguing way. Because of his schedule, something we're thinking about, maybe one episode and then another one later on."TVLine first reported Harris' casting.Other guest stars this season include Patti LaBelle, Matt Bomer, Wes Bentley and Celia Weston.American Horror Story: Freak Show airs Wednesdays, 10 p.m. on FX.(Originally published Oct. 29, 2014, at 2:06 p.m. PT)
