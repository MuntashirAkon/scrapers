The Two Convicted Murderers Who Escaped Jail Both Slept With The Prison Worker Who Helped Them Break Out!/n

There's as many twists and turns in this story as there are in the pipes they snuck out of!
It's been ten days since convicted murderers Richard Matt and David Sweat escaped Clinton Correctional Facility in Dannemora, New York thanks to their Shawshank Redemption-inspired breakout, and yet new pieces of the puzzle are still emerging.
That's because news broke on Sunday that the pair of escapees both had sexual relations with the female prison worker who helped them escape â€” and she was allegedly even in love with one of them.

You see Joyce "Tillie" Mitchell, 51, first started hooking up with David in the facility's sewing shop before authorities were tipped off to the relationship.
That's when Tillie turned her sights to Richard, and sources are saying that she even fell in love with the felon! 
In fact, had Tillie shown up to the rendezvous point following the escape from the manhole, it's being reported that the murderers were going to kill her husband, fellow prison worker Lyle Mitchell! Scary!

In addition to all of the above, Tillie also admitted to authorities that it was she who gave the adjoining cellmates the power tools to cut their way to freedom.
Richard and David are still on the loose, so if you're anywhere near upstate New York, please stay safe!
