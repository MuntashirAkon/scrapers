Dog Stays by Trapped Friend's Side for a Week Until They Are Rescued /n
Man’s best friend is just as loyal to their canine companions. 
A setter named Tillie stayed beside her trapped best friend, Phoebe the Basset hound, for an entire week until both the animals were found by rescuers, reports WZZM 13. 
Just over a week ago, Washington’s Vashon Island Pet Protectors reported that the pets were missing, posting photos to Facebook in hopes a local would spot the dogs. VIPP also sent out volunteers to search for Tillie and Phoebe, but the helpers were having no luck. Then, on Monday, the animal rescue organization received a call from a Vashon Island resident, who said that for several days a dog who looked like Tillie had been approaching them on their property and then quickly turning back toward a ravine behind the house. 
VIPP sent out volunteers to the area to search the ravine, concerned the tip would lead to another dead end. After several minutes of looking and calling Tillie’s name, the group heard a responsive “woof.” Moments later, the volunteers found Tillie lying beside an old cistern, her head peeking over the edge. 
“They knew that meant Phoebe was inside the cistern, and every breath was held and every doggy prayer offered that the peek over the rim would somehow find her safe,” VIPP Amy Carey told WZZM 13. “And it was a time we have a happy ending with dear Phoebe found perched on some concrete rubble that held her out of the water.”
“For nearly a week, Tillie stayed by her side with the exception of the few minutes of each day when she went for help.”
