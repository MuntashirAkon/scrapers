In 2008, Beyonce founded Parkwood Entertainment. That same year, she married Jay Z — who, as the world knows, is the mastermind behind Roc Nation — so she put her own projects on hold as the two started a family.
Now, she is ready to press the play button on the paused endeavor!
“She really wants to turn Parkwood into an empire now,” the source told Radar.
Late last year, when things began to turn sour for the billionaire couple, Queen Bey singed multiple artists with million-dollar contracts. Just last week, she took it to the next level with a big L.A. Concert for her protégé, Sophie Beem.

Jay Z was on hand for the event at Hollywood’s Fonda theater, but he didn’t look happy.
The source told Radar, “There is a lot of jealousy right now between Beyonce and Jay Z because her career is at a super high point and, unfortunately, Jay Z has been relatively stagnant in his own career in comparison.”
In 2014, Beyonce said, “I felt like I wanted to follow the footsteps of Madonna and be a powerhouse and have my own empire, and show other women when you get to this point in your career you don’t have to go sign with someone else and share your money and your success — you do it yourself.” /n
