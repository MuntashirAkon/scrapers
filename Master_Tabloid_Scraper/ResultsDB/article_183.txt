UPDATE: Eve says in a statement from her rep, "I deeply apologize for offending anyone. I support equal rights and equal dignity for all. I have deep compassion and support for Bruce Jenner. My intention was not to offend. My intention was simply to express that, with the overdue and welcome acceptance of us all living on a gender spectrum, we must encourage equality for all."________Alice Eve has landed herself in hot water after making comments about Bruce Jenner's transition announcement on her Instagram.According to the BBC, the 33-year-old Star Trek actress posted then deleted controversial thoughts on Jenner and the larger issue of gender inequality (At this time, Bruce Jenner has not chosen to publicly identify as a woman and so E! News will continue to refer to him as Bruce and use male pronouns, until he indicates otherwise.)."If you were a woman no one would have heard of you because women can't compete in the decathlon," the Brit star allegedly wrote in reference to Jenner's Olympian past. "You would be a frustrated young athlete who wasn't given a chance. Until women are paid the same as men, then playing at being a â€˜woman' while retaining the benefits of being a man is unfair."
