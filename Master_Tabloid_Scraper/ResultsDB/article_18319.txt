Sophie Tuner is hitting back after she was accused of using the N-word in an Instagram video.

While hanging out with boyfriend Joe Jonas at the gym on Monday (May 8, 2017), the Game of Thrones star was filmed appearing to say, “What’s up, my n****?” The clip, which was shared by fitness guru Brendan Fallis, also showed Jonas and Turner giggling as they prepared for her workout.

When critics quickly took to social media to blast the actress for allegedly saying the N-word, Turner released a statement to explain herself. According to her, many people misheard her and assumed she had used a racial slur.
“I used the word ‘motherf*ckers’ in a recent video posted in an Instagram story and not a hateful racial slur that has been suggested,” she said. “I am incredibly upset that anyone would think otherwise, and I want to make it clear that I would never use such an abhorrent word.”
