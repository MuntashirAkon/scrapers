Ariel Winter is ready for music festival season!

The Modern Family star started off with a bang by hitting up the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in Indio, Calif., this weekend. Debuting her new neon pink hair, the 19-year-old was spotted rocking a classic festival staple — fringed bikini — as she partied at Bootsy Bellows’ annual Coachella celebrations presented by Chevrolet and PacSun.
Clad in a chevron-patterned two-piece, Winter happily channeled her inner car model as she posed for photos by the new all-electric Chevrolet Bolt EV at outdoor bash. After snapping a few pictures, she made her way back to her poolside cabana to hang out with boyfriend Levi Meaden.
A partygoer told us Winter couldn’t keep her hands off the actor, sitting on his lap right before Lil Yachty took the stage for a private performance. “She was practically glued to him,” the insider dished. “They were being very cute together.”
Other attendees at the star-studded affair included Kendall Jenner and rumored beau Jordan Clarkson, Joe Jonas and girlfriend Sophie Turner, Katy Perry and alleged fling Ryan Phillippe, Sofia Richie, Hailey Baldwin, Jamie Chung, and Odell Beckham Jr.
