Joe Jonas is oiled up like a glazed carrot in his campaign with Baywatch’s Charlotte McKinney for Guess underwear.

Jonas and McKinney pose in Guess undergarments that have the brand’s ’90s logo embroidered on their bands. “It feels great to be chosen by Paul Marciano as the male global ambassador for the new Guess Underwear campaign with a focus on the Guess man,” Jonas said in a statement. “I am excited to be part of this amazing experience and to be able to represent the brand’s image.”
In the short series of photos that were taken by Yu Tsai, Jonas shows off his body in a handful of ways…
