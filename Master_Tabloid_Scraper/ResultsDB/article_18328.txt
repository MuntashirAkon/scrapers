Warning! Spoilers ahead!
Sansa Stark may have escaped her marriage to the vindictive and merciless Ramsay Bolton and reclaimed Winterfell with Jon Snow, but according to Sophie Turner, her troubles are far from over. The 20-year-old actress recently opened up about what viewers can expect from Ned Stark’s eldest daughter when Game of Thrones returns.

“She’s seemingly in control for the first time – and it really suits her,” Turner told Entertainment Weekly. “She’s kind of having a bit of a power trip. But she’s also becoming more insecure, because there are threats to the power that she holds.”

Is Snow one of those threats? The power struggle between the one-time siblings certainly felt like an issue on the horizon when Season 6 wrapped up. Also, that “seemingly” is difficult to ignore. Could she be a figurehead, taking direction from someone else when ruling the North?
Turner also teased that, with just two short seasons to go, the show aims to end things on a high note, and they’ve upped the ante to make sure viewers enjoy the sendoff.
“What overall excites me about this season is that main characters are coming together and it feels like things are ramping up,” she said. “It’s really exciting and all feels like it’s coming to a big conclusion.”
Game of Thrones will reportedly return summer 2017 on HBO.
