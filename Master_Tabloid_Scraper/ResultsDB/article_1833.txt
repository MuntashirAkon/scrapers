Amy Schumer has a few things to say about the woman who may replace her in Sony’s upcoming live-action Barbie movie.

Amid word that Anne Hathaway is in talks for the role after the Trainwreck star dropped out of the project, the 36-year-old took to her Instagram to express her feelings about the casting news. In true Schumer fashion, the comedian made a joke about it.
“Hathaway smathaway jkjk she’s perfect!!” she wrote alongside a selfie. “Can’t wait to see it!”

Variety reported this week Hathaway, 34, is in negotiations to step into Barbie’s heels. The publication also claimed Australian director Alethea Jones is in talks to helm the comedy, though studio reps say no deal is in place yet.
As reported, Schumer — who was cast as the iconic doll in 2016 — left the production earlier this year because she was working on other projects. “Sadly, I’m no longer able to commit to Barbie due to scheduling conflicts,” she said in a statement at the time. “The film has so much promise, and Sony and Mattel have been great partners. I’m bummed, but look forward to seeing Barbie on the big screen.”
Still slated for a June 29, 2018 release date, the adaptation will be a fish-out-of-water tale in which Barbie is cast out of Barbieland because she’s not perfect enough. While struggling through the real world, the famous character discovers that true beauty comes from within.
