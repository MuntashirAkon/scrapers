Game of Thrones Season 7 Finale: What's Going to Happen Between Arya and Sansa Stark? HBO Petyr "Littlefinger" Baelish Claim to Throne: Not legitimate. His only power comes from marrying Lysa Arryn, killing her, and now controlling her house and her .../n
If Jon Snow's (Kit Harington) line from the Game of Thrones season finale promo—the only line in the darned thing—doesn't leave you shook we need to talk."There's only one war that matters. And it is here," he says to Cersei Lannister (Lena Headey). Everybody's coming face-to-face this season and it's truly wonderful and terrifying.In the trailer, which you can see below, viewers only get a little glimpse of Sansa Stark (Sophie Turner) at Winterfell, but something is definitely going to go down between her and sister Arya Stark (Maisie Williams).

"In the books, it says something about how Arya and Sansa are different sides of the same coin. They love each other but they're so different. They never really got along. And now that they're back together that's heightened because they've gone down totally different paths and have had to adapt to totally different situations to the point where they don't see on each other's level," Turner told EW. "They don't really talk about what they've gone through. They never really had that communication before, and now when it's vital to do they don't have that and can't understand each other. Arya still sees Sansa as a snooty prissy child that she was before she left for King's Landing. There's a big lack of communication. There's this underlying tension. It's like a f--king horror movie."Who will take the Iron Throne? We broke it down.

Game of Thrones airs Sundays, 9 p.m. on HBO.
