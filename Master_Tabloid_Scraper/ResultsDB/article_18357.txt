Sansa And Tyrion -- Game of Tongue/nSophie Turner -- aka Sansa Stark from  "Game of Thrones " -- has still got a thing for ex-hubby Tyrion Lannister, or maybe even Peter Dinklage. Sophie was at a 'GOT' party at Comic-Con when she saw some random dude in a Tyrion mask ... a very good one we might add. The spirit moved her to straddling the guy and sticking her tongue down his mask. A big victory for cosplay nerds EVERYWHERE. Â /n
