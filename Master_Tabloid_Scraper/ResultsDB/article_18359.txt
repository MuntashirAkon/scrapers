Gene Simmons to Kids: Get Out of My House/nWho wants to be the children of Gene Simmons?Â  The answer is absolutely everyone, because when Gene gets sick of his kids freeloading at home, he gets them out by buying them their own crib. Gene's wife Shannon has been house hunting -- checking out this nice $2 million fixer-upper in Sherman Oaks (below) Sunday.Apparently the digs aren't suitable for 24-year-old Nick and 20-year-old Sophie ... so the search continues.BTW, as for why the 3,800-sq.-ft. house wasn't right ... the yard just wasn't big enough for their dogs./n
