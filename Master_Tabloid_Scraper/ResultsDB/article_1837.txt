Jada Pinkett Smith may be happily married with Will Smith, but she wishes they could be something more.

While appearing on Watch What Happens Live this week, the 45-year-old Girls Trip star addressed a longstanding rumor that she has an open relationship with her husband. When asked about the most outrageous gossip she’s heard about herself, Jada replied, “That Will and I are swingers. That’s the craziest one. It’s constant.”
“And I’m like yo, I wish!” she added, laughing. “I wish!”
According to the mother-of-two, who has been married to the actor for 23 years, there isn’t really a secret to a long marriage.
“I really think that Will and I just have amazing chemistry on a lot of different levels,” she explained. “We love to laugh together, we love to learn together, and we just love each other. We just have a good time together.”





“Yeah, I guess that’s the secret,” she continued. “Yeah, we just really like each other!”
Jada first met Will, 48, in 1994 when she auditioned to be the actor’s girlfriend on The Fresh Prince Of Bel Air. They started dating the following year and got married 1997.
The couple share two children: 19-year-old Jaden and 16-year-old Willow. Jada is also stepmother to Will’s 24-year-old son, Trey Smith, from his previous marriage to Sheree Zampino.
