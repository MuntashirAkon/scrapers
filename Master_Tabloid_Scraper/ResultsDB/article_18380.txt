Melissa Rycroft is Engaged! Inside Her Impromptu Engagement Party/n
She may have had some bad luck the first time around but Melissa Rycroft is ready for her second attempt at long-lasting love. The Dancing With the Stars alum celebrated her recent engagement to boyfriend Tye Strickland with an impromptu celebration at a local Dallas restaurant, RadarOnline.com has learned. 
At Celia’s restaurant, a place the former Dallas Cowboys cheerleader had frequented before, a group of about 20 helped the couple celebrate their news. 
“A couple of their friends walked in before them,” an onlooker at Celia’s confirmed. “They said their friends had just gotten engaged and asked if there was any room for their party.”
After “a few tables were pushed together” and a bottle of champagne was brought out the festivities began. The affair lacked the usual pomp and circumstance of the typical engagement party but was filled with all the expected joy and celebration.
“They all just showed up, it was really last-minute and casual. They were all about the same age so it seemed like it was just them and their friends.”
“They looked like they were having a lot of fun and stayed until closing at 2 a.m.,” the onlooker added. /n
