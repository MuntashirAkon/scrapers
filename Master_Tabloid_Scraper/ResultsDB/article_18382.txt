TV: Monday Hot List/n
It’s a big night for Showtime with the return of their hit series, Weeds and a first look at their highly anticipated black comedy, Nurse Jackie!
On the opener of Weeds, life is still bizarre for mom turned Hemptress, Nancy, as she ponders her fate and her relationship with Mexican crime boss Esteban. Meanwhile, Celia’s daughter discovers holding her mother hostage isn’t a very fruitful plan as no one seems to care (and they’re definitely not putting up any green to get her back!) And Andy, Doug and Silas get baked and contemplate a partnership in the cannabizness! Just say no people!
Oh Carmela, how we’ve missed you!  Edie Falco returns to cable tonight as a veteran NY City nurse on the series premiere of Nurse Jackie. As the perpetually sour-faced and cynical Jackie juggles patients and coiworkers, her own whacked out issues begin to bubble up… including an addiction to painkillers!
And gays rejoice! Your diva is back and ready for more OMG filled action! On the season premiere of Kathy Griffin: My Life On the D-List, Kathy’s latest efforts to get off the D-List include trying to bribe the Grammy folks into giving her a statuette; and a road trip to Vegas to meet Bette Midler lands her a cameo in Bette’s Vegas stage show! Fortunately for us that means two divas onstage! Unfortunately for Kathy, that also means choreography. So here’s your warning, it’s not a pretty sight!
Notable mentions… Mos Def kicks it on Letterman, and David Duchovny and Anna Friel visit the Tonight Show.
