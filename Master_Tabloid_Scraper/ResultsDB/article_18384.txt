Man Mowing His Lawn During Tornado Is The Definition Of Zero Fucks Given!!!/n

This guy is either the bravest man in Alberta or a lunatic about lawn maintenance. Possibly both.
Over the weekend, Cecelia Wessels posted the crazy pic of hubby Theunis carrying on with his chores while an apocalyptic tornado loomed to Facebook with the caption:

"My beast mowing the lawn with a breeze in his hair"
Ha! Cecelia told the CBC she only took the photo to show the awesome weather phenomenon to her family in South Africa and was surprised by everyone's reaction to the fact her husband was still mowing.

According to reports, no one was hurt by the massive tornado, which passed by the Wessels' small town of Three Hills, Alberta. Theunis himself explained:

"It looks much closer if you look in the photo, but it was really far away. Well, not really far, far away, but it was far away from us.
I was keeping an eye on it."
Yep. Lunatic. Ha!
