Calling all Orange Is the New Black fans!
Selenis Leyva and Diane Guerrero (affectionately known as Gloria and Maritza on OITNB, respectively) spill about their dream roles in Hollywood, social media, and the upcoming season in this new exclusive interview, and it’s just getting us all the more excited for the premiere of Season 3 on June 12th.

Celebuzz caught up with Guerrero and Leyva exclusively in NYC on March 25th at Procter & Gamble Orgullosa’s “Nueva Latinas Living Fabulosa”, an event celebrating “the beauty and diversity of Nueva Latinas through a forum recognizing Latina trendsetters and their stories of confidence, strength and success.”

On her dream Hollywood role, Guerrero told us:
My dream role would be, I would say just playing a bad-ass chick. Somebody who saves the world. I want to save the world! You know, and I want to do my job well…I think that my dream role would just be a really bad-ass character.
And we can’t help but agree that the 28-year-old beauty would be perfect saving the world on the big screen.
When it comes to Season 3 of OITNB, Guerrero is just like and us and super excited.
Oh my god, I can’t frickin’ wait. I really can’t wait. I’m in love with those women. I love the stories. Jenji Kohan is just so fabulous and I can’t wait for the world to see this next season. I think it’s going to be very special.



With my lovely @selenisleyvaofficial and the beautiful #AngieMartinez such empowering stories. thank you @orgullosa #livingfabulosa

As for Leyva’s dream role?

Oh my goodness, my total dream role is if they ever did the story of [legendary Cuban-American “Queen of Salsa”] Celia Cruz on film, I would love to do that. I got to play Celia Cruz on stage, so I would love to play her on the big screen.

When it comes to social media and interacting with her fans, Leyva, 42, totally owns it. However, she said honestly that social media can be a little too demanding at times, explaining:

I’m a little tired! But I get to interact so much with my fans of the show and stuff like that, that part is wonderful. I think it’s become a little bit much, you know I think it’s disturbing for me to be told I have to up my numbers and I have to join because that’s what everyone’s doing. I’m just an actress, I’m like, ‘I’m just an actress, leave me alone’! But the plus side of that is you do get to hear from fans and I love that interaction.

These two ladies stun whether they’re in their orange prison uniforms or on the red carpet. Check out the gallery above to see their red carpet arrivals, as well as celebs like Gina Rodriguez (who we spoke to about her potential upcoming role in Deepwater Horizon co-starring Mark Wahlberg), “The Voice of New York” Angie Martinez, style expert and TV personality Lilliana Vazquez, and Entertainment Weekly correspondent Nina Terrero. Our calendars are already cleared all day on Friday, June 12th so we can binge-watch Orange Is the New Black on Netflix; are yours?! But until then, we seriously just cannot wait. 

Thank you @Orgullosa for an evening to remember #LivingFabulosa !!! — Selenis Leyva (@selenis_leyva) March 26, 2015
