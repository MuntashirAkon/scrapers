I’ll Have a Slice of the Kim Kardashian With Extra Kheese, Please/n
Domenico Crolla, creator of this Kim Kardashian pizza and loads of other celebrity pizzas, thank you. Thank you for combining my two biggest obsessions: eating and cheeses cut in the shape of human faces. And another thank you to today’s caption contest winners, for your captions made me giggle. Shall I share them as one shares a pizza with good friends? Yes, yes I shall.

“Cheesus, I said I’m with Yezzus.” – Kristal
“FOOD PORN!!!” – Eva
“Pepperoni for the paparazzi” – Rosalya
“Kim finally found a way everyone will love her just as much as she loves herself…as pizza” – Celia
“I hope ‘Vogue’ doesn’t think this is too “cheesy”!!” – Sheridan
“You want a piece of me?” – Tanisha
Congrats to our winners! Visit our Facebook Page for a new Caption Contest each and every weekday. It’s never too late to add a caption, so do so in the comments!
