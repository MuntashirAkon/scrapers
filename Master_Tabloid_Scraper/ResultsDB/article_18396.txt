 He’s not mentioned by name, but Jennifer Esposito has some harsh words about her ex-husband Bradley Cooper. The Samantha Who star has just released a memoir, Jennifer’s Way, and in it, she speaks of a former flame who left the actress “very sad and … very alone.”
Esposito, 41, who was briefly married to the American Hustle actor from 2006-2007, writes in her autobiography that this particular romantic interest was “funny, smart, cocky, arrogant and a master manipulator, but he had a “mean, cold side” and “his personality could flip on a dime.”
While most of the book centers around Esposito’s struggle with Celiac disease, which caused her to lose teeth, suffer panic attacks, horrific stomach cramps and unsightly rashes, the former Blue Bloods actress does mention how this failed relationship was an all-time low in her life. She describes how, after attending a seminar at the Agape International Spiritual Center in Los Angeles, “my relationship hit an all-time low, and within a week it was over. Abruptly, rudely, and with the exact callousness that I’d come to expect from him.” Ouch.
Cooper, currently getting buff for his next film project, American Sniper, has rarely spoken of the relationship with Jennifer but when pressed by Howard Stern back in 2011, he would only say, “It was just something that happened. The good thing, we both realized it. … Sometimes you just realize it. It just wasn’t right.”
Esposito is now engaged to Kate Winslet’s ex Louis Dowler. The two co-own a NYC bakery, Jennifer’s Way, which specializes in gluten-free breads, cookies and muffins.
