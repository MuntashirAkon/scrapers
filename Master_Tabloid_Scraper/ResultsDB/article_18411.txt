Fans Bid Goodbye to Celia/n
    It was a funeral fit for a queen--the Queen of Salsa.        Braving a torrential downpour, thousands of loyal fans clogged the rain-soaked streets of Manhattan Tuesday to bid a final farewell to Celia Cruz, whose funeral service was held at St. Patrick's Cathedral.        The bronze casket of the Cuban-born music icon was taken via horse-drawn carriage to the chapel in a procession down Fifth Avenue, where umbrella-wielding mourners had thronged behind police barricades.        Cruz passed away last Wednesday at her home in New Jersey from complications of brain cancer. She was 77.        Twin white horses pulled the carriage which was met at St. Patricks' by an honor guard of New York police. The coffin, engulfed by flowers, was borne into the cathedral, whose pews were packed by fans and the famous, including New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Antonio Banderas and wife Melanie Griffith, singer-actor Ruben Blades, Latin music stalwarts Jon Secada, Victor Manuelle, and Johnny Pacheco and R&B; star Patti LaBelle, who sang "Ave Maria."        "From heaven, you will continue to be sugar," auxiliary Bishop Josu Iriondo, told the audience in Spanish, a reference to "Azucar" ("Sugar"), the trademark expression Cruz used to open her flamboyant shows. "Like good sugar, you will live melted in the coffee of your people."        A private burial followed in the 140-year-old Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, the resting place of jazz notables Miles Davis and Duke Ellinton.        On Monday, a crowd estimated between 70,000 and 140,000 turned up to view Cruz, who lay in an open coffin draped with the Cuban flag at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Home on the Upper East Side, which has sent off John Lennon, Judy Garland and Jacqueline Kenney Onassis. Cruz's body, decked out in a sequined white dress and blond wig, was enveloped by flower arrangements.        And what was a solemn wake turned into a celebration of Cruz's life and music as devotees of the salsa singer--some holding long-stemmed roses and Cuban flags, others carrying pictures, old LPs, tambourines and marracas--chanted "Celia! Celia!" They also sang many of her beloved hits, including "Yo Vivere" ("I Will Live"), and, as the sun began to set, a few hundred fans even formed an impromptu conga line.        Among the mourners who in attendance Monday: New York Governor George Pataki, Senators Charles Schumer and Hillary Clinton, Latin popster Marc Anthony and Cuban composer Paquito D'Rivera.  Cruz's husband of 40-plus years, trumpeter Pedro Knight, was on hand to thank those offering condolences.         It wasn't only New Yorkers who bid farewell to Cruz. Over the weekend, the Havana-born diva's body was flown to Miami, where her fellow Cuban expats turned up for a memorial service and public viewing at the Freedom Tower.        Cruz, who came to the United States in 1960 following the Cuban revolution, recorded more than 70 albums a career spanning over five decades. She won two Grammys, including this year's Best Salsa Album for La Negra Tiene Tumbao, and three Latin Grammys.        During Tuesday's Latin Grammy nomination ceremony, the president of the Latin Recording Academy, Gabriel Abaroa, held a minute of silence in remembrance of Cruz.        "Celia was a great friend of the Grammy, so the event cannot be staged without remembering her and talking about her," Abaroa told the Associated Press.        Organizers of the Latin Grammys are planning a special tribute to Cruz at this year's award ceremonies, scheduled to take place on September 3 in Miami.
