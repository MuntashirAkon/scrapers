Salsa Queen Celia Cruz Dies/n
     Salsa's inimitable queen Celia Cruz, she of the towering vocals and wigs to match, has died of brain cancer, her publicist announced.                    Cruz, who had been in declining health since being diagnosed with a brain tumor late last year, was 77. Her husband of four decades, Pedro Knight, was at her side in their Fort Lee, New Jersey, home when she died Wednesday afternoon.                    Her death comes exactly two weeks after Cuban radio stations in Miami prematurely reported her demise. It was the third time since she underwent brain surgery on December 5 that Spanish-language media in South Florida jumped the gun and rushed news of her passing on air.                    An icon of salsa music and the Cuban expatriate community, Cruz popularized the genre with recordings like "Yerberito Moreno" and "Quimbara" and remained a vital force up to her death, maintaining a schedule that saw her on the road 11 months of the year. "My life is singing," she told reporters in 2002. "I don't plan on retiring. I plan to die on stage."                    Her 2001 album, La Negra Tiene Tumbao, won a Latin Grammy in 2002 for Best Salsa Album, and its hip-hop-flavored title cut became a crossover hit.                    Cruz showed up at the award show in a supersized blue wig and brought down the house with a hip-swiveling performance that rivaled Ricky Martin's finest work.                     Martin was among those publicly mourning her death. "I am deeply saddened by the loss of Celia," he said in a statement Wednesday. "Her music not only touched my soul, but it influenced generations of singers and songwriters. Her vibrant sprit and positive energy can never be duplicated. We will always miss her."                Thalia, meanwhile, called Cruz "a true pioneer in Latin music. All of us following in her footsteps owe a portion of our success to her for paving the way."                Born in poverty in Havana, Cruz grudgingly came to her career, giving up her dream of schoolteaching and turning to music to help put food on the table. As a teen, her cousin talked her into entering a radio contest and she won, launching her star.                    "I really loved to sing," she once told the Miami Herald. "But I also did it because if you won, you would get a cake or a bag with chocolate, condensed milk, ham. We were very poor. All that came in very handy at home."                    In 1950, she joined her trumpet-playing husband in the Afro-Cuban group La Sonora Matancera. Ten years later, the group had come to the United States, and Cruz became a fixture on New York's Latin-jazz scene, often performing and recording with fellow music heavyweight Tito Puente, aka the Mambo King.                    Over the years, Cruz dueted with Latin stalwarts like Johnny Pacheco, Willie Colon, Pete Rodriguez, Ray Barretto and the Fania All Stars, as well as pop and rock artists like Dionne Warwick, Patti LaBelle, David Byrne, Gloria Estefan and Wyclef Jean. She even dueted with Luciano Pavarotti and put her pipes on display at a VH1 Divas tribute to Aretha Franklin.                    Her musical legacy includes a catalog of more than 70 albums, two Grammys and three Latin Grammys. She was awarded the National Medal of the Arts by President Clinton and a lifetime achievement award by the Smithsonian Institution. She picked up an honorary doctorate from Yale and received a star on Hollywood's Walk of Fame. Miami even named a street after her.                    Cruz "brought the world to its dancing feet with her visceral vocals, infectious energy and vibrant smile," the Recording Academy and Latin Recording Academy said in a joint statement Wednesday. "[We] have lost a very dear friend today, but her colorful spirit, uplifting music and inspiring passion will live on forever."                    She also appeared in several films, including The Mambo Kings and The Perez Family.                    Her success was bittersweet, though. Her enmity for Fidel Castro caused her to be persona non grata in Cuba. She was barred from returning to her native land for her mother's funeral, her records were banned (but were widely available on the black market), and her name was expunged from music reference books.                    She is survived by her husband, Pedro Knight. The couple, who marked their 41st wedding anniversary on Monday, never had any children.  Her recently completed album, Regalo Del Alma, is slated for release later this summer.                    Cruz's death comes just days after that of another Cuban music legend, Compay Segundo. Segundo, the cigar-puffing "Chan Chan" singer who attracted international fame as a member of the Buena Vista Social Club, died of kidney failure Sunday in Havana at age 95.
