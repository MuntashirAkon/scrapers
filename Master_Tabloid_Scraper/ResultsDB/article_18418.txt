Angela "Big Ang" Raiola's funeral mass was held Monday at Basilica of Regina Pacis, a Catholic parish church in Brooklyn.Family, friends and many of Ang's Mob Wives' co-stars came out to pay their respects, including Karen Gravano, Drita D'Avanzo, Carla Facciolo and Renee Graziano. A rep for Big Ang tells E! News her casket was walked out of the church by her two best friends, Celia and Lil Jen, followed by Adam Gonzalez (a Mob Wives show producer and good friend to Ang), Jennifer Graziano (the show's creator), Karen, Drita, Carla and Renee. "Ang's sister [Janine Detore] gave an amazing speech," a source tells E! News. "It was very touching."

"Everyone was crying and everyone's heart is broken," says her rep. "While we all know Ang would want us all to be strong, it's so hard."At the conclusion of the mass, white pigeons were released outside the church. Afterwards, there was a luncheon at Angelina's in Tottenville (Staten Island), where disco music was played and Sangria served. Big Ang will be laid to rest at a private burial in Staten Island.The beloved Mob Wives star passed away Thursday at age 55 after a battle with cancer. A statement posted on her Twitter account read: "It is with sad regret that we inform you that at 3:01 a.m. Angela Raiola peacefully ended her battle with cancer, and was called home. She was surrounded by nothing but love from her immediate family, and the closest friends. YOU, (her fans) were some of the most special people in the world, and she loved you immensely. Thank you for your love, prayers, and unconditional support of Angela right to the very end."

Big Ang's Mob Wives cast mates were "brokenhearted" by her death, a source told E! News. "Ang was like a mom and protector to these women. They loved her like a mom."—Reporting by Holly Passalaqua and Beth Sobol
