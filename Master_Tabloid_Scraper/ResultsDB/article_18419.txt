Between the CFDA Fashion Awards, the CMT Awards and all the red carpets nestled in between, this was a major week for celebrity fashion.We begin with the reigning queen of all things glamorous: Blake Lively. The L'Oreal Paris spokesmodel can do no wrong as of late, particularly in this 60s-inspired sequined Michael Kors mini with a scalloped hemline at the 2014 CFDAs. And speaking of blond bombshells, who could not love Carrie Underwood in a flowing printed Roberto Cavalli dress at the CMT Awards? It's unlike anything we've seen the country princess wear before, but we welcome the change. Also at the awards show was Carrie's gal-pal Miranda Lambert looking better than ever in an embellished Celia Kritharioti cap-sleeved mini with a deep V-neck.

But back to the CFDAs for a second because we forgot to mention Solange Knowles' stunning silver Calvin Klein Collection gown paired with a bright pink lip. And finally we'll top off our best-dressed list with the bright spot of our weekâ€”Shailene Woodley in a highlighter Ralph Lauren peplum creation. There's sophistication in the cut of the gown with a youthful flare in the eye-catching hue, making for one of the actress' best looks to date.Which look was your favorite? Vote in the poll below!
