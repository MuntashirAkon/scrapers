It's been almost a year since Kim Kardashian and Kanye West welcomed daughter North West into the world on June 15, 2013. And in that time there's been lots of changes (the couple got engaged for one thing!) including the E! Stars wardrobe.In the last 10 months the 33-year-old has debuted her new mommy style, which consists of a lot more black, white and muted hues than ever before.That's not to say she doesn't still enjoy the occasion brights. Pink seems to still be a favorite of the star, who has a Dior dress, Celine coat and a Kardashian Kollection jumpsuit in the girlie shade. She's also wowed us in—not one, but—two red hot dresses by Alexander McQueen and Celia Kritharioti.

Both frocks showed off her post-baby bod in highly complementing ways, which brings us to another theme of Kim's style: If you got it, flaunt it. And, oh yeah, she has and does.  From crop tops to skin-tight pants, Kardashian's brought sexy back in a big way (not that it ever really left).To see all of her looks from the past year, click through the gallery below.
