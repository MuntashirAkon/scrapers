When American Idol contestants get eliminated, their parting interviews always go a little something like this: "I was grateful for the experience. It was just my time to go. I love everyone on the show." This is not the case with departing America's Next Top Model hopefuls, such as last night's eliminee, Fo Porter, who went out fighting mad."Honestly, I don't want to sound too bitchy or catty, but I do think Celia [Ammerman] should've gone home before me, or instead of me, because I can put on a pair of six-inch heels and be tall, [but she] can't change. Age isn't something you can drastically change," Fo tells us. "Yeah, there's makeup of course, but I can put on a pair of heels and be six foot in a matter of seconds. I just felt like I should've stayed." (Celia, by the way, is 25-years-old, while Fo is just 19.)
