You know who you can usually count on to get it right on a red carpet? Miranda Lambert and Carrie Underwood.Once again the blond duo didn't let us down. They are the reason we can't pick one winner from the 2014 CMT Music Awards' red carpet—we love each of their looks equally! How could anyone choose between Carrie's breathtaking floral Roberto Cavalli gown and Miranda's glittery Celia Kritharioti mini? It's not possible. So we're crowning them both.Then, for runner-ups we select the pink ladies: Kellie Pickler, Cassadee Pope and Jana Kramer. OK, technically Kellie's dress is more of a magenta hue, but we still give her and Jana props for opting for such attention-grabbing gowns. As for Cassadee, her Theia crop top and skirt was the perfect combo. 

Now onto the looks that caught our eye for the wrong reasons. Really it was just an unfortunate case of unflattering prints as seen on Kimberly Schlapman, Elizabeth Cook, Kate Walsh, and Hillary Scott.Then there was the fringe-adorned getup with gold boots that Meghan Lindsey tried to pull off, unsuccesfully we might add. And last but certainly not least, was Raelynn's princess-y frock, which, we're sorry but Tinkerbell wore it better.
