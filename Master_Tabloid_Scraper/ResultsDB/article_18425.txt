Kevin Jonas & Wife -- Breaking Up ... With New Jersey Mansion/nKevin Jonas and his wife Danielle are calling it quits ... on their giant New Jersey home -- listing the property for $2.2 million -- and sources tell TMZ, it's all because they want more privacy.KJ and Dani purchased the home in 2011 for $1.19 million -- so if they get anywhere near their asking price (with the help of Terrie O’Connor Realtors Amy Werner and Celia Riggio) they'll have earned a nice little profit. Not bad for just two years.We're told the couple plans to start showing the home to potential buyers next week at a private event -- and they've already purchased property nearby to start building an entirely new place to live.According to sources, it's not about the size of the property -- the couple just feels their current home is too exposed ... it's already famous from their show  "Married to Jonas, " it's visible from the street ... and they're not comfortable with that.  Especially because Danielle is pregnant now.Maybe Kevin and Dani should start a band ... at least they can stay together./n
