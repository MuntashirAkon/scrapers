“He’s driven, precise and over-the-top,” Lifetime says of the tough-as-nails coach. “The team has over 15 national championships under their belt, and with this year’s nationals fast approaching, Sharp will push the ladies to another victory, even if it kills him.”
In Radar’s exclusive clip, when the captain of the dance team breaks down in tears, crying that she’s “mad at herself” and that people will say “she can’t even dance,” Sharp won’t stand for weak leadership.
“I take one look at [her] and I’m thinking ‘Oh s**t, here we go,'” Sharp complains in confessional. “She’s giving the weepy weeperson.”

So Sharp premieres Wednesday, July 26 at 10/9c on Lifetime.
