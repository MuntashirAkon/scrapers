Tell us how you really feel, Adam!Grammy winner Adam Levine was not having any fun watching tonight's 2017 MTV VMAs—so much so that the Maroon 5 frontman took to Twitter today to seriously diss the award show while it was happening.The music man, who accepted the Decade Award at the 2017 Teen Choice Awards earlier in the month, wrote, "It's always exciting to see how utterly horrible the VMAs will be. They really delivered so far this year. #HOLYF-CK."Yikes! But that's not all he wrote...The surly singer also added another not-so favorable tweet aimed at the show after his pal's performance got curtailed. "Julia Michaels gets cut off while she's singing and Lorde gets to NOT sing her whole song," wrote the 38-year-old.

Interestingly enough, Maroon 5 has actually been nominated five times for a VMA, and even won one. However, the band hasn't taken home a Moon Person since the boys won the award for "Artist to Watch" back in 2004. The band comes out with a new album later this year—we wonder if he'll feel the same way at the same time next year!
