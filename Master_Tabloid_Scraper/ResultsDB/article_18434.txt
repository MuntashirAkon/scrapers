Copycat! Megyn Kelly Aiming To Become The Next Oprah/n
Megyn Kelly is trading her hard-hitting TV persona for a more charitable career path — just like Oprah Winfrey!
According to Page Six, the new TODAY show anchor is hoping “to help people the way Oprah did” on her upcoming NBC slot.
“There was a lot of tough news to report on her show at Fox News,” a source told the publication. “A lot of combative interviewing, going after people. Doing that every night was difficult.”

“Megyn feels she has more to offer. She wants to help people the way Oprah did, and do something more positive. She’ll be focusing on issues and bringing in real people as well as celebrities. Plus, she has a sense of humor and she wants to use that,” the insider added.
As Radar readers know, Kelly’s NBC incoming has stirred up plenty of drama for the network. Longtime anchor Savannah Guthrie has reportedly been “terrified” about her position at TODAY since the Fox News vet was hired, according to sources.
