'Shunned' Matt Sandusky NOT SURPRISED Brother Jeffrey Nabbed On Child Sex Charges/n
Matthew Sandusky hasn’t spoken to his adopted family in at least four years, but RadarOnline.com can exclusively reveal that he’s not surprised to hear about Jeffrey’s arrest for sexually assaulting two minors.
“In some ways you are and some ways you aren’t,” he told Radar of his brother’s shocking crime. “Anyone can be a perpetrator. They’re out there.”
“I think that the most important thing to do is keep any potential victims at the forefront of this conversation and really to be mindful of them and to be hopeful that they’re receiving the help and support that they deserve and they need at this time,” he added, noting that he runs an organization for child sex crime victims. “Because really, that’s where my mind is right now.”

Matthew, 38, explained that he was “shunned” and “cut off” by the Sanduskys after he alleged that Jerry, 73, sexually abused him in an Oprah Winfrey special — so visiting his brother in prison “would be a big no.”
Although convicted of sexually abusing other children, Jerry adamantly denied his son’s claims.
“I think it’s important to use this opportunity to talk about the issue and to really lead with the victims at the forefront and not so much on any perpetrator at all,” he said, making it clear that he has no plans to reach out to his estranged brother.
Radar previously reported that Jeffrey, 41, was charged with 14 sex crimes against children on Feb. 13. His victims were a 16-year-old female and a 15-year-old female.
