Still Bitter! Former 'RHOC' Star Jeana Keough Rips Her Ex Co-Stars/n
Jeana Keough is trashing her co-stars for their outrageous on-camera behavior and finally revealing the shocking reason she actually quit The Real Housewives of Orange County!
The 60-year-old former Playboy Playmate of the Month dropped the bombshell about her walking away from the original franchise on Bravo.
“I quit the show because it became not so favorable to me,” Keough admits in a sneak peek of Oprah: Where Are They Now?, obtained by Radar.

Slamming her co-stars (all of whom has since left too, except Vicki Gunvalson and Tamra Judge), the former nude model said they were just not classy.
“I knew how to behave on camera and they didn’t,” she said.
Keough also addressed her own wild behavior, claiming that she was the inspiration for Teresa Giudice‘s infamous incident.

“That fight that started a lot of different fights became Teresa from New York (sic) throwing the table over on people,” she said.
But Keough believes her departure after five years was a solid decision. She said, “I don’t feel like I missed out on anything by leaving.”
Hit by the Housewives curse and now divorced, Keough bragged about her successful business.

“Wall Street Journal says I’m the #3 followed realtor in the United States,” she claimed. “When I list a house it goes around the world. The show has been really good for my real estate career.”
Still, she said she got out in the nick of time: “I felt like I kind of saved my soul a little bit.”
Keough’s interview airs on Saturday, August 20, at 10:00 p.m. ET/PT on OWN: Oprah Winfrey Network. /n
