Gayle King Caught Cheater Ex-Husband In Bed With Another Woman!/n
Gayle King may be one of TV’s friendliest personalities, but she knows how to throw shade when the time is right.
In a recent interview with Vanity Fair, the 61-year-old was asked to name a living person who “you most despise.”
“‘Despise is a strong word,” she replied, before finally admitting, “I’m not a huge fan of the woman I caught naked with my now ex-husband on June 24, 1990, at 9:16 P.M. But I don’t remember the details .”

King was officially divorced from husband, Connecticut Assistant Attorney General William Bumpus, in 1993.
In 2006, the CBS co-anchor told radio guest star Will Smith that time healed all when it came to her ex’s infidelity.
“I was married to a cheater . . . I went to marital counseling,” she said. “I have been divorced since 1993, so I’m all healed and everything. I have worked it out. I’m not bitter. I’m OK. I’m really OK.”
