Frontiers Magazine just published an oral history of the television sitcom featuring the show's old writers and producers, and while there are countless stories fans of the series will find amusing, there is one that sticks out from all the rest!
Former co-writers and co-producers Mort Nathan and Winifred Hervey shared an incredible story with Frontiers about how Bea Arthur took offense to a woman's review of the show in TV Guide!
Ch-ch-check out the story (below), first from Nathan: 

"TV Guide had done a piece on the show: 'The Golden Girls—Is it still as good as it was the first year?' And they asked random people what they thought of the show, and this one housewife said she didn't think the show was as good and that Bea Arthur's character wasn't as interesting. They mentioned her by name—Mrs. Betty Johnson, Sioux Falls, Iowa. So Bea reads this at lunch and then gets on the phone and asks information for this Betty Johnson's number. And she calls her. And she picks up, this TV Guide woman, and Bea says, 'This is Bea Arthur, and I want to talk to you about what you said in TV Guide.' The woman was horrified. She said she was misquoted. 'I didn't mean it. Is it really you? I love the show. I take it back.' And Bea goes, 'That's what I thought. OK, that's better.'"
OMG!!!
Hervey then continued the story, saying:

"And then Bea said 'That person's going to go tell everyone that I called her, and no one's going to believe her.'"
LOLz!!! No kidding!
Who knew Bea was such a badass?! And that poor, poor Betty Johnson! Ha!!!
