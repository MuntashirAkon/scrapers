Paris Attacks: Rob Lowe Slammed On Twitter Over Insensitive Comments/n

The attacks on the city of Paris have shocked the entire world.
Many celebrities have voiced their heartbreak and love for the victims on Twitter. Unfortunately, there's always someone that says something way off base.
Video: President Obama Responds To Paris Attacks
This time Rob Lowe is the offending party, after a very questionable remark.
The Grinder star first tweeted support, writing: 

Vive La France! #Paris
— Rob Lowe (@RobLowe) November 13, 2015

But then he followed it up by responding to President François Hollande's declaration that France's borders were temporarily closed. He quipped:

Oh, NOW France closes its borders. #Hollande
— Rob Lowe (@RobLowe) November 13, 2015

And then:

This is either the worst translation of an important speech ever, or one of the worst ever given. #Hollande
— Rob Lowe (@RobLowe) November 13, 2015

The implication that France would not be facing attacks if they had closed their borders to refugees is being decried as insensitive — reactionary at best and xenophobic at worst.
Many of Rob's fans are now putting the actor on blast:

@RobLowe don't be insensitive Rob

Rob Lowe you're a knob. Love, Europe. RT @RobLowe: Oh, NOW France closes its borders. #Hollande

@ThomasMorrison @nellbradfield @RobLowe also sounds like he's vilifying refugees - this is exactingly what they are fleeing from

@RobLowe oh come on, Rob. Refugees fleeing to Europe were escaping a whole country filled with this kind of chaos.

Lowe by name, low by nature "@RobLowe: Oh, NOW France closes its borders. #Hollande"
— Patrick Strudwick (@PatrickStrud) November 13, 2015
And simply:


@RobLowe this is the worst tweet of all time
— Anthony Brian Smith (@AnthonyBLSmith) November 13, 2015

We hope Rob doesn't really feel this way about aiding refugees.
