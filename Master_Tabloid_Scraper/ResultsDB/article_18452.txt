Disney Is Making Hocus Pocus TWO?!/n

Holy Thackery Binx!!! SO MANY EMOTIONS!!! 
The best Halloween movie of all time (sorry Tim Burton) is getting re-made!
If you don't know what we're tailing about, your parents didn't love you we'll give you a little Hocus Pocus backstory: It's about three awesome witches that are brought back from hell accidentally by a meddling virgin. Once back, the witches must suck the souls of all the neighborhood kids to stay young. Naturally, they are thwarted before doing so.
More importantly, it introduced a new generation to Bette Midler and Sarah Jessica Parker. Life. Changing. 
The remake has some pretty big, fabulous, pointy-toes shoes to fill, and what we've heard isn't super promising. 
All we really know is the flick's title, Hocus Pocus 2 : Rise of the Elderwitch. We can assume from the title that there is a new villain. Since the kids who saved the day — Vinessa Shaw, Thora Birch, and Omri Katz– are now all grown up, they'll probs not be involved in the movie either. 
We're not completely sold on Hocus Pocus remake with a whole new cast running amok (Amok, amok, amok, amok, amok!), but that seems to be the plan. 
We haven't lost all hope yet! 
If Disney can at least get the talking cat and Bette on board, we could totes get behind it! Or, as Winifred would say:
"Hello, I want my book remake. Bonjour, je veux mon livre um, remake."/n
