Bette Midler Just Won Halloween With Her Winifred Sanderson Costume From Hocus Pocus
/n
The witch is back.
Bette Midler answered fans’ prayers on Friday when she dressed up as her beloved Hocus Pocus character, Winifred Sanderson. The 70-year-old actress and singer scored major Halloween points with this throwback outfit, complete with curly heart-shaped wig, buck teeth, long nails, and a lack of eyebrows.
Midler dug the purple dress and embroidered green robe out of the archives for a good cause. She hosted her annual Hulaween Party at the Waldorf Astoria in New York City to celebrate the New York Restoration Project, a nonprofit that brings much-needed public green space to the state’s five boroughs.

This year’s bash was once again emceed by Kathy Griffin with designer Marc Jacobs serving as the costume contest judge and Darlene Love as the night’s entertainment.
Earlier this month, Midler’s Hocus Pocus costar Sarah Jessica Parker expressed her excitement about reuniting with her evil Salem witch sisters someday. “I would love that,” Parker said on Watch What Happens Live about filming a sequel to the 1993 Disney film. “I think we’ve all been fairly vocal about being very keen but that hasn’t created any ground swell of movement.”
However, Midler debunked the sequel rumors in November 2015 when she shared, “After all these years and all the fan demand, I do believe I can stand and firmly say an unequivocal no.”
