The trio portrayed evil witches called the Sanderson sisters, Winifred (Midler), Mary (Najimy), and Sarah (Parker), who are accidentally freed after a virgin teenager lights a candle at their abandoned house.   
Hocus Pocus fans got all fired up in early 2014 when speculations of a possible next chapter hit the web, with Tina Fey at the helm as producer. The Sisters star has since denied the rumor.  
Then in November, Midler took part in a Reddit AMA where she was asked if she would be reprising her famous Disney role.  
“Inundate the Disney company. Because I have canvassed the girls and they are willing to do it, but we have no say in it, so if you want a ‘Hocus Pocus 2,’ ask the Walt Disney company.”  
But it appears Disney has not forgotten about the beloved Sandersons. The witches are currently a part of a new stage show at Disney World’s Magic Kingdom Park just in time for Halloween. The Hocus Pocus Villain Spelltacular show runs through Nov. 1.
