Get ready for more Hocus Pocus!A sequel to the beloved 1993 cult hasn't officially come together quite yet (sorry to be such a witchy tease!), but fans of the Sanderson sisters are still in luck: There's a "Hocus Pocus Villain Spelltacular" coming to Disney World!According to the Disney parks blog, the new show will be presented exclusively during Mickey's Not-So-Scary Halloween Party held select nights at Magic Kingdom Park from Sept. 15 to Nov. 1, 2015. And just what does this sure-to-be spooky spelltacular involve? Winifred, Mary and Sarah will, per Disney, "gather together sinister shadows, nefarious nightmares and the power of their frightful friends to conjure the ultimate Hocus Pocus Party Potion and cast a spell on everyone in the Magic Kingdom Park."

The sisters' "Hocus Pocus Villain Spelltacular" will feature appearances from other great Disney villains, too, including Dr. Facilier, Oogie Boogie and Maleficent!While news of this spelltacular isn't quite as exciting as a confirmed Hocus Pocus sequel would be, it's most definitely taking the franchise in the right direction! After all, those Sanderson sisters can will cast a spell over a new generation of youngsters. Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker and Kathy Najimy have all confirmed they'd up for a Hocus Pocus round 2, and if the target audience keeps getting bigger, maybe it's only a matter of time before Disney agrees to make another magical movie!Mickey, please make that happen.
