It's just a bunch of Hocus Pocus, but we witches sure love it!On Saturday, Oct. 19, Hocus Pocus castmembers reunited 20 years after the film's 1993 release at an official Disney fan club meeting in Burbank., Calif. Among those in attendance: Thora Birch (Dani Dennison), Kathy Najimy (Mary of the Sanderson Sisters), Omri Katz (Max Dennison) and Vinessa Shaw (Allison, Max's crush).The two remaining Sanderson sisters—Bette Midler and Sarah Jessica Parker—were not in attendance for the nostalgic get-together. Fans, however, made up for their absence by dressing in their likeness for the Hocus Pocus celebration. Props from the movie—including the Winifred Sanderson's spell book, bound by (not real!) human skin—were put on display.

Najimy was grateful that Hocus Pocus still has its spell cast on fans 20 years after its initial release. "halla to all the fabu people at the D23 screening and panel today," she tweeted. "we all had a blast! thanks for the kudos."Tubular!
