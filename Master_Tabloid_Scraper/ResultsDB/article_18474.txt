Jesse Leroy Matthew Jr., the 32-year-old man authorities have arrested and charged in the kidnapping case, has a checkered past when it comes to women. He was accused of rape a dozen years ago during his time as a college football prospect at Lynchburg, Virginia’s Liberty University.
Teammates revealed recently that he was accused of raping a female classmate, though he never faced charges in connection with the Oct. 2002 allegation based on inadequate evidence.
And Because of Graham’s homicide investigation, cops are now re-opening cold case files that may link Matthew to as many as ten rapes, murders and disappearances, including that of Morgan Harrington, 20, who vanished in 2009, according to the new report. /n
