The emergence of the tape involving Michael Jackson’s troubled teenage daughter is the latest in a series of leaks to hit Los Angeles County Sheriff Leroy D. Baca‘s department.
Describing the leaker or leakers as an “informant” to certain media outlets, Sergeant Thomas said: “We haven’t been able to catch what deputy is giving the information.” But he added their internal probe has “been ongoing for quite a while,” however to date “just haven’t been able to get to [the source].”
Top cops believe it’s possible some media outlets are paying sources to leak the recordings and other secret information.

“I’m sure they got a hundred bucks and they’re going to throw away decades of income for 100 bucks,” he said.
