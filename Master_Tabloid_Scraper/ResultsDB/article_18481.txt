The X Factor: Nicole Scherzinger Bans Simon Cowell From Rehearsals/n
By Neil Woulfe, Radar Senior News Director
Nicole Scherzinger might not be a Pussycat Doll anymore, but she’s still got her claws.
Nicole — annoyed with Simon Cowell‘s meddling with her team on The X Factor — has banned the iconic British music mogul from attending any of rehearsals for her team members, Stacy, Josh and Leroy, RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned.
The development came after Radar first reported last week that Simon had been attending Stacy’s rehearsals and criticized Nicole’s work in mentoring her. The bad blood boiled further when Simon boldly took credit for choosing Stacy’s song on last Wednesday’s episode.

An insider with the production crew told us that the former Dancing with the Stars champ — seething over Simon micromanaging her team — spent the weekend in seclusion mentoring her team with the Simon ban in full effect.
“Last week, Simon made a big deal out of choosing Stacy’s song, and he said he didn’t think she’s connected with them all. She wasn’t happy with him at all — so now Nicole isn’t taking any chances,” the insider said. “She’s made it clear these are her artists, she is mentoring them and Simon should back off!” 
We’ll see the fallout when The X Factor returns on Fox Wednesday at 8/7c.
