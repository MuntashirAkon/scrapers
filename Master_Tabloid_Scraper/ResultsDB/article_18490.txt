Natalie Portman’s New Historic Home/n
Natalie Portman just plunked down $3.25 million on a historic property inside a gated community in the hip Loz Feliz area of Los Angeles.
Portman – who has recently been romantically linked with Sean Penn – bought the 1930’s Grand Laughlin Park mini-estate. The craftsman-style home has four bedrooms, two baths, and two separate guest properties.
The main home boasts beautiful wood floors, gallery ceilings, a private courtyard with leaded glass French doors. There are over 18,000 sq ft of lushly landscaped grounds with a beautiful swimming pool and the security system has been totally upgraded.
The Star Wars beauty sold her Richard Meiser green glass tower in New York City for $6.5 million last summer and had been on the look-out for a west coast property. The Oscar-nominated actress’ new digs were previously owned by Catherine Keener and her ex-husband Dermot Mulroney who sold it to recently deceased sax player LeRoi Moore from the Dave Matthews Band.
Portman, 28, is expected to move into her new home within the next month. She has recently been linked to play a part in Marvel Comic’s fantasy adventure Thor. (Photo: PR Photos) /n
