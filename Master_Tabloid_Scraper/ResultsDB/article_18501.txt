His New Testament album will be the followup to his 2013 Yeezus album. See a pattern here?
Billboard magazine recently posted a roundup off what they know about the forthcoming album.
He may or may not have worked with James Fauntleroy, Gee Roberson, Mike Will Made It, Malik Yusef, Rick Rubin, Q-Tip, French Montana (Khloe Kardashian’s new piece), Tyga among a slew of others.
Kanye told Power 105.1’s The Breakfast Club that his 2014 album will be his very own Born In the U.S.A. S1 added that it will “connect strongly.”
