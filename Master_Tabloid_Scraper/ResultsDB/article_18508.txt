 Getting down to business, Lea Michele and Cory Monteith headed to the Glee set. Lea looked flawless in a red and white heart dress.
The duo were joined by veteran actor Jeff Goldblum, who will play one of Rachel’s adoptive parent. TVLine.com broke  the news on Wednesday that the roles of Hiram  and LeRoy Berry were given to Goldblum and Broadway star Brian Stokes Mitchell.
The duo will first hit the small screen for the show’s Valentine’s   Day episode titled “Heart,” airing appropriately on Feb. 14.  We can’t wait to see them sing together!

Meanwhile, the latest episode of Glee left us with a HUGE cliffhanger — will Rachel will accept Finn’s marriage proposal?! We’ll have to wait, but what do you think? Sound off in the comments!
