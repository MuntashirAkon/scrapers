TVLine.com broke the news on Wednesday that the roles of Rachel’s adoptive parents Hiram and LeRoy Berry were given to Hollywood heavyweight Jeff Goldblum and Broadway star Brian Stokes Mitchell. 
The website also confirmed that the duo will first hit the small screen for the show’s Valentine’s Day episode titled “Heart,” airing appropriately on Feb. 14.  Also, get ready to see Goldblum and Mitchell sing! 
Both guys have musical experience. Goldblum starred in the 1971 Broadway play Two Gentleman in Verona,while Mitchell has made his mark in theater, starring in plays including Jelly’s Last Jam, Ragtime, Man of La Macha and Kiss Me Kate. 
Do you think these men are the right guys for the job?
