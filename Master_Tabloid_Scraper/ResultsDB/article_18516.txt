Real World: Leroy Changes His Whorish Ways for Slightly Less Whorish Ways/n
On last night's Real World, Leroy and Naomi had a scare. You see, Leroy has been sleeping with both Naomi and the city of Las Vegas. So when Naomi felt a searing pain in the region doctors refer to as "lady parts," she thought she might have an STD. Fortunately the test results came back negative. But the scare was enough for Leroy to see the light.

So the next time I find myself in a hot tub with 2 girls I've known for 20 minutes and one of them tries to have sex with me, I'll just say, "Sorry honey, safety first."Of course, the girls will be strippers named Honey and Safe-tee and I'll simply be instructing Honey that I am going to have sex with Safe-tee first, but now I'll wear protection. Lesson learned.
