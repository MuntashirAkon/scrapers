“The rehearsal dinner was beautiful. Ciara and Russell couldn’t keep their hands off of each other,” a source told E! News  of the romantic evening. “The love was strong in the room. Russell and Ciara said a few words to their guest thanking them for coming to Liverpool for this special occasion. Kelly Rowland and Lala [Vasquez] were helping Ciara before hand get ready and haven’t left her side.”
As Radar previously reported, the couple began dating in 2015, and announced their engagement in March.
Before Wilson, Ciara was engaged to rapper Future, but the pair had a bitter split in 2014, following the birth of their son, Future Zahir. /n
