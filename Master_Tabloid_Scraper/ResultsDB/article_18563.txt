In the meantime, “There are lots of family photos with Alexis and her growing belly,” added a second source.
And the 33-year-old mom-to-be — a former financial advisor for the investment bank Morgan Stanley — has been keeping a low profile in their New York neighborhood in order to keep her baby bump under wraps.
“She doesn’t leave the house too often because she doesn¹t want anyone to know,” continued the second source. “And she wears big dresses to cover it up.”

As previously reported by Radar, Billy has long been committed to Alexis, who’s 32 years his junior. Though they haven’t married, he gave her a diamond ring a couple years ago.
The “Uptown Girl” crooner has been married three times before.
Joel’s rep confirmed the news in a statement, saying,“Billy Joel and his girlfriend, Alexis Roderick, are expecting their first child this summer,” adding, “The couple, together since 2009, opted to keep any further details of her pregnancy under wraps until their new addition makes an official debut.” /n
