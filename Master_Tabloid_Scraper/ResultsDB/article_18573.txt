This is one star-studded bit!
On Wednesday, Nashville's Charles Esten enlisted stars like Darius Rucker, Kellie Pickler, Billy Ray Cyrus, and Little Big Town to help kick off his hosting gig at the CMT Music Awards. And, surprisingly, the opening sketch was pretty funny. We mean, who knew so many country singers doubled as comedians??
LOLz! Of course, as the event took place in Nashville, the award show host had to praise the Nashville Predators for making it to the NHL Stanley Cup final. However, things took an inneresting turn when Esten joked that the town was "oversold" due to the upcoming game, and ordered half of all musical duos to go — à la United Airlines. Let's just say one half of Big & Rich was thrown out a window.
Be sure to ch-ch-check out the opening bit for yourself (above)!
