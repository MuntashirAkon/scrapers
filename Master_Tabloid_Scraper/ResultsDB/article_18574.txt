Twitter Roasts Dierks Bentley After He 'Butchered' The National Anthem At The Stanley Cup Finals!/n

Well, this is embarrassing.
On Monday night, Dierks Bentley took the ice in Nashville to perform the National Anthem before game four of the Stanley Cup finalsâ€¦ and fans were less than pleased with his raspy rendition!
In fact, the country singer might need a hug or two after many people took to Twitter to straight up destroy his performance!

Not the worst we've ever heard, but absolutely not the best.
Ch-ch-check out the harsh responses (below)! 

I think the Dierks Bentley critic with the most retweets should sing the Anthem at Game 5.
