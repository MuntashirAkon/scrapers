Court Refuses To Grant Katherine Jackson A Temporary Restraining Order Against Allegedly Abusive Nephew!/n

And the court battle rages on!
As we reported in February, Katherine Jackson accused her nephew/driver Trent Lamar Jackson of elder abuse, claiming she is living in a "constant state of fear and confusion."
In response to these allegations, a judge granted Michael Jackson's mom's initial request for a restraining order, and ruled that Trent must move out of her home and return all passwords and keys to the property.

Fast forward to Tuesday, Trent won a major legal victory in his fight against the 86-year-old!
According to legal expert Jill Stanley, the judge dismissed the matriarch's request for a temporary restraining order, and she cannot refile — she can only seek a separate order if she has new evidence from a new incident.
Trent's lawyers — Philip Cohen and Ron Rale — were not only responsible for Tuesday's success, they also persuaded the court that Mrs. Jackson had to come back to the US from London to testify.
We just hope the Jackson family can resolve their differences!
