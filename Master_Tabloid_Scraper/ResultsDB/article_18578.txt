What have we done to deserve this? The Devil Wears Prada is headed to Broadway with a score that will be composed by Elton John.

Deadline reports that John will be working with Paul Rudnick to write a musical adaptation of the 2006 film The Devil Wears Prada. John is writing the music while Rudnick is penning the book and lyrics.
The timeline of the project is TBA. It will be produced by Kevin McCollum, Fox Stage Productions, and John’s Rocket Entertainment.
John said in a statement, “Re-imagining The Devil Wears Prada for the musical theatre is super exciting. I’m a huge fan of both the book and the feature film and a huge aficionado of the fashion world. I can’t wait to sink my musical teeth into this hunk of popular culture.”
