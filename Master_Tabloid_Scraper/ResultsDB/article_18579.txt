Fans are getting their first taste of Emma Watson’s singing in the live-action version of Beauty and the Beast.

The musical leak was discovered when one eagle-eyed fan spotted a Belle doll at a local Toys “R” Us. The toy, which features the Disney princess in her iconic dress, is a tie-in to the upcoming movie and plays songs like “Something There” sung by Watson.
Once recordings from the doll made its way online, Beauty and the Beast co-producer Jack Morrissey confirmed that the voice heard belongs to the Harry Potter actress by sharing the snippet on his own Instagram.
