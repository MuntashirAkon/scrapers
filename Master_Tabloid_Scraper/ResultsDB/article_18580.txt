After Shelly Duvall told Dr. Phil McGraw that she is suffering from mental illness on his show, many fans have criticized the talk show host for allegedly exploiting the actress. According to E! News,Vivian Kubrick, daughter of director Stanley Kubrick, is trying to help.

Kubrick was one of the many people who criticized Dr. Phil, saying the interview “has nothing to do with compassionate healing.” Now, she set up a GoFundMe page to raise money for the actress.
The page reads, “Like many older movie stars, embarrassed fincances is not uncommon. Showing your love and support for Shelley Duvall by making a donation can start her back on the road to independence and perhaps back to health and for her fans, more superb performances.”

Kubrick says that all the funds will go directly to Duvall. She says that she first heard about Duvall’s illness when Toy Story 3-director Lee Unkrich tried to contact the actress while working on a book about the making of The Shining, in which Kubrick’s father directed Duvall.  Kubrick says all they heard was that Duvall was in financial trouble and was unwell. When she and Unkrich saw a commercial for the Dr. Phil interview, they were both horrified.
Unkrich tweeted that Duvall was “put on display like the town crazy.”

@MentalIllPolicy We’ll have to disagree on this. I watched the interview. No redeeming value. She was put on display like the town crazy.
