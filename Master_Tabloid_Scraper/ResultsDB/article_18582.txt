Shelley Duvall, the star of The Shining, recorded an interview with Dr. Phil McGraw for his television show in which Duvall discusses her present battle with an unidentified mental illness.

In a clip from the episode of Dr. Phil that describes Duvall as a “recluse” in its introduction, Duvall explains to Dr. Phil that she does not believe that Robin Williams, her former co-star who committed suicide in 2014, is dead. Instead, she says that he is “shape shifting.” Duvall also tells Dr. Phil that she believes she has a disc has been implanted in her leg and that she’s being threatened by “the Sheriff of Nottingham.”

Duvall’s fans spoke out against Dr. Phil in her defense, saying that he is “showboating the visibly ill.” Vivian Kubrick, daughter of The Shining’s director Stanley Kubrick issued her criticism of the show on Twitter.
“Your exploitive use of Shelly Duvall is a form of LURID ENTERTAINMENT and is shameful,” wrote Kubrick. “You are putting Shelly Duvall ‘on show’ while she is suffering from a pitiable state of ill health. Unquestionably, this is purely a form of lurid and exploitive entertainment — it’s appallingly cruel.”
