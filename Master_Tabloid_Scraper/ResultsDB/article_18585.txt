Spotlight Deal: Save 70% on the ATGOIN V4.1 Wireless Sport Stereo Bluetooth Headphones.

Comfortable: These earbuds are very comfortable. Don’t worry any pain in your ears while wearing them to lift weights and run.
Support: The curved loops provide great support, they keep the weight of the earbud off of your ear canal and keeps the earbuds on your ears. Prevents the earbuds from falling out of your ears when tugged by accident.
Sound quality: The sound quality is awesome, I listen to Rap/R&B while working out and it provided great all-around sound with the perfect amount of bass. These earbuds kept me pumped throughout my entire workout!
Power button: Large button conveniently located on left earbud allowing you to easily pair and turn on/off the device (Large button easily accessible even with gloves on)
