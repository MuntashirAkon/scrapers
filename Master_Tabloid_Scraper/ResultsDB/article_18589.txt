This “shit-ton of famous people” are here to inspire you to get out and vote this fall.

Joss Whedon, the director behind Marvel hits like Avengers and Avengers: Age of Ultron, has created a platform called Save the Day. It has one purpose: to make sure every American knows how important participating in the election process is.
And because he’s a Hollywood heavyweight, he enlisted a seemingly endless roster of celeb pals to help him to drive home the point with a new video. Like many “get out the vote” videos before it, the clip is aiming to tug at your heartstrings as well as tickle your funny bone.
Celebrities who appear include Neil Patrick Harris, James Franco, Julianne Moore, Don Cheadle, Robert Downey Jr., Mark Ruffalo, Scarlett Johansson, Keegan-Michael Key, Randall Park, Stanley Tucci, Martin Sheen and many more.
