Baby on board!Stanley Tucci and wife Felicity Blunt are expecting their first child, the Hunger Games star confirmed to E! News Monday."I'm very excited to be a dad. It's incredible," the 53-year-old actor told Us Weekly, who was first to report the baby news. Tucci, who already has three children with his late wife Kate Tucci, who passed away from breast cancer in 2009, added, "I'm most excited to have a baby with Felicity and for the baby to be healthy.""The sex is of no concern to me," added Tucci, who wed Blunt, a literary agent, in 2012. When asked what kind of mother his wife would be, Tucci gushed to the mag, "A great one!"

Aw! Baby Tucci will also have a great first cousin to play with: 8-month-old Hazel Krasinski! Felicity's sister Emily Blunt and husband John Krasinski welcomed their little lady in February, and the sisters (and their spouses) are incredibly close!In fact, Emily was actually the one who introduced her older sister to her Devil Wears Prada co-star. The twosome clearly hit it off and became engaged in November 2011.The lovebirds wed secretly in August 2012, then celebrated their union with a formal wedding ceremony nearly two months later. The newlyweds walked down the aisle at Middle Temple Hall in London with Steve Buscemi as best man and Felicity's sister, Emily, as the maid of honor. Other guests included Krasinski (of course!), Meryl Streep, Patricia Clarkson, Julianne Moore, Colin Firth and Kenneth Cole.It seems like Baby Tucci will have plenty of famous friends!-Reporting by Holly Passalaqua
