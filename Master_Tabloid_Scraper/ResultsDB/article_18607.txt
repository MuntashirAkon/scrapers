Remembering Stanley Kubrick/n
A mystery in life, Stanley Kubrick's death is no mystery, police say.           And his movie studio says there's little intrigue regarding his now-posthumous final film, either.          Officials in Britain today ruled that the reclusive directing great died of natural causes--no "suspicious circumstances," no inquests needed. CNN said a heart attack was to blame. Kubrick apparently died in his sleep. He was found by his fourth wife, Christiane Harlan, Sunday in their London-area mansion. He was 70.          Warner Bros., meanwhile, said it's sticking with its previously announced July 16 release date for Kubrick's last opus, Eyes Wide Shut, starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.          Though described as "not a fitness guy" by a Hollywood executive, Kubrick's death was sudden. He was not under doctor's care for a preexisting condition.          It appears Kubrick was just able to complete work on the likely R-rated psychological thriller Eyes Wide Shut. Warner executive Terry Semel and partner Robert Daly got their first look at Kubrick's cut just last week. Semel said they were thrilled--as was Kubrick.          "He felt really great about the film," Semel said in the Times.           The studio honcho said he spoke with Kubrick on the telephone Saturday night.          "We laughed our heads off, just talking about everything," Semel said. "He was on a roll."          As previously planned, theater owners will see Eyes Wide Shut footage at this week's Sho West convention in Las Vegas. Even before Kubrick's death, it was considered a key film to hit-starved Warner Bros.           In addition to exerting total control of what was on the screen, Kubrick routinely directed the marketing of his movies. It was not immediately known if he left Warner Bros. any such directives.          What was immediately known was what the Hollywood community thought of one of its finest filmmakers.                "He copied no one while all of us were scrambling to imitate him."--Director Steven Spielberg.          The "single greatest American director of his generation."--Director Oliver Stone.          "We have lost someone important."--Actor Kirk Douglas, who gave Kubrick his big studio break on 1960's  Spartacus.               Kubrick's three "Top 100" film credits are: 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), Dr. Strangelove (1964) and A Clockwork Orange (1971).            Survivors include wife Christiane and three daughters.
