Stanley Kubrick: The Frugal Filmmaker/n
Call filmmaker Stanley Kubrick fussy; call him obsessive. Call him paranoid. And yes, after he took 15 months to shoot his first film in a decade, the Tom Cruise-starrer Eyes Wide Shut, you might even call him late for dinner.        Just don't call him over budget. Despite a marathon production schedule, several casting changes and big-sticker stars like Cruise and his wife, Nicole Kidman, Warner Bros. cochair Terry Semel tells the Los Angeles Times that the England-produced Eyes will end up costing the studio about a third less than it would have had it been put together in Hollywood.        "I know you won't believe me, but it's in the 60s," says Semel, happily referring to the millions the studio had to pay for the psychological drama about a Manhattan married couples' somewhat racy sex-capades. It will be released next summer.        "I promise you that a Hollywood-type production with a major star like Tom Cruise and a world-class director like Stanley Kubrick would have cost someone else $80 million or $90 million," Semel tells the paper.        After reportedly writing a zero-interference clause in Kubrick's contract, Warners had to sit on its hands while production on the film dragged from November 1996 to spring of this year.        To keep costs manageable, Kubrick not only directed, but often manned the camera and did some of the digital editing himself. Whereas the usual big Hollywood shoot can cost upwards of $300,000 per day, the Times says Kubrick spent as little as $12,000 per shooting day.        "He's very concerned about wasting money," Semel says. "He treats the studio money as if it's his own."        Warners also got a bargain when came to talent cost: In lieu of his usual $20 million and 20 percent of profits, Cruise agreed to a 15-15 deal. He took the pay cut for the privilege of working with the director of 2001: A Space Odyssey, A Clockwork Orange and Full Metal Jacket.        And Kubrick signed on for around 10 percent of gross profits, which is somewhat of a bargain when you consider that fellow "world-class" director Steven Spielberg has worked film deals in the past that have paid him a full half.
