Throwback Thursday: Folgers Coffee Truly Stirred Inside Paul Stanley/n
Today we honor a recently resurfaced gem by traveling back to that glorious morning when Paul Stanley entered a circus tent  with an Under The Tuscan Sun-like energy that could not be denied while at the same time begged for the appearance of a turtleneck sweater. Make-up free and emotionally raw, he cuddled his mug just as a squirel would its precious acorn, and sang for what truly stirred inside of him. And that stirring? It was Folgers.Please make yourself especially present for his final gesture…for it is a magical flourish that will indeed make you fly, or at least dream of it while barging in unexpectedly on someone's extremely high-risk tech rehearsal.
