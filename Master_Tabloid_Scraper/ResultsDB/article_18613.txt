Penguins Fans Stanley Cup Celebration, Eat Dead Raw Catfish!/nAWESOME ... and also ... GROSS!!! After the Pittsburgh Penguins won Lord Stanley's Cup on Sunday, fans took to the streets and celebrated by EATING RAW DEAD CATFISH! Why, you ask? The Penguins beat the Nashville Predators -- whose fans often throw dead catfish on the ice during games. The eating of the dead, raw catfish is obviously symbolic -- then again, so is buying one of those fake mini-Stanley Cups and running around with that instead. Pittsburgh PD tells us they had no arrests related to the celebration and 1 medical transport for someone who fell and hit their head. Congrats! (And also, good luck to your toilets).
