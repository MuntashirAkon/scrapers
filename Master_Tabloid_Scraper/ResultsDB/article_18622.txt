L.A. Kings -- Stanley Cup's SWEET First Night with the Champs!! (VIDEO)/nLord Stanley's Cup went home with a bunch of the NHL Champion L.A. Kings to their neighborhood bar where it was immediately filled with ... a ton of M&Ms ... and TMZ Sports has the awesome video!! Most of the Kings and the Stanley Cup arrived triumphantly at North End Bar & Grill in Hermosa Beach early this morning. In the video, Alec Martinez -- who shot the Cup-winning rebound shot -- helps fill the trophy with bag after bag of Plain, Peanut Butter, and of course Peanut (the best) M&Ms and then grabbed the first handful. There's a bunch of reasons why you do NOT want the last handful. Not that hockey players are superstitious, but the Kings brought the Cup to the same bar hours after winning it 2 years ago.We're told captain Dustin Brown, Matt Greene, Drew Doughty, Anze Kopitar, Jarret Stoll and Jonathan Quick -- to name a few -- all partied with their fans. It's unclear who got first crack at taking the Cup home when they finally left the bar around 4 AM. If you're wondering ... someone did the math. The Cup can hold somewhere between 5,000 and 7,000 M&Ms ... depending on flavor.Oh, and the dapper dude in the video, sporting the vest and tie, is this year's official Keeper of the Cup. You're gonna see a lot of him, and he's gonna log a ton of miles./n
