L.A. Kings -- We Screwed Up! Slava Voynov's Gotta Stay Away/nThe Stanley Cup Champions just fell on their sword -- the L.A. Kings are admitting they messed up badly by letting their suspended star Slava Voynov practice with the team.The Kings reacted to the $100,000 fine the NHL laid on the team today, saying ... “It is incumbent upon us to be more vigilant in managing this situation to ensure that Slava’s allowable training activities always remain separate from the team.”Slava was suspended after his October arrest for allegedly beating up his wife. As we told you ... he pled not guilty yesterday, but participated in a team practice today -- a violation of his suspension. The Kings added ...  "This was clearly a mistake on our part and we accept full responsibility. " /n
