'Mad Men' Creator Matt Weiner -- Ducks Big Don Draper Coke Question After Finale/n "Mad Men " fans woke up Monday feeling like 'Sopranos' fans did 8 years ago -- an ambiguous final scene made it SEEM like Don Draper created the iconic Coke commercial ... and the show's creator is keeping the mystery going.  We got Matt Weiner and Christopher Stanley (who played Betty's second husband) outside the show's wrap party -- and put the big Draper question to them. If you missed it ... the final shots of the series showed Don finally reaching a point of clarity in his life -- cut to black (a la 'Sopranos') ... and then the legendary  "I'd Like to Buy the World a Coke " commercial rolls.  So, did DD clean up his act, and make the epic ad -- or was it just symbolic of the kind of manufactured feelings Draper was famous for creating throughout the series?  Stanley tries to give us an opinion, before Weiner crushed his groove.
