Kate Beckinsale's New Boy Toy Under Fire For Racist, Homophobic Tweets/n
Kate Beckinsale‘s very young new boyfriend, Matt Rife, has been exposed on Twitter for offensive old posts, Radaronline.com has learned.
The 21-year-old comedian, who has appeared on MTV’s Wild N Out, came under fire last year after people discovered a slew of racist and homophobic tweets from his account.
In 2012, Rife posted a slew of racial jokes that many fans found controversial.
“#ifihadasuperpower it’d be to jump high and run fast….. I’d be called “Black Guy,” one said.

“Happy Black History Month! I don’t know about you guys, but I’m gonna get back to my roots, by watching Boys In The Hood,” he said in another tweet.

“When my black friends call me the N-Word…………..that’s what it’s like to find out you’re not the father on Maury, right? #PureJoy,” he wrote in another instance.

“No I didn’t f***ing f****t!” he allegedly wrote on September 5, 2012. “F**k n***a that’s that s**t I don’t like.”

Rife also dropped homophobic slurs in a still active tweet the year prior.
“OFWGKTA = Old F*****s Waiving Gay Kites Through Arkansas #TeamFunkVolume,” he wrote in 2011.

Many fans fired back by demanding MTV drop the comedian from the show.

“Why do you give Matt Rife money to be a racist and a homophobe?” one follower asked.
Rife has not responded to Radar’s request for comment.
Four years later after his most controversial tweets, he was seen passionately kissing Beckinsale this week in West Hollywood.
Beckinsale, a 42-year-old mother of teen Lilly, is two years older than Rife’s mother.
