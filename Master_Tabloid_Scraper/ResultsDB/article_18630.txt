L.A. Kiss QB -- Team Left Me Homeless ... And Stole My Wife's Meds/nGene Simmons and Paul Stanley's arena football team is getting blasted by its own QB ... who says the L.A. Kiss kicked him out of his home just because he suffered an injury during a game.Matt Bassuener went down with a broken hand during a loss in May and says the Kiss showed no mercy. According to a new lawsuit, the team's doctor cleared him to play in July -- but Bassuener insisted on a 2nd opinion from his own doc, who put the kibosh on him suiting up again.  That's when the trouble started. Matt and his wife live in corporate housing ... an apartment subsidized by the team. But in his suit, Matt says the team forcibly entered the apartment in August -- and went through their stuff, changed the locks ... and even stole stuff. He says the missing items included his wife's passport, immigration papers, and her epilepsy medication ... which she needs to take twice a day.  Bassuener says she missed 3 doses before the team allowed them to pick up the meds and some belongings, but other items are still in the apartment.  Matt's suing to get back in their crib, but he's persona non grata with the team ... which insists he's been cut. /n
