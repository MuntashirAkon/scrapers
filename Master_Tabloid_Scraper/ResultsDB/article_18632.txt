And I'm Damn Proud Of It! /nLudacris hit up a professional sporting event this weekend -- but it wasn't the Belmont, or the Stanley Cup, or the big NASCAR race ... dude took his daughter to a WNBA game and TMZ Sports has the pics. Luda and Karma sat courtside to watch the Atlanta Dream demolish the Chicago Sky on Saturday night -- it also happened to be  "Dads and Daughters night. "The father /daughter duo seemed to be having a blast -- and even went down on the court and met some of the players.Pretty cool, right?/n
