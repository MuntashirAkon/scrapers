The Australian stunner turned to celebrity stylist Harry Josh on Tuesday of this week, who got rid of her highlights and replaced them with a deep, golden caramel color. The John Frieda Consultant then gave Rose super long bangs (like Sandra Bullock’s at the Golden Globes) to give her a “French chic” look a la Jane Birkin.

To style her hair, Harry started with the new Frizz-Ease 3-Day Straight, which is an at home alternative to salon straightening treatments, because he wanted her hair to be super straight.

He then blow-dried her hair with a round Mason Pearson brush and finished by running a flat iron from root to tip to lock in the style.
