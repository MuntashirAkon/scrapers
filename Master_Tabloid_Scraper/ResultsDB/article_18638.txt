Katy Perry played a princess, as she cuddled in the front row of the John Galliano show with new beau Russell Brand in this pink gown. The pop star and the comedian, who met at the MTV Music Awards in September, were far from camera shy, clinging to each other the entire night! Who else radiated off the runway?
