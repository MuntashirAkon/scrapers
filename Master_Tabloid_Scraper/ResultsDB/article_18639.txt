Slumdog Stars Show Puppy Love Toward Each Other/n
Life continues to imitate art in the Slumdog Millionaire saga.
Dev Patel and Frieda Pinto, the adult stars of the acclaimed Bollywood import, were spotted together in Israel, where Pinto is making her next film, Miral.
“They looked very close,” an eyewitness told UK Daily Mail. “They sat side by side and looked into each other’s eyes. At one stage, Freida leaned in towards him and rested her head on his shoulder.”
While the couple has stayed silent about a possible off-screen romance, some have said otherwise.
Their Slumdog co-star, Anil Kapoor, was quoted saying the couple shared “a magical chemistry.”
Kapoor told an Indian radio show, “This is the beginning of something exciting happening. They definitely make a great pair. Both of them look very good together.”
Not all onlookers have sugar-coated words for the possible lovebirds — Pinto’s ex, Mumbai public relations executive Rohan Antao, told the UK Telegraph he blames Patel for their 16-month relationship dissolving.
“I don’t know if they were having a sexual relationship but if I came face to face with him I would have things to say,” Antao said. “Now, everywhere I go, I see them on billboards. I am devastated.”
