Slumdog Actress Scores Big Role/n
With the golden aura of awards season still surrounding her, “Slumdog Millionaire” star Frieda Pinto will make her second big screen splash in the next Woody Allen film. 
Opposite such powerhouses like Naomi Watts, Josh Brolin, and Anthony Hopkins, Pinto will be front and center in the unnamed project which is set to start filming in London this summer.
“Yes, it’s in July,” Pinto confirmed on the Today show during her press tour. “So thank you [“Slumdog” director] Danny Boyle for helping me take off.” 
Allen’s last muse- Penelope Cruz– recently won an Oscar for her role in “Vicky Cristina Barcelona”. Pinto may just get another chance to walk that Academy Awards red carpet after all! /n
