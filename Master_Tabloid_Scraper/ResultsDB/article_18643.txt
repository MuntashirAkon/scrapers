You’re going to want to write these down.

We already know Chrissy Teigen is your favorite celebrity chef, therefore you’ve already bought her book “Cravings” and tried out half of the recipes. But even a master (home) chef like Teigen doesn’t want to cook every night, so when she’s not busy being the soup master or making her out of this world chicken lettuce wraps, she’s got a few staple dishes at her favorite restaurants that she’s always in the mood to eat. And because Teigen is basically the internet’s BFF, she went ahead and shared the priceless information with everyone, and now we’ll never cook again. From five star restaurants to drive-throughs, Teigen’s got a favorite food for everyone.
