Khloe Kardashian’s Hair Was Styled Using Only Products From a Drugstore: Get the Look/n
While the Kardashian/Jenner clan stick to designer brands when it comes to their beauty routine, sometimes life happens, and they do the unthinkable: make do with products from the drugstore. Such was the case for Khloé Kardashian earlier this week.

KoKo’s hairstylist Jen Atkin ended up losing her luggage during a quick trip to Chicago on Monday and was forced to visit the local drugstore.

“When your hair kit doesn’t make your flight? You make lemonade out of sour lemons at the local Walgreens! Wish me luck today!” Atkin wrote on Instagram, adding a positive, “At least I found pink leopard!”
The lemonade actually turned out pretty sweet. Using the drugstore products and tools (and a little hairstylist magic), Atkin took Khloé’s hair from a knotted up-do to loose, beachy blonde waves that actually looked seriously fab (see the photo above).
So how did Atkin get the look? With these 17 products that cost under $100 total:

Conair hair clips (two packs)
John Frieda blow dryer (which she claims became one of her favorite products)
Leopard beauty bag
Kardashian Beauty straightener
