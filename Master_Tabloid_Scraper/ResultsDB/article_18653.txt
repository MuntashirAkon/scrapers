Yay or Nay: Ashley Benson’s Little Black Romper (PHOTOS)/n
Are LBRs the new LBDs?
Pretty Little Liars star Ashley Benson was seen in NYC on Tuesday afternoon while signing copies of her Seventeen magazine cover and was sporting a little black romper. While we love a good romper, we’re still not sure how we feel about this look.
There is one part about this look we’re absolutely loving!

Ash’s blue pumps! She’s not the only lady to rock these kind of shoes. Frieda Pinto was seen in blue kicks last week in the big apple. Check out the photos below!
