Katie Holmes Cheats on Her Stylist in John Frieda Short Film/n
[brightcoveplayer 849970826001]
The mystery has been solved: Katie Holmes was cheating on her hair stylist! Well, in a movie, that is. Tuesday night, the actress revealed The Decision, a short film she shot for John Frieda’s new Precision Foam Colour, which was teased online last week. In the four-minute flick, Holmes plays Joan Hudson, an American movie star who’s gone missing, and reportedly split from her colorist beau. As she tries to flee by airplane, she’s stopped by security, and when her bag is searched, boxes of the foam are found. John Frieda stylist Harry Josh, who coiffed Holmes’s hair for the movie and Tuesday’s premiere, says the actress was excited to do the promotion. “She said it was a really fun project,” he told PEOPLE. “She told me she was attracted to the whole short-film concept.” For The Decision, Josh said he “structured” her hair. “It was very dramatic … very clean,” he explained. So for the premiere, held at New York City club Lavo, he took it to the other extreme. “We did something incredibly soft, loose, natural and totally easy. We wanted it casual, just to throw the whole thing off.” Tricky! Learn more about The Decision at facebook.com/whatsinthebag. —Reporting by K.C. Baker
