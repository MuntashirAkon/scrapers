While most of us are probably going to be spending tonight binging the new season of Orange is the New Black from our beds or couches, we imagine the show's star, Taylor Schilling, will also be having a chillaxing kind of Friday. Why? Well, mostly because her Thursday was a nonstop whirlwind of activity—Last night's OrangeCon wasn't your average premiere event!Yes, yesterday the actress was literally off-and-running as soon as the sun came up. And then she had to prep for the Netflix soiree, which meant hours of glamming. And finally the fête itself, which included a red carpet, panel and fan meet-and-greet.And how do we know all of this? We were there! Well, kind of. In that we lived vicariously through the actress via her photo diary. See what she shared below and for even more behind-the-scenes with Taylor watch E! News tonight at 7 p.m. and 11:30 p.m.—Additional reporting by Lauren Mendoza

"No matter how busy I am, I make a little bit of quiet time in the morning to read a good book. Green tea is a perfect compliment."

"Nothing like a good sweat to start off my morning. Time to hit the shower before my big day."

"Nobody does it better! Hanging with some of my favorite boys Harry Josh and Hung Vanngo for our shoot with John Frieda hair care today."
