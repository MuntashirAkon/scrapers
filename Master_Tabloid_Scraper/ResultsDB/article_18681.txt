J.R. Martinez was a hero again Saturday night when he helped a charity raise a whopping $25,000 just by dancing!
The Dancing with the Stars champion and U.S. Army vet was the honored guest at a Palm Beach gala benefiting the American Veterans Disabled for Life Foundation.
Founded and chaired by philanthropist Lois Pope, widow of National Enquirer creator Generoso Pope, the Foundation has spearheaded a Washington, D.C. memorial honoring permanently disabled vets like Martinez.PHOTOS:  J.R. Martinez Dances For Charity
At the lavish ball, where all the women wore red, a dance with J.R. went up for auction. A generous bidder won it for $25,000 and then turned it over to Mrs. Pope.
With another of the guests, Donald Trump applauding, J.R. gave Pope an unforgettable spin on the dance floor.
