Smart, 23, reportedly stormed out of the courtroom when a psychiatrist testifying in Mitchell’s defense said he had been motivated to kidnap Smart because of his desire to have children and create a new race.
Forensic psychiatrist Paul Whitehead claims he obtained such information from journals of Mitchell’s estranged wife, Wanda Barzee, according to KSL-TV. Whitehead testified that he believes Mitchell suffers from a “major psychotic illness” and a personality disorder.
