We're not sure if Brothers Osborne were looking for a soloist or a scapegoat!
For their performance of It Ain't My Fault at the 2017 CMT Music Awards, the duo brought on legendary rock guitarist Peter Frampton!
If you thought the guitar licks were catchy before, damn they were on fire this time. And that for sure was Peter's fault.
Ch-ch-check out the rowdy, toe-tappin' performance (above)!
