In honor of National Comic Book Day (Sept. 25, 2016), we’ve compiled a list of the top ten grossing comic book movies of all time. Whether fans were taking sides in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice or choosing their favorite Avenger, these films brought audiences in masses to theaters.
With the superhero role comes great responsibility (not to mention, good looks) — Big screen stars like Christian Bale, Tobey Maguire, and Robert Downey Jr. have all  appeared in the sequels to their comic-to-movie adaptations. The Spider-Man Trilogy racks up $2.5 billion total at the box office, making it the sixth-highest grossing film franchise in the world.
