Actress Noel Neill Who First Played Lois Lane Has Died at 95/n
Noel Neill, the woman who first played the role of Lois Lane, has died. She was 95.  
The actress’s manager Larry Ward revealed the news via a Facebook Post from editor Jim Nolt, saying that Neill died in Tucson, Arizona on Sunday following a battle with a long illness, although he did not specify what ailment she suffered from.   
Neill first appeared as Lane in the 1948 Superman film, and again in the 1950 film Atom Man vs. Superman, before moving on to the television series The Adventures of Superman.  
Although she eventually stepped away from the role as Lane, Neill returned to the Superman franchise in 1978, taking on the role of Lane’s mother Ella, and again in 2006 when she played Lex Luther’s wife Gertrude Vanderworth in Superman Returns.  
 
“She was kind, selfless, hardworking, funny with a quick wit, and assertive – all the same qualities that embodied the character of Lois Lane,” Ward added in his message. “Noel truly was Lois Land, and for many of us, she was the first working woman seen on television.   
“Few of her fans actually knew her real name, almost always simply calling her ‘Lois’ to which she would unfailing answer with a bright smile and a kid word. It was more than a role to her. ‘Lois’ was someone she believed in and a character she happily and warmly embraced.”  
Neill is survived by her husband Hal Lierly.
