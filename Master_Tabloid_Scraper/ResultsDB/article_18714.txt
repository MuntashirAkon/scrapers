Lois Lilienstein of Sharon, Lois & Bram Has Died/n
Lois Lilienstein of Canadian children’s music group Sharon, Lois & Bram died Wednesday night. She was 78.  
The performer – best known for the trio’s song “Skinnamarink” from their preschool show Sharon, Lois & Bram’s Elephant Show – was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer this past October and died peacefully at her Toronto home, her son David told Canada’s CBC News.  
“She was just a normal, everyday person that had a phenomenal sense of music inside her,” he told the outlet, adding that she enjoyed being a grandmother and cooking. The family is planning a funeral; other public events may be held this summer, her son said.

Lilienstein retired from the children’s trio in 1998 after her husband, Ernest, died, but her counterparts, Sharon Hampson and Bramwell Morrison, still tour today. All three were named Order of Canada honorees in 2003.  
Said Toronto city counselor Josh Matlow, who knows the Liliensteins: “Lis dedicated her career to making children the world over so happy by her music, and I think I know that we are all grateful.”
