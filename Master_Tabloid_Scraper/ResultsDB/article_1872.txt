Johnny & Amber's Secret Battle Over Baby — How It Tore Them Apart/n
Johnny Depp and Amber Heard‘s sudden divorce after 15 months of marriage has stunned fans, but according to an insider, their marriage was secretly over for months! A source told RadarOnline.com that Depp and Heard were sleeping separately as far back as last October, and fights over expanding their family were to blame.
“Johnny and Amber were at odds with each other because she wanted a baby, but he didn’t want to be an old dad,” an insider told Radar exclusively. And tensions got so bad, the source claims, they started sleeping apart.

Depp told friends his snoring was the reason for the arrangement, said the source, but they couldn’t hide the deeper issues for long.
“Johnny was slightly open to the idea of adopting a kid that’s 8 or 9, but Amber wants a child that’s hers,” the source claimed.
Depp, 52, already has two kids with his ex-partner, Vanessa Paradis: Lilly Rose, 16, and Jack, 14. But even as a younger man, Depp was reportedly ambivalent about having children.
As Radar reported, Heard, 30, filed for divorce in L.A. on May 22.
