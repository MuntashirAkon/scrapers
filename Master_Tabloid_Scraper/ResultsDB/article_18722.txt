"Lois & Clark" Star Smith Dies/n
     Lane Smith, the character actor who portrayed Perry White, the editor of The Daily Planet on television's Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman, died at his home in Los Angeles Monday. He was 69.          In recent months, Smith had suffered from ALS, the degenerative neuromuscular condition more commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease.           The actor's family released a statement thanking fans for their support and calling Smith's death a "blessed relief from his ALS."          "He was diagnosed last April and thank God it took him very quickly because there is absolutely nothing you can do with this disease," Smith's wife, Debbie Benedict Smith, told Los Angeles' local ABC affiliate. "It is so hideous. My new campaign is to see if there's something to do for the cause."          "In a way, it is such a relief because he was so ill. He wanted to be at home. He wanted to pass away at home, and he did."          Born in Memphis, Smith appeared in numerous television, film and stage productions over the years. Though he never became a household name, his face was instantly recognizable.          Apart from his Lois & Clark stint, perhaps the actor's most memorable turn came as the small-town prosecutor who goes up against Joe Pesci in My Cousin Vinny. Other film credits included The Mighty Ducks, Son-in-Law and The Distinguished Gentleman.          Smith won acclaim and a Golden Globe nomination playing Richard Nixon in the television miniseries The Final Days. His last film role was in 2000's The Legend of Bagger Vance with Will Smith and Matt Damon.          The actor also appeared in the original stage production of Glengarry Glen Ross, for which he captured a Drama Desk Award, as well as the stage revival of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.          In addition to his wife, whom he wed in September 2000, the actor is survived by an 18-year-old son, a 19-year-old stepson, a brother and a sister.          Benedict Smith said that funeral services had not yet been planned, but would likely be private.
