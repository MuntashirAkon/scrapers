Update: Diane Kruger won't be taking a Super turn any time soon. Following a press conference for her current film Unknown, the German actress was asked about reports that she was up for a lead role in Zack Snyder's highly anticipated new version. According to ComingSoon, the star answered "No, it's not true." That leaves three actresses up for the mystery leading role, but have to say, we're disappointed to hear we won't have more Diane in our lives. Â All right, so we have our new Superman with Henry Cavill, and yes, that is reason to rejoice and be glad. But that's only one half of a critical duo. Who's going to play Lois Lane in director Zack Snyder's reimagination?First off, we can rule out Kristen Stewart. Sorry, but it looks like she has Snow White aspirations. So who are the actresses taking meetings with filmmakers, and what role are they up for?

In what is surely the most argh-inducing bit of casting info surrounding the superhero flick yet, we're being teased that three actresses are on the short list for a "lead" part...that isn't Lois! Alice Eve (She's Out of Your League), Diane Kruger (Inglourious Basterds) and Rosamund Pike (Die Another Day) are currently vying for the role, but according to Variety, the part is being kept tightly underwraps.It's no secret that there are other women besides Lois in Superman's world. In fact, one gossip columnist at the Daily Planet named Catherine "Cat" Grant was pretty upfront about her attraction to Clark Kent. Maybe this latest installment will feature our superhero dealing with a feisty love triangle on the side?
