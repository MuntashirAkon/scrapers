Lois Lane, meet...Lois Lane?!In a casting move made of pure genius, the CW confirms that Teri Hatcher, aka Superman's soul mate from the days of The New Adventures of Lois and Clark, has joined Smallville's final season as our beloved present-day Lois' (Erica Durance) mother.True, Lane's mom, Ella, is dead, but here's how this return goes down:

If your DVRs don't already have a Smallville season pass (we know that's none of you!), be sure to triple-check that episode eight, titled "Abandoned," is set to record later on this season, because that's where the Desperate Housewives star will be popping up in all her glory.Lois is going to discover some old family videotapes that contain footage of mama Ella, and thus two of this generation's greatest Lois Lanes appear on televisionÂ together. Pretty amazing, no?Even more amazing is that all these years later, Teri (who now plays kooky Susan Mayer each week on ABC's Housewives) has an obvious soft spot in her heart for the other ABC series that made her a household name. C'mon, we all loved her and Dean Cain together on Lois and Clark, right?
