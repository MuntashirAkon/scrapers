Since we are clearly hoping Kristen Stewart doesn't settle for her standard lovesick-lady role, we've been picking our brains on which starlet should get the part of Lois Lane and lock lips with the sexy Henry Cavill in the Superman reboot.We're thinking Lindsay Lohan? All right, quit your WTFing and rewind your superheroine movie memories would you.Has everyone already forgotten the stunts Kirsten Dunst pulled prior to her upside-down snoggin' with Tobey Maguire in Spider-Man that put her back on the movie map?

The booze, buds and burglaries (Lohan is in the middle of a theft scandal herself)! All of which didn't stop her from totally rocking the role of Peter Parker's hot GF in the flick.Spidey's original It girl even had a rehab stint at Cirque Lodge treatment center in Utah—one of Lohan's many stops—due to alleged alcohol and substance abuse problems, rumors she later dispelled as a battle with depression. Whatever the reason for rehabbin', Dunst was known as a regular in the L.A. party scene, spending late nights right alongside LiLo at Le Deux, we'll have you know!I mean, can you blame the girl? We're sure Kirsten's flip-flopping relaysh with Jake Gyllenhaal didn't do her depression any good.On a brighter note, we can't help but wonder if maybe Lindsay—despite all her supposed substance issues—could give director Zack Snyder the Lois performance the rest of these ladies just can't.And let's not forget, if Lohan did play Loi, she would finally have to dye that hideous blonde hair. We always digged her auburn dreads anyways.What do you all think? Could Lindsay land Lois and comeback like Dunst did?
