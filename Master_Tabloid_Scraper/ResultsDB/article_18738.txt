Everybody Loves Brandon/nOn June 28, the world will finally get a good look at perhaps the most anticipated movie hero of the decade. Yes, in just a few short weeks, 'Superman Returns.' Brandon Routh, who plays the dreamy alien hero (as well as his bumbling alter-ego, Clark Kent) has a lot to live up to. Few actors were as beloved as Christopher Reeve, who donned the red cape 25 years ago. r But Brandon has some friends in his corner, including Kevin Spacey and Kate Bosworth, who play Lex Luthor and Lois Lane, respectively. Spacey says,  "He embodies what people want out of their Superman. "  r Bosworth says that after her audition with Routh that she didn't care if she got the role or not, but that  "it's going to be such a great film, and you're gonna be great. You really are. " r All of that praise doesn't seem to have gone to Brandon Routh's head. Maybe in addition to resembling Christopher in his face, physique and even voice, Brandon also has a bit of the famous Reeve modesty as well. r  r Â /n
