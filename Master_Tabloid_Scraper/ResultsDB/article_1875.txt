“In response to this threatened public outing against my will, I had a prepared a statement that was one part piss, one part vinegar and 12 parts gasoline,” she wrote in the statement.
“My sister Lana and I have largely avoided the press,” she continued, noting her need privacy. “I find talking about my art frustratingly tedious and talking about myself a wholly mortifying experience. I knew at some point I would have to come out publicly. You know, when you’re living as an out transgender person it’s…kind of difficult to hide. I just wanted — needed some time to get my head right, to feel comfortable. But apparently I don’t get to decide this.”
“So yeah, I’m transgender,” she added. “And yeah, I’ve transitioned.”
