Buzz Aldrin Divorce -- LET ME IN MY DAMN HOUSE!/nHe may have walked on the moon ... but soon-to-be-divorced Buzz Aldrin wasn't allowed to walk into his OWN HOUSE to get his stuff back from his estranged wife without being MONITORED by THREE people ... TMZ has learned. Buzz's 3rd wife Lois Driggs Cannon hates the astronaut so much, that ever since he moved out of their L.A home a few months ago ... she refused to let him pick up his stuff unsupervised because she feared he would steal property that partly belongs to her. But Buzz didn't want to have to go back into the home while Lois was there ... because he hates her too ... so the two sides worked out a compromise. According to court docs, obtained by TMZ, Buzz was allowed to enter the home on August 17 -- between the hours of 1-5 PM -- as long as his lawyer, Lois' lawyer and a 3rd party were there to make sure he didn't jack anything that didn't belong to him. Sources close to the situation tell us the plan went off without a hitch -- and Buzz was able to retrieve his clothes, medications, computer stuff and a treasured family picture during the supervised visit.One small step for man .../n
