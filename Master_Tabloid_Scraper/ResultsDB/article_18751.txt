Tracy McGrady -- Your MLB Chances Are WEAK ... Says Dean Cain/nTracy McGrady has a snowball's chance in hell when it comes to making an MLB roster ... so says Superman himself, Dean Cain. The former  "Lois & Clark " star -- who played a little pro football back in the '80s -- was brutally honest about the NBA star's future the other day ... telling us the odds of McGrady getting a pro pitching gig are  "very, very slim. "As we previously reported, McGrady is gunning for a spot on an independent pro team in TX ... and says he's been working out every day with a pitching coach to make his baseball dream come true. But even though Cain says he's rooting for Tracy to succeed -- Dean says there's a point where he's gotta be honest with himself ... it probably ain't gonna happen./n
