“Austin is sleeping a lot and mending physically and mentally, then Friday we start treatments up here in Tampa for his 3rd degree burns on his hand, and possible nerve damage surgery,” Autin’s father Kyle Dunn wrote via Facebook on Tuesday.
As seen in the shocking clip, co-workers ran to Austin’s aid as soon as they saw him collapse. He was sent to the hospital with third-degree burns all over his body and a bleeding in his brain.
According to his dad, “He has nerve damage down both legs,” where the electricity also exited.

Warning lighting systems in the airport were reportedly activated when the lightning hit, so it is uncertain how the tragic accident occurred.
