Although the vet recommended that the American Crime Story actress put the pooch down to end "her suffering," the 45-year-old saw the dog's wagging tail and refused to give up hope.
She posted: 




💔Please say prayers for Ducky. She had a terrible accident this evening . The vet recommended ending her suffering. But when her tail wagged, I couldn't do it. We are going ahead to try to put her body and organs back together. She is our home. We ask for this miracle. Please say a word. Arthur's heart is broken. 🐾💔A post shared by Selma Blair (@therealselmablair) on Aug 16, 2017 at 10:01pm PDT


Unfortunately, hours later, Ducky passed away, leaving Blair and her family — including 6-year-old son Arthur — feeling "broken."




Run with the angels. We miss you so much. So much, sweet girl. Please send us our next dog. With the spirit of you and wink. Our hearts are broken.A post shared by Selma Blair (@therealselmablair) on Aug 17, 2017 at 7:55am PDT
