 Jay Z's Alleged Love Child Goes To Federal Court Alleging Fraud & Corruption In Paternity.../n
Jay Z‘s alleged love child, Rymir Satterthwaite, has gone to federal court, demanding that they take action in his case, which his attorneys insist has been riddled with fraud, corruption, and collusion!
Satterthwaite’s case has been championed by the Family Civil Liberties Union (FCLU), which alleges that attorneys have colluded with employees of the local court system, conspiring to withhold essential documents from the petitioner’s counsel.
Accordingly, Satterthwaite has filed a Notice of Federal Younger Doctrine in the Superior Court of New Jersey, asserting that local dereliction of duty has amounted to a violation of his constitutional rights. Moreover, he has asked for an FBI investigation into “corruption such as but not limited to mail fraud, consumer fraud, RICO” on the part of the NJ Camden County Trial Court Family Part.

As Radar reported, Satterthwaite’s camp has been fighting since 2011 to get recognition of the 22-year-old’s paternity. “This is about making sure that Jay Z is held responsible for the emotional damage that he has caused Rymir,” Satterthwaite’s former guardian, Lillie Collie told Radar. “Rymir not only looks identical to Jay Z, but he really, really looks a lot like Jay Z’s mother, who is Rymir’s grandmother. Unfortunately, for Rymir, he has an entire family that he will never be able to know.”

However, while the family insists that the case is “not about the money at all,” ultimately, the lengthy delays in the case threaten their pursuit of justice for Satterthwaite. “The family has not gotten paid one cent since this story came out,” Collie revealed. “It is costing us a lot of money to proceed.” /n
