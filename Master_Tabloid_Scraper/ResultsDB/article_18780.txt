First Twitter Reactions To Wonder Woman Are GREAT ‚Äî And Relieved!/n

There are people who don't think a female superhero film can succeed. Female directors are consistently overlooked for big Hollywood action films. The DCEU has suffered in the review department lately, and could really use a win.
It's unfair for so much burden to be placed on one movie's shoulders, but if anyone is strong enough to bear the burden, it's Wonder Woman.

The embargo for social media reactions was lifted on Thursday night, so critics who got to see early press screenings could finally give us their first impressions.
And so far, so good! Especially for stars Gal Gadot and Chris Pine!
See the (understandably) relieved reactions (below)! 

Happy to report 'Wonder Woman' is a blast and @GalGadot is fantastic. Her chemistry with Chris Pine is magnetic. Absolutely recommended. pic.twitter.com/VPW4QW3IhM

Loved WONDER WOMAN. She reminds me of Christopher Reeve's Superman: true north superhero w/ no angst or cynicism, which is needed right now.

Gadot and Pine have great, funny banter together. The backdrop of WWI is bleak, but the characters never are. I rooted for them.

Smart, funny, romantic, genuinely moving. And incredible, all-female fight scenes! The Amazons' battle made me cry happy tears.

It wasn't 100% positive, but even those with complaints had some very nice things to say:

I can finally share my thoughts on #WonderWoman! I really loved it; it's not perfect, but its charms won me over. @GalGadot is WONDERful.

Can't say I loved all of #WonderWoman but there's a ton of great stuff - especially Gal Gadot, Chris Pine and Themyscira.

Pacing is a problem in the 2nd half but charisma & chemistry, and emphasis on hope & heart left me eager for another watch. #WonderWoman

3. Rough parts? Sure. But guys, guys, YOU GUYS! You'll truly LAUGH. And you'll walk out, for once, feeling downright inspired by a DC movie.
