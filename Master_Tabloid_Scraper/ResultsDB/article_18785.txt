The first trailer Lifetime’s authorized biopic of Britney Spears has been release, and it’s… something.

The 30-second clip includes various fictionalized highlights from Spears’ career — including her wedding with Kevin Federline and the time she shaved her head during her 2007 breakdown — as Australian actress Natasha Bassett does her best to mimic the singer’s slight southern accent in a voiceover.
“I’m not going to say I was fine, because I wasn’t,” she says. “I wanna be strong for my fans.”

As previously reported, Spears’ team did not approve or authorize the making of this film, saying in a statement that she “will not be contributing in any way, shape or form to the Lifetime biopic” nor does it have her blessing.
Now called Britney Ever After, the TV movie airs February 18.
