Charlie Sheen apologized to Rihanna for calling her “that b**ch” on a recent episode of Watch What Happens Live.

In case you missed the inciting incident, WWHL host Andy Cohen asked Sheen about his heated Twitter engagement with Rihanna in 2014 in which he confronted the singer about refusing to meet his then-fiancée when they found themselves in the same restaurant one evening.
“No biggie for me; it would have been 84 interminable seconds of chugging Draino and ‘please kill me now’ that I’d never get back,” tweeted Sheen at the time. “My Gal, however, was NOT OK with it. Nice impression you left behind, Bday or not. Sorry we’re not KOOL enough to warrant a blessing from the Princess. (Or in this case the Village idiot.)”

In response, Rihanna changed her Twitter background to a photo of her signing an autograph and tweeted out, “If that old queen don’t get ha diapers out of a bunch…”
Returning to the present, Sheen replied to Cohen’s inquiry about the feud by saying, “That b**ch. She abandoned common courtesy and common sense.” But on Tuesday (Jan. 17, 2017), Sheen apologized on Twitter, still in poem format.

On the same episode of WWHL, Sheen ranked his former female co-stars from most- to least-favorite, but he hasn’t written a Twitter apology poem to Selma Blair or Jenny McCarthy about that quite yet.
