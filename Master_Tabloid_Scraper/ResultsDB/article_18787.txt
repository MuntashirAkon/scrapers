In June, Selma Blair began sobbing and making bizarre statements while on a flight returning to L.A. from Cancun, Mexico with her four-year-old son Arthur and her ex-husband Jason Bleick. When her plane landed, she was met by paramedics and carried off the plane on a stretcher. Now, six months later, the 44-year-old actress is offering an update on her health.
