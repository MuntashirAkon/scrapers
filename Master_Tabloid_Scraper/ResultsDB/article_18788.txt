Selma Blair takes full responsibility for the in-flight episode that caused her to be removed from a plane back in June.

Blair appeared on The Talk on Wednesday (Oct. 19, 2016) and discussed the events that led to her outburst as she returned from a Father’s Day vacation to Mexico.
“I am someone that should never drink and I rarely do and I don’t drink anymore, but I did,” Blair began. “I was going through something. I had a glass of wine, someone gave me a pill that I thought was something that I had taken before, which I don’t take on a regular basis. It was something completely different.”

The actress described her breakdown as “disruptive,” calling it a “total psychotic blackout.”
“It was horrible and frightening and I had empathy for myself actually, afterwards, because actually, it was so out of character for me, especially now that I am a mother,” Blair said, noting that she took the pill since her son was asleep and under the care of his father, her ex-boyfriend Jason Bleick.
“I keep it alive in me, with me, every day,” she explained. “I forgive myself, but I keep it alive like things can go really wrong and humiliating.”
