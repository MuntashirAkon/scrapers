As previously reported, Blair was removed from her plane flying from Cancun to L.A. on a stretcher after a midflight meltdown in which she began crying and talking about an unnamed man she was afraid of.
The actress later apologized in a statement to Vanity Fair, admitting to mixing her medication with alcohol which caused her to black out. “I made a big mistake yesterday. After a lovely trip with my son and his Dad, I mixed alcohol with medication, and that caused me to black out and led me to say and do things that I deeply regret. My son was with his Dad asleep with his headphones on, so there is that saving grace. I take this very seriously, and I apologize to all of the passengers and crew that I disturbed and am thankful to all of the people who helped me in the aftermath. I am a flawed human being who makes mistakes and am filled with shame over this incident. I am truly very sorry.”
