Actress Selma Blair reportedly had a rough time on a plane flying from Cancun, Mexico to LAX, breaking down during the flight. She was met by an ambulance upon landing.
Witnesses on the flight told TMZ Blair started crying and talking about being afraid of an unnamed male after allegedly combining wine with medication. She reportedly said, “He burns my private parts. He won’t let me eat or drink. He beats me. He’s going to kill me.”
People reports she “was met by paramedics at LAX as soon as her plane arrived,” and they removed her from the aircraft on a stretcher, taking her to a hospital.
Blair was apparently returning home from a vacation with her 4-year-old son, Arthur, and ex-Jason Bleick, as a special Father’s Day getaway.
