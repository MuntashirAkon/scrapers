Selma Blair Opens Up About Her "Terrifying" Plane Outburst: "I Had a Total Psychotic Blackout"/n
Back in June, Selma was removed from a Delta flight after having an outburst mid-fight. The actress, who was on a getaway with her four-year-old son and ex for Father's Day, asked for forgiveness one day after the incident."I made a big mistake yesterday," she told Vanity Fair. "I am a flawed human being who makes mistakes and am filled with shame over this incident. I am truly very sorry."Contrary to reports, Selma told viewers Wednesday afternoon that she was taken to a clinic instead of the hospital where she was given an IV and an assessment. She was able to go home two hours later.

"My son was with his father and he had slept through it. I knew he was going to sleep. He had headphones on and that's why I took this pill...bad choice all around," Selma admitted. "Totally own it, it will not happen again."If the actress is offered a glass of alcohol today, she will politely decline. And if you keep asking, she has one joke ready to go: "Google me.""I keep it alive in me with me every day," she shared with Sharon Osbourne, Aisha Tyler and the rest of the co-hosts. "I forgive myself, but I keep it alive like things can go really wrong and humiliating."
