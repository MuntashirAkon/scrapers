Alice Eve Tells Jimmy Kimmel: NASA Knows Aliens Exist!/n
"J.Jâ€¦.said he sat next to an astronaut once who had told him that he had seen 'forms or shapes' that make him believe in alien life which you know is really scary," the blonde beauty told Kimmel, taking a deep breath."And exciting," replied Jimmy."And exciting," Eve said in agreement. "And so the response the NASA base gave us when J.J. asked this question, 'Have you seen alien life,' was so rehearsed and so clear that they have seen [aliens]."

She then quipped that she could be "abducted" for suggesting such a thing.For his part, Kimmel agreed with her that aliens do exist, citing the odds in his mind were just too good for humans not to run across them.The final frontier indeed. Star Trek Into Darkness is now in theaters.
