Selma Blair is apologizing for her actions yesterday.The actress was removed from a Delta flight returning to Los Angeles from Cancun on Monday and taken to a local hospital after she had an outburst mid-flight. The actress, who was on a getaway with her 4-year-old son Arthur and ex Jason Bleick for Father's Day, explained what happened and is asking for forgiveness."I made a big mistake yesterday. After a lovely trip with my son and his Dad, I mixed alcohol with medication, and that caused me to black out and led me to say and do things that I deeply regret," Blair told Vanity Fair."My son was with his Dad asleep with his headphones on, so there is that saving grace. I take this very seriously, and I apologize to all of the passengers and crew that I disturbed and am thankful to all of the people who helped me in the aftermath. I am a flawed human being who makes mistakes and am filled with shame over this incident. I am truly very sorry." 

The Los Angeles Fire Department told E! News at the time of the incident that they responded to a call at "2:54 p.m. for an individual that was sick on a plane and transported the individual to a local hospital."TMZ, who first reported the story, shared that the actress was enjoying a glass of wine in first class when she started to cry and talk about fears regarding an unidentified man. "He burns my private parts. He won't let me eat or drink," she reportedly stated. "He beats me. He's going to kill me."The outburst happened after what seemed to be a very enjoyable weekend away at the Hard Rock Hotel Rivera Maya where Blair indulged in a massage at the Rock Spa and relaxed with their hydrotherapy services. "Arthur was so happy to spend the weekend with his family, giving his mom lots of hugs and kisses on their beach getaway," a source told E! News."Selma and Jason got cozy in a cabana where they played with son, Arthur, and the family was spotted laughing, building sand castles and playing beach games. The actress had a relaxing and healthy weekend, where she worked out daily and spent time with her family."
