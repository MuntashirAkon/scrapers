Former Real Housewives Of Atlanta star Kim Zolciak has been very vocal about her love for both wigs and plastic surgery, and famously saying on an episode of Housewives that some people go to the gym, while others go to the doctor. Now, it seems that all of those long hours at the surgeon have finally paid off!
Zolciak took to Instagram to show off her precision cut body, clad in a bikini from Shahs Of Sunset star Lilly Ghalichi‘s line. The strappy crimson bikini wrapped around her narrow waist and lifted her surgically enhanced bust while her barely there bikini bottoms covered only the essentials and revealed a sizable thigh gap.
