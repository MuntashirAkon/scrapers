Sarah Michelle Gellar & Selma Blair -- Awesome Intentions!! Sucking Face While Reese Witherspoon Watches/nSarah Michelle Gellar and Selma Blair recreated their epic  "Cruel Intentions " make out scene last night -- and it was just as epic ... 16 years later. Reese Witherspoon made it a full reunion -- but she kept her tongue in her mouth -- as the former co-stars went to a musical parody of   "Cruel Intentions " that plays in Hollywood.  The ladies seemed to have a great time ... Reese even called it her  "best girl night of the year.” It gets our vote too, Reese ... based on the kiss alone./n
