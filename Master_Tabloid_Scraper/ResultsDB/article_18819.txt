Mary-Kate's Miracle/nJust when we thought it wasn't possible, Mary-Kate Olsen has provided us with a post-Christmas miracle -- by finally giving up those wretched witch boots! Praise the lord!For the first time in months, the itty-bitty millionairette was seen wearing something other than the heels from hell. Here, she's seen in platform jackboots, with apparently itchy leggings. Behold the Olsen twin, who was delivered from the East by private plane to Los Angeles along with friend Selma Blair and Mary Kate's British boytoy, Max Snow.
