The two women “will be asked about the heartbreaking story of their captivity, their dramatic escape,” and “how they are rebuilding their lives” in the wake of the longtime trauma in Castro’s house of horrors.
The women will also open up about their upcoming book Hope: A Memoir of Survival in Cleveland, which combines more than 1,200 diary pages with news reports about their disappearances. Prior to their harrowing escape, Knight had been missing 11 years (since Aug. 23, 2002), Berry 10 (April 21, 2003), and DeJesus nine (April 2, 2004).
