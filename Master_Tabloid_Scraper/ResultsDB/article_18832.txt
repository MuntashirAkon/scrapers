Selma Blair Gets Nurses' Assist During In-Flight Outburst/nSelma Blair was comforted by 2 nurses ... minutes after she lost control during the flight. TMZ broke the story ... Selma was flying to L.A. from Cancun when she apparently mixed meds with alcohol and began screaming uncontrollably.   The nurses -- one standing over her and one seated -- propped her head up with a pillow and gave her oxygen to calm her down. Selma was flying with her ex-boyfriend /baby daddy and their 4-year-old son, after they spent what looked like a relaxing and happy few days in Cancun. Selma was taken off the plane on a stretcher shortly after it landed at LAX and taken to a nearby hospital./n
