Jimmy Fallon's Drinking Got 'Out Of Control,' NBC Insiders Claim/n
Jimmy Fallon‘s alleged drinking problems have NBC execs so concerned that sources say the Tonight Show host has been told to cut back on the boozing.
According to Page Six, the issue has become quite serious.
“There were fears that Fallon was out of control and something could happen while he’s out drinking,” one NBC insider told the publication. “Things got so serious at one stage that execs feared that Jimmy was splitting up with his wife over his drinking, but they patched things up.”
Another source close to Fallon added: “He is a heavy drinker. He sees himself as somebody who needs image rehabilitation.”

But a pal of the SNL veteran later came to his defense, saying, “He knows he needs to be responsible. He has two kids. He has cut back on his drinking.”
Meanwhile, insiders have told Radar that Fallon “likes to let loose after work,” but now his wife Nancy Juvonen, 49, isn’t having it anymore.
“They have two daughters Winnie, 3, and Frances, 1; Nancy works, and she doesn’t have time to babysit Jimmy, too,” a source claimed.

As Radar readers know, Fallon experienced two alcohol-fueled injuries in the span of four months last year, causing major concern for his well being.
Of course, the TV personality never mentioned any consumption of alcohol in his explanations of the incidents.
