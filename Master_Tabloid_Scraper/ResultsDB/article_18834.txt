'Very Drunk' Jimmy Fallon Caught Dancing All Night At Punk Bar/n
Jimmy Fallon’s party-boy ways haven’t slowed down, despite previous reports of substance abuse issues.
According to Page Six, the “very drunk” Tonight Show danced the night away at punk bar Manitoba’s this week.
“He was at the end of the bar playing ’90s music on his phone,” one onlooker told the publication. “He would have the bartender hook it up and start dancing. He was very drunk, cutting up and making people laugh.”

According to sources, the 42-year-old didn’t leave until 3 a.m.
“He left alone and people recognized him on his way out,” said a source. “He was like, ‘Hugs for everybody!’ Someone asked for a selfie and he was like, ‘Nah, not right now.'”
“Jimmy was with his staff following the debates and was there for less than an hour,” they added.
Meanwhile, details have emerged about Fallon’s alleged battle with the bottle — and it’s no laughing matter.

While an insider told Radar that Fallon “likes to let loose after work,” his wife Nancy Juvonen, 49, isn’t having it anymore.
“They have two daughters Winnie, 3, and Frances, 1; Nancy works, and she doesn’t have time to babysit Jimmy, too,” the insider revealed.
As Radar readers know, Fallon experienced two alcohol-fueled injuries in the span of four months last year, causing major concern for his well-being. Of course, the TV personality never mentioned any consumption of alcohol in his explanations of the incidents.
