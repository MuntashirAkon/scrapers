Father Accidentally Drops Newborn Baby Right Into The Toilet!/n

Forget dropping the ball - this dad dropped his baby! 
Luckily for him, he also forgot to put down the toilet seat!
 Lillie  and David Davis weren't planning to have a water birth in their New Haven, Connecticut home… but that's exactly what happened this past Friday for the couple.
The mother originally planned to deliver her newborn at a hospital but was sent back from there when the staff determined the pregnant lady was not ready yet.  
That seemed to be the wrong diagnosis as the momma later went into labor at her home, and the couple were forced to deliver the baby in their bathroom!
Everything went along smoothly until the very end when the poppa tried to grab the child but unfortunately let the little girl slip right through his hands…
…And into the toilet!
Actually it was fortunate that happened according to the dad who said: 
"And thank God we were near the toilet because she slid…the baby slipped through my hands and actually went into the water…crying like that. So, when I heard those sounds, I knew that was like the best sounds I ever heard in my life."

The couple are now the parents of a healthy girl, who weighs seven pounds, six ounces, and who they've named Livia Davis. 
The lil' lady will have quite the story to tell her friends when they ask about her baby days!
