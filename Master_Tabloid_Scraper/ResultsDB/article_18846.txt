The Real Reason Wonder Years Cutie Danica McKeller Split With Hubby/n
By Radar Staff
Danica McKeller‘s Wonder Years of marriage are over, and RadarOnline.com has the reason why.
The 37-year-old actress, who played Winnie Cooper on the hit 80s show, filed for divorce June 4 from her struggling musician husband, Michael Verta, because she was sick of being the bread winner throughout their three year marriage.
“Danica felt that she was doing all the work,” a source tells the new issue of the National Enquirer. “She was bringing home the bacon so he could sit around and work on his music.

“She got tired of carrying more than her fair share of the load – especially after having their son, Draco, nearly two years ago.
“That put a terrible strain on the marriage, and it finally collapsed.”
Thankfully, the former child star had the foresight to protect her fortune with a pre-nup, the source says.
