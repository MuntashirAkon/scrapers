We caught up with Bad Girls Club beauty Natalie Nunn fresh off her Saturday wedding ceremony to former NFL player Jacob Payne in Malibu, where cameras rolled on the classy affair for the reality show, WE TV’s Bridezillas. 
“I’m actually married! It was as wild as ever, but what’s a wedding without one good fist fight!” she told RadarOnline.com exclusively, referring to a skirmish in which her relatives had to be separated.

“People asked if we scripted our wedding for the show — no way! We don’t need a script because there are no words to describe my family,” she said. “All I have to say is, ‘My poor mother,’ she tried so hard to calm things down, but of course, they got out of hand.”
More details on Natalie’s big day: Natalie’s dress was designed by Winnie Chlomin of Winnie Couture in Beverly Hills. Moscato wine was flowing at the wedding, where the gorgeous cake was designed by The Wedding Cake Shop.

While Natalie said she felt fat before the wedding, in order to prepare, she and her bridesmaids took at trip to LA Slim Wrap, whose state-of-the-art wrap methods saw Natalie shed 13 inches before exchanging “I dos!” 
“Now that I have married Jacob Payne,” she said, “people can actually say I’m a payne in the a**!”
