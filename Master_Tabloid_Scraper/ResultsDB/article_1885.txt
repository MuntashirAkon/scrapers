Two Of X Factor's Rebecca Ferguson's Family Members Get Seriously Injured In A Drive-By Shooting!/n

Oh no, we can't imagine having to go through this terrible and scary ordeal.
Two members from Rebecca Ferguson's family were seriously injured after a drive-by shooting occurred in Everton on Wednesday.
The two victims, Karl and Craig Dures, were believed to be targeted as they were shot in the leg and face on the corner of Lance Close.
Karl and Craig are related to the former X Factor star's ex, who is also named Karl and fathered her two children, Lillie May and Karl.
A friend close to Rebecca said: 
"This is very scary for everyone. Rebecca is absolutely shocked by it. Obviously her first thought is for the children who are still a big part of Karl and his family’s lives.
Rebecca always puts their welfare first. Her priority is to make sure they’re safe and that they feel secure at all times."
After the scary event, Rebecca took to Twitter to say:


Blessed with an amazing family, we have someone looking down on us counting all our blessings god is good! Fresh start! Bye rat race!

Although her children's grandfather and uncle are injured, thankfully they did not pass away from the scary circumstance. 
The victims reportedly remained in the hospital this past weekend and are in stable condition.
