by Radar Staff
Move over Beyonce, there’s a new hot bod in town and it belongs to Jennifer Hudson.
The super slimmed-down soul singer shows off her incredible weight loss in her new music video, which sees her strutting her stuff in sexy black lingerie, and RadarOnline.com has the sizzling footage.
The 29-year-old has lost an incredible 80-pounds and looks like a shadow of her former self in the revealing video, for the ironically titled, No One Gonna Love You.

And it’s not just her lacy underwear which shows off her slender frame as she also sports a pantsuit and a series of little dresses as she dances her way through the song.
In the video she is clearly having man trouble but in reality things are still going strong with her fiancé and baby daddy David Otunga.
