However, Miz Charles isn't finished yet!
On Tuesday's episode of Home & Family, the flexible diva attempted her most daring trick yet! Not only was she going to limbo under a car while holding beverages, she was going to do it BLINDFOLDED!
The entire scene was so stressful, host Debbie Matenopoulos could barely contain herself!
Does Shemika pull off the nearly impossible feat?? You can either tune in tomorrow morning at 10am/9c on the Hallmark Channelâ€¦
