Justin Bieber just totally tried to slide into Sofia Richie’s DMs.

The “Sorry” singer was recently caught attempting to flirt with his ex-girlfriend when he commented on an Instagram photo from her Flaunt magazine spread.
“Ur so pretty,” wrote the 23-year-old, who broke things off with Richie, 18, last September just six weeks after making their relationship public.
The random message quickly prompted fans to suspect that Bieber was thirsty AF looking to rekindle the romance, inciting all sorts of eye rolls from women who’ve been in a similar situation with someone who’s afraid of commitment.

The next night, Richie certainly turned heads at the launch of DL1961’s new campaign in Los Angeles, showing tons of skin in a black bra she wore as a top. Chilling at West Hollywood hotspot The Nice Guy, the daughter of Lionel Richie was spotted having a girls night out as she held court with model Winnie Harlow and stylist Chloe Bartoli in a VIP booth.
The word’s still out if she actually responded to her ex’s note. Either way, we’re pretty sure Biebs is eating his heart out.
