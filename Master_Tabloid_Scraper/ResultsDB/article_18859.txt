Royal perfection.
When Prince Harry decides to photobomb, he does it with style.
At the Audi Polo Challenge in London on Saturday, America’s Next Top Model star Winnie Harlow took a pic with her agent, as Harry made a silly face in the background.
“When you’re trying to have a serious convo but your agent and Prince Harry aren’t serious at all,” the 21-year-old beauty wrote alongside the hilarious Instagram shot. Love it.

Harlow also posted a photo of both Harry and Prince William in the background during the luncheon.
