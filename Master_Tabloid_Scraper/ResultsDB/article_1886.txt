Rihanna Parties In London After Drake's Gig! Is This Veil Her Attempt At Going Incognito?/n

Rihanna's worn some interesting head gear over the years. And this one's not even the weirdest!
In fact, the red veiled visor she wore to party at the Tramp Club early this morning (following Drake's gig at O2 Arena in London) was one of many veiled pieces she's worn in the past â€” remember the veiled pink beanie?
Her black dress and embellished leather jacket were pretty low-key for RiRi's standards, but her little tiny Chanel bag was definitely an eye-catcher! Once you actually noticed it, that is.
The Bajan songstress has definitely been the one to pioneer this look, but we're not sure if it'll ever catch on.
Some things only RiRi can get away with!
