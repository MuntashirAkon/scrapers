Bonnaroo 2014 Lineup Announced!  Kanye West Headlining — But Will He Get Booed Off The Stage This Time?!/n

He’s baaaaaack!
Six years ago, Kanye West took the stage at Bonnaroo and was BOOED by the crowd of thousands, after he showed up two hours after his scheduled start time!
Despite all that, Ye is returning to headline the Manchester, Tennessee music festival, along with a list of talent so long, it’ll make you dizzy for shizzy!
Joining the Louis Vuitton Don in 2014 will be “it” alternative bands Vampire Weekend, Arctic Monkeys and Phoenix, as well as Frank Ocean, Wiz Khalifa, Lauryn Hill and, ready for this…
