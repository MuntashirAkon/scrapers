/n

Have you ever wondered where Winnie the Pooh came from? What inspired the beloved character?
The first full-length trailer for Goodbye Christopher Robin offers an answer, along with a healthy dose of childhood nostalgia, critically acclaimed actors and the right amount of movie magic involving a beloved teddy bear and his familiar friends. It packs a strong emotional punch. But don’t take our word for it, watch the clip above and judge for yourself.
The family-friendly drama revolves around author A. A. Milne (Domhnall Gleeson) and his son Christopher Robin (newcomer Will Tilston), whose stuffed animals inspired the magical world of Winnie the Pooh during a difficult time following the first World War. Before they know it, Pooh and his friends become an international sensation and later, some of the most valuable fictional characters of all time.

We see in the trailer the fuzzy inspirations for Pooh, Piglet, Eeyore and Tigger, but also hints of family struggle and a young boy thrust into the spotlight too soon following the sudden sweeping success of the books. It eventually takes a toll on the family: father, son, Christopher Robin’s mother Daphne (Margot Robbie) and his nanny Olive (Kelly Macdonald).
