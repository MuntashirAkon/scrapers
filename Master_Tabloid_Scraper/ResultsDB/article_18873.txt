Winnie-the-Pooh Meets the Queen – and Prince George Too!/n
It turns out that Queen Elizabeth isn’t the only beloved icon to celebrate a 90th birthday this year.  
A.A. Milne’s classic children’s character Winnie-the-Pooh was also born in 1926 – and a brand-new tale is being released on Wednesday to mark the occasion.  
DisneyWinnie-the-Pooh and the Royal Birthday, an original illustrated and audio story narrated by Oscar winner Jim Broadbent, finds the kindly bear and his friends from the Hundred Acre Wood – including Piglet, Eeyore and Christopher Robin – receiving a “Most Urgent” letter informing them of the Queen’s big birthday.  
Disney/Illustrated by Mark Burgess in the style of E.H. ShepardAn exclusive sketch created by Mark Burgess (in the style of original Pooh illustrator E.H. Shepard) especially for PEOPLE shows Pooh and Piglet playing outside Buckingham Palace with the Queen’s corgis.  
In the new adventure, Pooh and his pals decide to visit Buckingham Palace, but first they encounter big-city sights in London, including the Tube and Trafalgar Square.
