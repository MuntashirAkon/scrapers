Rebecca Ferguson's Daughter Has A Favorite 1D Member! And It's Not Her Ex-Boyfriend Zayn Malik!/n

We wonder if there's a reason why this one's the favorite! 
X Factor UK finalist Rebecca Ferguson used to date Zayn Malik before her current fiancee Perrie Edwards.
So, it would make sense that her daughter Lillie May, who's a huge fan of One Direction, would consider Zayn her favorite, right??
Apparently that's not the case though! In fact it's actually Harry Styles!
Here's what she recently said: 
"She [Lilly May] is a little bit of a fan, she loves Harry Styles , they used to play backstage in the corridors and him and her they just got on - but she is not a die hard fan."

In fact, her kids like a whole variety of music! Including Kanye West!
The proud momma said:
"My kids are getting into quite cool music, like they're into Jake Bugg and Kanye West, although I can't let them listen to too many of his records."

So does Rebecca Ferguson still talk to Zayn Malik? 
Um, not so much. She said:
"I don't really speak to him, so no not really [I haven't given him congratulations] I would if I had seen him, but I haven't spoken to him in years it has been a long time. It's been two years."

Even though she doesn't talk to him - that doesn't mean she isn't proud of his and 1D's success! 
She said:
"I think it's brilliant, it's actually madness! It's like mania, its amazing and I'm proud of them. We went through a lot together. We went through all that and we all pulled through it."

We LOVE the camaraderie! And we hope the daughter keeps on her 1D obsession! 
We know we will!!!
