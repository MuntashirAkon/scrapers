Also pretty stinking cute? When Channing starts talking about his wife of six years. "...Jenna is a super mom," he gushed to Vanity Fair's August issue. " There's no other way to say it. She is there every single second, every single day. I love being a dad. They're like little mirrors running around. They show you things about yourself you wouldn't pay attention to before. Jenna says it all the time: 'Oh, my God, that is so you right there.' But I don't know if I'm good at it."Well, not every dad would dress up as Pooh Bear to delight his little girl, so we're going to guess he's doing an A-OK job so far. Channing seems to have a pretty laid-back approach to parenting, too. As he put it, "I think Woody Allen was right when he said 80 percent of success is just showing up."

"Conversely, I know some guys that would've been better off without their fathers around," he told Vanity Fair. "It's case-by-case: did you get loved too much or not enough? I now look back on my own parents and have a better appreciation."
