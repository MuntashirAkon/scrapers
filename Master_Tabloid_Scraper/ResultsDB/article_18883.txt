No meet-and-greet on the steps of the hospital for Jimmy Fallon.Resorting to more common ways of introducing one's newborn baby to the world, the proud papa posted a photo of his 2-day-old daughter on Instagram today."I would like to introduce... Winnie Rose Fallon," the Late Night host wrote. Winnie, his first child with wife Nancy Juvonen, was born Tuesday.

"Welcome, everybody, to Late Night With Jimmy Fallon. I'm your host, Dada," he joked during Wednesday's monologue, back in LOL action after having only missed one night of work to attend to baby business."I'm emotionally drained. I'm a father of a beautiful baby girl, she's so cute. Her name is Winnie Rose Fallon," the new dad revealed, "and she's so cute. She's 5 pounds, 9 ounces. "I got down to the ounce—that's how I weigh myself as well. I've gotta lose a couple of ounces."And no, he hasn't forgotten about that other kid born across the pond just one day before his own daughter. "Yes, William and Kate, we'll definitely set up a playdate—stop bothering me!" Fallon sighed. "I saw the invitation on the easel, yes!"
