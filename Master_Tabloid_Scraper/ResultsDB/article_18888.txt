'Winnie the Pooh' Ban in China Is Absurd, They Should Be Flattered ... Says Voice of Pooh/nChina's Internet crackdown on memes comparing President Xi Jinping to Winnie the Pooh is a major overreaction not worthy of even a bother ... according to the guy who gives Pooh a voice.

Well, up until the government started blocking the images on all public sites and forums.

FYI Winnie the Pooh is banned in China because of this image: pic.twitter.com /vAm9HBLK2e— Jason Yuan (@JasonYuanDesign) July 16, 2017/n
