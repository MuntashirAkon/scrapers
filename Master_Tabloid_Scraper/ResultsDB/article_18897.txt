Terrence Howard Ends 6-Figure War with Bitter Ex-Manager/nIn the midst of a nasty divorce with his allegedly racist wife, Terrence Howard somehow found time to tackle ANOTHER legal dispute -- this time with an ousted ex-manager, who claimed Howard owed her mega bucks in unpaid commission. The manager -- a woman named Victoria Fredrick -- filed a lawsuit against the actor last year, claiming Terrence owed her $137,500 for work she did while he starred in  "Winnie " and  "Fightin, " for which Terrence earned a combined $2.75 million.Fredrick also claimed Terrence owed her residuals from some of his biggest movies --  "Hustle and Flow ",  "Get Rich or Die Tryin ",  "Iron Man " -- PLUS over 100 future movies not even made yet. But Howard furiously shot back -- claiming Fredrick was a  "personal manager " only insofar as she answered phones and ran errands ... she did NOT help babysit his movie career, or have a stake in future projects.Terrence said he paid her adequately while he employed her -- including some commission -- but any money demands she made beyond that were BS.But it's all water under the bridge now -- the case was dismissed last week ... after the parties settled out of court for an undisclosed amount./n
