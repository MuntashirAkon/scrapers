We may be used to seeing Star Trek star Alice Eve all made up and looking fab, but she's showing a much different side of herself in the new thriller, Cold Comes the Night.Eve stars in the film (in theaters and on demand on Jan. 10) as a motel owner who is held hostage with her daughter by a nearly blind criminal (Bryan Cranston) who makes her retrieve a bag of cash from a crooked cop.In our exclusive sneak peek at the movie, Eve appears with her hair back, in a winter parka, jeans and snow boots. She has little, if any, makeup on.

Eve sneaks through a dark house looking for the bag. A woman sitting in the backyard doesn't realize Eve is in the home…or does she?Take a look and let us know what you think.Directed by Tze Chun, the movie also stars hottie Logan Marshall-Green.
