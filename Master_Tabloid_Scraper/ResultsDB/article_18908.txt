Winnie Cooper Marries -- Not Kevin Arnold/nDanica McKellar, who played Winnie Cooper on  "The Wonder Years, " married her longtime boyfriend this weekend in Los Angeles. "Once upon a time there was a girl I knew, who lived across the street. Brown hair, brown eyes. When she smiled, I smiled. When she cried, I cried. Every single thing that ever happened to me that mattered, in some way had to do with her. That day Winnie and I promised each other that no matter what, that we'd always be together. It was a promise full of passion and truth and wisdom. It was the kind of promise that can only come from the hearts of the very young. "/n
