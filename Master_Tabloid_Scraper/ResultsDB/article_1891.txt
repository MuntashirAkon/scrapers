Jay Z Might Have a Secret 21-Year-Old Love Child/n
Jay Z’s got 99 problems and a love child might be one of them…
The rapper has been slapped with a paternity suit claiming he submitted fraudulent information to a New Jersey court to avoid taking a DNA test over his alleged son Rymir Satterthwaite — a now 21-year-old aspiring rapper.

The young man alleges that his mother, Wanda, hooked up with Hova multiple times in the 90s, way before he became the megastar he is today. When Satterthwaite discovered that another man in question was not his father, he and his mother took Beyoncé‘s husband to court in New Jersey to take a paternity test. However, the case was dismissed on the basis that Jay Z did not live in New Jersey at the time and therefore the N.J. courts did not have the jurisdiction to preside over the proceedings.
The dismissal opened the door for Lillie Coley (Satterthwaite’s legal guardian and paralegal) to file suit again in Dec., claiming the rapper lied about where he resided and provided false information to the court. She also claims Jay’s actions have caused Satterthwaite emotional and financial damages.
This is not the first time Jay Z has been surrounding by allegations over a love child. In 2011, rumors began circulating that he had fathered a young boy with Trinidad model Shenelle Scott. Of course Hova never fessed up to being the baby daddy, but reports emerged that he paid her $1 million to keep his name off the birth certificate.
