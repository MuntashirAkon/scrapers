Josh Duggar’s sickening sex scandal hasn’t stopped the rest of the family members from having their own blossoming romances!
RadarOnline.com has learned that Joseph Duggar, 22, is officially “courting” a teenager named Kendra Caldwell.
“We are so excited to share the news with others that we are courting,” Joseph said about his new romance, which will follow the strict rules of their religion.
“Our families are close friends through church and this has allowed Kendra and me to get to know each other. She’s the best!”

“I’m looking forward to getting to spend more time with Joseph as we take this exciting step toward a new season in life,” she said. “It’s a really wonderful moment!”
