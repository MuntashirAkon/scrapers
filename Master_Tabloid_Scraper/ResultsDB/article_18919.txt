More Duggar Secrets Exposed! Josiah’s Ex Marjorie Jackson Writing Tell-All Book/n
It’s been nearly two years since an uncovered police report revealed accusations that oldest Duggar son Josh molested five family members, leading to a downward spiral of cheating admissions and even a trip to rehab.
While the famous Christian family finally swept the sex scandal under the rug and moved on to a successful spinoff show, Counting On, an ex-girlfriend could drag the clan back to unbearable shame.
Josiah Duggar’s former girlfriend, Marjorie Jackson — who dumped the 20-year-old immediately after the molestation investigation was exposed in May 2015 — is publishing a book, Devoted, on May 1, RadarOnline.com has learned.

The book will discuss Jesus’ influence on “relationships, decisions, standards, convictions, priorities…everything,” the Christian blogger, 18, writes on her website.
As Radar previously reported, Josiah and Marjorie started courting in April 2015. The young writer claimed she “admired” her boyfriend and his family.
But she seemed to quickly change her mind. The pair was last photographed together in late May of that year — and by August, they had confirmed the split.

Though they swore to remain friends, a bitter Josiah deleted all photos of Marjorie from his Instagram page. The former couple has not been spotted together since.
