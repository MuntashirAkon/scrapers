And now Marjorie, who was the family’s close confidante for months during the courtship, has announced she’s writing a new book for fellow teen girls— about love!

“Romantic sparks are fickle and unreliable—here one day, faded the next,” she says in her blog entry about the upcoming project.
It seems quite possible that the budding author could draw upon her own failed relationship, and the chaos that ensued.
Radar first revealed that the pair had parted ways after Josiah stopped posting photos of his new girlfriend to his Instagram page after months of loved-up snaps.

The couple was last pictured together in May— just days before a bombshell report painted father of four Josh, 27, as a sick child molester.

Could Marjorie spill the Duggars’ secrets? Sound off in the comments. /n
