 Bitter Breakup? Josiah Duggar Deletes All Photos Of Ex Marjorie Jackson From Instagram.../n
After the Duggars confirmed RadarOnline.com’s report that Josiah and girlfriend Marjorie Jackson had split, the family assured fans that the breakup had been amicable.
“Both are thankful for the time getting to know each other, and their families continue to enjoy each other’s company and close friendship,” read the post on the Christian clan’s official Facebook page.
But Josiah, 18, sure isn’t treating his 17-year-old ex like a best pal. Radar has discovered that the teen has deleted all photos of Jackson from his Instagram page.

While the account was once covered in cute couples’ pics, the homeschool student now just features three photos of his family members and one snap of a cryptic quote.

As Radar first noted, Josiah stopped posting photos of his Christian blogger love in late May— just days before his older brother Josh‘s sex abuse scandal shocked the public.
Josh, 27, was accused in newly uncovered police reports of sexually molesting five minor females, including sisters Jill, 23, and Jessa, 22, when he was a young teen.
