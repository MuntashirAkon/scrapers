Like Josiah and his 18 siblings, Marjorie is homeschooled. However, the teen is very active in the Christian community, and accomplished as well.
When she was just 16, she published a Bible study guide called The Greatest Book You’ve Never Read: Why the Bible Is Not Only Exciting, But It Will Change Your Life!, available on Amazon.
“You and I are about to embark on a journey through genres galore, viewing the Bible in full blast, high-definition color,” Marjorie wrote in the book’s description. “No matter what age you are, the Bible is for you.”

She’s not only a budding author, but a motivational speaker, too! Last month, Marjorie spoke at the NWA Beautiful Girls Retreat, an annual weekend getaway for Christian girls and their mothers in Bentonville, Arkansas.
“Among many hobbies, Marjorie enjoys playing the piano, singing with her sister Genevieve, musical theater, art, watching black-and-white TV shows from the fifties, and talking with family, friends, strangers… pretty much anybody,” her bio on the NWA Beautiful Girls website reads.

And it looks like Marjorie is already well acquainted with her boyfriend’s mother: Michelle was also a speaker at the retreat!
Last year, two Duggar daughters experienced successful courtships that led to marriage. Jill, 24, wed Derick Dillard, 26, in June 2014, while Jessa, 22, married Ben Seewald, 19, five months later.
