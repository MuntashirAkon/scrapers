Mom Ends Special Wedding Episode With A Shocking Character Death!/n

Well that took a turn.
Based off the name of the show, you probably wouldn't be able to tell that Mom is one of the darkest sitcoms on network television.
In actuality, the basic premise is all about the characters doing their best to battle drug and alcohol addiction while still getting into crazy situations typical for a multi-cam series.

And while fans of the show have had three seasons to get used to the sometimes sad moments on the Anna Faris and Allison Janney vehicle, we don't think anyone saw Thursday's episode ending the way it did.
That's because while we were supposed to think the half hour was all about Mimi Kennedy's character Marjorie getting married, things were flipped upside down when it was revealed that Emily Osment's character Jodi had suddenly died due to a drug overdose.
Creator Chuck Lorre spoke to The Hollywood Reporter about his decision to feature the death of a teenager on his comedy, saying: 

"Even though we're doing a comedy and our first issue is to somehow cause laughter, from the very beginning we've tried to make this show about recovering from alcoholism and drug addiction and to do that without ever acknowledging the harsh reality of it seemed to be a cheat. It would be easy to do on a network sitcom, to walk blithely through the mine field, but it didn't feel like the right thing to do.
It was made more difficult when the time came because we all fell in love with Emily, but the idea was all along to keep the show with at least one foot in the real world, where these things happen."
Deep stuff.
Luckily, CBS took the opportunity to spread awareness and teamed up with U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek H. Murthy to talk about the dangers of drug and alcohol dependency.
