Could Steve Harvey Host Next Year's Miss Universe?! Find Out Why The Comedian Might Return!/n

Forgive and forget!
Steve Harvey made a MASSIVE mistake on Sunday when he announced the wrong winner of the Miss Universe contest.
Thankfully, the comedian corrected his mistake, but it couldn't repair all the damage he'd done.
Since Harvey's blunder, a lot of people have spoken out about what went down — including his wife who is supporting him, to the other contestants who are blaming the real winner, and Miss Philippines Pia Alonzo Wurtzbach too!

However, what matters most is that the Miss Universe Pageant is forgiving the 58-year-old for the EPIC gaffe.
Mark Shapiro, the chief content officer of WME IMG — the owner of the Miss Universe Organization — opened up about the controversy on the Jim Rome Show and actually said he'd love to have Steve return next year to host!
Shaprio said:
"He was funny, he was informative, he's high energy, he's got a great following. I definitely want him back, and I would hate to see him not come back. He's going to want a shot to redeem himself."

Well that's good to hear.
He continued:
"The world forgives, the world forgets. It could happen to the best of us. He was so well intended, and he's such a good guy, and it was really such a mistake that I hope people don't hold this over him other than for just a good laugh and let it pass."
We couldn't agree more!
The Family Feud host should DEFINITELY receive another shot at hosting as we LOVES the idea of him redeeming himself — especially since the announcement card was printed in such a weird way!
What do you think of Harvey returning to host next year?!
