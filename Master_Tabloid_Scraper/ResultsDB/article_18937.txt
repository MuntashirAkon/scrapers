Steve Harvey Attended Miss Universe Rehearsals 'From Start To Finish,' According To A New Source — Who Do YOU Believe??/n

No excuses, Steve Harvey!
After the daytime talk show host now infamously announced the wrong contestant as winner of Sunday's Miss Universe pageant, some thought the mistake might not have been his fault.
Fans wondered if perhaps it was an error from the teleprompter, or if Harvey wasn't prepared for the live broadcast — reports even surfaced saying that Harvey missed the "last hour" of rehearsals and didn't practice the ending of the FOX pageant!

But it turns out, the line flub was just the result of live TV and human error!
A source told E! News that Steve was extremely well rehearsed for the program, explaining: 

"Steve rehearsed the entire show and attended every one of his rehearsals from start to finish."
The insider also ruled out any technical difficulties from the teleprompter, as it wasn't set to display the names of any winners. The source added:

"The names of the final three contestants are printed only on the card as putting them on the teleprompter would allow everyone onstage to see the names in advance."
Unfortunately, these things happen on live TV. No matter how prepared Harvey was for the pageant, human error is always a risk!
Unless the pageant is hosted by BB-8 or C-3PO — and we'd totally watch that!
Talk about a Miss Universe! LOLz!
