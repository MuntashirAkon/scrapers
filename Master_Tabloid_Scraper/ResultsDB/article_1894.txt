Evangeline Lilly is smokin' hot—literally. The 34-year-old Hobbit star strips down for the January/February issue of Esquire magazine, sporting lacy lingerie while flaunting her enviable figure.Lilly's bangin' bod is fully on display as she poses in a sexy bra while seductively lighting a cigarette in addition to showing off her booty in a bodysuit in another superhot pic.  The erstwhile Lost star opens up about her children's book, The Squickerwonkers, with the publication, telling the mag how she hopes her first children's novel will help kids grow and face their own hardships. 

"Back then, I lived in my head. My daydreams owned me," the actress says of the inspiration for her book, for which she conceived the idea at age 14 and hopes to create an 18 volume series. "All of my friends were imaginary. The everyday world felt like such a distraction."Lilly debuted the novel at last year's Comic Con in San Diego, Calif. The story, which Esquire describes as "delicious creepy" centers on a spoiled little girl who stumbles upon an attraction of grotesque marionettes.

"I don't want to shield kids from reality," she says of the themes in her book. "I want to replicate their experience with characters they can hopefully relate to, ones that are flawed, lovable, troubled, courageous outcasts."
