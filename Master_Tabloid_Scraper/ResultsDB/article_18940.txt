Anna Faris has a special guest star headed her way in an upcoming episode of Mom, according to Entertainment Weekly.

It’s a horse, but also, her husband Chris Pratt will appear on the FOX comedy in early 2017 as a horseback riding instructor named Nick that catches her character’s eye. The only problem is that he is the nephew of Marjorie (Mimi Kennedy), who declares him as off-limits.
