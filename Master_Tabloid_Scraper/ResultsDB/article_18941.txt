1. New England Soup Factory Cookbook: More Than 100 Recipes from the Nation’s Best Purveyor of Fine Soup





Marjorie Druker, executive chef and co-owner of Massachusetts eatery the New England Soup Factory, joins veteran Boston-based food writer Silverstein to weave personal stories of the region with mouthwatering recipes in this instant classic, a must-have for soup lovers. Standards like Beef and Barley, Split Pea with Bacon and Potatoes, and Hot and Sour Soup sit comfortably next to innovative combinations such as Butternut Squash Soup with Calvados, Gorgonzola Cheese and Prosciutto or Yellow Tomato Soup with Jasmine Rice.
Aside from the stock-making, which Druker and Silverstein heartily endorse, most of the soups and accompanying sides come together in minutes, producing a quick, hearty meal that few dishes can match for sheer satisfaction. Many recipes highlight just a handful of ingredients (Roasted Yellow Beet and Pear Soup with Blue Cheese; Sweet and Sour Cabbage Soup with Dill; Apple, Onion and Cheddar Soup) and call for little else, keeping recipes simple, costs low and flavors bold. Recipes are grouped intuitively by theme (cheese, chicken, chowders, etc.) as well as by season, ensuring that the perfect bowl of soup is never far away. (List price, $24.99)
