 You might say this relationship is one for the “ages.” (Sorry, we had to).
Meet Kyle Jones, a 31-year-old who claims he’s wired to like women of a certain era.
The age difference in films like The Graduate and Prime doesn’t even come close to Jones and his lady loves. (Yep, he has more than one).
“The things that they’re conscious about is what I’m into,” Jones, who lives in Pittsburgh, tells Barcroft TV. “I like lines, I like the neck feature. You know, women worry about their boobs sagging, I think the natural hang looks great. I’m a fan of platinum hair.
