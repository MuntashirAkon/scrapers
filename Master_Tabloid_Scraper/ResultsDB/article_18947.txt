 Boy band Big Time Rush is on a winning streak right now. Not only is their new single, “Windows Down,” climbing the charts, but their Nickelodeon show just got renewed for a 13-episode fourth season.
“Our viewers continue to love the stories, music and comedic misadventures of Kendall [Shmidt], James [Maslow], Carlos [Pena] and Logan [Henderson],” Nickelodeon Group’s Original Programming and Development President Marjorie Cohn said.
“Their authentic friendship and brotherhood connects them to each other and their audience,” she continued. “Both on camera and when performing in front of thousands of screaming fans.”

Keeping the show on another year is simply good business for the youthful cable channel. The series, which is co-produced with Sony Music, ranks in the Top 10 live-action series with kids 2-11, kids 6-11 and tweens 9-14 across all of TV.
And the show registers internationally, as well. It airs in more than 100 territories and in 20 languages. Big Time Rush ranks in the Top 10 programs on Nickelodeon in its key markets and demos, including Germany, Mexico, Italy, Brazil, UK, Spain, Netherlands, Poland, South Africa and Australia.
