Marjorie Lord, Danny Thomas Show Star and Philanthropist, Dies at 97/n
Marjorie Lord, the actress and philanthropist, has died, her family announced. She was 97.  
Lord died in her Beverly Hills, California, home on Nov. 28, the family said. She died of natural causes, according to the Los Angeles Times.  
“Her health began to fade about two years ago and we thought we were going to lose her in a few months, but she would just keep rallying,” daughter Anne Archer, a noted actress as well, told CNN.  
“I think she had the best parties of her life in the past two years,” Archer said. “She had family and friends around her nonstop for all the last years of her life.”   
Perhaps most famous for her years-long role on The Danny Thomas Show in the ’50s and ’60s, Lord’s acting career began much earlier – stretching from her time as a teenager on Broadway in the ’30s to Danny Thomas and beyond, to The Love Boat and Fantasy Island.  
But it was her “seamless” career transition into a cultural philanthropist for which she will also be remembered, according to the Times.  
“She was possibly the most elegant, gracious and ladylike woman I ever met – like at an iconic level, you know?” her grandson Tommy Davis told the Times.  
Among her causes were the Scripter Award, which she co-founded, to support the libraries of the University of Southern California; the Banning Museum; and the Music Center, according to the Times.  
Lord received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960 and retired from acting in the late ’80s, after a final appearance in the 1988 TV film Side by Side.  
“I would rather retire graciously,” she told the Times in 1989.  
She released a memoir, A Dance and a Hug, in 2005.  
Lord is survived by a daughter and son, five grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.
