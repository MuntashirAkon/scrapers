There shall be no new Duggar wedding anytime soon, as Josiah Duggar appears to be a single man once more.The 18-year-old, who starred with his devout Christian family on TLC's now-canceled reality show 19 Kids and Counting, and 17-year-old girlfriend Marjorie Jackson have broken up after several months of courting."Both Josiah and Marjorie have enjoyed getting to know each other and to build their friendship over the past months," his parents, Michelle Duggar and Jim Bob Duggar, said in a statement on Facebook on Wednesday. "We are so grateful that they each are seeking the Lord's will for their future.""A few weeks ago, Marjorie and Josiah agreed to end their courtship, keeping in step with what they believe the Lord's will is," they added. "Both are thankful for the time getting to know each other and their families continue to enjoy each other's company and close friendship. As parents, we are very pleased to see two young people searching out their futures with God's will as their first priority!"

In April, after a week of courting, Josiah and Marjorie had gushed about their new relationship in a video posted on TLC's website."Hey guys, my name's Marjorie Jackson and I have some Duggar insider news for you," a super peppy Marjorie had said.Josiah had often shared pics of the two together on Instagram. His most recent posts, which showed the couple at the Silver Dollar City theme park in Missouri, were posted more than two months ago.

They had begun their courtship on the day his sister Jill Duggar and husband Derick Dillard welcomed their first child, Israel David Dillard.In the Duggar family, unmarried children must be accompanied by chaperones, usually their siblings, during dates. Dillard's courtship of Jill, their wedding, her pregnancy and Israel's birth, as well as sister Jessa Duggar and Ben Seewald's relationship and marriage,  were depicted on 19 Kids and Counting before its cancellation in June, which followed brother Josh Duggar's molestation scandal.
