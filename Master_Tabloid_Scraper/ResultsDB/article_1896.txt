Ah, genetics. The thing that makes some people look perfect 24/7 and others...Well, some just have to try a little harder.Evangeline Lilly looking fit in a bikini seemingly just weeks after giving birth (she still had a ways to go when she debuted her baby bump at the Ant-Man premiere in June) reminded us that Hollywood is still the center of the universe when it comes to new moms looking particularly impressive in a seemingly inordinate amount of time.Some stars are blessed with that "oh, breastfeeding was all the exercise I needed" metabolism while others get themselves to the gym as soon as they can spare a minute. But either way, the end result tends to be envy-inducing.Whether the baby weight melted off gradually or Mom fast-tracked her fitness schedule, here are seven more celeb moms who have babies at home and abs for days...

4. Scarlett Johansson: At the Oscars in February, you'd be hard-pressed to guess you were looking at the mother of a 5-month-old daughter.

6. Stacy Keibler: We know a baby came out, daughter Ava Grace, in August 2014, but this pic taken in March was a mind-blowerâ€”and inspiration to get our butts in gear regardless!

7. Kate Middleton: Presumably the duchess places zero import on such things, being far too high-brow for common concerns, but... dang, Kate. Here the mother of two attends to one of her many engagements in September, less than five months after daughter Princess Charlotte was born.
