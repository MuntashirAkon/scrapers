Whether you're there to work or watch, going to the Olympics is obviously goals. Add getting proposed to during your Rio visit, and you've got, hands down, one of the best days of your life right there. That actually happened at the Olympic Games this year when Deodoro Stadium manager Marjorie Enya, asked her girlfriend, Isabella Cerullo, to marry her, notes BBC Sport. Please be advised, you're going to want to fetch a box of tissues really quick before you read the rest of this. We'll wait.

Since Cerullo is a Brazillian rugby player, Enya had the romantic idea of proposing on the field after the Australian team took home a gold medal on Monday. "As soon as I knew she was in the squad I thought I have to make this special," Enya said to BBC Sport. "I know rugby people are amazing, and they would embrace it." Um, a touching rugby themed proposal for her rugby player boo? Smooth, AF.The 28-year-old said she was not nervous about proposing in such a public fashion. "She is the love of my life," Enya said. I meannnn, can we get a round of applause here? The 'aww'-factor is on another level.

After making a moving speech to her bae of two years, the couple hugged in front of a cheering crowd of Enya's coworkers holding balloons. If you're not misty-eyed yet, you will be after you hear Enya's reason for proposing the way she did. "The Olympic Games can look like closure but, for me, it's starting a new life with someone. I wanted to show people that love wins." Who else can fill an Olympic-sized pool with their happy tears right now?
