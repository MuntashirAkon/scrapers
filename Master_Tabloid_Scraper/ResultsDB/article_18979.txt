It’s Over! Jen Files For Divorce From Ben/n
Jennifer Garner filed for divorce from Ben Affleck just weeks after he completed treatment in a rehab center.
Garner, 44, and Affleck, 44, both filed their divorce “pro per,” meaning without a lawyer.
Each parent requested joint legal and physical custody of their three children, Violet, 11, Seraphina, 8, and Samuel, 5.
The multi-million-dollar-earning couple did not mark the spousal support section on their documents.

The Alias star and her husband separated in June 2015, just one day after their 10-year anniversary, and after he was caught up in a cheating scandal with the nanny.
They do not have a prenup, so they’ll likely be splitting their vast fortune.
