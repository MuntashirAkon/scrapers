Evangeline Lilly is a mommy!The Lost star was spotted with a bundled-up baby in tow while out shopping in Hawaii over the weekend.So, will Lilly's tiny tyke be wearing lots of blue? Or pink?

According to Us Weekly, blue. The mag is reporting that Lilly delivered a boy.Don't look for the privacy-minded actress to divulge intimate details on the baby's birth any time soon, however. She told E! News she wanted to step away from the spotlight once Lost came to an end."I want to have some quiet space," Lilly said. "[I want to]   drop off the radar a little bit and enjoy a little bit of normalcy."Thus, it's perhaps not surprising that news of Lilly's pregnancy first became apparent not via press release, but when photos of her sporting a sizeable baby bump surfaced in April.Â This is the first child for Lilly and boyfriend Norman Kali, who worked as a production assistant on the hit ABC show.Congrats!
