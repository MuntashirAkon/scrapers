Drama, drama, drama in the teeny-bop world of post-Vine stars on YouTube!

Here's the backstory: both of these guys are YouTubers, of course, and Jake released a video the other day accusing FaZe of clothes-lining his assistant at a club, claiming Banks  allegedly choked the girl on purpose — and that Banks is cheating on his current girlfriend (and Jake's ex), Alissa Violet.
Whew.
Got that?!
Up at the top of this post is FaZe's response video, detailing exactly why he believes the assault charge is absurd — and FaZe goes further to counter that he believes members of Jake's Team 10 squad may have drugged his drink at the club that night!!
WTF?!

Whoa.
Best news here, though?! Jake is losing TONS of subscribers right now — with tens of thousands falling off his channel in response to his (nearly universally unliked) video about the alleged assault.
Wow!!!
