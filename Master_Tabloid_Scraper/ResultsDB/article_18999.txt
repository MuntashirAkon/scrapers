Although Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner spent Easter Sunday together with their children, sources say that Affleck is already dating someone new.

Garner and Affleck were photographed attending Easter services together in Los Angeles on Sunday (Apr. 16, 2017) with their three children, Violet, Seraphina, and Samuel. Affleck wore jeans and a gray blazer over a T-shirt while Garner wore a light blue polka dotted dress. Just three days before, they officially filed for divorce, citing “irreconcilable differences” as the reason for their split.
On Sunday night, Garner’s friends threw a birthday party for her 45th birthday at Little Beach House in Malibu.
“Jen arrived with a small group around 6:30 p.m., just as the sun was starting to set,” a source told E! News. “The tables looked pretty with little votive candles, hydrangeas, and roses.”
Attendees included Reese Witherspoon, “mom friends from school,” and her manager and publicist.
“Jen was in a great mood, smiling and chatting with her friends the whole time as she made her way to her car,” another insider said. “It looked like a great time.”

TMZ reports that Affleck is moving out of the family guest house and into a new home. He’s dating someone new, but “not seriously.”
“He’s ready to move on,” a source told the tabloid.
Garner reportedly “cares deeply for Ben,” but his stint in rehab was the straw that broke the camel’s back. She felt that now was the right time to end the marriage officially. It will take at least six months for the divorce to be finalized.
