Damon Lindelof is boldly acknowledging the obvious when it comes to Alice Eve's eyebrow-raising lingerie scene.The Star Trek Into Darkness writer took to Twitter on Monday to admit that a scene in the sci-fi blockbuster, which had the blond beauty strip down to her skivvies, was 100 percent unjustified and had nothing to do with the plot whatsoever."I copped to the fact that we should have done a better job of not being gratuitous in our representation of a barely clothed actress," Lindelof confessed.

He was quick to add, though: "We also had Kirk shirtless in underpants in both movies. Do not want to make light of something that some construe as mysogenistic."The scribe was prompted to address the matter after being quizzed about it during a spoiler chat with MTV News over the weekend."Why is Alice Eve in her underwear, gratuitously and unnecessarily, without any real effort made as to why in God's name she would undress in that circumstance? Well there's a very good answer for that. But I'm not telling you what it is. Because... uh... MYSTERY?" Lindelof wrote in response.

It didn't take long for him to see the error of his ways, however."What I'm saying is I hear you, I take responsibility and will be more mindful in the future," he subsequently tweeted, adding, "Also, I need to learn how to spell 'misogynistic.'"So far, no word what Eve has to say about the admission. Though for anyone that's seen STID, perhaps the bigger crime in all this is the fact the 31-year-old actress's character, Carol Marcus, is given so little to do opposite Kirk and company.
