Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck have sealed the deal on their separation.

The LA Times reports that Garner and Affleck filed for divorce on Thursday (Apr. 13, 2017) in Los Angeles Superior Court, citing irreconcilable differences.
The former couple is seeking joint physical and legal custody of their three children, Violet, Seraphina, and Samuel. The petition was filed without a lawyer, suggesting that it was an amicable decision.
Garner and Affleck starred in Daredevil together in 2003 and were wed in 2005. They announced their intention to divorce in 2015, but only filed their official documents this week.

“After much thought and careful consideration, we have made the difficult decision to divorce,” the couple said in an official statement in 2015. “We go forward with love and friendship for one another and a commitment to co-parenting our children whose privacy we ask to be respected during this difficult time.”
TMZ reports that they do not have a prenup, which means all of the earnings will be split in half unless they decide on an alternate settlement. Their divorce can be finalized in as little as six months, per California law.
