Ben Affleck just announced he completed another stint at a rehabilitation center.

In a statement released on his Facebook Tuesday (March 14, 2017), the 44-year-old actor confirmed he recently sought help for his struggles with alcohol.
“I have completed treatment for alcohol addiction; something I’ve dealt with in the past and will continue to confront. I want to live life to the fullest and be the best father I can be,” the statement read.
The dad-of-three also showed his gratitude for wife Jennifer Garner, who was recently rumored to have called of their divorce. Though the couple split in 2015 after 10 years of marriage, they continue to maintain a close relationship for their children: Violet, 11, Seraphina, 8, and Samuel, 5.

“I want my kids to know there is no shame in getting help when you need it, and to be a source of strength for anyone out there who needs help but is afraid to take the first step,” Affleck wrote in the announcement. “I’m lucky to have the love of my family and friends, including my co-parent, Jen, who has supported me and cared for our kids as I’ve done the work I set out to do. This was the first of many steps being taken towards a positive recovery.”
In 2001, Affleck was admitted to rehab for unspecified reasons.
According to TMZ, the Batman v Superman star went in for treatment this year immediately following his appearance at the Oscars.
