Roses are red, violets are blue, Joe Manganiello wooed Sofia Vergara on their anniversary with a 40-page book about when their love was new.

Manganiello recalled the benchmark moments in his relationship with Vergara in the latest issue of Cosmopolitan U.K., beginning with his pursuit of the Modern Family star in 2014 after he learned that she and Nick Loeb were about to break off their engagement.
“My friend is an editor, and told me she was about to make the announcement,” said Manganiello. “I got her number from [her Modern Family co-star] Jesse Tyler Ferguson, then flew to New Orleans to take her on a date.”
He proposed six months later and they were wed on Nov. 21, 2015. “Sofia and I have always put each other’s wellbeing first, and that’s how I knew she was the one,” said Manganiello.

The actor also confessed his grand literary gesture of love for Vergara. “I wrote her a book as a gift for our first anniversary,  he said. “It was about how we met—as well as our courting—and was about 40 pages long.”
