Kylie Jenner has always been intrigued by the idea of lip enhancement.

In a story collaboration with the luxury editorial publication VIOLET GREY, Jenner discusses the road that led her to pioneer her wildly popular cosmetics line, Kylie Cosmetics. The reality star-turned-beauty entrepreneur says that she’s always been fascinated by a particular part of her body.
“I was obsessed with lips in general, and with making my lips bigger before I got them injected,” Jenner tells VIOLET GREY.

The Snapchat aficionado admits that her life and career would be markedly different if social media wasn’t a factor.
“Social media is everything to me. It can also be a negative space for celebrities,” says Jenner, whose half-sister Kim Kardashian was accused of posting too much on social media after she was robbed at gunpoint during Paris Fashion Week in 2016. “But what would we do without it?”

Though she is confident in her brand now, Jenner says that she was genuinely surprised when her first lip kit sold out in record time.
“I called my mom freaking out and saying, ‘Oh my God, Mom, this is too much, are people gonna buy it? This is crazy!’” Jenner remembers. “And then it sold out in, I think literally under a second…I refreshed the page and everything was gone.’
