Just days ago, it was announced that Suicide Squad director David Ayer would be putting together a big-screening take on the female-centric comic book series Gotham City Sirens. Margot Robbie will be reprising her role as Harley Quinn, and now there’s rumbling that Megan Fox could be joining her as Poison Ivy!

According to Bleeding Cool, Fox is contention to take on the vine-slinging seductress. The actress has even reportedly ordered several comic books exploring when Harley Quinn and Poison Ivy first strike up a friendship.

If Fox were to take on the villainess gig, it wouldn’t be her first time venturing into the comic book world. She’s already starred in the 2010 adaptation of Jonah Hex.
Now, the Gotham City Sirens series is about a trio, not a twosome. This gang of badass women also includes Catwoman. So, who would be the purrrr-fect actress to take on the beloved role?!
