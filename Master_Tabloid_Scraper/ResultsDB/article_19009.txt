Never did we every think that there’d come a day when Scott Eastwood would take a bad photo, yet here we are.

The Suicide Squad actor believes the Australian paparazzi captured his unflattering side during a recent trip to the coast with an unnamed woman.
Calling out the shutterbugs, Eastwood poked fun of the photos — which feature the shirtless 30-year-old sticking his tongue out as he splashes his bikini-clad companion with water — and joked that he looked like a “total creep” in the shots. (After all, he did kinda look like he’s reaching out to grab the mystery brunette’s butt.)

“Thank you Sydney paparazzi for trying to capture my playful side, but instead making me look like a total creep. Can’t a guy have an innocent splash fight in peace? At least let me put my tongue away next time,” he wrote on Instagram alongside one of the pictures taken that day. He then added the hashtags, “#creep #30s#oldguyshit #loveit.”
Eastwood is currently in Australia to film the follow-up to 2013’s Pacific Rim. Let’s just hope he has better luck with the paps next time!
