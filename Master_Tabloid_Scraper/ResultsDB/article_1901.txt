Evangeline clearly loves motherhood, and it's likely that she'll keep expanding her family after her second child is born. "What I wanted originally was six kids," she told Ocean Drive in a 2014 interview. "I frickin' love being pregnant. I'm one of the lucky women who just had a blissful pregnancy, but I wanted to adopt four. My partner and I have really been through the ringer in the adoption world and it's hard, so we'll see what happens. Life is magically beautiful, and it brings you what is perfect.""Becoming a mother has really helped me put my feet on the ground and given me a very powerful sense of self and a powerful sense of priority in life," she said. "All I have to do is see my son to do that mental check that says, 'Is this really important? Do you really need to be doing this? Do you really care?' It helps put everything in perspective when things get stressful or when there's a demand or pressure on me. At the end of the day, it's our family, it's being a mother and a partner and seeing love all around."

Somebody's got her priorities in order! Congratulations, Evangeline, on baby No. 2!Ant-Man hits theaters July 17.
