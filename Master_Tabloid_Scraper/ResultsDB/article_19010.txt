Fans of the hit A&E show Bates Motel know that Rihanna was tapped to play Marion Crane, the character who dies at the outset of Alfred Hitchcock’s classic film Psycho. Now, filming has begun on the show’s fifth and final season and the pop singer was spotted on set!

RiRi was glimpsed inside the Hastings Street Building in Vancouver, Canada today looking very professional in a grey skirt and jacket, carting around coffee cups at files and sporting fiery red short hair. Before Marion (played by Janet Leigh) meets her untimely end in the film, she works in a bank, so it’s very possible Rihanna has a similarly officious gig at the outset of the forthcoming season.
As of now, there’s no certainty that the “Work” songstress’s Marion is going to die in the shower, but considering how iconic that moment in the film is, it’s a solid bet. And this image that Rihanna herself shared seems to confirm how she’ll leave the show.

“We wanted the final season to allow us to do our version of the Psycho lore,” EP Carlton Cuse told TV Line earlier this year. “We will be colliding with certain events in the narrative of the film, but it would be boring to just recreate Psycho.”
