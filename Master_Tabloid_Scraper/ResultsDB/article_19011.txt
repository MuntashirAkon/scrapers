Look of the Week: Amp Up Your Eyeliner Game with Model Taylor Hill's Vibrant Violet Version
/n
Would you believe us if we told you purple eyeliner was just as versatile as black? If you said no, we’re about to change your mind.
Supermodel Taylor Hill made a major case for the royal hue after wearing it to the V magazine issue launch event, “V103: Face the Music,” earlier this week, and because of that, her bold beauty moment is taking home the award for this week’s Look of the Week!
Find out why you should ditch your trusty kohl pencil in lieu of the statement-making shade, plus a few tips and tricks, from the model and Lancôme spokeswoman‘s makeup artist Flynn Marie, below!
Marie says the vibrant violet liner moment, which she describes as “playful, yet sultry,” was inspired by Hill’s personal makeup preferences, as well as a few “captivating” photo tears she brought along to show the model before the glam began.
“Taylor is great and we both worked together on her look,” Marie tells PeopleStyle on the creative process. “I wanted her to feel comfortable with her makeup and what she likes. She gave me direction as to how she likes her makeup, and then once we decided on the look, she gave me creative control from there.”

And with that creative freedom, Marie decided to play up Hill’s eyes with a touch of purple eyeliner, and then paired it with a “softer nude lip” to balance out the color-heavy liner eye makeup.

“I think Taylor has very captivating eyes, so we really wanted to make them pop,” she tells PeopleStyle. “The purple helps to make her eyes even more green-slash-blue, so we intensified that.”

To get the show-stopping liner look, Marie lined Hill’s upper and lower lash lines with Lancôme’s Drama Liqui-Pencil in Ampoulé, and then etched an exaggerated flick on the upper lash line with Lancôme Grandiose Liner in Matte Noir to create a subtle cat eye.
And because Hill “loves a dramatic lash look,” Marie finished with “coats and coats of mascara” using the Lancôme Hypnôse Drama Instant Drama Mascara to intensify the lashes. “The more mascara the better,” she says.
Wise words to live by!
