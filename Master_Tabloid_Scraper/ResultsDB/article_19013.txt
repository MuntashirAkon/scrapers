Violett Beane, actress and star of the CW’s The Flash: “Like most out there, I love getting pampered, but of course my wallet doesn’t. I recently received a pack of mini Glossier face masks: Moisturizing Moon & Mega Greens Galaxy (which is the one I’m wearing here). And I am obsessed! The Mega Greens is good for getting all that gunk out and the Moisturizing one works wonders on my dry areas.  I love their motto that make-up should be fun, easy, imperfect and personal… kind of like me! 🙂 Plus they don’t test on animals. I mean what more could you want, really? I can’t wait to try out their other products, like the Generation G lip colors they just added.”
