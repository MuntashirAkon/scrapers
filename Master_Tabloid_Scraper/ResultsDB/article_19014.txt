Live Like the Dowager Countess – Downton Abbey Manor Home for Sale/n
For fans of the PBS series Downton Abbey, the chance to live like a Crawley is a little bit more obtainable today – the Dowager Countess’s house is on the market.  
Byfleet Manor is most recognizable as the home of Lady Violet Crawley, who’s played by Emmy-winning actress Dame Maggie Smith on the period drama.  
The countryside home, located in Surrey, just outside of London, is listed for $6 million. Photos of the elaborately decorated rooms are included with the listing.
The manor’s history extends back to the 7th century, and is first recorded in existence around 1086. The structure, as it stands today, was built around 1686. The home features eight bedrooms, five bathrooms and four “reception” rooms on 19 acres of property.  
The manor was also featured as Cinderella’s (Anna Kendrick) home in 2014’s blockbuster musical Into the Woods.  
The sale of the home comes after news that Downton Abbey will be ending after its sixth season, which will air in the U.S. in 2016.
