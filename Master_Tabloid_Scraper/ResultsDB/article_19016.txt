Real World: Skeletons' Violetta Milerman Opens Up About Her Eating Disorder/n
Real World: Skeletons star Violetta Milerman opened up about her struggle with anorexia and bulimia after a roommate she had previously confided in shared her secret on Tuesday’s episode.  
In a heated argument, castmate Bruno Bettencourt called Milerman – shown earlier in the episode weighing herself and saying she wants to be 100 lbs. – “ugly and anorexic.”  
Though the premise of the reality show is to bring to the surface roommates’ past mistakes and personal issues, this wasn’t a skeleton Milerman was prepared to share with the entire house.  
“I don’t think that you can honestly forgive anyone that ever talks about your darkest secret, especially one that you didn’t want to bring to the show,” the 24-year-old says in a bonus clip.   
Millerman told Cosmopolitan that her four-year battle with an eating disorder was under control before she joined the show, but the stress eventually caused her to relapse.  
“With me, it’s a control thing. The reason I do it is because something is happening in my life that I can’t control,” she said.  
But the reality star, who sees a therapist, says she isn’t ashamed of her disease and hopes to inspire others to speak up.  
“I’m okay with who I am. I absolutely love myself,” she said. “The only thing I can do now, the best thing I can do, is to help others.”  
“Knowing that other girls are going through this, I don’t ever want someone to feel alone, because that’s how I felt at first,” she added.
