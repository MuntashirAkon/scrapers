Rosie Huntington-Whiteley Strips Down, Shares Sweet Story About Jason Statham for Violet Grey/n
It’s no secret that we love Rosie Huntington-Whiteley’s street style. We also love how she somehow manages to exude sex appeal all the time, even getting off an airplane (seriously, how is that possible?). And her latest shoot for   The Violet Files, might be one of her sexiest yet. Good news: We have a sneak peek at the photos.

In the interview, Huntington-Whiteley (who wears everything from a fur coat to a bodysuit) shares that, while she loves her supermodel career, she’s also thought about other occupations. “I would love to have the patience to be an interior designer, but I also like the idea of being a physiologist,” she says.

She also talks about her dream movie role (“Elizabeth Taylor is the ultimate femme fatale”), and her favorite dance partner, her boyfriend of four years Jason Statham (of course!). One of the keys to their success as a couple? They know how to laugh together. “Jason has taught me nearly the whole dictionary of Cockney rhyming slang,” she says. “I get quite a few odd looks because people don’t expect it to come out of my mouth. In the U.S. people just think we are bonkers.”
