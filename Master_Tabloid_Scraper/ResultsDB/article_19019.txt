PHOTOS: January Jones Poses Nude in Furs, the Bath for Violet Grey/n

January Jones may play the epitome of the 1950s ice queen on Mad Men, but in real life she’s not afraid to be provocative. “I try to take risks and shock people a little bit,” she says in the latest edition of 
Violet Grey
. “It’s important to provoke some sort of emotion, negative or positive.”

And she proves it by posing for some seriously smoldering photographs, aided by Rachel Goodwin’s makeup skills and Giannandrea’s slicked-back hairdos, in The Violet Files. The star exudes major Hollywood glamour in red lips, long nails and diamonds while showing off her sleek physique — both in the tub and wrapped in a floor-length fur (see all the photos here).

But for all she reveals in the photos, Jones is tight-lipped in the interview. As she says, “I prefer to remain mysterious and have people make their own judgment calls about me than to always have to explain who I am and what I’m about.” She does touch a bit on plastic surgery (“Talk to me in 20 years”) and the joys of motherhood (the best night of her life was “The night my son was born for so many reasons”).
With the final season of Mad Men just around the corner, we’ll take any excuse to see Jones channeling Betty Draper — red lips, luxe clothes and all. Check out the rest of her interview at VioletGrey.com and tell us your thoughts in the comments!
