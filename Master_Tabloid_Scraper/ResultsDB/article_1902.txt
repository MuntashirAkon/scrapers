Baby Bump Watch: Lost Edition!While her reps aren't talking, Us Weekly has posted pics of Evangeline Lilly that certainly seem to suggest that the former Lost cutie is expecting.The photos were reportedly taken on Thursday in Hawaii and, if she is indeed pregnant, it would be the first child for both Lilly and her boyfriend Norman Kali.Prior to Lost coming to an end last year, the 31-year-old actress spoke to our very own Kristin Dos Santos about her plans once the hit ABC show was over...

"I want to have some quiet space," she said at the time. "[I want to]  drop off the radar a little bit and enjoy a little bit of normalcy."And wait for a visit from the stork, perhaps?(Originally published April 15, 2011, at 2 p.m. PT)
