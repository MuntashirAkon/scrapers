Private Practice: Violet and Pete Are So Busted!/n
As Tim Daly teased to us last month, Pete and Violet are so on! After their sexathon at the end of last week's episode, they're facing a bad case of morning-after syndrome. Was it just a hookup? Is this the beginning of something serious? And if it is, how to tell our friendsâ€”or in Pete's case, our friends with benefits?Check out the other Vi-and-Pete sneak peek below. Can they escape the curse of postcoital weirdness?

Want more Practice sneaks before the new ep airs Wednesday at 9 p.m. on ABC? Check out E! Online's Video albums and then share your take in the comments. Are these two in it for the long haul? And what's your current theory on the Charlotte pregnancy thing? Because IMHO she's totally knocked up and lying about it to Cooper and the rest of us.
