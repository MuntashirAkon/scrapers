We can't decide if Zosia Mamet's completely blue suit makes her look more like the blue faced men of Blue Man Group or the blue faced brat of Wonkaville. Not that one is necessarily better than the other.We do love both of the electric shades on the Girls scene-stealer, but together it's a bit too much and the ensemble as a whole leaves us feeling—wait for it—blue!Maybe a statement necklace would help her break it up? Or at the very least a different colored belt? Anything to prevent her from looking like a pre-blueberry Violet Beauregarde.For now, we can't stop picturing her banging on PVC pipes. That is, until she's wheeled away by the Oompa-Loompas.
