It's not a great sign when your look is compared to a costume, but it's probably worse if it's compared to a cartoon...Evangeline Lilly looks sexy as always in this blue, strapless jumpsuit, but we can't quite figure out the outfit inspiration. Is she re-wearing part of last year's Halloween costume? This would make a pretty impressive blueberry. Or is this color in honor of her friends in Smurfs 2—a little subliminal advertising, fashion style?

We doubt the Real Steel star will reveal her secret (or appreciate our suggestions...), so we'll just judge the look for design alone.The shape: fun and summery. The fabric: light and breezy. The accessories: a bit too simple, but that's the new author's typical style.And so we're left with the color: Sorry, but it's way too Smurf covered in blueberries for our style.
