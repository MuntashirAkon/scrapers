Jen, Liv and Uma Push Back at Paps/nHalloween is a day for the ghoulish and garish, but it was the paparazzi who were especially scary yesterday, pushing two of Hollywood's sweetest mommies -- Jennifer Garner and Liv Tyler -- to the edge in New York.Garner was out for a walk with baby Violet on the Upper West Side, when a couple of photogs got right up in Violet's face, forcing Jen to give them a stern stiff arm.Later on, Liv Tyler brought the kids home after a night of trick-or-treating in the West Village, only to find shooters crawling all over her stairs. After demanding that they scram, Liv was polite enough to thank them for not trespassing on her property.But it was a couple of Uma Thurman's youngsters who truly knew what's what, feeding the flashers a series of raspberries before retreating into a Manhattan house, following the lead of Mama Uma./n
