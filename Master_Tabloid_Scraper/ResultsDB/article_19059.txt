Dolly Parton Caught Up In Lesbian Payoff Scandal!/n
Dolly Parton has gotten lassoed into a family embezzlement scandal that’s financed a lesbian romance!
RadarOnline.com can reveal that the country superstar’s sister, Freida Parton‘s lover Ashley Daffin, has been accused of looting the Daffin family trust to fund their “lavish” gay lifestyle!
“Ashley stole my kids’ inheritance and college education!” her sister, Jessica Daffin, told RadarOnline.com.
The scandal started when Jessica’s father, former oilman Forest R. Preston, died in August 2008 and left a trust fund worth more than $400,000 to his five adult children.

But between August and December 2013, Ashley — an attorney and co-executor of the trust — “paid herself $124,000 … without any justification or disclosures,” according to a lawsuit filed by Jessica.
Within months, Freida and Ashley opened the Parton Family Wedding Chapel off Highway 66 in Sevierville, Tenn., where Freida performs weddings and sells antiques.
The two women also lived “lavishly together and used at least part of the trust money to fund their lifestyle,” according to Jessica, 50, and her brother, Forrest “Clay” Preston.
A Georgia judge has found Ashley guilty of “willful misconduct, fraud, oppression, and misrepresentation and suppression of fact,” removed her as executor of the trust and ordered her to pay back the $124,000 — plus interest!

Now Jessica — who has declared bankruptcy and lost her home due to what she claims are her sister’s financial shenanigans — is looking to Dolly to make things right.
“Dolly should pay back the money that went into the chapel,” Jessica said. “It’s not right. Not at all.”
