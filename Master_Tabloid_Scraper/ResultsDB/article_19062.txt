Diane Kruger continued her style streak, hitting the Amour premiere in a sizzling, sequin Vivienne Westwood custom gown. Earlier in the week, the gorgeous German actress dropped jaws in Giambattista Valli, Versus and Calvin Klein.

Tara Reid experienced a fashion flop over the weekend, giving double meaning to the word trashed at Eva Longoria’s yacht party. Not only was the American Reunion star totally wasted, but her dress, which she paired with her bare feet, also resembled a hefty bag! As for wacky, Lady Victoria Hervey got the attention she was seeking by showing off her nude panties under a totally sheer and somewhat sequined R-rated gown at the Chopard Mystery Party.
