From the red carpet of the hottest movie premieres, fashion shows and exclusive events, to the city streets, Hollywood’s hottest stars were dressed to rock and shock in the best, worst & wackiest fashions – and RadarOnline.com has all the photos in our weekly feature!
Mellow yellow? Reese Witherspoon brightened up the red carpet of her This Means War Rio de Janeiro premiere! The blonde beauty rocked a retro-style Louis Vuitton cocktail dress belted in black with Jimmy Choo sandals and an attention-grabbing necklace, scoring herself best dressed status. We also loved her church girl chic getup earlier in the week, which consisted of a pretty patterned Kate Spade dress and Repetto ballet flats.

Fashion fur pas! Kim Kardashian was dripping in animal at Kanye West’s Dw by Kanye collection fashion show at Paris Fashion Week, wearing expensive threads designed by the rapper himself – including crazy $6,000 heels.
As for wacky, eccentric heiress Daphne Guinness definitely shocked the couture crowd at Paris Fashion Week with her bizarre getup. The funky fashionista showed a lot of skin in a totally shredded and far-out ensemble at the Paco Rabanne show.
Other style scores included Angelina Jolie in Gucci at the 3rd Annual Women in the World Summit, Stacy Keibler at the Audi Beverly Hills opening and Megan Fox in Elie Saab at the Friends with Kids premiere, while style slip-ups included regular re-offenders Snooki, Helena Bonham Carter and Cassie.
