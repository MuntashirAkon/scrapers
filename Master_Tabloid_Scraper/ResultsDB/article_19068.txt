 Glamour Girls And Self Tanner Slip-Ups! The Best & Worst Dressed Stars Of The Day.../n
By Leah Ornstein – Radar Style & Beauty Editor
From the biggest and swankiest soirees around the world to the city streets, Hollywood’s hottest stars were dressed to rock and shock on Monday – and RadarOnline.com has all the photos in our daily fashion feature.
Mirror, mirror on the wall, who was the best dressed babe of them all at Glamour’s Women of the Year Awards?  Though Jennifer Aniston and Jennifer Lopez both showed off their luscious legs to perfection in Versace and Lea Michele dazzled in a Jenny Packham gown, our favorite fashionista at the event was Emma Stone, who looked Grecian gorgeous in a head-to-toe Lanvin look.  The Spider Man sexpot looked effortlessly glam to the max in her gold toned, pleated gown and gold accessories, which she finished off with a Jack Vartanian ring.

At the Los Angeles premiere of Immortals, Freida Pinto glammed up the carpet in a stunning Antonio Berardi gown, but her costar Isabel Lucas couldn’t quite keep up. The Aussie actress experience a major self-tanner slip up, looking awkwardly bronzed in her wrinkled Roksanda Ilincic gown.
Other style scores included a boobiful Nicole Richie at the 15th Annual ACE Awards, wearing a lowcut Antonio Berardi gown and Kerry Washington at the Glamour event in an anything but mellow, yellow Marchesa gown.
