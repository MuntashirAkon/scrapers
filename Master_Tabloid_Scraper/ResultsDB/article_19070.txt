By Radar Staff
Gorgeous Jennifer Aniston dazzled in a short, shimmery cocktail dress with a plunging neckline at ELLE magazine’s 18th Annual Women in Hollywood Tribute held in Beverly Hills on Monday night, and RadarOnline.com has the sexy snapshots.
The Horrible Bosses star, 42,  apparently attended the glitzy gala at the Four Seasons Hotel without her beau, Justin Theroux, 40, who wasn’t pictured on the red carpet.
Other stars at the event included Barbra Streisand, Naomi Watts, Michelle Pfeiffer, Freida Pinto and Evan Rachel Wood.

Streisand was given the most prestigious award of the night — the L’Oreal Paris Legend Award, while  up-and-coming actress Elizabeth Olsen, sister of Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, was presented with the Calvin Klein Collection Emerging Star Award.
Elle editor-in-chief Robbie Myers said in a statement, “As has long been our tradition, this year we honor an extraordinary group of women who continue to redefine what is possible in Hollywood.”
