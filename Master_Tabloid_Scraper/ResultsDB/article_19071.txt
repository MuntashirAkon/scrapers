By Leah Ornstein – Radar Style & Beauty Editor
From the city streets to the most happening Hollywood parties and premiere, the hottest stars were dressed to rock and shock on Thursday – and RadarOnline.com has all the photos in our daily fashion feature!
So maybe Amber Heard’s television show, The Playboy Club, was one of the first casualties of the Fall television season, but clearly it hasn’t brought the blonde bombshell down! The out-of-the-closet hottie was the major scene-stealer at the Los Angeles premiere of The Rum Diary, showing off her luscious legs in a slitty Elie Saab strapless gown.  The knockout paired the red hot number with Christian Louboutin peep-toes, scoring herself the best look of the day.PHOTOS: The Best & Worst Fashions Of The Day
Steven Tyler was up to his usual wacky attire antics in New York, adding to his awkward clothing choice with a rather unique manicure – the American Idol judge had stripes painted on his nails!
Other style scores included Freida Pinto in Calvin Klein and Nicole Richie in Helmet Lang, while slip-ups were experienced by Ciara, who forgot to put on her pants, and Katy Perry, who wore a Moschino Cheap & Chic phonebooth print dress.
