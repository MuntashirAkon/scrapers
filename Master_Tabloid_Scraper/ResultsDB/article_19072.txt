By Leah Ornstein – Radar Style & Beauty Editor
From the city streets to the hottest red carpet events, Hollywood stars were dressed to rock and shock on Monday – and RadarOnline.com has all the photos.
Julianne Hough spiced up the Los Angeles premiere of Footloose, looking red hot in a Tibi ensemble and Ruthie Davis heels.  The pro dancer-turned-bigscreen bombshell was joined by High School Musical hottie Ashley Tisdale, who showed off her flawless figure in a Lovers + Friends dress.

Ice-T’s curvy wife Coco managed to grab attention – but not in a good way – at the season 2 premiere of IFC’s Onion News Network. The heavily endowed reality show star and rap wife wore a pair of fire engine red jeans that were extremely ill-fitting and left VERY little to the imagination.
Vanessa Hudgens wore denim cutoffs that looked more like underwear on the streets of Los Angeles, while Jessica Biel looked divine at Paris Fashion Week in Giambattista Valli.
