By Leah Ornstein – Radar Style & Beauty Editor
From the red carpet of international film festivals to the streets of London, stars were dressed to rock and shock over the last few days – and RadarOnline.com has all the photos in our weekend roundup!
The competition was fierce for best dressed status, as bigscreen bombshells were out in full fashion force, but nothing tops a baby bump! Jennifer Garner looked charitably chic at Elyse Walker’s Pink Party, wearing a one-shoulder fuchsia Yves Saint Laurent cocktail dress with lace Valentino heels and David Webb bling. The hot mama hosted the swanky soiree at Drai’s in Hollywood, which raised over $1 million for the Cedars-Sinai Women’s Cancer Program at the Samuel Oschin Comprehensive Cancer Institute. Well done, Jen!

As for style slip-ups, Greta Gerwig looked like her granny dressed her for the Venice Film Festival photocall for Damsels in Distress, Juliette Lewis wore street clothes to a TIFF premiere and Tara Reid showed off her new hubby, her bad hair dye job and her tacky sense of fashion on the streets of London.
