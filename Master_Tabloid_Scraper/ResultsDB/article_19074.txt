From the coolest events around and on the streets of the town, stars were dressed in hot and not fashions on Thursday – and RadarOnline.com has all the photos in our daily feature.
Lea Michele was the queen of the red carpet at the Hollywood Foreign Press Association’s 2011 Installation Luncheon. The Glee girl was dressed in totally fem summer fashion, wearing a divine Valentino number with nude Prada peep-toes and carrying a chic Jimmy Choo clutch. Other stars at the Beverly Hills soiree included Taylor Lautner, Mark Wahlberg, Gerard Butler and Elisabeth Moss – who sported matronly a la mode.

Vanessa Hudgens hosted Hurley Walk the Walk National Championship in Huntington Beach along with 90210 star Tristan Wilds, but the High School Musical grad failed to achieve charitably chic status. Wearing a hot pink dress from the surf line, tied into a knot on the side and belted in brown, with Kettle Black sandals and too much boho bling, the young actress looked more frumpy than fab.
