Get Your First Look At Matt Bomer's Controversial Role Playing A Trans Woman In Anything!/n

Matt Bomer is a talented actor.
But that still won't ease the outrage on the cisgendered star playing a transgender woman in the upcoming film Anything.
In this first look at the Mark Ruffalo-executive produced drama, the Magic Mike star is seen playing Freda, a Hollywood-based trans woman who falls in love with a man (John Carroll Lynch) who has just lost his wife.

Bomer's casting sparked controversy last year, with members of the LGBT community voicing frustrations over the lack of trans representation in Hollywood.
Trans actress Jen Richards, who last year argued that a trans woman should have been cast instead of the American Horror Story alum, pointed out the real missed opportunity will come during the film's press tour.
She explained on Twitter: 

One more thing. Compare Matt as a trans woman and then while doing press, vs. me on and offscreen. That's a big part of the issue. pic.twitter.com/B0AI02YgtE

Or better yet, compare Jared Leto on and offscreen to @Lavernecox. Do you realize the impact of these images on the public mind? pic.twitter.com/Y8CEi3rOlG

She certainly has a point!
But as Ruffalo said, Bomer poured his "heart and soul" into this role — so should we give the actor a chance?
