Did Empire Really Just Kill Off This MAJOR Character?! See What The Actor Had To Say About His Future!/n

Talk about a cliffhanger!
In the penultimate episode of Empire, there were plenty of great moments, but the BIG one that everyone's talking about is THAT potential death!
Wednesday night's episode dealt with the fictitious American Sound Awards as both Lucious, played by (Terrence Howard) and Jamal (Jussie Smollett) are nominated.

But the REAL drama isn't who wins the award but rather what goes down at the show as Carol gets drunk and ends up telling Freda Gatz that it was Lucious that killed Frank Gathers. At this point, Carol is so upset that she grabs a security guard's gun and goes for the head of the Lyon family. The only problem is, Jamal sees this going down and steps in front of his father and takes a bullet!
This of course has EVERYONE worried that Jussie might have actually bitten the dust and it sure doesn't help that he took to Twitter to share: 

I've thoroughly enjoyed my time w/ @EmpireFOX. I love you all. Truth. Time 2 make a record & some movies. #Empire ðŸŒ¹ pic.twitter.com/xeCONIhAlE

Say it ain't so!
Don't stress too much though as a source revealed to ET that Smollett isn't leaving the show anytime soon!
In regards to the actor's tweet, he's probably just helping to build hype for next week's big season finale and we're sure we'll see our little Lyon boy back in action by season three â€” seeing as how it has already been picked up.
Make sure you catch next week's season finale of Empire when it airs at 9 p.m. EST on FOX!
