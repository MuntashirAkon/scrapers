Prince George Is A HANDFUL! Prince William Thinks He'll Even Be Faster Than He Is VERY Soon!/n

Really? 
But his legs are so much longer than his baby's! 
This past Wednesday Prince William flew solo to Coventry's War Memorial Park to launch the Fields in Trust Centenary Fields campaign which will protect war memorial parks from any kind of development. 
But while he was there on this most serious occasion, the 32-year-old dad couldn't resist updating everyone on the status of his son Prince George!
In fact he gushed to one teacher named Gill Naylor about his son's speed! The husband of Kate Middleton said: 
"I think George will be running faster than me very soon."

But that wasn't all the information he divulged! He also told one resident of Leicester, Mavis Jarvis, this his son is already on the up and about! Here's what the resident said Prince William told him:
"He said George is charging around and opens doors. [Prince William also called his son] lovely."

Aww! 
Now the brilliant boy, who turns one-years-old next week, will also be receiving a present from his daddy once Prince William returns home. 
The royal poppa received a beautiful gift from Earlsdon Primary School of a custom made plaque that spelled his son's name out in scrabble letters! 
That sounds awesome! What a nice present! 
And like most parents, having children has brought back memories of Prince William's own childhood! Although, he probably won't have to reach that far back in his mind to find them! He's kind of a baby himself! 
Here's what he told one Freda Jones:
"I often think back and wonder what was my earliest recognition and how young I was when I did it."
Aww! 
We LOVE how Prince William has taken to parenthood like a fish to water! He's a natural! 
But he better be prepared for next month! A child's first birthday ain't no joke! 
We're excited to see what they have in store for their little guy!
