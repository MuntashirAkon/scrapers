Admit it: Robert Pattinson and FKA twigs are so cute together.

The couple, who got engaged earlier this month, were spotted enjoying a nice afternoon together in New York City this Tuesday. The duo reportedly grabbed some food at brunch go-to hotspot Jack’s Wife Freda before indulging in some retail therapy in the SoHo neighborhood.
Recently, FKA twigs told the New York Times that she’s “so happy” to be with Pattinson despite all of the drama that comes with dating the Twilight actor.

I’m so happy … Nothing can impale my work or make me choose not to say things a certain way or make an image the way I want.”
D’aww.
