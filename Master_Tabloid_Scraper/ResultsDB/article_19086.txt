 Twihards are storming bridal boutiques everywhere — just to try on Bella Swan’s gorgeous wedding dress.
The lace-backed gown mirrors the one Carolina Herrera designed for Kristen Stewart to wear during the wedding scene in The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 1. But the $799 Alfred Angelo replica is causing quite a headache for some bridal consultants.
“We’ve had a ridiculous amount of people calling about the dress,” a rep for R.K. Bridal Boutique in New York City told Celebuzz. “If everyone who has called actually buys the dress, it will be sold out in no time. People are setting up appointments just to try on this dress — and it hasn’t even arrived in most stores yet.”

The rep’s biggest concern though was whether Twilight fans were just making  appointments with no intentions of actually buying the dress.
So how does it compare to the buzz surrounding Kate Middleton’s royal wedding gown?
“Everyone wants to be Bella,” the rep said.
