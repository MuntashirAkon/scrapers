Dean & Maya Jankelowitz’s Egg Salad Sandwiches
The authors of the Jack’s Wife Freda cookbook share a popular dish served at their New York City restaurants 
4 large hard-cooked eggs, peeled and roughly chopped
2 tbsp. mayonnaise
2 tbsp. Dijon mustard
1 tbsp. chopped fresh chives
1 tsp. paprika
½ tsp. smoked paprika
½ tsp. kosher salt
2 tsp. lemon zest plus 2 tbsp. fresh juice, divided (from 2 lemons)
4 (3¾-in.-thick) brioche slices, toasted
1 bunch watercress, stems removed
1 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil
1. Stir together chopped hard-cooked eggs, mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, chives, both paprikas, salt, lemon zest and 1 tablespoon of the lemon juice in a medium bowl.
2. To assemble the sandwich, spread about ½ cup of the egg salad on each of 2 brioche slices. Toss together watercress, olive oil and remaining 1 tablespoon lemon juice in a small bowl. Divide watercress mixture between sandwiches; cover each with 1 brioche slice.

Food Hack! “Egg salad is a great base for veggies,” says the restaurant’s chef Julia Jaksic. “Anything that has crunch—think chopped bell peppers or celery—can be folded into the mix.”
