Watch Debra Messing, Martin Sheen and Other Stars Urge Electors to Prevent a Trump Presidency/n

Hollywood stars are banding together in an effort to keep Donald Trump out of the White House.
Celebs including Debra Messing, Martin Sheen and Bob Odenkirk appear in a video plea to Republican electors, urging them to deny President-elect Trump the 270 electoral votes he needs to secure the presidency.
“Our Founding Fathers built the Electoral College to safeguard the American people from the dangers of a demagogue, and to ensure that the presidency only goes to someone who is, ‘to an eminent degree, endowed with the requisite qualifications,’ ” Sheen says in the video created by Unite for America, a group that aims to prevent a Trump presidency.
Messing appears somber in the footage, repeating Sheen’s words, “to an eminent degree.”

“Someone who is highly qualified for the job,” she continues.
Noah Wyle, Freda Payne and Odenkirk noted that just 37 votes are needed to “make a difference,” and urged electors to vote their  “conscience,” “thereby shaping the future of our nation.”
The stars noted, however, “I’m not asking you to vote for Hillary Clinton.”
“As you know, the constitution gives the electors the right to vote for any eligible person,” M*A*S*H alum Mike Farrell said.
Messing continued: “But it should certainly be someone you consider especially competent.”
The stars join a long list of citizens imploring electors to vote down Trump.
A petition on Change.org was created shortly after the election, calling for the Electoral College to elect Clinton as president. The petition has amassed nearly 5 million signatures.
