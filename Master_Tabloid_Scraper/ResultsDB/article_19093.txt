This Texas Couple’s Disney-Themed Engagement and Wedding Will Make Your Heart Happy!/n

Ty Junemann and Ashley Idema just had the happiest wedding on earth.
The Texas couple tied the knot in a Disney-themed ceremony at The Grove in Houston, Texas, on October 10 – and their Up bouquet, Beauty and the Beast centerpieces and Cinderella-esque attire made guests feel like they’d stepped into a real-life fairytale.

Wedding photographer Dawn Browne tells PEOPLE that Idema made most of the decorations herself and was particularly proud of the reception tables — each one with a unique Disney movie theme.
The Cinderella-themed table had a pumpkin carriage, The Little Mermaid table featured a snarfblatt and a dinglehopper. The Tangled table had an array of lanterns. And on the Beauty and the Beast table, Idema crafted a rose with twinkle lights to go with their Mrs. Potts, Chip and light-up Lumiere figurines. The head table featured a Sleeping Beauty castle.

The wedding cake, made by Idema’s sister-in-law, was topped with mini replicas of Carl and Ellie’s chairs from Up.
Oh, and they cut it while Lana Del Rey’s “Once Upon a Dream” played in the background.

A guestbook was made from real vintage Disney postcards. And a sign asking guests to refrain from taking photos during the ceremony was filled with iconic Disney characters.

Idema (with a little help from her hubby-to-be!) even made her own bouquet!
“The night before the wedding, my best friend and I were up late putting together bouquets for the bridesmaids. It was 2 a.m. by the time we got around to putting mine together. At that point I was too exhausted to think, so my husband sent me to bed. He stayed up later and put together my bouquet for me,” she told Huffington Post.

And, of course, the bride’s gorgeous gown – from Alfred Angelo’s Disney Fairytale Weddings collection — was Cinderella inspired.
Junemann proposed to Idema, a longtime Disney fan, at Disneyland’s Sleeping Beauty Castle in 2014. So, naturally the couple opted for Disney-themed engagement photos.

“It was the most magical day of my life,” she told Huffington Post of the proposal. “By having a Disney-themed wedding, Ty and I were hoping to recreate some of the magic from that day and share it with our families and friends.”
The newlyweds, who honeymooned in (where else?!) Disney World, seem like they’re truly living a happily ever after.
