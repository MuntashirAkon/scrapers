And every year, we patiently wait to see what they wind up wearing.Some looks are a little extreme (we'll give you that), but, for the most part, every trend we spot is adaptable for every day. Who says you can't wear a dainty body chain layered under your V-neck tee? And there's something about platform white sneakers that give a cool-girl edge to any outfit already in your closet. Trust us: These trends are familiar, but with a very welcome hint of festival flair.Keep scrolling to shop! You can thank us later.
