Legendary TV producer and entertainer David Gest has been found dead in his London hotel room at the Four Seasons Canary Wharf, E! News has confirmed.London Metropolitan Police tell E! News that police were called at 10:17 a.m. local time and the London Ambulance Service were called to the scene. A post-mortem will be done "in due course" and the next of kin are in the process of being informed, but the case is being treated as "non-suspicious" at this time.Gest was scheduled to go on tour throughout the United Kingdom, putting on 24 shows alongside Dina Carroll, Russell Tompkins Jr. and Freda Payne. The tour was titled David Gest Is Not Dead But Alive With Soul, a joke about the fact that some of his Celebrity Big Brother co-stars thought he was dead.

He was last seen on CBB, but he departed the house after only 13 days because of medical issues.The 62-year-old star married Liza Minnelli in 2002, but they called it quits after 18 months of marriage, with Gest claiming Minnelli violently abused him throughout their marriage. He filed a lawsuit for $10 million, but it was dismissed in 2006 and their divorce was finalized in 2007.Gest was close friends with Michael Jackson and even produced his 2001 TV tribute, Michael Jackson: 30th Anniversary Special.
