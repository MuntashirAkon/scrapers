In this league of extraordinary classics, you already know the power of fail-proof beiges, on-the-mark navys and go-to blacks, but let's reintroduce ourselves to perhaps the most underestimated neutral of them all—one beloved by celebs like Elle Fanning, Nicole Scherzinger and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley—olive.For those unfamiliar with the stylistic powers of the yellowish-green hue, we bring you inspiration for every level of wearer.

The NoviceFor the beginner, it's all about integrating olive add-ons that complement an existing outfit. The best way to introduce the neutral into your wardrobe is through the utilitarian army jacket. Lightweight, timeless and appropriate for all season, the closet staple will keep you warm on your next flight or on a chilly movie night in the park. In any starter kit, you should equip yourself with a pair of polarized sunnies and green-tinged booties, which will add a little depth to any breezy outfit.Chic Nova Army Jacket, $32.93; H&M Sleeveless Tank Top, $12.95; Rag & Bone 'Boyfriend' Distressed Denim Shorts, $210; Joe's Jeans Avryl Boots, $79.99; Vicoria Beckham Modern Aviator Sunglasses, $550
