38-year-old Ashton once even gushed about fatherhood to Ellen DeGeneres: “You think you know how much you can love another person, and then you have a child and you realize you didn’t know. It’s infinitely rewarding. I think I really look at this as the greatest opportunity of my life.”
“But the most amazing thing about having a baby is my partner, Mila,” he continued. “She’s the greatest mom — I can’t even! Like, I go to work every day and I come home and she’s perfect.”
Last October, Kunis seemed thrilled at the idea of more children, telling Insider: “Not today, but yeah, absolutely. For sure!”
