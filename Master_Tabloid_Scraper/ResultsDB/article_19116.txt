Newly Reconciled Amy & Son Jacob Roloff  Take Family Trip For Molly's Graduation/n
The Roloff love fest continues!
Just a few weeks after Amy Roloff and rebellious youngest child Jacob, 19, reconciled in his Mother’s Day tribute post, the mother/son duo, along with his girlfriend, met up at the family farm for a celebration.
“Jacob and Isabel made my Thursday night,” Amy gushed. “So excited to see them along w/ their dogs Luna & Moose.”





 Jacob and Isabel made my Thursday night.  So excited to see them along w/ their dogs Luna & Moose.  We're all gathering together at the farm because we'll be heading up to Spokane for Molly's  graduation from Whitworth.  #secondact #allaboutfamily #lovemykids #graduation #godisgood

After Jacob’s favorite breakfast, the bunch later headed from their Hillsboro, Oregon, property to Spokane, Washington, for 22-year-old sister Molly‘s graduation from Whitworth University.





 And She Did It!  Spectacularly!  Congrats Molly Girl.  Love you❤️ #secondact #graduate #whitworthgrad #lovemykids

As RadarOnline.com previously reported, Jacob slammed his family and their long-running TLC reality show, Little People Big World, last fall, claiming he was “f***ed” out of their TV fortune.
After he later said he was “thrown” into reality TV for “ratings,” Amy publicly apologized for his struggle.
“I’m sorry it was so tough on you,” she wrote on Instagram in September.
Fortunately, there now appears to be peace at the farm. /n
