 Mila Kunis ‘Cannot Wait’ To Get Her Hot Momma Pre-Baby Body Back In Time For Her Wedding.../n
Ashton Kutcher has often said that his fiancée Mila Kunis is the “most beautiful” female in the world, and after giving birth to daughter Wyatt Isabelle Kutcher almost a month ago, the Black Swan actress is telling friends that she is ready to bring sexy back!
“She cannot wait to feel sexy again,” a source close to Kunis, 31, tells RadarOnline.com exclusively.
“She has started a very gentle cycle of postpartum yoga and going on walks with Wyatt until her doctors give her the green light to start intense workouts, which should be by the end of this month,” the insider says.

The source adds that Kunis, who has been outspoken on the changes her body has gone through during pregnancy, “is breastfeeding now and it has given her really large boobs, which Ashton loves!”
In fact, the actress told Marie Claire magazine in the July 2014 issue, “They’re amazing!” referring to her breasts. “They’ve tripled in size. I was a 34A; now I’m a 36C. I’m so excited! I’m telling everyone I know, ‘Go ahead, touch them!’”
“She has been such a sport about this whole pregnancy thing,” the friend tells Radar. “But she is eating extremely healthy right now and will only allow natural foods into her body as well as the body of her daughter.”

As Radar previously reported, the happy couple’s wedding “will be next July,” according to a source, who explained, “They want to focus on their daughter first.”
“Mila is a tiny girl and already looks like her old self again, but she really wants to get her banging body back in time for the wedding,” the source says.
The Jobs actor, 36, and Kunis welcomed Wyatt into the world on Sept. 30 at Cedars Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles. /n
