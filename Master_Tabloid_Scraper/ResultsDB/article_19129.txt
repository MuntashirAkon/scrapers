Sorry, Jackie — Isabelle Huppert Wins Best Actress In A Motion Picture, Drama, At The 2017 Golden Globes!/n

We love a good award show upset!
This year's category for Best Actress in a Motion Picture, Drama was packed with some serious talent — and Isabelle Huppert reigned supreme at the 2017 Golden Globes!
The Elle star was definitely the dark horse in this category, but she managed to beat out frontrunners Natalie Portman in Jackie and Amy Adams in Arrival — as well as other nominees Jessica Chastain in Miss Sloane and Ruth Negga in Loving – for the prize!
After taking the stage, the French actress was in shock over her win — but still gave an impassioned speech on the importance of inclusivity in cinema, saying:

"Do not expect cinema to set up walls and boundaries."
Another slight dig at Donald Trump? We love it!
Ch-ch-check out Isabelle's inspiring win (above)!
