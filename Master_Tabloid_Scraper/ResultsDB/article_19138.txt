Although the ball doesn’t really get rolling until the Golden Globes (held on Jan. 7, 2017), awards season is upon us and so far Moonlight is showing signs of momentum. At last night’s Gotham Independent Film Awards, the festival darling took home the prize for best feature, best screenplay, best ensemble and the audience award.

“When you go eight years without making a [new] film,” the film’s writer and director Barry Jenkins said while accepting one of his awards, via the L.A. Times, nodding to his previous film Medicine for Melancholy, “you assume no one is going to watch it.”

But watch it people have and after last night, it’s prominence at more awards shows in the months to come is now a sure bet. The film tells the story of one of the boy’s formative years in Miami during America’s “War on Drugs” era. Through three vignettes, Chiron copes with his tumultuous home life and his own sexuality.
Other winners last night were Casey Affleck for his leading role in Manchester by the Sea, Isabelle Huppert for Elle, the documentary O.J.: Made in America, and the CW show Crazy Ex-Girlfriend.
