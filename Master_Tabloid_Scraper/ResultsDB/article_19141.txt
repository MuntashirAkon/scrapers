On Saturday afternoon (Oct. 22, 2016), Kerry Washington opened up on Twitter to get a few things off of her chest.

Washington first acknowledged the love that she and her husband Nnamdi Asomugha received on Twitter following the birth of their second child. “I saw all your very kind & thoughtful congratulatory tweets,” said Washington. “So yeah 😍  we thank you. Xo.”
However, her messages diverted away from her family life to address the recent police shooting of Deborah Danner, a woman from the Bronx who had been battling with schizophrenia for over three decades and was killed by an officer in her apartment.


Also the loss of #DeborahDanner has rattled my core. Not only becuz of painful truth that we must continue to affirm that #BlackLivesMatter

Washington added that Danner’s death was even more impactful since she was killed in the community where Washington was raised. “So when I #sayhername, my heart aches,” wrote Washington. “For lives lost and for the lives we must protect. For the humanity we must work to illuminate and preserve and affirm. #BLM“

She concluded her address by telling her followers to go see the movie Moonlight, calling the film “artful food for your soul … at a time when so many of us need to be lovingly nourished.”
Washington and her husband welcomed their son into the world on Oct. 5, 2016. They are also parents to their two-year-old daughter, Isabelle.
