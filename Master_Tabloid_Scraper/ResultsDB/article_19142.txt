Kerry Washington has welcomed her second child — a boy — with husband Nnamdi Asomugha.

The Scandal star gave birth to a son named Caleb Kelechi Asomugha on Oct. 5, 2016, E! News reports. Given just how private Washington is about her personal life, no other details were made available.
As previously reported, Washington announced her pregnancy when she debuted her baby bump at the White House Correspondent’s Dinner in Washington D.C. this May.

According to the actress, her pregnancy was not written into her hit TV show. Rather, the prop department has made it their mission to find things to obstruct the view of her baby bump.
“Big coats, big bags… hiding behind different body parts of other actors. Bigger body parts,” Washington said on Ellen in September. “Like if I’m in the back of the room, it can be, like, somebody’s leg, and I’m positioned behind it.”
Washington and Asomugha are also proud parents to a daughter named Isabelle Amarachi.
