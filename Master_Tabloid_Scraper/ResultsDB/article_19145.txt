They had a date night as they left their baby daughter Wyatt Isabelle, who was born in October 2014, at home for the night.
Kutcher, 38, and Kunis, 32, were dressed down in jeans and black but were definitely on the home team’s side as they were gifted with a yellow Golden State Warriors “Strength in Numbers” t-shirt during the game.
They’ve often been spotted attending Lakers games at the Staples Center in Los Angeles.
