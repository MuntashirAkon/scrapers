It was a girl for Kerry Washington!The Scandal star gave birth nearly two weeks ago and her team of real-life gladiators managed to successfully keep that information under wraps until today, upon the public availability of the child's birth certificate.The document, obtained by E! News, shows that Isabelle Amarachi Asomugha was born April 21 at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. Washington's husband of nearly a year, Nnamdi Asomugha, signed off as the father on April 29 and the attendant who served as a legal witness to the birth signed on April 24.

Hey, everyone involved was probably a little too busy to think about signing papers right away, you know?The baby girl's middle name, Amarachi, is an African word meaning "God's grace," a rather beautiful complement to Isabelle, which means "devoted to God."

E! News confirmed in October that Washington and Asomugha were expecting their first child together, but the 37-year-old actress didn't really talk about her pregnancy until she hit the Golden Globes red carpet with a baby bump."I also feel like I have the best date of the night, my little accessory here," she told E! News, gesturing to her belly.And as her adorable accessory grew on her, Washington continued to wear it well. "I work very physically as an actor," she told The Hollywood Reporter last month. "The biggest thing for me has been the challenge of how to be this person [Scandal's Olivia Pope] with the personal transformation that's going on for me physically and how to stay true to this character. That hasn't been easy."—Reporting by Claudia Rosenbaum
