"They don't get it. They really don't," she said. "Maybe one day."Kerry who is the mom to three-year-old Isabelle and eight month Caleb said there isn't much you can teach them about Cars when they are that young."You just read your bedtime stories and let the world take care of the rest. You just got to stay in mom mode," she said. Nevertheless, the star who graced the red carpet with an Oscar de le Renta pop of pink and Sophia Webster clutch thinks her time of being "cool" is on the horizon.

"One day I'll be cool. Probably not in my own home ever, but one day, somewhere, I'll be cool," she joked. Cars 3 hits theaters this Friday.
