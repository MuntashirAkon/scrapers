Kerry Washington -- Rare Appearance with Baby ... And Ex-NFL Star Hubby/nHere's something you never see ... Kerry Washington -- out in public -- WITH HER HUSBAND (her real-life husband, not Tony Goldwyn). Kerry and former NFL superstar Nnamdi Asomugha were spotted leaving the Ritz Carlton hotel in NYC last night -- right after a nanny rushed their baby Isabelle into a waiting SUV. The couple made sure to keep the baby's face covered -- just as they have since she was born back in April. So far, one of the few people to reportedly have seen the baby's face is The President (the real-life president, not Tony Goldwyn)./n
