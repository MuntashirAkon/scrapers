'Dear Eleanor' Teenage Star Making Big Money/nLiana Liberato is not a household name in Hollywood yet but the 17-year-old actress is already getting the Jennifer Lawrence treatment ... pocketing a cut of her upcoming film's box office profits. Liana's landed a starring role in the coming-of-age flick  "Dear Eleanor, " about two Eleanor Roosevelt fangirls set in 1962. It's being directed by Kevin Connolly, aka  "E " from  "Entourage, " and also stars Jessica Alba and Isabelle Fuhrman.  Liana's getting $65k off the bat for the role ... pretty low by Hollywood standards, probably because it's an indie and she's a newbie. But there's a silver lining ... if the film makes back its money, Liana will get 2% of gross profits. And she'll get a $35k bonus if the film hits $10 million and another $35k for each $5 mill after that. Considering the film's geared for the teen audience and there's already a Sundance buzz  ... Liana could very well be rollin' in it./n
