Selena Gomez's Sweet Siren Style Evolution/n
In a sea of controversial young stars, Selena Gomez is an absolute breath of fresh air. The Ramona and Beezus beauty (who just turned 18 this week!) has nailed the art of red carpet dressing by developing her own personal style, which incorporates sophisticated femininity and electric youth. Truly a great role model for her fans, the Disney star turned leading lady is definitely worthy of Style Siren status.

When Selena popped up on our Radar a few years ago, she wasn’t quite the fashionista she is today. Hitting the red carpet in graphic t-shirts and Converse kicks, it was clearly evident that the Wizard’s of Waverly Place star was comfortable in her own skin.

After skyrocketing to fame, the actress upped her attire ante. While other teen actresses were trying to imitate their older costars in too-mature-for-their-age a la mode, Selena opted for a more feminine and sophisticated look, showing off her youthful figure in a totally tasteful way.

Favoring lines such as Notte by Marchesa, Luella and Christian Cota, the young star always grabs attention in divinely demure fashion. We never see too much skin, too little fabric or exposed undergarments when it comes to this doll-faced beauty!
