Travis Barker & Kids Rock On Over To The Doctor's Office/n

Travis Barker brought his two children - Alabama Luella and Landon Asher - with him to the doctor's office. 
The Blink 182 drummer recently had a emergency tonsillectomy which forced his amazing band to cancel more than a few dates on their North American tour. 
Bummer!
But thankfully he seems to be really healthy as he looks just plain happy! 
We don't know if it's because he's feeling good because he's with his kids, or if it's the amazing weather, or if the doctor just gave him something to take the pain away. 
Whatever it is, we love it! 
What's his age again?
