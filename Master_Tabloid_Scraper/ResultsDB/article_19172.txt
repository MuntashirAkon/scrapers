Luella Loses Financier/n

Well this stinks.
Despite the critical success of her spring 2010 collection, Luella Bartley's label, Luella, has just lost the financial backing of Club 21, the major investor of the label.  
Bartley says she has "a number of options," for future financing, but for now the label is no longer trading.  This comes on the heels of her ready-to-wear producer, Carla Carini, unexpectedly closing last month, which means orders for Luella's spring collection won't ship. 
Now, it seems Bartley will have to cut corners and pinch pennies to stay afloat.  The designer said, "[It] is upsetting not to be able to protect jobs in this difficult economic climate."
Let's hope they find a new financier soon!  We love Luella!
