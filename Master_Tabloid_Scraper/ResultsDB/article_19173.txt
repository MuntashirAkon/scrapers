Kate Moss Lily Allen In Elle UK/n




Lily Allen is all over the fashion world these days!  First, her campaign for Chanel.  Next, her K-Stew impression in GQ.   
Now photos have surfaced from her spread in the October Issue of Elle UK.  
Looks like the camera liked her this time!  Maybe she's taken some pointers from her grandma BFF Kate Moss!
In keeping with "The London Issue," theme, Elle got British designers such as Luella, Giles Deacon, and Burberry's Christopher Bailey to design one-off outfits for the songstress.  That's a big deal, bbs!!  We have to admit, we're kinda jealous.
Check out some highlights from her interview, below:
On being famous:
“I get quite shy and embarrassed, actually. Yes, I think I am [shy], actually. I get embarrassed when people come up and ask for autographs. I think people expect you to have a certain sense of decorum, but I almost find it like being a nursery teacher, having to be nice to people all the time. I haven’t got a problem with that, but I think people expect you to know how to deal with s**t.
On becoming jealous when another female singer is played on the radio:
“I get pangs of jealousy when I hear people like radio presenters getting really excited about new music. I kind of feel like, ‘Oh, I’m just fading’. I don’t feel I am in competition with all the other girls. I really feel this is the year of the girl, with La Roux and Little Boots and Florence [Welch of Florence & the Machine].”
On her love life:
“It’s good…it’s very good, I’m very happy. I’m not talking about it any more. Some things are not for public consumption, just don’t want it to be ruined.”
