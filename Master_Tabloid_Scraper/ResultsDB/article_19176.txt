Travis Barker Goes Into Sean Penn Mode on the Paparazzi (VIDEO)/n
Travis Barker had a little run-in with the paps on Sunday. Actually, two run-ins, and they were both pretty ugly.
The trouble began when the Blink-182 drummer attempted to bring his daughter, Alabama Luella, to the Marmalade Cafe in Calabasas, only to be confronted by a photographer on the way in. Slapping the pap’s video camera, Barker declared,

“I’ll kick the sh*t outta you bro … if I didn’t have my little girl in my hands … give me an hour and I’ll meet you.”

While the original photog was nowhere in sight when the drummer emerged from the restaurant, as it turns out there was a whole other group of paps for Barker and his pals to tussle with and, oh yes, it was on: Cursing, spitting, homophobic slurs, alleged tire-slashing….oh my. 
Later, on his Twitter page, Barker reflected on the incident, noting,

“Paparazzi cried like young girls when it was no longer three of them against me and my kids. Didn’t they remember threatening me an hour ago? What happened to the tough guys with the cameras? It was gonna be a fair fight.”

Yikes; sounds like he’s up for a rematch. Check out video of both confrontations below:
