Oh, Be-Hive, Drew Barrymore!/n
He’s Just Not That Into You star Drew Barrymore arrived at Hollywood post-production facility The Post Group yesterday sporting a vintage Judas Priest concert tee and shades.
Drew’s been in a bit of a heavy metal mood lately. Last week she was snapped out and about while wearing an Iron Maiden t-shirt.
As for her platinum blonde hair, there are two ways to go with this. One is that Drew, 33, rolled out of bed, propped up her shambolic beehive in about 30 seconds and jetted off to work.
The other interpretation is that the E.T. cutie is an incredibly fashion-forward star who has a finger firmly on the pulse of the latest trends.
Well, that’s Elle’s take on it, at least.
The site for the UK edition of the style mag says that Drew’s new updo channels recent Moschiono, Luella and Fendi shows, where overly-styled, dry, messy hair ruled the runway.
Tell us what you think of Drew’s crazy locks!
