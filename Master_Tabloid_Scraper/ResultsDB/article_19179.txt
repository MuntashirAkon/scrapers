Travis Barker Gets a Grip on His Life/n
Looks like Travis Barker and DJ AM are both recovering nicely since the September 19 plane crash that left four dead and both musicians severely burned. 
Less than a week after being released from the Los Angeles Burn Center, former blink-182 drummer Barker was seen in Los Angeles, carrying his two-year-older daughter Alabama Luella Barker to Marmalade Cafe. 
Though he displayed scars on his hands and legs that testify to his recent tragedy, Barker is no doubt relieved to have some semblance of normalcy return to his life.
Earlier this month, he told Us Weekly that one of the worst aspects of his hospitalization was not being able to see Alabama and his five-year old son Landon, exclaiming, “I’m going nuts not being able to see them and spend time with them!”
