A Family Affair! Travis Barker Walks the Red Carpet with Son Landon and Daughter Alabama/n
Travis Barker‘s kids are already musically inclined, so it’s only a natural next step for them to attend music’s biggest night of the year.
The Blink-182 drummer walked the Grammys red carpet on Sunday with daughter Alabama Luella and son Landon Asher by his side.
Landon, 13, took after his dad in a casual ensemble — himself in a jean jacket, and Barker in a white tattered sleeveless shirt reading “Gangster Rap made me do it.”
Alabama, 11, was dressed to the nines in a long-sleeved glittery pink outfit, complete with matching clutch.

This isn’t the first time the siblings accompanied their dad to the Grammys. They made appearances in both 2013 and 2016, with Alabama rocking a hot-pink dress for the latter ceremony.
Barker’s kids seem to be following in their father’s footsteps, as they have shown a passion for and talent in music. Alabama released a music video in December for her cover of Elvis Presley‘s “Blue Christmas,” in which she sings amid a wintry backdrop while brother Landon plays the drums.

“It was really exciting recording together and watching him play the drums to what I recorded,” the budding entertainer told PEOPLE of Landon. “We got along very well.”
“My heart melts every time they record a song for me,” proud dad Barker, 41, added at the time.
“I told them at a young age, ‘You’re my kids, and if somebody hands you a pair of drumsticks, you better know what to do with them.”
