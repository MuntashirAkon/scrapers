Watch Travis Barker’s Daughter Alabama Nail ‘Let It Go’ While Playing the Piano/n
Travis Barker isn’t the only member of the family with an ear for great music.
The Blink-182 drummer shared an Instagram video originally posted by his daughter Alabama Luella showing that the 10 year old is already dabbling in her father’s profession.
In the clip, Alabama has opted for the piano over the drums, playing and singing her own rendition of “Let It Go” by James Bay.





 My baby @alabamaluellabarker sat down at the piano and played this for me today 💔 I love my kids love music as much as I do 🙏🏻

Although she shrugged it off as simply “playing around on the piano,” Barker, 40, couldn’t be more thrilled at her interest in the arts.
“My baby @alabamaluellabarker sat down at the piano and played this for me today,” he captioned the video on his own page. “I love my kids love music as much as I do.”

In addition to Alabama, Barker and his ex-wife Shanna Moakler are also parents to son Landon Asher, 13.
“The kids’ best interest is what we all have in mind — there’s nothing else,” Barker told PEOPLE of Moakler earlier this year. “Our relationship was so long ago. We’re just being friends. Doing the best co-parenting is the most important thing.”
