What We're Buying: Gold Heels, New Sneaks and a Bright Scarf/n
Nothing gets us in the mood to shop like a sunny day, so when it finally warmed up in NYC this week, we took our credit cards for a little spin. Check out the items we picked up that were just too good to keep them to ourselves.
And we want to return the favor. If you Tweet (@StyleWatchMag) or Instagram (@peoplestylewatchmag) a picture of the item and include #PSWshops, we’ll can showcase our favorites. And make sure to share shots of yourself wearing the item here; you might just see the latest addition to your closet on the site!

Style Director Andrea Lavinthal: I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again (and probably again and again): If you love it, buy it in two colors. So it should come as no surprise that I now own these cute, comfortable Corso Como “Delilah” sandals in gold and black, and am considering purchasing them in red too. 
And I wasn’t the only one who scored in the shoe department. After noticing that my boyfriend had worn holes in his favorite Vans, I convinced him to pick up a fresh pair of kicks. He couldn’t decide between plain gray and checkerboard, so I reminded him of my aforementioned life rule and he bought both.

Writer-Reporter Michelle Ward: As a recent L.A. transplant, spring can’t arrive soon enough. In anticipation of the warm weather to come, I wanted to brighten up my wardrobe with a colorful accessory (one that I could wear as a transitional piece now and throughout the summer). I found the perfect item at Club Monaco — the Luella Cashmere Scarf in guava. It’s ultra-soft and super lightweight, plus the poppy pink color screams spring. Even better, it goes with everything. Pair it with a sundress and flats on the weekend or wear it to work with a blouse, jeans and heels, which I did today! And collected many compliments, I might add.
