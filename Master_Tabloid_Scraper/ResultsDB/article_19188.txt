Cinderella may be a timeless classic—but the costumes are not.Even though the latest reboot of the Disney movie features more modern styling, it's a bit too whimsical and dramatic for us modern-day ladies.

We think not.That said, we mustered up the magic of the Internet and bippity, bippity bop-ed together fresh outfit inspiration that any princess, fairy or evil stepmother can adore.The best part? These looks will last way past midnight.

And they need to be comfortable doing it. Jumpsuits have been a constant fixture on runways and red carpets lately.
