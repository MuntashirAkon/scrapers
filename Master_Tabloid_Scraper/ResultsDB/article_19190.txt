Tat Dad Trav to Get Tots?/nTravis Barker says he's getting custody of his children with Shanna Moakler. insertBCSinglePlayer(1111637124 ); TMZ spotted the laid back tatty rocker leaving Les Deux last night, where he gleefully told our photog,  "I'm getting custody of my kids right now. " Travis and Shanna have two kids together, Landon Asher and Alabama Luella. Barker filed for divorce last August. Though Barker and Moakler had a rocky separation -- with both of them taking to MySpace for some trash talkin' -- the two were all over each other when TMZ caught them together back in April. Looks like the reconciliation was brief.A rep for Moakler had no comment.UPDATE: TMZ spoke with lawyers from both sides in a conference call, who explained that Barker's claim was a big fat misunderstanding, and issued a joint statement saying,  "The recent post on TMZ regarding Travis Barker was taken out of context. At that time, he was going to pick up his children, exercising his agreed upon custody time. Shanna and Travis currently share custody of the children.'
