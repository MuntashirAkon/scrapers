 Who's The Daddy? Father Of Bristol Palin's New Baby Revealed — Her Most Shocking Secret.../n
When Bristol Palin announced Thursday afternoon that she is pregnant, she neglected to mention who is the father of her baby-to-be. But RadarOnline.com can reveal the identity of her new baby daddy: her ex-fiancé Dakota Meyer!
According to a Wasilla insider, Bristol has told friends “that the baby daddy is her ex-fiancé, Dakota Meyer.”
The couple first sparked rumors of a secret pregnancy when they suddenly got engaged in March after dating just a few months. They were scheduled to wed on May 23, but called off the wedding roughly one week before. Though they had little explanation for the breakup at the time, it came on the heels of Radar’s shocking report about 26-year-old Meyer’s secret ex-wife.

Now, the insider says, Bristol, 24, has been trashing her ex and baby daddy behind the scenes.
“She told people that she broke up with Dakota partly because he was super controlling and made her move to Kentucky,” the source said.
Bristol sold her Wasilla home on Lake Lucille in anticipation of the marriage, but now that those plans are scuttled, sources say she has purchased a smaller one a few miles outside of town, where she plans on raising both of her children — in close proximity to mom Sarah.
