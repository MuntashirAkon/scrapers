In his  lawsuit, Connors contends that he was instrumental in promoting the show and that due to false accounting practices he could not establish how much money he was actually owed.
Connors is suing for costs of the suit, contingent compensation wrongfully withheld, punitive damages, and for the court to impose a constructive trust on the monies wrongfully withheld.
