Kathleen Turner's Off-Broadway Turn/n
Kathleen Turner — who was one of the screen’s great hotties in 1981’s “Body Heat” and who went full-frontal on Broadway in “The Graduate” in 2002 — will be back on stage this Saturday in the off-Broadway comedy ‘The Third Story.’ 
However, she’ll be wearing her clothes and a leg brace, and walking with a cane.
According to AP, the 54 year-old actress sustained a knee injury on Tuesday at the Lucille Lortel Theater where the ‘The Third Story’ is playing. Because the show has no understudies, three performances were cancelled.
“Kathleen Turner personifies the attitude of the Broadway trouper,” said MCC co-artistic director Bernard Telsey. “Against any odds, she must – and will – make her performance.”
The comedy is about a mother-and-son writing team who run afoul of the Communist witch hunt in the 1950s. It runs through February 28.  /n
