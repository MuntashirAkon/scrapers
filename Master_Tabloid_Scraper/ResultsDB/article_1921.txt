Bradley Cooper Whips Up Something Delicious In The New 'Burnt' Movie Trailer/n
Yummy! And weâ€™re not just talking about Bradley Cooper being a bad boy chef with something to prove in his new movie Burnt.
The culinary film is about two-star Michelin chef Adam Jones (Cooper) and his road to redemption, as he wants to run the best kitchen in London all in the hopes of returning to Paris to gain that elusive third star.
Obviously, there is some romance sprinkled in as Jones takes budding chef Helene, played by Sienna Miller, under his wing.
Make sure to catch Burnt out October 23 in theaters.
