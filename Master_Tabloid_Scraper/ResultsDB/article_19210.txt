It's been a cold world without the HIGHlarious hijinks of the Bluth family to keep us warm (well, cold except for when we binge watch all 3 seasons on the interwebz)â€¦
Which is why we are SO EFFING PUMPED that Arrested Development's online-only season 4 is SOCLOSE to entering our eyeballz! 
Take a peek at the FIRST trailer for the dream season that became reality (above)! 
Oh man we are happier than a drunk Lucile about AD's return!  
But one question that remains is IF the fourth season turns out to be a Netflix hit, could fans be treated to a fifth season?!
Ok, now we're just getting greedy, LOLz./n
