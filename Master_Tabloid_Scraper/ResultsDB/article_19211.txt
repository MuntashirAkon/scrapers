Wonder Twins Miraculously Survive Birth!!!/n

Sometimes it seems like twins share everything, but usually not amniotic sacs!
Kate and Annie Carlson are monoamniotic twins, meaning they suffered from a rare disorder in which they didn't get their own individual amniotic sacs and were forced to share one!
Delivery team leader Dr. Susan Crowe says:
"Having a set of monoamniotic twins can be dangerous and unpredictable. With no membrane dividing them, the obstetrician has to balance the risk of prematurity with the risk of a cord event."
Unfortunately, that's exactly what happened. At 30 weeks, Kate and Annie's cords got entangled, which cut off blood flow to the unborn siblings.
So mom-to-be Allison was rushed to the hospital where an emergency C-section miraculously saved both babies!
Dad Kevin says:
"We’re really grateful. Despite the chaos surrounding our delivery and pregnancy, Packard Children’s really put us at ease with their experience and expertise. It’s one of the best holiday gifts a family could ever ask for."
Awwww! Beautiful little three lb. gifts! And they'll be on their way to normal size and coming home just in time for their first Christmas! Congrats!
