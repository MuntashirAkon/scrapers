15-Minute-Old Preemie Is Youngest Newborn To Receive Pacemaker/n

Awwww… Poor little thing!
Jaya Maharaj was born 9 weeks prematurely at the Stanford University's Lucile Packard Children's Hospital after her mother, Leanne Maharaj, was forced into labor when doctors feared her baby wouldn't survive.
Within 15 minutes of birth, doctors made the decision to insert a pacemaker after determining that Jaya was born with a dangerously low heart rate of 45 beats per minute.
FYI, the heart rate of an average newborn is 120-150 beats per minute.
She is now the youngest person to have ever received a pacemaker.
Her condition isn't a common one. While Jaya was in the womb, she was diagnosed with congenital heart block, in which the mother's immune system mistakenly attacks the nerve fibers that cause the fetus' heart to beat.
So, inducing labor and inserting a pacemaker in such a young life was absolutely necessary, says Dr. Valerie Chock.
She explained:
"Unfortunately, a lot of babies in this position don’t even survive childbirth."
But, luckily, she did survive. And she's already a fighter.
HUGE sigh of relief. We have a feeling this is going to be one tough little cookie.
