Wonderful news.
Two-year-old conjoined twin girls Angelica and Angelina Sabuco were successfully separated at the Lucile Packard Children's Hospital at Stanford.
The two girls shared a liver, diaphragm, and sternum, but thankfully, had two separate hearts, which made the surgery easier for doctors.
Dr. Gary Hartman said:
"We are very pleased.  It could not have gone better." 
Their chests and abdominal walls had to be reconstructed, which went smoother than expected.  
The girls are said to be doing well and even slept in two separate beds, the first time in their lives, the night after the surgery.  
Such wonderful news.  We are so happy that the surgery was a success and the girls are doing so well. They seem to have a wonderful spirit.
Watch above to see their life at home before the surgery.
