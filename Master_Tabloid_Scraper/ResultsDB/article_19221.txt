Driver Who Hit Sandra Bullock Placed on Probation/n
Lucille Gatchell, the 64-year-old Gloucester, Mass. woman who hit Sandra Bullock and husband Jesse James in April pleaded guilty to drunken driving and failing to stay within marked lanes, the Boston Globe reports.  
Gatchell was placed on probation for a year – and was ordered to complete an alcohol safety education program. In addition, her license was suspended.
During her April 22 arraignment, Gatchell entered a standard not guilty plea, and expressed her relief that nobody was injured. Her lawyers also shared her “gratitude to Ms. Bullock and Mr. James for what she understands was their concern for her well being after the accident.”  
Bullock was in the Boston-area shooting her romantic comedy The Proposal when she and her husband were struck on April 18.
