No harm, big foul.Lucile Gatchell, the woman whose car struck a vehicle that happened to contain Sandra Bullock and husband Jesse James, pleaded guilty Tuesday to driving under the influence and the lesser charge of failing to stay within marked lanes.The 64-year-old entered the guilty plea in Massachusetts' Gloucester District Court, an about-face from the not guilty plea she entered at last month's arraignment.Judge Joseph Jennings placed Gatchell on probation for one year, suspended her license for a period of 60 days and ordered her to complete an alcohol-safety program.On April 18, Gatchell's station wagon jumped the center median and hit head-on an SUV driven by the star couple. Amazingly, no injuries resulted from the crash.Bullock and her Monster Garage hubby were in Gloucester while the actress filmed The Proposal, a new romantic comedy with Ryan Reynolds. Neither was present for yesterday's hearing.
