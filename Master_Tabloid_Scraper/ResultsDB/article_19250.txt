I wish I could put into words how fun this was! Going down in the toboggan at the #GreatWallOfChina with my family. @DangeRussWilson Unreal! ❤️A post shared by Ciara (@ciara) on Jul 23, 2017 at 4:48pm PDT


Almost immediately, the 31-year-old was SLAMMED by commenters for allowing her baby daughter to go on something so "dangerous"!
The haters wrote: 

"Has your attention-seeking narcissism as a couple affected your parenting decisions too? This is ridiculous. She's 3 months old"


"Isn't this too dangerous for a newborn?… It may be fun but doing this with an infant to your chest is not smart at all."


"Honestly not trying to shame Ciara, but this was VERY dangerous… What if the thing had malfunctioned? Don't believe people are trying to say she is a dumb parent, but it was a dumb decision, IMO."

On the flip side, the couple did have some supporters!

"I really wish people would think before they speak. Ci and Russ would never put their children in any kind of danger… They are going really slow, they control the speed. And the baby is strapped to her mother, in the carrier… So calm down it's not that deep."

You can't please 'em all!
