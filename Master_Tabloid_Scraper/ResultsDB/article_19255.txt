Ariel Winter was dreaming of the desert over the weekend.

The 19-year-old actress posted throwback photos from Coachella on Instagram on Saturday (Apr. 29, 2017). In the sunny pics, Winter wears a long pink wig, a pink bandana to match, a revealing white crop top, and short denim cut-offs paired with white sneakers. Winter’s boyfriend Levi Meaden makes a steamy appearance in one photoset as he holds her from behind and gives her a kiss.
