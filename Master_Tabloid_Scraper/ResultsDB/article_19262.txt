Like Ciara and Russell Wilson before them, Miranda Kerr and Snapchat co-founder Evan Spiegel are practicing abstinence until their wedding day.

Kerr, who announced her engagement to the 26-year-old billionaire last summer, recently opened up about her love life. Speaking to Times of London, the model seemingly hinted that she’s never even had sex with Spiegel yet.
“I don’t!” the 33-year-old told the reporter when the subject of contraception was brought up. When the interviewer asked if that meant Kerr was trying for a baby, she explained, “Not yet. Not until after we get married. My partner is very traditional.”
“We can’t,” she said. “I mean we’re just … waiting.”
Kerr started dating Spiegel in 2015 after meeting him at a Louis Vuitton dinner in New York the year before. She was previously married to Orlando Bloom, with who she shares son Flynn, but separated from the actor in 2013.
