Dare to bare!

Ciara, who’s currently pregnant with her second child, went completely makeup-free when she stepped out at the 2017 MAKERS Conference in Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif., on Wednesday (Feb. 8, 2017). Like what Alicia Keys previously did at the MTV Video Music Awards last year, the “I Bet” singer walked the red carpet without a speck of makeup on her face, proving that you don’t really need a glam squad for a glamorous night out.
Showing off her baby bump in a cream-colored ensemble, Ciara was joined by husband Russell Wilson as she happily posed for photos.
