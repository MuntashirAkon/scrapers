“No matter how big you are, what’s important is how hard you work and how much you want it,” Wilson told the kids.
Joined by his Grammy-winning wife, Ciara, Wilson has spent the week in Shanghai and Beijing on an action-filled tour with Nike and Alibaba, meeting with fans and inspiring young athletes and experiencing China’s culture, cuisine and historic sights.
