At the time, the songstress wrote, "On this special birthday I received an abundance of love from friends and family...and I'm excited to finally share one of the greatest gifts of all that god could give."Wilson posted a sweet image on his own Instagram and wrote, "The greatest blessing of all.

In fact, Ciara recently gushed to E! News about how blissful the first year of marriage has been."Married life is the best life. It's definitely life-changing, and you do feel a difference between the stages of being boyfriend and girlfriend to being engaged to actually being married," she explained to us."You feel the definition of what 'being one' is, and it's really cool. Nothing compares to what this feels like."We're guessing nothing compares to welcoming a newborn into the happy family either! Congratulations to the Wilsons on their little one's arrival.
