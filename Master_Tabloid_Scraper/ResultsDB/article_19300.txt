Ciara's Sunday Fun Day with Future Jr. /nCiara's back in the spotlight ... this time on mommy patrol. The singer and her son, Future Jr., enjoyed some sun and a little water gun action at a beach park Sunday in Seattle. It's the first time we've seen Ciara out in public in just over a month since she gave birth to baby no. 2, Sienna. Last time we saw Ciara was back in March ... sporting a baby bump and locked arm-in-arm with hubby Russell Wilson as they were leaving Mr Chow.  /n
