This isn't what we'd give our grandmother for her bday, but Macklemore knows his Helen!
In the music video for Glorious, featuring Skylar Grey, the rapper surprises his g-ma on her 100th birthday and takes her to egg someone's house, sing karaoke, get a new tattoo, and more.
There's even a thrift shop trip.

Oh, then he gets her bridge club a stripper. And Grandma Helen is down for all of it!
