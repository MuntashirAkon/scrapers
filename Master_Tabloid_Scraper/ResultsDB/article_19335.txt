Flip Or Flop Fans Decree The Show Is Awkward AF Now That Christina & Tarek El Moussa Are Over!/n

Flip Or Flop's return was just as awkward as we expected it to be.
As you surely know, Tarek and Christina El Moussa are continuing on with production for their HGTV hit, despite being in the middle of a highly publicized divorce. The former couple left fans shocked when they announced their separation and plans to divorce back in December 2016. Pretty much their breakup was equivalent to Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie splitting up, but in the home renovation world!

While the former flames have downplayed the drama in their split, they can't seem to stop making headlines. To make matters worse, it appears as though the breakup has made things awkward AF on their TV show. While watching Thursday's new episode, fans couldn't help but flock to Twitter to weigh in on the awkwardness they were witnessing onscreen.

Watching #FliporFlop & want to crawl in a hole because I can feel the "we're-divorced-but-working-together" tension through the tv. #hgtv

Did you see Tarek's face when Christina said she might be the buyer of the house on #FliporFlop? The show is dying right before our eyes.
