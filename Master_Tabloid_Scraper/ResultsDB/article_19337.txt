The iconic religious play will be executive produced by NBC's live musical partners Craig Zadan, Neil Meron, Marc Platt, as well as original lyricist Tim Rice, and composer Andrew Lloyd Webber.
Chairman of NBC Entertainment Robert Greenblatt said of the production:
"As we continue to expand the profile of our live musicals, we are thrilled to be partnering with Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice to bring a new live staging of the iconic Jesus Christ Superstar to NBC. Casting has just begun, but we want to fill out this classic show with as many recording artists as possible to give proper voice to what is the original rock opera score."
