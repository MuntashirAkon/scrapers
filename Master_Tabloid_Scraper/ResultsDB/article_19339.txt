Apparently, the life of Pablo involved a multi-million dollar lawsuit.

Kanye West is suing Lloyd’s of London for failing to pay him the money he is allegedly owed after the cancellation of the Saint Pablo Tour. The rapper claims the insurance market failed to pay him after he was hospitalized at UCLA Medical Center following his public breakdown last year.
Via Revolt TV:
Kanye’s lawsuit addresses the aforementioned show, notes the “strained, confused and erratic” behavior, and the decision to issue full refunds.
…
A filed complaint reads, “Nor have they provided anything approaching a coherent explanation about why they have not paid, or any indication if they will ever pay or even make a coverage decision, implying that Kanye’s use of marijuana may provide them with a basis to deny the claim and retain the hundreds of thousands of dollars in [paid] insurance premiums….The stalling is emblematic…of never-ending post-claim underwriting where the insurers hunt for some contrived excuse not to pay.”
