For a film that almost didn't get made, the Back to the Future trilogy has withstood the test of time—literally.Oct. 21, 2015 marks the day that lead character Marty McFly travels to in the second installment of the series. The cast of the wildly popular films, including Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd and Lea Thompson reunited on NBC's Today Wednesday to reminisce about the history-shaping movie they starred in over 25 years ago."I just felt we had chemistry from the instant we walked on the set. We were so happy to see each other," Lloyd said of working alongside Fox. "It never had to be manufactured…it just was there. It was innate. It was wonderful."Despite their magic on-screen, the movie's plot was an initial turn-off for many distribution companies because of a certain risky scripted relationship between mother and son.
