Lloyd Webber Cleared of "Phantom" Filching/n
Looks like Lord Andrew Lloyd Webber didn't need any help making the music of the night, after all.        A federal jury ruled Tuesday that the pop music maestro did not steal the main theme from his Phantom of the Opera from an obscure church-music composer, ending a contentious battle that has dragged out in court for eight years.        Ray Repp, a Baltimore-based composer and clothing salesman, cast the first stone in 1990, suing Lloyd Webber, claiming a riff in the British tunesmith's 1986 opus filched a 1978 Repp ballad called "Till You."        Lloyd Webber countersued, saying he never heard of Repp or "Till You." The Broadway mogul said if the melodies sounded alike, it was because Repp must have lifted his from "Close Every Door," a tune from Lloyd Webber's Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, written in 1969. But Repp contended he never heard Joseph until after he wrote his ballad.        So the lawyers for both parties lined up musicologists, who pointed out how each composer ripped off the other. At one point Repp's suit was tossed out. Then it was reinstated on appeal. Lloyd Webber even asked the Supreme Court to dismiss the lawsuit, but the high court sent it back to federal court.        The case played out in a New York courtroom in recent weeks, with Lloyd Webber himself taking the stand Monday to dispute ever swiping others' music. He swore he never listened to the radio so he could avoid similar suits in the future.         "I hate it when it's in a restaurant or in a car or a taxi," Lloyd Webber said. "My driver has instructions never to have the radio on."        It took jurors just two hours to decide the case.        "He's going to be happy with the result. He didn't copy the song," defense lawyer Jane Stevens said of Lloyd Webber, who was not in court when the verdict was read.
