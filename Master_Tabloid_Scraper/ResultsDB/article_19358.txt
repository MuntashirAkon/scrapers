Lloyd Webber Fights Church Composer/n
Pop musical maestro Andrew Lloyd Webber says that he was "irreparably injured" by a little-known religious ballad that plagiarized one of his early signature tunes. He testified in a New York courtroom for the first time Thursday in a trial pitting the West End and Broadway mogul against Ray Repp, a Maryland-based composer of liturgical music. It's the latest legal go-round in a six-year battle between the two.At one point, Lloyd Webber, who raked in $50 million last year according to Forbes, asked for financial damages of $78.09, but he later dropped the claim.Repp cast the first stone in 1990, suing Lloyd Webber, claiming the British tunesmith's main theme from the 1986 opus The Phantom of the Opera filched a 1978 Repp ballad called "Till You."Lloyd Webber countersued, saying he never heard of Repp or "Till You," but if the melodies sounded alike, it was because Repp must have lifted his from "Close Every Door," a tune from Lloyd Webber's Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, written in 1969. Of course, Repp contends he never heard Joseph until after he wrote his ballad.So the lawyers for both parties lined up musicologists, who pointed out how each composer ripped off the other. In 1994, New York Superior Court Judge Shirley W. Kram tossed out Repp's suit after concluding Lloyd Webber never had heard "Till You"--but the judge allowed the countersuit to continue.However, the bombastic theater baron promised he would drop the countersuit if Repp didn't appeal. Despite that assurance, Repp immediately appealed, saying his tiny K&R; Music was as David to Webber's Goliath, the multi-billion dollar Really Useful Group.Judge Kram, who will decide the trial without a jury, is expected to rule early next week.Lloyd Webber's latest juggernaut, Whistle Down the Wind, will debut at the National Theater in Washington, D.C., on December 12, before hitting Broadway.
