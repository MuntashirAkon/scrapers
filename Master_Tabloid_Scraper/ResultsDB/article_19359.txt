Jake Lloyd to Play Annakin Skywalker?/n
At least one eight-year-old won't have to wait until Christmas to get new Star Wars toys. Jake Lloyd, the action-figure-craving moppet from Jingle All The      Way may soon have one of his own to play with.             According to the Hollywood Reporter, Lloyd has been picked for the role of Annakin Skywalker, the young Darth Vader, in George Lucas' upcoming prequel.            While Lucasfilm is keeping mum, saying only that the company is talking with representatives of various actors, Lloyd is reportedly "close to signing" a deal to play the virtuous young man with the potential for great evil. He'll to join a cast that sources say includes Ewan McGregor, Liam Neeson and Natalie Portman.             Lucas, who will write, produce and direct the film, has been combing Europe and North America for the right actor. Young Jake is no stranger to this kind of lottery. The charming child actor made his debut in Nick Cassavetes' Unhook the Stars (due on video in June) when he was 6      years old. Lloyd was selected to play the studious son of boisterous      working-class mom Marisa Tomei by that film's makers after they had seen more than 1,400 other young hopefuls.             Lloyd also has appeared on TV's ER, as well as working as a commercial-cutie for products such as Kentucky Fried Chicken, Gatorade, Bayer aspirin, AT&T; and Sara Lee.             Rehearsals should get under way on the untitled Star Wars prequel in London next month with principal photography to follow at London's Leavesden studios, as well as Tunisia and Naples.             After the box office bonanza of the Star Wars trilogy this winter,      Lucasfilm is financing the prequel itself.  While no domestic distributor has been set, 20th Century Fox is expected to have the upper hand after its super-successful work on the re-release of the first three pictures.
