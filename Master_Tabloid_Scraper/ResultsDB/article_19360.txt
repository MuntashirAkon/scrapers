Lloyd to Play "My Favorite Martian"/n
My Favorite Martian, the '60s sitcom, is coming back, this time to the big screen, says Daily Variety.  Christopher Lloyd, best known for his whacked-out roles in the Back to the Future movies and TV's Taxi will recreate the anal-retentive alien made famous by Ray Walston.  You can bet Lloyd will have different take on the character. But the plot remains the same.  Tim O'Hara, a newspaper reporter, finds a space ship crashed and rescues its crew of one.  The reporter thinks he's stumbled on the story of a lifetime.  However, the Martian, who looks human except for a retractable antenna on his head, refuses to cooperate.  He insists to the world that he's just another Earthling, forcing the reporter to go along with the charade that he's "Uncle Martin."Bill Bixby, who played Tim O'Hara in the series and later starred in The Incredible Hulk, died in 1993 at 59.  Disney Pictures, the film version's producer, hasn't cast his part. Ray Walston came to the series already a veteran of stage, TV and movies (South Pacific, Damn Yankees), went on to do many more films and eventually return to television in Picket Fences as Judge Henry Bone, a part which won him his first Emmy in 1995 at age 80. He played a Martian again that year--in an AT&T; commercial in which an operator assures him that he can really telephone Martians, as long as they live in the United States. Walston will not appear in the film.
