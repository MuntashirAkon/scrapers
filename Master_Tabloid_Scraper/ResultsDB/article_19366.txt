Aaron Hernandez Funeral in Bristol, Cops Out In Force (PHOTO)/nAaron Hernandez is set to be laid to rest in his hometown of Bristol, Connecticut on Monday -- and the police are out in force to make sure things don't get violent.  Hernandez's body is currently at a funeral home in Bristol -- where it was taken after it was released from the medical examiner's officer following his death Wednesday morning.  As we previously reported, Hernandez was found hanging in his cell at a maximum security prison in Mass. where he was serving a life sentence for the 2013 murder of Odin Lloyd.  Cops have set up barricades and dispatched squad cars in the area where the funeral will take place.  A family spokesperson told the Boston Globe's Travis Andersen that Hernandez will be cremated.  So far, it's unclear who will attend the ceremony.   Bristol police closing off Lincoln Ave ahead of #AaronHernandez funeral pic.twitter.com /cItbsUlJaH — Travis Andersen (@TAGlobe) April 24, 2017/n
