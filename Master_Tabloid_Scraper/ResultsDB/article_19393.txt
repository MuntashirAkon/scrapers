Philip Michael Thomas, Where Are You Now?/n
Miami Vice sex machine Philip Michael Thomas flaunted a gold medallion in the early ’80s with the letters “EGOT” —
for Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony — and shamelessly boasted in 1984 he’d win them all in the next five years.
Sadly, his soaring career went into a tailspin after his stint as Detective Rico Tubbs on Vice ended in 1990.
The 67-year-old landed only a handful of movies and TV roles, including a guest shot on Nash Bridges,
the hit detective show starring his old Vice partner, Don Johnson.
Apart from 10 years working for a psychic network, Philip’s most prolific output has been as a dad.
He’s the father of six daughters, five sons and a stepdaughter! /n
