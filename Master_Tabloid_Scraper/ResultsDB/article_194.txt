Johnny Depp -- Not an Original Vampire/nJohnny Depp schooled a photog or 2 Wednesday on his way out of Jimmy Kimmel. Johnny's band, Hollywood Vampires, performed on the show, which is scheduled to air tonight. Johnny was asked if he came up with the name of his group, which features Joe Perry, Alice Cooper, Duff McKagan and Matt Sorum. A little history ... the Hollywood Vampires was originally a group that drank and sang together at the famous Rainbow Bar & Grill on the Sunset Strip back in the '70s. Alice Cooper would jam with the likes of John Lennon, Harry Nilsson, Keith Moon, Bernie Taupin, Jim Morrison and Mickey Dolenz. Johnny and Alice decided to resurrect the Hollywood Vampires 3 years ago. We asked Johnny about playing on the roof of Kimmel's building. As we reported a stage was set up on the roof as the sweltering heat beat down. Johnny seemed oblivious to the roof, so he may have played in cooler surroundings./n
