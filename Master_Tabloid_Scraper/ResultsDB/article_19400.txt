Susan Sarandon: My Sexual Orientation Is 'Up For Grabs'/n
Susan Sarandon won’t be held down by labels — especially when it comes to her sexuality.
The 70-year-old made a shocking confession during an interview with PrideSource, admitting: “My sexual orientation is up for grabs, I guess you could say.”
Later, she divulged juicy details of her steamy affair with gay actor Philip Sayer, whom she met on set of 1973 film The Hunger.

“I did at one point have a very successful and very loving and wonderful affair with a man who then wasn’t with another woman after me, and that worked out fine!” the actress, now starring in Ryan Murphy’s Feud series, shared.
“I don’t think you had to declare yourself as rigidly as you do now in terms of having to declare yourself almost politically about your sexual preference,” she added.
Though she was previously married to Chris Sarandon from 1967-1979, had two sons, Jack Henry and Miles Guthrie, with long-term partner Tim Robbins and shares daughter Eva with Italian filmmaker Franco Amurri, Sarandon has also had a string of affairs with iconic stars like David Bowie and most recently Jonathon Brocklin.

“I’m a serial monogamist, so I haven’t really had a large dating career. I married Chris Sarandon when I was 20, and that went on for quite a while — each of my relationships have,” she told PrideSource.
“I haven’t exactly been in the midst of a lot of offers of any kind. I’m still not! I don’t know what’s going on!”
