We’ve seen Nicki Minaj in a lot of outrageous outfits in the past, but her latest look may just take the cake.

On Monday (April 3, 2017), the rapper was seen at the Montage Hotel in Beverly Hills rocking a black gown covered entirely in slithering reptiles. Designed by Charbel Zoe, the dress featured sheer sleeves, a knee-length train, and a chest piece made of fake snakes. (Think: Medusa meets Xena: Warrior Princess.)
Minaj paired the head-turning frock with Philipp Plein gladiator sandals and accessories by Alexander McQueen and NSR by Nina Runsdord.

“I’m always late & always rushing out @ the last minute with this shocked look on my face 🙃,” Minaj wrote on Instagram alongside a photo of her walking through the halls of the hotel.  “Is there a hypnosis of some sort that can make u on time everywhere?”
Someone better get her a watch (maybe one also made of snakes).
