Mariah Carey and Bryan Tanaka fed the meter on their relationship’s social media presence with a sensual kiss selfie (if that’s a thing).

Carey posted the photo below of Tanaka going in for a kiss while she is just kind of enjoying breathing the same air. The singer captioned the pic with the appropriate Blades of Glory quote: “No one knows what it means, but it’s provocative … it gets the people going!”

Carey was last spotted out at the Vanity Fair Oscars after-party, without Tanaka. Her skin-tight Philipp Plein dress worked against her by accidentally exposing her right nipple during her photo shoot in front of the Vanity Fair sign. See photos of the nip slip in our Oscars after-party gallery.
