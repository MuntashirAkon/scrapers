He added, "This truly outstanding facility will be enjoyed by visitors to Lord's for many years to come."Before pulling a cord to part a small curtain, The Duke of Edinburgh joked, "You're about to see the world's most experienced plaque-unveiler."The massive reconstruction project involved the complete overhaul of the 2,656-seat stand and will continue to be rebuilt in multiple phases over the course of the next 20 years.

Later today, The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh will attend a service for Members of the Order of Merit at the Chapel Royal, St. James's Palace.Afterward, the royal couple will give a luncheon for those attending the service.
