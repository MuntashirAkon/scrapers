Shocking Royal Family Video -- Royal Pain In The Arse … He Said What On Camera?/nPrince Philip has a royally bad potty mouth ... and he doesn’t care who hears it. Philip got testy with a meticulous photog during a group photo -- that included Prince William -- for the 75th anniversary of the “Battle of Britain.”  First, the 94-year-old husband of Queen Elizabeth II spouted out “just take it” to get the whole process moving along … but then he really lost his composure and let out profanity fit for a king … which he's not. Check out the video and make sure to put ear muffs on any youngsters nearby./n
