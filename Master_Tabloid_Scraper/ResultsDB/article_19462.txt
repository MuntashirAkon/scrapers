Queen Elizabeth Hits the "Casino"/nHer Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II, attended a benefit premiere of  "Casino Royale " in London tonight. Other queens, like Elton John, were seen scrambling just before Her Royal Highness pulled up in a swank limo. The Queen, 80 (not Elton), dragged her consort, Prince Philip, to the shindig. The queen looked noticeably excited to meet Daniel Craig (Elton that is).  Related Article      The Babes of Bond/n
