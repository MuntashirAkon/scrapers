Instead of heading to Rihanna’s bangin’ after-party, Lena Dunham was rushed to the hospital following her appearance at the 2017 Met Gala.

The Girls star was hospitalized Monday night (May 1, 2017) after experiencing complications stemming from her endometriosis at the star-studded event. She was later released after undergoing a series of medical tests.
“She’s at home resting and doing well,” an insider told E! News. “As you know she’s very public about her battles with endometriosis.”
The 30-year-old attended the gala with Girls showrunner Jenni Konner. While it’s unclear exactly when Dunham left the party to seek medical help, she did have time to pose in Vogue’s Instagram booth with comedian Nick Kroll.

In April, the Dunham revealed that she underwent five different surgeries to move her ovaries away from her rectal wall, putting an end to years of chronic pain in her abdomen.
“My surgery went off without a hitch,” she wrote in her feminist newsletter, Lenny Letter. “When I emerged, cotton-mouthed, [Dr. Randy Harris] told me something I hadn’t expected to hear, maybe ever: there was no endometriosis left. Between my surgeries and hormonal intervention, I was disease-free. That doesn’t mean it can never return, but for now, once my sutures have been removed and my bruises have changed from blue to yellow to green to gone, I will be healthy.”
