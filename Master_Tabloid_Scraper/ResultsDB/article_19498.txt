Finally, Eddie Redmayne and his wife Hannah Bagshawe were reportedly denied entry at Rihanna’s exclusive Met Gala after-party at 1OAK. According to the Daily Mail, the couple was seen talking to bouncers before Redmayne turned away while speaking furiously on the phone. They tried to negotiate with bouncers for 30 minutes longer before they decided to go elsewhere.
E! News reports that Madonna was the first guest to arrive at Rihanna’s party.
