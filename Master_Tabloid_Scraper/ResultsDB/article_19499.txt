Kylie Jenner is now the proud mom of a pet chicken.

Turning her $12 million mansion into somewhat of a farmhouse, the 19-year-old recently introduced a new flock of feathery friends — including one named Eddie — to her followers on Snapchat. In a series of videos, the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star was seen feeding a white chicken before cooing, “I love you, Eddie!”
“Damn! Eddie with the neck game,” she gushed in another clip.

However, Eddie may not be the only bird in Jenner’s care. The makeup maven also shared a video of a backyard chicken coop filled with at least two more creatures.

“Dreams do come true,” she captioned.
In 2015, Jenner told Interview magazine she plans to “go off the map, have a family, and live in Malibu with a farm, and just raise my own chickens” when she turns 30.
Guess she, like, realized her goal a little early.
