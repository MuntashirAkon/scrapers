In strangely arousing news, Jude Law will play young Dumbledore in the sequel of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.

Law will take on the role that has previously been embodied by Richard Harris and Michael Gambon after Harris’s death in 2002.
The Fantastic Beasts sequel takes place when Dumbledore is still the transfiguration professor at Hogwarts, long before he becomes the headmaster or meets Harry Potter.
Johnny Depp will also appear in the film as Gellert Grindelwald, who is Dumbledore’s childhood friend-turned love interest-turned sworn enemy. Eddie Redmayne will return as Newt Scamander and David Yates will direct once again.

“Jude Law is a phenomenally talented actor whose work I have long admired, and I’m looking forward to finally having the opportunity to work with him,” Yates said in an official statement on Wednesday. “I know he will brilliantly capture all the unexpected facets of Albus Dumbledore as J.K. Rowling reveals this very different time in his life.”
Law will next be seen in King Arthur: Legend of the Sword and recently made waves as Lenny Belardo in HBO’s The Young Pope.
Fantastic Beasts 2 comes to theaters on Nov. 16, 2018.
