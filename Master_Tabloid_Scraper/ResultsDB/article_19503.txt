Amber Heard may have found a new man following her highly publicized divorce with Johnny Depp.

According to Us Weekly, the Danish Girl actress has a “casual” relationship with Elon Musk after the Space X founder reportedly asked to be set up with her.
“They continue to see each other and hang out from time to time when they are in the same city. It is nothing new,” an insider tells the publication. “He is too busy doing things like building a tunnel under L.A. and sending people into space to seriously pursue anyone.”
The two, who were seen slipping into the same room together at a Miami hotel last August, sparked romance rumors once again after Heard, 30, and Musk, 45, was spotted at a special screening of Al Gore’s An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power on Tuesday (Feb. 28, 2017) in Palo Alto, Calif.
“Call it what you want,” the source adds. “But they hang out and casually see each other whenever time permits.”
Last October, Musk settled his second divorce with actress Talulah Riley, who he remarried July 2013 after legally separating in the prior year. The billionaire entrepreneur was also previously married to author Justine Musk from 2000 to 2008.
