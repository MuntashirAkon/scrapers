Eddie Vedder Opens Up About the Time Paul McCartney Punched Him in the Face/n
Paul McCartney packs a powerful punch — literally: In a new interview on the Beatles’ SiriusXM channel, Pearl Jam frontman Eddie Vedder revealed he was once hanging out with McCartney at a Seattle hotel bar when a story got more intense than anticipated.
“He kind of was illustrating how he hit this guy, and when he did that, he shot out his left arm as if he was hitting this guy, and I was standing there, and I got hit,” Vedder recalled, laughing. “He didn’t quite pull back the punch, you see. So the story kept on. It was a great, incredible personal story, and I caught the end of it, but as I was listening I was just thinking, ‘Paul McCartney just hit me in the face. And it hurt!’”
Vedder said he even ended up tasting a bit of blood, but in a way, it was all worth it.

“A great time in my life, to be hit by Paul McCartney,” Vedder said. “I remember it hurt for a few days, And I remember when it went away, when the pain finally subsided and the swelling went down, I kinda missed it.”
