Even Eddie Redmayneforgets his lines!E! News recently sat down with the Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them actor and his co-star Katherine Waterston for a must-see game of "Who's Most Likely To?" When asked which of the wand-wielding wizards was most likely to flub their lines on set, Redmayne was quick to recall a particularly "catastrophic" scene. "Do you remember that day? The last scene?" he asked Waterston. "The last scene of the film when the camera came in and I had to go, 'There's a venom in there…' We had to do it about 46 times and there were about a hundred extras, all these hours."

Eddie continued, "It was catastrophic and now when I watch that scene in the film you can see it in my eyes going, ‘Remember the friggin' line.'" LOL!Additionally, the pair weighed in on who's most likely to take a tumble during a stunt (Katherine), who's most likely to be caught noshing at craft services (Katherine) and who's most likely to break a wand (Neither!). Waterston, who plays Porpentina Goldstein in the highly-anticipated flick, also dished on wanting to take home Fantastic Beasts merchandise with her character on it. "I was thinking, well, I have a niece and nephews. Maybe they'd want a little doll of me or something, but then I thought that's probably the last one that they want!"
