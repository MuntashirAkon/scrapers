It's safe to say that going through TSA at the airport is the worst experience even if you've managed to follow all the rules.But what if you're carrying a magical briefcase full of fantastic beasts? That has to be pretty nerve-wracking. Eddie Redmayne's Newt Scamander of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them was traveling Thursday night (on his way to The Late Late Show we presume) and got flagged by a TSA agent (portrayed by James Corden) after he saw a pair of eyes on the x-ray machine."I'm in a bit of a hurry," Redmayne pleaded with Corden."Everyone's in a bit of a hurry here, sir, except me," a terse Corden replied. "I've got all the time in the world. Let's pop the bag, shall we?"

"You can chuck that," Redmayne relented. "I don't need it."When Corden walked away to handle the mouthwash, the same beast popped outâ€”as well as a second animal that had a beak and tons of feathers. Once again Redmayne's creatures hid just in the nick of time, but the rest of Redmayne's stop and search with Corden doesn't go as smoothly.Watch the video to see what happens!
