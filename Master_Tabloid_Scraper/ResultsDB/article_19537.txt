UFC's Eddie Alvarez Says Conor McGregor Will Be 'Damn Good' Father /nThey were enemies in the Octagon, but Eddie Alvarez just delivered a pretty awesome compliment to Conor McGregor ... explaining why the UFC superstar is going to be a great dad.   "If he puts 10% of the effort into his child as he does fighting, I think he's gonna do dang good. So, I wish him the best of luck.
