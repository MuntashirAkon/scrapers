Oscar Showdown! Leslie Jones Battles Tina Fey & Amy Poehler For Hosting Gig/n
And the job goes to? While Tina Fey and Amy Poehler are the current front-runners to host the upcoming Oscars in February, insiders say there’s been a huge push to rip the prestigious gig away from the comedians and award it to SNL star Leslie Jones instead!
“Tina and Amy are asking for a hell of a lot of money to do the job,” one source told RadarOnline.com of why Jones’ name first came up as a possible replacement. “She’s in with an even better chance now.”
Another reason? “There’s a huge argument for appointing Leslie after her Olympics social media coverage impressed everyone,” continued the source.

Despite her poise on camera, behind the scenes the Ghosbusters actress has been feeling insecure ever since hackers posted Jones’ explicit photos to her website.
“She’s convinced the hacking of her site, with naked pictures and racist insults, has destroyed any chances of getting the job,” said the source.
However, the insider told Radar that Jones may be in for a shock since she’s “actually garnered even more supporters from the cyber attack and she’s slowly overtaking Tina and Amy as the Academy’s number one choice.”
