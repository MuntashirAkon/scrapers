Contract Chaos! 'Ghostbusters' Stars Leslie Jones & Kate McKinnon May Exit 'SNL'/n
RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned that breakout Ghostbusters stars Leslie Jones and Kate McKinnon may be ending their runs on Saturday Night Live.
“They haven’t refused to return for another SNL season, but because of the Ghostbusters opening, neither of them have closed their deals,” revealed an insider.

The news follows the surprising news that longtime cast members Taran Killam, a gifted impressionist who showcased characters like Jebediah Atkinson, and Jay Pharoah, who shined as President Obama, have been booted from the sketch comedy show.
But the loss of Jones, 48, and 32-year-old McKinnon, who was just nominated for an Emmy for Saturday Night Live, would come as an even greater shock to both the cast and fans.
“It’s tricky because SNL does all their contracts in June and July — new cast and old cast — and sometimes people can drop out of negotiations suddenly, especially if they have a surprise hit movie,” explained the insider.

The show’s creator, Lorne Michaels, “is terrified this is what’s going to happen with Leslie and Kate, because it’s how Chris Rock wound up exiting the show twenty-something years ago.”
Now Michaels is putting pressure on the women to renew, despite a major negotiation roadblock, claimed the source.
“The sticking point is that he won’t raise their salary, and that could push them out of the door.” /n
