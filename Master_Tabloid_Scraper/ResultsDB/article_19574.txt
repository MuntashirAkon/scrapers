Obviously Jennifer Lopez is a queen.
But that does not always translate to treating people with the utmost respect. *cough*Mariah Carey*cough*

Thankfully, it turns out J.Lo is as woke as they come, and she proved it by showing her 68 million Instagram followers how to show deference to someone whose gender non-binary identity is largely misunderstood.
She posted this week: 




This is Brendan my sister Leslie's second child!! They were the one person selected to represent their school at #globalyoungleadersconference in Washington DC!!! And I couldn't be more proud!!! Brendan is strong and smart and loving and a obviously a leader!! Titi Jenn loves you!! #superproudauntie #familia❤A post shared by Jennifer Lopez (@jlo) on Jul 17, 2017 at 12:48pm PDT


Notice how she used the proper preferred pronouns in reference to Brendan? And focused on the important attributes like intelligence and heart and leadership?
While some of her followers were confused, most noticed right away, posting comments like:

They/Them/Their. GO @JLO!!!!!!!!!!!!
jlo respecting her sisters kids pronouns i love this concept
Thank you so much for being so rad about pronouns, J. I love you.
This is so great on SO MANY levels. 🎯💯 Thank you @jlo 🙌🏻 And CONGRATS Brendan! #nonbinary
