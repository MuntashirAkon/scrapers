Leslie Jones has a bone to pick with one of Los Angeles’ swankiest hotels.

Following her hosting gig at the 2017 BET Awards this weekend, the Saturday Night Live star took to Twitter to blast the Ritz-Carlton — a hotel located near the Microsoft Theater where the ceremony had taken place. Though Leslie didn’t specify exactly what the hotel did to her, her tweet suggested she had been mistreated due to her race.
“Wow was such a great night at the BET awards. But then had THE WORST STAY @RitzCarlton,” she tweeted.
“DO NOT STAY THERE!!” she cautioned. “THEY DONT LIKE BLACK PEOPLE!!”

A customer representitive since responded to the accusation, replying, “We’re very sorry to hear this. We pride ourselves on providing excellent service to all. Please DM us & we’ll look into this right away.”
The hotel’s manager, Curtis Kent, told the New York Daily News an internal investigation has been launched into the claims.
