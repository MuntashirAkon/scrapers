The Big Bang Theory will see a 12th season.

The popular CBS series has been renewed for two more seasons, according to The Hollywood Reporter. The five original stars of the sit-com — Kaley Cuoco, Jim Parsons, Johnny Galecki, Kunal Nayyar and Simon Helberg — will all be getting paid $900,000 per episodes per their negotiations to free up funds for castmates Mayim Bialik and Melissa Rauch’s raises.
As previously reported, the fivesome, who were each receiving $1 million per episode, offered to take a pay cut in order to boost their co-stars’ pay. As actors who joined the series only in Season 3, Bialik and Rauch were making considerably less — approximately raking in $200,000 per episode — prior to the new negotiations.
According to reports, Bialik and Rauch are still without contracts, though they are very likely to make more than $400,000 per episode per their new deals.
The renewal news comes after CBS CEO Leslie Moonves announced that a Big Bang Theory spinoff was in the works. Titled Young Sheldon, the show will be narrated and executive produced by Parsons and focus on the his character’s childhood and upbringing in Texas.
