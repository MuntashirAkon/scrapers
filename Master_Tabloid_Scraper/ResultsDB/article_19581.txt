She may have a song dedicated to her Louboutins, but Jennifer Lopez teamed up with Giuseppe Zanotti for her new shoe collection.

On Thursday (Jan. 26, 2017), the “Ain’t Your Mama” singer celebrated the new fashion line at Neiman Marcus Beverly Hills. Clad in a cleavage-baring white number from Cushnie et Ochs, J.Lo toasted the collaboration and explained how the project was near and dear to her heart. According to her, every shoe was named after a strong woman in her family — including sisters Leslie and Lynda.
“I think of family and they’re my stability, they keep me grounded,” she told Entertainment Tonight. “There was a connection there, so I was like, ‘I’m going to name it after all the women in my family.'”
Lopez also explained why she named a pink python-printed gladiator sandal after her 8-year-old daughter Emme, saying, “She’s soft and fierce, you know what I mean? She is like, the combination of everything good in this world.”
How cute!
