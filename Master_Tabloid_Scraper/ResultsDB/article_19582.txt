Will & Grace isn’t returning to TV… yet.

Though actor Leslie Jordan recently said in a radio interview that the beloved NBC sit-com has been picked up again for 10 new episodes, Debra Messing, who starred as one of the two titular characters for eight season, refuted reports that the show is back for good.
“It’s back,” Jordan told KPBS, claiming production will start in the summer with a premiere date slated for fall. “[NBC] has ordered 10 [episodes]. It’ll be for next season, so they’ll go in in July.”
However, Messing later tweeted to a fan, “Sadly Leslie was wrong. Nothing beyond talks.”

As previously reported, the four main leads of the comedy — Messing, Eric McCormack, Sean Hayes and Megan Mullally — reunited last year to star in a 10-minute special election-themed short about the importance of voting. When the clip went viral, it was reported that network execs were looking to bring back the series, which ran from 1998 to 2006. At the time, the tentative plan was rumored to be a single ten-episode season should all four stars signed on for the project.
While nothing official was announced, the cast expressed interest in reviving the show 10 years after it went off the air.
“I never say never anymore,” Messing, when asked about the chances of a revival, told The Hollywood Reporter at the time. “Everything has changed so much in the TV industry; there have been reboots.”
“My wish is that we did 10 [episodes] on, like, Netflix or Amazon or somewhere where it could be the naughty version of Will & Grace,” she told People. “Because you know we were on network television and there were certain lines of common storytelling that we were limited to so it would be fun to kind of go into that world where nothing is held back.”
