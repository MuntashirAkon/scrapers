Hart will appear next in Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle, out Dec. 20, and then takes the screen alongside Nicole Kidman and Bryan Cranston in The Upside in March.
He and wife Eniko Parrish are also expecting their first child together, a baby boy. Already dad to Kendrix, 9, and Heaven, 12, from a previous marriage, Hart has some ideas for what to name his next arrival.
“For me, I’m just thinking about anything with a Kevin in it,” he told PEOPLE in June, just after the couple announced the baby news. “I don’t care what it is as long as Kevin is in there somewhere.”
As for Jones, she’ll face off against her SNL costars Vanessa Bayer and Kate McKinnon in the Emmys’ Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series category when the awards show airs Sept. 17. The Ghostbusters actress also plans to return to the sketch comedy show when season 43 debuts this fall.
