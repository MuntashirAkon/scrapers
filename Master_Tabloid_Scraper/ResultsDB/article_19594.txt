“Today is the 20th anniversary of my marriage to the brilliant, hilarious, amazing Leslie Mann,” he wrote in the caption of a photo from their wedding day. “The greatest thing that has ever happened to me.”
The photo, a black and white snapshot, looks to have been taken on a beach. The pair — who met in 1995 and married in 1997 — have been hilariously adorable together.
At the 2015 Oscars, they joked about their choice of drinks for the after parties that take place on Oscar night.
“We’ll be drinking a lot and then eating a lot and drinking more,” Mann quipped to E!’s Will Marfuggi on the red carpet. “It’s a three-hour event, right? Just until other people come, then it’s like seven more hours.”
Apatow added, “It’s a lot of time, so we’ll be balancing drinking and eating.”
The couple share two daughters together, Maude, 19, and Iris, 14.
