Kit Harington has a new roommate and she goes by the name Rose Leslie!
Stopping by The Late Late Show with James Corden in London on Tuesday, the Game of Thrones star admitted that he has pulled the trigger on the next step in his relationship with his girlfriend.
“I’ve moved in with my other best friend, Rose,” Harington said of his former costar. “So, I’m very. very happy and it’s going well. She has all sorts of ideas for the house … I said to her, because she moved into my house, ‘Look, darling, this is important that it’s our space, that it feels like our space and that you haven’t just moved into mine. Move anything you want around — change anything or chuck anything out.’ ”
“I went to the shops and I came back and said, ‘What did you decide?’ ” he continued. “And she said, ‘We’re moving the kitchen downstairs.’ ”

Nicole Kidman, who was also a guest on the show, then jumped in and asked the actor, “Are you going to get married?”
“Wow!” a shocked Harington replied.

“No, I just think it’s kind of nice if you’re going to live together maybe to at least get engaged,” Kidman continued.

“I’ve been put on the spot by Nicole Kidman!” he joked back. “I mean, it’s step by step, step by step.”
Harington and Leslie went public with their relationship in April 2016 when they both attended the Olivier Awards in London and hit the red carpet together — they even shared a red carpet kiss for the cameras.
