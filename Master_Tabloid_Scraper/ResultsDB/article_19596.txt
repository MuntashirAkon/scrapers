Game of Jones, the show you've been waiting for, is back. Yes, Game of Jones, not Game of Thrones. Saturday Night Live star Leslie Jones returned to Late Night with Seth Meyers to watch Game of Thrones with the host for the first time in over a year."When it comes to Game of Thrones, this is where you're the most like a young, nerdy, white 12-year-old," Seth Meyers told Jones.Now for some key Game of Thrones character takeaways from the Emmy nominee:Regarding Jaime Lannister, Jones said: "Man, I feel like he a young-armed bandit right now. That's what I feel like, Mr. Goldfinger."

Jones said the Stark family should have a DJ and go all out for the family reunion. Then she went in on Varys (Conleth Hill), only to have him surprise her. And then guess what? She told it to his face."I was saying, you can't trust your ass," Jones told Hill.As if that wasn't enough, you have to stay for Jones' reaction to the dragon's arrival."Look at it, even the horses are like, ‘I'm getting the f—k out of here," she said.See how much the cast has changed below.

Late Night with Seth Meyers airs weeknights on NBC.
