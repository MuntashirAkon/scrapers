Watch Leslie Jones Belt Out Selena Quintanilla's "Como la Flor"/n
Next thing we know, the SNL star was singing one of our favorite songs from the late singer. She switched up the lyrics a bit, and we're not saying she should win a Grammy, but let's give her some serious props for trying and singing in Spanish, which is no easy feat. Although Jones belted out a small part of the song, some of Hollywood's biggest names have performed many of Selena's greatest hits. Selena Gomez once covered "Bidi Bidi Bom Bom," and Adrienne Bailon also sang "Como la Flor" at her friend actress Paula Garces' baby shower. As Jones said, "Go, Selena!"
