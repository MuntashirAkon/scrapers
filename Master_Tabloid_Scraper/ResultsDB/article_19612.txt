Leslie Jones Rips Ritz-Carlton Hotels, 'They Don't Like Black People'/nLeslie Jones ain't putting on the Ritz -- she's pissed about the service she got at L.A.'s Ritz-Carlton, and fired back at the hotel the same way Kanye West did George Dubya. Fresh off hosting the BET Awards in downtown L.A. -- right next to the Ritz -- Leslie implored her 693,000 followers to NOT stay there, claiming  "THEY DONT LIKE BLACK PEOPLE!! "  Wow was such a great night at the BET awards. But then had THE WORST STAY @RitzCarlton DO NOT STAY THERE!! THEY DONT LIKE BLACK PEOPLE!! — Leslie Jones (@Lesdoggg) June 26, 2017  Unclear what exactly happened to set her off, but the Ritz responded to Leslie's tweet with ...  "@Lesdoggg We're sorry to hear this. We pride ourselves on providing excellent service to all. Please DM us & we'll look into this right away. " We've reached out to her rep, but haven't heard back./n
