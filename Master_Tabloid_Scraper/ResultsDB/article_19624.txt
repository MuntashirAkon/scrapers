New 'Ghostbusters' -- First Video of the Girls in Action!!! (VIDEO)/nDogs and cats living together, mass hysteria -- it's all starting to go down as the new  "Ghostbusters " films, and we got video of a few stunts in progress. Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, Leslie Jones and Kate McKinnonÂ have been shooting in Boston for a few weeks, and this the first time we've seen video of the ladies in action at GB HQ. Check out the clip ... there's a shot of someone (pretty sure it's a stunt person, not one of the stars) falling out of a window -- and the new ECTO-1 peeling out of the garage. As always ... don't cross the streams. It would be bad./n
