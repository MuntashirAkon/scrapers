Leslie Jordan -- When I Tossed the Tea at the Hooligans ... 'I Was So Butch!' (VIDEO)/nLeslie JordanÂ says he's never been so scared in his life when he confronted 3 guys after one of them hurled a homophobic slur. As TMZ reported, Leslie was at Starbucks on Santa Monica Blvd in WeHo this week when 3 guys came up, caused a scene and were asked to leave. One allegedly screamed,  "f****** f****** " on the way out. Leslie ran out to confront them, he says one raised his fists and Leslie doused him with delicious tea. You gotta listen to the video ... it's like the cops played  "Let's Make a Deal " with the actor as he noodled over whether to press charges./n
