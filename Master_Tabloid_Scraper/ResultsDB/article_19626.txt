Actor Leslie Jordan -- Confrontation in WeHo Over Homophobic Slur  (PHOTOS)/nActor Leslie Jordan fashioned his own style of justice by dousing a guy with a cold Starbucks drink after someone in the guy's group hurled a homophobic slur. The  "Will and Grace " star was at a Starbucks Wednesday on Santa Monica Blvd -- the heart of WeHo -- when cops say 3 young men were waiting in line, loudly talking to each other about heterosexual exploits.   We're told at one point the manager asked the men to leave, and as they left one of them yelled,  "You will die f****** f******. " Jordan, who was inside Starbucks, followed the men out and started to reprimand them, and when one of the men allegedly came at him, Leslie doused him with his cold drink.  L.A. County Sheriff's deputies were called and the three men were cuffed because they refused to calm down. The men were interviewed but ultimately not arrested because no crime was committed. A Sheriff's official tells us deputies got the names of the 3 men and documented the disturbance as a  "hate incident, " so it's on file. Leslie was not arrested for throwing the drink./n
