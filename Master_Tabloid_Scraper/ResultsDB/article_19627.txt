Lisa Leslie -- Warns Tom Hanks' Son ... Use N-Word, Get Ass Kicked/nIf Tom Hanks' son wants to use the N-word in a rap song, he'd better watch his ass -- so says WNBA legend Lisa Leslie who says  "the real homeboys " could have a real problem with it.  Chet Haze -- who is extremely white -- has been on a crusade to justify using the N-word ... saying it's not about race, it's  "about the culture you identify with. "  So, how does Leslie feel about it?  First off, she's not a fan of the word -- saying,  "It's really unfortunate that it's a word that's hung around for 200 years plus. " Then comes the warning ... and you can give Lisa credit for putting it in terms that Chet will definitely understand. /n
