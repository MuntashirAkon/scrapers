And in today's batch of eccentric celebrity body art decisions…Don't fret! This time we're talking the less-than-permanent variety. And it's actually pretty darn sweet.Helen Hunt's 11-year-old daughter, Makena, and a friend have decked their arms in matching henna tats ...of the famous actress's face. (Must be a pretty close friend, not only because of the choice of ink, but because Helen referred to her "daughters" in her Twitter caption.)The 52-year-old actress, who is smiling wide and holding the hands of both girls in the darling snap, wrote Sunday, "My daughters got henna tattoos. My life is so good."

Definitely unusual, but pretty thoughtful if you ask us! The portraits are fairly accurate, too—and definitely endearing!Makena Lei Gordon Carnahan is Helen's daughter with her longtime partner, producer-director Matthew Carnahan.

No word on the second daughter to whom Hunt refers in the photo's caption, but at least from the looks of it, Makena and her friend are like sisters. We'll of course see what happens after junior high.An award-winning career, an A-plus attitude (not to mention, those mile high cheek bones!) and a daughter who's so inspired by her mom that she's willing to walk around with Mom's face on her arm?!As good as it gets, indeed.
