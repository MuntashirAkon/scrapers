Kim Kardashian's BFF Brittny Gastineau's Mom Melts Down On Social Media/n
Kim Kardashian and her famous family may want to think twice before crossing best friend Brittny Gastineau‘s mom! Brittny’s mother Lisa lost it on social media over the weekend when she revealed her friend’s darkest secrets in an explosive rant.
Gastineau’s mother called out her “great friend” Steve Victor for refusing to return money he borrowed from her.
“You were broke,” she began. “You asked me to lend you $25,000 on a bridge loan – I was a friend who believed in you… You are now trying to f**k me on the money [I] gave you as [a] friend.”

She then threatened to expose his new wife’s reported drug habit if he doesn’t give her the money back.
But her rant didn’t end there, as she bashed him in another tell-all tirade.
“I lent you 20,000 when you promised to give me back 25,000,” she continued. “I would like my original of 20,000 dollars to be returned now – and we will send the compounded additional charges tomorrow. Let’s make this as simple and easy as possible. Thank you.”

In a rare public outing since Kim was held at gunpoint in her Paris hotel in October, the 36-year-old was spotted driving with Brittny in Los Angeles on December 17.
Although Lisa has remained silent on the Kardashians for now, she could have information on Kim’s seclusion after the robbery and Kanye West’s hospitalization from a breakdown in November.
