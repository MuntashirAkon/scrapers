After a hard fought battle, it was clear that  boxing is SO new to McGregor — and he was bone tired by the end of it all, lagging just a split second behind Floyd and giving enough of a window to the veteran boxer for the victory.
Congratulations to Floyd Mayweather Jr.!!!!!
As far as the spectacle itself, the fight definitely proved to be more legit than some people were thinking — but in the end, well, upsets are tough to come by!! Floyd is a very, VERY good boxer.
