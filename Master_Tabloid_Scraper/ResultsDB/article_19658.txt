Kevin Federline Steps Out with Wife Victoria Prince for Romantic Dinner Date in Hollywood/n
The love birds are out and about!
Kevin Federline and Victoria Prince beamed earlier this week as they stepped out for a romantic dinner date at Asian eatery TAO in Hollywood.
 
Britney Spears‘ ex and the father of her two boys opted for a black suit and tie along with his signature fitted cap. Prince, 34, wore a tight black dress with matching heels. The blonde beauty let her locks tumble down to her shoulders.
The longtime loves just can’t seem to get enough of each other. And their respective Instagram accounts are riddled with photos of the couple.

On Monday, Prince shared a pair of selfies, writing, “My Ride or Die till the end😘”
They recently celebrated their four-year wedding anniversary, and Federline, 39, celebrated with a collage photo on the social media site, which included a sweet message for Prince.
“I couldn’t have found a better lover, best friend, drinking buddy, team mate, mom, and on … and on.. and on… you are the glue that holds us together,” he wrote in the photo’s caption.
