Conor McGregor Confronted By Paulie Malignaggi, 'Bring Your Balls, Conor'/nThings got real heated between Conor McGregor and Paulie Malignaggi at a fight media event in Vegas moments ago -- with Paulie getting right in Conor's face, teasing him about his balls. Paulie kept repeating to Conor,  "Did you bring your balls? " Conor reached out and put his hand on Paulie's shoulder and said,  "You got your ass whooped. Get over it. " Paulie is furious with Conor for releasing a sparring video from his training camp which showed him knocking Paulie down in the ring. Paulie claims the video was edited to make him look bad. Conor's camp says that's BS. Paulie will be part of the Showtime announcing team working the Mayweather fight -- but Showtime says it's not worried about slanted coverage.  Conor & Paulie get into it. @PaulMalignaggi tells @TheNotoriousMMA  "don't forget to bring your balls " #mayweathervsmcgregor @espnlasvegas pic.twitter.com /NjBRRxkqYI â€” Helen Yee (@HelenYeeSports) August 22, 2017/n
