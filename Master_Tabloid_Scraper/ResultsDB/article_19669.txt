Screen "Hunk" Victor Mature Dies/n
Funeral services were set for today for larger-than-life leading man Victor Mature, a certified screen "hunk" of the 1940s and 1950s who lent his lumbering presence to the film classics Samson and Delilah and My Darling Clementine.                Mature died August 4 in in Rancho Santa Fe, California, losing a three-year battle to cancer, his family revealed Monday. He was 86.                That an actor of his renown could be dead for nearly a week before word leaked to the press owes to Mature's low-key nature--one that was never so low-key then when he virtually walked away from Hollywood in the 1960s.                "I made a lot of money," Mature once said, "and I wanted to enjoy life and play golf."                      Before slipping into retirement, Mature racked up more than 50 film credits. Never lauded for his thespian skills, Mature nonetheless was an big-screen force. Who but the one dubbed "the hunk" (or the "beautiful hunk of a man") could rightfully lay claim to strongman Samson's muscles in Cecil B. DeMille's 1949 Samson and Delilah epic?                Mature also left an impression as Doc Holliday, opposite Henry Fonda's Wyatt Earp, in John Ford's 1946 rendition of the O.K. Corral gunfight, My Darling Clementine.                Other notable movies included: Kiss of Death (1947), Million Dollar Mermaid (1952) and The Robe (1953). One Million B.C. (1940) brought Mature one of his earliest, and most defining, roles--as the hulking caveman Tumak. (The film was remade in 1966 as One Million Years B.C., with bikini-clad Raquel Welch filling out the hunk-stress department.)          The semi-retired Mature once came in from the golf course to do a bit in the Monkees' psychedelic, Jack Nicholson-scripted cult comedy Head. And in 1984, he played Samson's father in a TV-movie remake of Samson and Delilah.            Mature was born January 29, 1915, in Louisville, Kentucky, where today's funeral will be held. Survivors include his fifth wife, Lorey.
