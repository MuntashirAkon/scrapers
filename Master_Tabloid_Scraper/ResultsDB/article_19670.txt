Lyons Den Rising Star: Victor Rasuk!/n
It takes one to know one.Victor Rasuk and I are both natives of New York City, which is where his HBO show, How to Make It in America, takes place. Season two premieres Sunday, October 2 at 10:30 p.m., and it was evident when Victor came by our newsroom that he's pumped for what's in store.That, or he's jacked up on too much Rasta Monsta.
