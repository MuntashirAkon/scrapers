Critics Pan Welch in "Victor/Victoria"/n
Raquel Welch as a man?               "Oh, come on!" says the New York Times. "No way," says the Associated Press.  Then again, Variety thinks, "She looks great in a tux."              The reviews are in for Welch's debut last night as the star of Broadway's Victor/Victoria--and there seems to be a certain credibility gap showing.  The role (previously held by Julie Andrews, Liza Minnelli and Julie Andrews again) calls for an actress who can play a woman who pretends to be a man pretending to be a woman.  To hear the critics tell it, Welch is too much woman, and not enough singer and dancer, to carry it off.               "Not for a single moment does Ms. Welch...make a remotely persuasive case for temporary manhood," writes Peter Marks in the Times.  He suggests the show be retitled Victoria/Victoria.              Reviewers didn't find Welch's impersonation of a Broadway personality persuasive either.  She "doesn't register as a star on stage, especially with her small and shaky voice," says the A.P.'s Michael Kuchwara. "But it must be noted that at the age of 56, she is a wonder of the physical world," Marks added, "shown to her best advantage here in the ensemble numbers in which she promenades in...Las Vegas showgirl get-ups."              "Welch does little to move this tired, star-driven musical beyond its own mediocrity," Variety's Greg Evans sums up.               Okay, guys, you've had your say--now watch your back. Welch is known for her temper on the job; the New York Post claims the stage crew called her "Vicious Victoria". She even spoofed herself in the last Seinfeld episode of the season. When Kramer contrives to accept a Tony Award, he's found out and told the only way he can keep the award is to go fire Welch from a show. They meet--and she beats him up.
