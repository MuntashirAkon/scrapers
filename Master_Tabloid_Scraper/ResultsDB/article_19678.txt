Joel Embiid Turns Up with Break-Dancing Kid in Africa/nJoel Embiid and DeMarcus Cousins have invaded Johannesburg for the NBA Africa Game ... and there's only one way to properly welcome the NBA superstars. DANCE CIRCLE!! The vid is awesome ... one break-dancin' kid went HAM to  "Work from Home " by Fifth Harmony -- and Embiid lost his mind. Seriously, Joel literally had to be held back --  "Da footwork, doe! " Elsewhere ... Dikembe Mutombo led a squad ft. Kemba Walker, Jaylen Brown and Victor Oladipo in a xylophone jam sesh ... and a face-painted Rondae-Hollis Jefferson ﻿even let it rip on a guitar. Epic. /n
