Victor Cruz Says He's Not Retiring from Football, 'This Ain't Over!' /nDon't stick a fork in Victor Cruz yet ... the ex-NY Giants wide receiver says he's NOT retiring from pro football and he's sick of people claiming he's throwing in the towel. The 30-year-old was released by the Giants back in February and hasn't signed with a new team yet -- but he's adamant he'll catch on somewhere and he's keeping himself in shape until that happens.   "I'm not retiring, " Cruz told  "Uninterrupted " ...  "This ain't no retirement party! "  Cruz says he wants to join a team in the next few weeks -- hopefully a contender -- and insists,  "This ain't over. It's just starting!
