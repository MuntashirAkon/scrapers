Lil Wayne Gives Russell Westbrook An Assist To Turn Up Onstage /nGreat news for Russell Westbrook ... he finally found a superstar willing to help him out ... Lil Wayne, who brought Brodie up onstage to turn up in Oklahoma city Thursday night. The Thunder were smacked from the playoffs by the Rockets earlier this week, but you'd never be able to tell by the way Westbrook was cheesin' onstage while Tunechi performed his hit,  "No Worries. " BTW, Thunder player Victor Oladipo was also onstage turning up, and looked like he was trying his best, but still didn't give Russell much help in the partying department. Remind you of anything?  Lil Wayne brought out Russell Westbrook to loud MVP chants No Problem: pic.twitter.com /o5uM15FZdj â€” Matt Ravis (@mattravis) April 28, 2017/n
