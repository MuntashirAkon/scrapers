After 'Dancing with the Stars' Loss/nLolo Jones says she felt broken, unlovable and embarrassed after she was eliminated from  "Dancing with the Stars " Tuesday night ... and penned an emotional letter saying she's sick of being a loser.

I thought oh no here it comes again. People are going to ridicule me. I'm so tired of feeling embarrassed. " "I joined the other competitors upstairs and I couldn't force a smile on my face.

"Jones -- who's been RIPPED in the public over her lackluster performances at the Olympics over the years -- added,  "I really wanted to stay on the show and have the layers of hurt wash away by showing the public how hard I work. I wanted to come away a victor for once. I wanted to do so good performing in public that the haters would stop teasing me. " "But that is my way of thinking. Not Gods. Instead I need to trust God that he would heal my heart. That I would not work so hard for the world to validate and redeem me but know that God already conquered that for me on the cross. "She concluded ...  "My time was brief but the lesson is lasting. Thank you everyone who wrote me kind messages. You were helping me not fall into darkness. "Yeah, she's taking this pretty hard./n
