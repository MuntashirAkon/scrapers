Victor Cruz -- WHAT INJURY?! Parties In Miami With Hidden Knee Brace/nVictor Cruz won't let a busted right knee keep him from hitting the party scene ... 'cause the NY Giants star hit up a huge party in Miami Thursday night -- with his knee brace -- and we've got the pics. Cruz -- sporting a medical brace under his sweatpants -- hit up a Crooks & Castles party presented by Hennessy V.S for Art Basel Thursday night.  Despite the fact he's recovering from a season-ending torn patellar tendon in his right knee that he suffered during a game back in October, Victor was seen laughing and having a great time at the party. Meanwhile, back in NY ... Cruz's teammates -- who have lost 7 straight games -- are preparing to take on the Titans this weekend. Cruz seems to be making good progress on the knee -- he looked pretty spry while walking through a NY mall a few weeks ago ... and told us he expects to be busting out his salsa again very soon./n
