Rob Gronkowski -- YES, I'VE BEEN CHEATING ... On My Diet, Bitches! /nTo the victor, GO THE CHEESEBURGERS ... so says Rob Gronkowski who tells TMZ Sports he's been on a celebratory cheeseburger binge ever since he won the big game.   "I've been eating cheeseburgers off the charts, " Gronk told us out in NYC earlier today. Don't worry, the burgerfest is only temporary ... Gronk says he'll be back on his regular diet in just a few days -- but if anyone's EARNED a burger break, it's this guy. Bonus -- Gronk told us he'll be spending time in L.A. this summer and says he hopes he can continue making waves in Hollywood ... where he's already landed a movie role ( "Entourage ") and TV cameos ( "Whose Line Is It Anyway? ").  Our fingers are still crossed for a Gronk & Marshawn Lynch reality show. /n
