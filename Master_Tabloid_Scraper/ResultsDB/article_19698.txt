Chris Weidman and Floyd Mayweather -- Two Champs Hangin' in Vegas (PHOTO)/nUFC champ Chris Weidman mixed fun with mixed martial arts this weekend, mugging with Floyd Mayweather at a Vegas pool after his title victory. Chris didn't look the worse for wear after his 1st round submission against Victor Belfort at UFC 187. The sunglasses are pretty big and could be hiding a bruise or 2, but Weidman took care of business pretty quickly so probably not. The 2 champs chilled at the pool at The Palms, where Weidman was hosting a post-fight event. Both fighters share something pretty impressive .... they're both undefeated./n
