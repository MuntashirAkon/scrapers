American Pharoah -- TRIPLE CROWN WINNER!!/nHe did it!!! American Pharoah became the first Triple Crown winner in 37 years by holding off the field to take the Belmont Stakes. American Pharoah was heavily favored -- after winning the Kentucky Derby and The Preakness -- but we've seen this many, many, many times before -- and the Triple Crown hadn't been won since Affirmed in 1978. AP, ridden by Victor Espinoza, was awesome -- leading the Belmont from wire to wire. The horse is now the 13th horse to win the Triple Crown. And if you haven't been paying attention to the sport -- yes, his name is a typo. And he still managed to win. Amazing!/n
