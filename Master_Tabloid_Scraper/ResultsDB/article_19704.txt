David and Victoria, who announced in January that they were expecting their fourth child, have been very open about their desire for a daughter, and RadarOnline.com first reported in February that their wishes for a girl were going to come true.

Victoria has said that she’s desperate to have a girl so that they can spend hours, “painting her nails, putting on make-up, and choosing clothes.” 
In February, David’s legal battle over an article in In Touch Weekly magazine in which prostitute Irma Nici, 26, alleged that she had a series of sex romps with the dad-of-three for $10,000 cash in 2007 was dismissed by a judge.
However, the soccer superstar is still at war with the publishing company that scored a victory against him in his hooker defamation lawsuit; he’s filed an objection to the proposed order dismissing his lawsuit.
