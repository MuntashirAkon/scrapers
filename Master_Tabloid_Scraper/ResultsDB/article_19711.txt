“Beckham’s international fame, the fame of his marriage to Victoria coupled with the emerging trend of high-profile stars cheating on their wives, causes this report to fall squarely within the statute’s broad definition of ‘public interest,'” the publishers said.
Nici, in an October 4, 2010 story called “David’s Dangerous Betrayal,” said the sexy soccer stud bedded her on multiple occasions, everywhere from New York to London.

Beckham responded in a subsequent declaration: “I have never met Nici, let alone committed adultery with Nici or paid her for sex.”
