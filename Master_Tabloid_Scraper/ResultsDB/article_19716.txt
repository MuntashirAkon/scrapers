EXCLUSIVE: David Beckham Counter-Sued By Former Call Girl Who Claimed Affair/n
Irma Nici, the former hooker who is being sued by David Beckham for her published claim that they had a fling, is fighting back with her own lawsuit against the married soccer great, RadarOnline.com has learned.
According to her attorney, Nici filed her suit in Los Angeles County Superior Court Friday.

Represented by attorney Paul Rolf Jensen, Nici filed a special motion to strike Beckman’s libel lawsuit.
“California law does not allow public figures like David Beckham to stifle free speech,” Jensen says.  “Maybe he didn’t live here in Los Angeles long enough to learn how precious we here consider our rights to tell the truth in print.”
The sports superstar, married to singer-turned fashion designer Victoria Beckham, is also suing the magazine that printed Nici’s allegations.
Nici’s lawyer separately filed a cross-complaint for emotional and physical injuries he says she received when a process server showed up at her New York hotel with Beckham’s lawsuit last week.  Her suit claims she was hounded until she had to leave the hotel.
“She was immediately hospitalized as a direct result of this event,” Jensen says.  “Beckham is responsible for his goon’s conduct, and we will hold him liable for it.”
This latest legal action comes on top of revelations in a bizarre divorce case where a multi-millionaire lawyer claims his jewelry-designer wife was having an affair with Beckham.  Both she and Beckham fiercely deny the allegation.
