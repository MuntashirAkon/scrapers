Hey Lady! Jerry Lewis Wins Oscar/n
     
Although Jerry Lewis has never been nominated for an Oscar, the governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences will be presenting the comedian and filmmaker the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award during the February Oscar ceremony.
This award is given to people whose humanitarian efforts have brought credit to the movie industry.
The 82-year-old Lewis, whoâ€™s first movie was My Friend Irma in 1949, and who has acted in and directed countless movies since, has been the Muscular Dystrophy Association national chairman since 1952, raising over $2 billion with his annual Labor Day telethon. /n
