#BannonOut! See The Best Twitter Reactions To Steve Bannon Being Fired!/n

Steve Bannon is out!!!
In a teeny tiny little bit of good news from the world of politics, the vocal alt-right (AKA white supremacist) supporting White House Chief Strategist has finally been kicked out.
Though we're being told it was some kind of mutual breakup by Sarah Huckabee Sanders, two officials told CNN he was straight up fired.

And while this doesn't get rid of the alt-right problem in the White House — after all, Donald Trump himself is all too happy to defend them on national TV — it is at least a small victory we can cheer.

It is a delicious irony that the white supremacist rally has led to the ouster of the most visible white supremacist from the White House.

Someone should let Bannon's former employer know about his white supremacist leanings so he can't go back to work there.

Congrats to Steve Bannon on being the only Trump adviser to emerge with his reputation exactly as tarnished as it was before he went in.

Please let the door hit you on the way out, Steve Bannon! Bye Felicia!

But not everyone was celebrating.
Many couldn't savor the win knowing racism was still very much alive in the White House:

Bannon is out. Beware! He can do the exact same thing without an official title in the Administration. Nothing changes until Trump is out.

Getting Bannon out of the White House won't solve the problem. Neither will one sip of water in the desert but thank you yes I'll drink that

Steve Bannon is a problem, but Steve Bannon is not the problem.

Um what kind of sociopath hires Steve Bannon in the first place?
— billy eichner (@billyeichner) August 18, 2017


Steve Bannon is out, but Stephen Miller and Sebastian/Katharine Gorka still in. White Nationalists linger in the White House.
— Wajahat Ali (@WajahatAli) August 18, 2017


Let's be clear, Steve Bannon being removed from the WH means nothing so long as Stephen Miller & Sebastian Gorka remain there. GET THEM OUT!

Even though Steve Bannon has been destroyed, Trump still has a few more horcruxes left. pic.twitter.com/vEO5LpKKSb

One thing we know: Steve Bannon is not resigning to protest the President's apparent support for white supremacists.
— Rep. Brad Sherman (@BradSherman) August 18, 2017


If Steve Bannon is fired from this administration it should only serve as a reminder that he was in this administration in the first place.
— Jared Yates Sexton (@JYSexton) August 18, 2017


Steve Bannon may be out of the White House but the hate that he and Trump emboldened still remains as a cancer in our nation
— (((DeanObeidallah))) (@Deanofcomedy) August 18, 2017



As far as racism in the White House goes, Steve Bannon's departure is a total Game Samer.
