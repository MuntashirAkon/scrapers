NBC has announced that their next live musical production will be Andrew Lloyd Webber’s 1971 rock opera, Jesus Christ Superstar.

It will debut on Easter Sunday in 2018 (Apr. 1) and will be directed by Webber, NBC’s live musical partners Craig Zadan and Neil Meron, lyricist Tim Rice, and Marc Platt.
Jesus Christ Superstar tells the story of Jesus’s last week of life, beginning with the preparation for his arrival in Jerusalem and ending with his crucifixion. It features hits such as “I Don’t Know How to Love Him,” and biblical characters such as Judas Iscariot, Mary Magdalene, and Pontius Pilate.

“As we continue to expand the profile of our live musicals, we are thrilled to be partnering with Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice to bring a new live staging of the iconic Jesus Christ Superstar to NBC,” said Robert Greenblatt, Chairman of NBC Entertainment [via Deadline]. “Casting has just begun, but we want to fill out this classic show with as many recording artists as possible to give proper voice to what is the original rock opera score.”
Last year on Easter Sunday, Fox aired The Passion from Tyler Perry.
