American Idol is officially returning to television on ABC for the 2017-2018 season, and it’s going to be “bigger, bolder and better-than-ever.”

ABC announced that they’ve acquired the rights to the beloved singing competition 13 months after it ended its 15-season run on Fox. The network confirmed the news early Tuesday morning ahead of further announcements about renewals and series pickups that will roll out over the next two weeks.
“American Idol on ABC…that has a nice ring to it,” said Ben Sherwood, co-chairman of Disney Media Networks and president of Disney-ABC [via HThe Hollywood Reporter]. “Idol is an entertainment icon, and now it will air where it belongs, in ABC’s lineup of addictive fan favorites alongside Dancing with the Stars and The Bachelor.  America, get ready for the return of a bigger, bolder and better-than-ever Idol.”

The network did not reveal details about any on-camera talent that will be attached to the show, though TMZ reports that Ryan Seacrest “seems interested” in returning to host despite his recent commitment to co-hosting Live! with Kelly Ripa. Meanwhile, Simon Cowell is now the executive producer and a judge on NBC’s America’s Got Talent.
“American Idol is a pop-culture staple that left the air too soon,” said Channing Dungey, president of ABC Entertainment. “ABC is the right home to reignite the fan base. We are thrilled viewers will once again share in these inspiring stories of people realizing their dreams.”
