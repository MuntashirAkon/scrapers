Helen Mirren -- Drops Best Geriatric Twerk Ever/nShe's late to the game, but Dame Helen Mirren risked her 68-year-old hip to do some twerking ... and the video is pretty awesome.Helen was at Harvard to receive the Hasty Pudding Club's Woman of the Year Award yesterday ... when they dared her to go where Miley Cyrus, Nicki Minaj, and thousands of other women more than half her age have gone.Helen refuses at first, but eventually drops it kinda low. Hey, it's definitely hotter than anything Madonna's done lately.So, we gotta ask .../n
