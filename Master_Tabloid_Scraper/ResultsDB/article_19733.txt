Caitlyn Jenner is opening up about her sex life — particularly about the one she had with ex-wife Kris Jenner.

In an excerpt from her upcoming memoir, The Secrets of My Life, obtained by People, the Olympian formerly known as Bruce Jenner shares her most intimate moments. While she writes sex with Kris was “imbued” with love, Caitlyn admits she was not always 100 percent okay with it.
“My attitude is no different than it was in high school: I’m just not entirely comfortable with it,” she recalls. “Since — let’s not kid ourselves — everyone wants to know, Kris and I have good and frequent sex at the beginning.”

In another passage, Caitlyn reveals she may never become intimate with another woman again. “A future female companion? I think about that. A future female sexual companion? Not happening, at least for now, and perhaps not ever,” she writes. “A future male sexual companion? I have never had the inclination. But maybe that attitude might possibly change if I have the Final Surgery.”
“I don’t have the appetite for [sex], which is why the public’s obsession over whether I would [get gender confirmation surgery] is annoying to me,” Caitlyn, who underwent sex reassignment surgery in January, explains. “It hearkens back to this misperception that people transition because of their sexual desires.”
