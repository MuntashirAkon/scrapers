According to ET, supermodel Kate Moss and Michael’s longtime partner, Fadi Fawaz, were in attendance at the funeral.
Michael passed away at the age of 53 in his home in the U.K. on Dec. 25, 2017. He was discovered dead by Fawaz. The Senior Coroner for Oxfordshire confirmed earlier this month that Michael died of natural causes.
“As there is a confirmed natural cause of death, being Dilated Cardiomyopathy with Myocarditis and Fatty Liver, the investigation is being discontinued and there is no need for an inquest or any further inquiries,” the coroner’s statement read.
