Today we learned that Mariah Carey works out in fishnet stockings and Rihanna’s Fenty x Puma stiletto heels, and so did Rihanna.

It’s the beginning of February, so we can imagine that you are tired of seeing photos of people in your social media network sticking to their 2017 #fitspiration #goals and posting all of the selfies to prove it. We’ll spare you the monotony by sharing Carey’s gym series from her workout session with Gunnar Peterson that she posted on Instagram instead.
These are her sprints:



Running amok. @gunnarfitness

Climb every mountain 👊🏾😘 @gunnarfitness

This circuit workout is pretty brilliant and Rihanna thought so too considering that the Elusive Chanteuse is wearing her Fenty heels. She re-posted Carey’s photo on her own Instagram account and wrote in the caption, “Yo I made it!!!”
In addition to releasing this photo set before the weekend, Carey dropped her collaboration with YG on Friday called “I Don’t.” She teased the song earlier this week on social media as the first season of Mariah’s World came to an end. Is it about James Packer or breaking up with sneakers? Decide for yourself by watching the track’s music video:
