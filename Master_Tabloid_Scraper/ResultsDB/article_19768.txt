Rihana’s Huge Weight Gain!/n
POP star Rihanna has packed on over 30 pounds — but she’s OK with it!
“Being size 0 is not realistic — and it’s not healthy!” the eight-time Grammy winner declared.
Despite that, her fleshy new figure has sent online fat-shamers into overdrive!
Barstool Sports blogger Chris Spagnuolo was suspended after posting: “A world of ladies shaped like the Hindenburg … may be on the horizon now that Rihanna is traipsing around looking like she’s in a sumo suit.”
The uproar erupted after the Barbadian beauty, 29, burst out of her jeans and off-the-shoulder top in Manhattan on May 28.
A week later she looked like a titanic fruit salad stuffed into a tiny crop top while filming a video in Miami’s Little Haiti.
“Rihanna seemed super confident, and you can see she’s loving herself  at the moment,” noted one observer.
“You just have to accept your body,” the megastar said. “You may not love it all the way, but you just have to be comfortable with it.”
Saudi Arabian billionaire Hassan Jameel, 29, was MORE than comfortable when he wrapped his arms around every inch of Rihanna in a hot embrace in a pool on June 27 during a Spanish getaway!
There’s just more to love, we guess! /n
