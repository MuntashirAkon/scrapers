Tori and Dean's Soho Stroll/nA new baby can be exhausting for two parents to handle all alone -- which is why Tori Spelling and Dean McDermott needed a nanny to accompany them on a family rendezvous in the Big Apple this weekend. Nothing says  "bonding " like a paid caregiver! Where's Mr. Belvedere when you need him?! Over in the Hamptons, Mandy Moore hit the Jaeger-LeCoultre Polo Charity Cup where she looked like a breath of fresh air -- which was clearly needed at an event where horses are the main attraction. Stomp the hell out of those divets! A fro' sportin' Howard Stern -- the shock jock not the lawyer -- was also partying in the Hamptons along with his fianc√© Beth Ostrosky and supermodel Christie Brinkley at Hamptons SOCIAL @ Ross. In Los Angeles, Ray J and Lil' Kim attended Magic Johnson's 48th birthday party, proving why they're still in the running to be the next Pam and Tommy Lee! Also spotted out was Helen Hunt (where she been?) --looking very maternal, Hilary Swank and Katherine McPhee -- who all attended a house party event on Sunset. All this and more in today's gift wrapped edition of Star Catcher!/n
