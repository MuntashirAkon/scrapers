Like Kylie Jenner before her, Khloé Kardashian was called out by another company for allegedly ripping off their ideas.

A woman named Destiney Bleu, whose work has been worn by Beyoncé and Serena Williams, just accused the Revenge Body host of stealing her designs and using them for the Good American denim brand.
According to the designer, Khloé had previously asked her to customize several bedazzled bodysuits tailored to fit a curvy figure. Destiney finally decided to finally put the reality star on blast after seeing similar items show up in a promotional video for Khloé’s clothing label.

When someone buys 1 of everything on your site, has you make them custom @dbleudazzled work, never posts it or wears it, then copies it. 🙃https://t.co/hylp6fcOdh

“When someone buys 1 of everything on your site, has you make them custom @dbleudazzled work, never posts it or wears it, then copies it,” Destiney tweeting, sharing a link to a campaign clip of models in pieces from the new fashion collection.
Though Khloé herself hasn’t commented on the matter, the Good American label seeming hits back at the claims by sharing photos of celebrities like Cher, Diana Ross, and Britney Spears in sheer, glittery one-pieces. In what can only be describe as a shady subtweet, the company’s Twitter writes, “Important to know your fashion history #nofrauds.”

“Under no circumstances did Good American or Khloé Kardashian infringe on another brand’s intellectual property and we are going through the proper legal channels to handle the situation,” an official statement from the brand reads.
Though Khloé’s camp denies the stealing allegations, this isn’t the first someone from the Kardashian clan has been accused of copying someone else’s product and selling it as their own.
Kylie Jenner, whose makeup company has been a booming success, faced the same claims when her Kyshadow eyeshadow palette looked almost eerily identical to one created by BH Cosmetics. In the past, she was also accused of ripping off ColourPop’s Ultra Matte Lip Stain colors Clueless, Beeper, and Limbo when it became apparent that her original three lip kits — Candy K, Dolce K, and True Brown K — were nearly identical in shade and consistency.
