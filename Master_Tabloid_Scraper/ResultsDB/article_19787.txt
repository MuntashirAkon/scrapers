UPDATE: The Wayne County Medical Examiner’s Office issued a statement following a preliminary autopsy, reading, “The cause of death has been determined as hanging by suicide. A full autopsy report has not yet been completed.”

Hollywood is in mourning after Chris Cornell, the frontman of Soungarden and Audioslave, passed away at the age of 52.

The grunge rock icon was found unresponsive in his bathroom at the MGM Grand hotel following his performance in Detroit Wednesday night (May 17, 2017), according to his rep.
A family friend reportedly had to force his way into the musician’s room after receiving a call from Cornell’s wife, Vicky Karayiannis, to check up on him. Emergency personnel arrived on site shortly after midnight Thursday, when Cornell was pronounced dead at the scene.

Michael Woody, a spokesman for the Detroit Police Department, told CNN the death is being investigated as a “possible suicide.” Though he declined to provide details, he added “basic things observed at the scene” suggested Cornell may have killed himself.
TMZ claims the person who broke into Cornell’s room “found him with a band around his neck.”
Cornell was the father of three children: Toni and Christopher — with whom he shared with Karayiannis — and Lillian Jean from his previous marriage to manager Susan Silver.
The singer, who struggled with drug use throughout his career, sang “Slaves & Bulldozers” as his last song. The performance also included parts of Led Zeppelin’s “In My Time of Dying,” a track Soundgarden’s frequently covered. Watch his final live show — below.
