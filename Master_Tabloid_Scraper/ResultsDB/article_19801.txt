Jean-Claude Van Damme Storms Out of TV Interview: "What the F--k Is Going on With Australia?"/n
"I'm 55 years old. So I'm not anymore 35, 25. I'm 55 years old," he continued. "So I've got a different view of life, and we'll talk about this in Australia. But those interview you are giving me on TV right now, they are very boring. Because the questions are boring. It's difficult for me to answer the question, so I start to sweat. I don't feel good, because then I'm very...they are boring. Next question? You have something interesting to ask me?"Van Damme then stood up, claiming he had to go to the restroom, and tore off his microphone. "What the f--k is going on with Australia? What the f--k is going on?" the actor said while removing his mic. "I cannot do this. I'm too natural. You can blow this stuff away. What is this?"The actor, who is on location in Bangkok, will start his speaking tour Down Under next month.
