Hold that celebration Sean Penn…Wyclef Jean may not be out of Haiti's presidential race just yet. Following news that the country's board of elections rejected Jean's presidential bid Friday night, the Grammy winner, who actually penned a song called "If I Was President," says he hasn't given up on his candidacy, according to the New York Times.

Jean is reportedly planning to appeal the board's decision on claims that it threw out his presidential bid before the BCEN (national electoral dispute office) could issue a final ruling on the issue of his residency. "Tomorrow our lawyers are appealing the decision of the CEP," Jean wrote on his Twitter page Sunday morning. "We have met all the requirements set by the laws. And the law must be respected." The CEP—Haiti's provisional electoral council—didn't give a specific reason why it disqualified the hip-hop star from the upcoming race in the first place. But, based on the country's laws, it appeared it was due to residency requirements. While Jean is Haitian-born, the law states that a presidential candidate must live in the country for five consecutive years leading up to the election. Jean seemed to have come to terms with the decision after it was made, writing on the Huffington Post  shortly thereafter, "Though I disagree with the ruling, I respectfully accept the committee's final decision, and I urge my supporters to do the same." But now it appears he's gearing up for a fight.
