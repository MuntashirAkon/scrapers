Vivica A. Fox Sued by Ex-Strip Club Partner for Poaching Dancers, Ruining Biz/nVivica A. Fox's former business partner says she ruined his  "Black Magic " male stripper revue by bad mouthing him and stealing his dancers ... according to his lawsuit. Jean-Claude LaMarre says his partnership with Vivica went south when she went on  "The Breakfast Club " and said the  "Black Magic " guys don't strip for gay men. The LGBTQ community blasted her, and LaMarre says Vivica got pissed at him when he distanced himself from her ... during a  "TMZ Live " appearance.  According to docs, Vivica started plotting to start her own male revue -- recruiting 4  "Black Magic " dancers -- and bad mouthing LaMarre to sway them to join her team. In the suit, LaMarre says Vivica actively tried to torpedo promotions for his show by calling it a  "fake, " and telling her fans to avoid  "Black Magic " like the plague. We've reached out to Vivica's reps, no word back yet. If this one goes to trial ... we smell a hung jury./n
