Sam Adams & USA vs Belgium World Cup Match -- Don't Bocott Belgian Beer!!/nPeople who are boycotting Belgian beer in support of Team USA soccer are only screwing themselves out of an opportunity to DRINK GOOD BEER ... so says Samuel Adams founder Jim Koch. Of course, with Team USA's big match against Belgium just hours away -- some Americans are 86'ing all things Belgium from their lives ... waffles, chocolate, Jean-Claude Van Damme, etc. But Koch tells TMZ Sports ... the beer shouldn't suffer.  "We hear some people are boycotting their favorite Belgian beers (like Stella) in support of Team USA, " Koch says ...  "I can’t say I agree with beer boycotts because then you’re giving up your right to drink your favorite beer! " "For me, I’ll be cheering on Team USA with a Samuel Adams Boston Lager, my favorite. If you really want to show patriotism, I say boycott Brussels sprouts or Belgian waffles. "USA takes on Belgium at 1PM PT -- there will be no Belgian waffles in our office./n
