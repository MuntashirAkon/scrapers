Casey Kasem's Widow -- Jean Dropped by Her Attorneys ... You're M.I.A. & Owe Us Cash/nJean Kasem just made another enemy -- her attorneys are cutting her off ... claiming she's a pain in the ass client who also happens to owe them a ton of cash.According to documents filed in Casey Kasem's conservatorship ... attorneys at Haney & Young are asking the court to relieve them as counsel for Jean, ASAP.The lawyers claim Jean rarely responds to their emails -- and refuses to communicate by phone -- and she's ignored mounting fees (temporary conservator, Casey's attorney and others) against Casey's Estate ... which they say could end up totaling $500,000.In a letter to Jean, the firm says if she doesn't deal with the bills -- and also pay her tab to the firm -- the total will come out of Casey's Estate. We've made calls to Jean, but she's not getting back to us either./n
