 Is Kim's BFF In Danger? Larsa Pippen's Ex Scottie Secretly Arrested For Domestic Battery.../n
Kim Kardashian‘s best friend Larsa Pippen has been accused of cheating on her husband Scottie with rapper Future, prompting the NBA legend to file scathing divorce papers.
But the 42-year-old former Real Housewives of Miami star’s ex has his own fair share of dirty laundry.
More than 20 years before police were reportedly called to the family’s Florida home twice in a month for domestic disturbances, the Chicago Bulls alum, now 51, was arrested for allegedly getting physical with his former fiancée.
According to Illinois’ Lake County Circuit Court records obtained by Radar, Scottie was charged with two counts of domestic battery stemming from a May 1995 incident.

That summer, The Chicago Sun Times reported that Scottie’s fiancée, Yvette DeLeone, told police that he had “grabbed her by the arm and pushed her into a car” in the garage of their Highland Park home during an explosive fight.
DeLeone later told authorities that her superstar boyfriend had abused her in previous incidents.
After three hearings, both charges were ultimately dropped on July 17, 1995, the records indicate.
DeLeone reportedly told prosecutors that she no longer wished to pursue the charges.

The former couple share a daughter, Sierra, 21.
Now, two full decades later, Scottie is in another messy split with his second baby mama. (Larsa and Scottie have four children together.)
As Radar exclusively reported, Scottie has demanded full custody of their kids, and begged the court not to order him to pay his Kardashian pal ex any alimony.
