Madonna's Kids At Each Other's Throats Amid Bitter Custody Battle/n
Madonna has been making headlines for her custody battle with her ex-husband, Guy Ritchie, but behind the scenes her kids are immersed in their own war of words!
Madonna’s loyal 20-year-old daughter, Lourdes Leon, is begging her wayward half-brother, Rocco Ritchie, to show more compassion for their mom.
“Lourdes hates seeing how stressed he mom’s been throughout this whole custody ordeal, she thinks Rocco is a brat who needs to pull himself together and stop playing his parents off against each other,” an insider revealed.
