Mom Again! Madonna Plans To Adopt Another Baby Boy/n
Devastated over her war with her teenage son, Madonna plans to ease her pain by adopting a baby boy, sources told RadarOnline.com.
Since Rocco, 15, fled to his director dad Guy Ritchie‘s home in England late last year, the Material Girl has begun a search for a new child, said the insider: “She’s trying to lessen the pain of losing Rocco.”
While in the Philippines for her Rebel Heart tour, Madonna dropped by the Bahay Tuluyan Foundation and Hospicio de San Jose orphanages.

She posted selfies from her visits, but asked staffers not to take pictures, said the source. “Madonna is keeping everything under wraps,” the source added.
But it seemed like the visits were a success.
“The children stole Madonna’s heart, and she’s plowing forward with plans to adopt a baby boy from one of them,” the source claimed.

As Radar reported, Madonna, 57, and 47-year-old Ritchie divorced in 2008, and they are now locked in a bitter custody battle over Rocco. The “Vogue” singer has already adopted two children from Malawi: David, 10, and daughter Mercy, 10. She also has a daughter Lourdes, 19, with ex Carlos Leon.
“The situation with Rocco makes her heartsick, and there’s nothing she wants more than to adopt a baby boy,” the insider claimed.
