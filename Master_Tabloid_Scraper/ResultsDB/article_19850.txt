 Kourtney Kardashian Made 'Great Move' Splitting With Scott Disick –– Andre Leon Talley.../n
Kourtney Kardashian made a “great move” in breaking up with Scott Disick, according to family friend Andre Leon Talley, who said the breakup is “good for [their] kids.”
Talley, the famed Vogue editor who snared a coveted invite to Kim Kardashian and Kanye West‘s wedding last year, was asked his opinion about the parting on Watch What Happens Live Sunday — and didn’t hold anything back in his response.
The 65-year-old fashion industry powerhouse said, “I think … that it’s a great move for her, because she cares about her children, and she said somewhere, ‘I must sacrifice my relationship with him to make sure my children are OK.'”

Talley, admitting he knows Kourtney better than Scott, said he thinks that “a few other issues” Scott had probably accelerated the breakup.
“Wasn’t he in rehab recently, and he was chasing other skirts?” (The answers are yes and yes.)

Talley said he was confident Kourtney didn’t make any rash moves before consulting with her “Momager,” Kris Jenner.
“I am sure Kris said to her daughter, ‘Clean it up and move on‘ … it’s good for the kids,” he said.
Kourtney herself has echoed similar thoughts in her rationale behind the breakup, insiders told RadarOnline.com, when it comes to her children with Disick: Mason, Penelope and Reign.

“Kourtney has told those close to her that her and Scott’s children will be much better off with her,” sources told Radar. “And pretty much everyone agrees with this decision.
“Those kids are going to be raised with a lot of love from Kourtney’s sisters, as well as Caitlyn and Kris.” /n
