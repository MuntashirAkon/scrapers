Diva In Training! Madonna's Daughter Lourdes Leon Snubs 'Vile' Kylie Jenner/n
Lourdes Leon has absolutely zero interest in keeping up with the Kardashians — or Kylie Jenner!
RadarOnline.com can reveal that Jenner had hoped to find a gal pal soul mate in Madonna‘s 18-year-old daughter when she reached out to her last month suggesting they hang out, but the youngest Kardashian’s BFF plea fell on deaf ears!

“Lourdes was horrified,” a source tells Radar, adding Leon has been trash-talking Jenner, 17, ever since.
“She thinks Kylie and her sisters are vile and has made a big effort to avoid being in the same room as any of them,” says the source.
“She couldn’t believe Kylie thought she’d be receptive to a party invite and has completely ignored her — as far as Lourdes is concerned, she’s not going to lower herself to even responding.” /n
