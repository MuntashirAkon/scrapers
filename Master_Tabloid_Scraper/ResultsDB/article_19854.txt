2 Much, 2 Soon? Woman Claims She Had On-Set Fling With Late Actor Paul Walker/n
Fans flocked to theaters to see Paul Walker in Furious 7, the last film he shot before he died, but his former fling recalls him in another light — and she doesn’t seem ashamed to dish all the details.
Cindy Leon, a now 30-year-old legal assistant in a Boca Raton, Florida, law office claims she first met Walker and his fellow co-star, Tyrese Gibson, on the set of 2 Fast, 2 Furious in Miami around 2003.
Leon allegedly hooked up with both men, a fact that Gibson recently decided he should share on The View, prompting Leon to tell her side of the story.

Leon, who worked as Eva Mendes’ body double on the film, reveals that Gibson and Walker had a discussion and realized they were both seeing her. “It seems like it’s pretty much how they started bonding,” she explains in a video interview. “You know how boys can be, they either fight about it or become best friends.”
She goes on to claim that Walker was “sweet and loving” in the bedroom and that it seemed “surreal” at the time that she was hanging out with the “calm” star.
When asked about Walker’s manhood, Leon, in a TMI confession, claimed, “He was good, he was not small.”
While both Gibson and Leon maybe should have thought twice about dishing on the late Walker, Leon insisted she doesn’t “have any regrets” about their relationship that lasted a “couple weeks” since “this was over 10 years ago.”
