Kendall Jenner has no bad blood with her sister’s ex-boyfriend.

The model caught up with Khloé Kardashian’s former flame, French Montana, at the after-party for the Los Angeles premiere of Diddy’s Can’t Stop, Won’t Stop: A Bad Boy Story Wednesday night (June 21, 2017).
Joined by sister Kourtney Kardashian, the 21-year-old held court with the rapper at their very own VIP booth. An insider told Celebuzz the two sisters were friendly with French, “laughing away” as guests sipped on CIROC Vodka and Deleon Tequila cocktails. Kendall looked cute and casual in a Balenciaga sweater, while French was dressed to the nines in a white suit.
Aside from the Keeping Up with the Kardashians stars, other attendees included Madonna, Vin Diesel, Chris Brown, and Lana Del Rey with rumored boyfriend G-Eazy. Wiz Khalifa and his new gal pal, Izabela Gueda, we also spotted getting cozy on the dance floor.
