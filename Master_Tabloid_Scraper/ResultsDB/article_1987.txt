Posh: Woman of the Year? Puh-leeze!/nDressed like a total poshtitute in what appears to be a botched tuxedo /racing ensemble, Victoria Beckham somehow took home the Woman of the Year crown at the Glamour Magazine awards last night. Say whaaaat?!Though Mrs. Beckham was touted by the mag's editor as  "a role model " and  "indicative of the modern woman, " Beckham's only recent accomplishments appear to be constantly looking hungry and pissed-off, and shtupping one of the sexiest men in the world. Role model indeed ... for automatons and streetwalkers! Other  "glamorous " women honored at the event included Sienna Miller -- who said she had too much wine to make a speech -- and the musical group Girls Aloud (think Pussycat Dolls with British accents). What, Jordan wasn't available? The ceremony was somewhat redeemed by also giving awards to Angelina Jolie (yes, Posh beat Angie for the highest honors), Beyonc√© and Helen Mirren -- though none of them showed up to receive the, er, honor.
