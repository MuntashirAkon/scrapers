Do you remember when Katy Perry was married to Russell Brand? No? Well, that’s okay because Ellen DeGeneres doesn’t either.

Perry was a guest on Ellen on Tuesday (May 16, 2017) to talk about Witness, her forthcoming album, and the tour that will coincide with its release, but DeGeneres diverted for a few moments to play a matchmaking game called “Will You Perry Me?” given that Perry recently emancipated herself from Orlando Bloom. Before getting started, Perry jokingly asked, “Do I have to get married…again?“
“You were not married,” DeGeneres replied, and Perry had to remind her that:

She married Brand when she was 25
DeGeneres gave her wedding gifts for that wedding on her show

They proceeded to play after DeGeneres promised to donate $10,000 to the Boys & Girls Clubs of America if she participated. In the middle of this “Who’d You Rather” game that offered her male romantic partner options of Harry Styles, Chris Martin, Leonardo DiCaprio and others, Perry asked, “What if I’ve like, kissed a bunch of these people already?”
If only we were so #blessed. Watch the video at the top of the page to see the whole game play out in its uncomfortable glory.
