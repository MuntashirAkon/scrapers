Adam Nimoy made headlines in 2016 when he revealed that he was working on a documentary to memorialize his father Leonard  — whose portrayal of the logical but lovable half-human, half-Vulcan Mr. Spock captured hearts around the world starting in the late 1960s.
“When I originally approached my dad about making the documentary it was just going to be Spock-centric all the way, from beginning to end,” Adam Nimoy told PEOPLE in July of 2016. “It was really supposed to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Star Trek coming up in September.”
The father-son duo began work on what would become For the Love of Spock in Sept. 2014, but just a few months later Leonard passed away on February 27, 2015 at the age of 83 after a long battle with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
“After my dad died there was such an outpouring of emotion,” he says. “Not only for Spock but the loss of Leonard Nimoy the artist and renaissance man. It became clear when I decided to continue on with the project that it had to include my dad’s life as well.”
A month after creating  a Kickstarter to raise funds for the documentary the project met and surpassed its $600,000 goal by more than $60,000, Variety reported.
