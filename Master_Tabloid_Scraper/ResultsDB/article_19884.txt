Usually, it's her mother who is making headlines.But Madonna's daughter Lourdes Leon herself managed to do just that when she decided to flip the bird (times two!) at photographers snapping her picture in New York City on Tuesday, Nov. 12.Sporting a pair of formfitting jeans, sneakers, a letterman's jacket and a large scarf draped around the top of her head and neck, the 17-year-old was clearly not in the mood for the prying paps as she made her way to school.

Then again, maybe she was merely preparing for her role as Betty Rizzo.According to the New York Daily News, Lourdes has been cast as the tough and sarcastic leader of the Pink Ladies in the LaGuardia High School production of Grease.Of course, when she's not letting her fingers do the talking or working on musicals, the gal continues to keep herself busy collaborating with mom on their Material Girl line.
