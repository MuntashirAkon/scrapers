Kings Of Leon is certainly one of the biggest bands around the days.But rock aficionados aren't the group's only fans…

Trey Songz has actually been sampling the group's hit single, "Use Somebody," while on tour with Usher. "I sing a portion of it, and the fans have taken a liking to it," the "Bottoms Up" crooner told us at the American Music Awards.They also want to know if he'll actually record his version. "They keep asking me to, so I may," Songz said. "I love Kings of Leon and the music they make. It's just beautiful."In other music news from the AMAs, Disney Channel star Mitchel Musso says his girlfriend, Gia, definitely had a part in at least one of the songs on his new album, which dropped earlier this week."Being an actor, I like to make up stuff a lot of the time, you know?" Musso said. "I think that comes with the territory. But 'Come Back, My Love' is the most personal song...to my girl, Gia."Just how in love are the two? Musso showed us by opening his mouth and revealing that he's had Gia's name tattooed inside his lower lip.If that's not commitment, we don't know what is.
