Is Lourdes Leon on her way to dorm room living and studying for midterms? It appears she might be.Madonna and her 17-year-old daughter caused quite a frenzy on Twitter, and presumably on campus as well, when they were spotted touring the University of Michigan on Wednesday, Nov. 20.Many students tweeted sightings of the mother-daughter duo around the Ann Arbor college grounds."I Just saw THE Madonna at Umich! #nobigdeal," one student tweeted."Casual celebrity spotting on campus #Madonna" one fan said on the social networking site."I'm not kidding.... Madonna is here... And she's in the music deans office... ***debates skipping voice lesson to stalk her*****" another student wrote.

Leon visiting the School of Music, Theater and Dance makes a lot of sense given the brunette beauty's background.She attends the performing arts LaGuardia High School in New York City and according to the New York Daily News, she was recently cast as the tough and sarcastic leader of the Pink Ladies in the school's production of Grease.Madge has her own history with the University; she was a student briefly before moving to New York to pursue her music career. She has made it no secret that she would like her daughter to follow in her college footsteps."I want my daughter to go to school there," the 55-year-old Grammy winner told the NFL Network in 2012 before her Super Bowl XLVI halftime performance. "I keep telling her, Ann Arbor is an awesome place."
