Some teenagers turn on the TV when they need a little study break, but when you own a clothing company like  Madonna's daughter Lourdes Leon, you use your downtime to blog about spring trends.That's right, the fashionable teen, who owns Material Girl along with mama Madge, took a break from studying for the SATs to share her thoughts on her fave styles for the upcoming warm weather season on the label's blog."I feel like finally this sense of body con dresses and tube skirts has left us (praise the lord)," the 15-year-old shared.

Amen, Lourdes! There's nothing like a roomy tee or shift dress to help a gal as she transitions into bikini season. And while the svelte Lourdes definitely doesn't look like she needs to spend any time at the gym, she can still commiserate."I mean okay they look nice but really no one is comfortable lets be frank among friends (oooh peep my alliteration)," she went on to say about the body-hugging looks of past seasons. "I think (I hope) you guys will be pleased to see that the spring 2013 collection of Material Girl incorporates more loose t-shirts and tank tops and flowy-er-y-ish-like skirts and dresses. Yay. Ugh gotta let da body BREATHE."

Indeed, Georgia May Jagger, who stars as the face of the brand's spring 2013 campaign (and joins former Material Girl spokeswomen like the rocker chic Taylor Momsenand Kelly Osbourne) definitely doesn't look like she has any trouble moving in a breezy high-low skirt or roomy mini-dress, as she models the latest duds from the line.And to complete your look, Lola suggests you "shave your legs (or dont #live)." Looks like this material girl is also a laid back one!
