Rihanna -- Karaoke Hoggin' in Germany/nRihanna violated karaoke etiquette at a bar in Germany this weekend -- hogging the mic to yell and sing her way through TWO songs in a row -- but it's Rihanna so no one complained ... duh. It all went down at the Thai Royal Bar in Cologne ... where a baseball cap-sportin' Rihanna and a friend sang  "Don't Speak " by No Doubt ... followed by  "Sex on Fire " by Kings of Leon. Rihanna's currently on a world tour -- and is scheduled to perform in Germany tomorrow night ... so, kinda badass that she's also hitting up karaoke bars and singing during her down time./n
