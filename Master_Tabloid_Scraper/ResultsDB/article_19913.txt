Ray J: Jewelry Haul May Explain Armed Guard /nRay J may have good reason to have armed security follow him around, because he and his fiancee are dripping in tens of thousands of dollars in jewelry.  The singer hit up Richard Nektalov over at Leon Diamond in NYC for a 4 carat diamond and rose gold RJ pendant, with a $10k price tag attached. But that was just the beginning. Ray also left with a $40k rose gold Rollie and two charm pendents at $7,500 a pop.  Leon Diamond does well by Ray J ... it's where he bought the 8-carat engagement ring for Princess Love back in October.  This may explain why Ray and Princess Love were escorted by a hooded, armed security dude Thursday when they hit up a Detroit nightclub. /n
