 'Little People's Jacob Roloff Claims He STILL Doesn't Get TV Money After Slamming Show!.../n
Jacob Roloff isn’t backing down.
Days after slamming his family’s famous reality show, Little People, Big World, as fake and declaring he will never again appear onscreen, the 19-year-old rebel told fans he’s still not getting money from his previous work.
Responding to a fan who dissed him for earning paychecks from his cameo in the show’s opening credits, Amy and Matt Roloff‘s youngest son set the record straight.

“There is no money to be missed,” he wrote in the comments to his earlier Instagram rant. “I haven’t and still don’t get ‘royalty checks’ from a simple 20 second intro.”

Last year, Jacob publicly stated that he had been “f***ed” out of TV money after starring on the show for roughly eight years. (He stopped regularly appearing on the series in 2013.)
Months later, he appeared to reconcile with his parents and siblings. But now, the family unity seems to be smashed.
He does have an ally in his corner. Girlfriend Isabel Garreton supported Jacob in the comments, claiming he has changed his “anger” into “love;” and agreeing that the show is “fake.”
She also argued that “not everyone responds well to fame,” and pointed out that he was just six years old when pushed into Little People.


Jacob, the only liberal in his staunchly conservative Christian family, and Isabel live a quiet live in California with their dogs, while their parents and siblings still call their native Oregon home. /n
