“Ashton really hopes to have a boy next,” the source tells Radar, “but they will be happy as long as the baby is healthy.”
Kutcher and Kunis first met on the set of That 70’s Show, which ran from 1998 until 2006. They remained friends until 2012 after Kutcher split from his ex-wife, Demi Moore, and they began dating.
Although Kutcher did not cheat on Moore with Kunis, there have been sparks for years. The Jupiter Ascending actress once told W magazine, “My first real kiss ever was with [Ashton] on the show. We all get movie star crushes. I’m marrying mine.”
