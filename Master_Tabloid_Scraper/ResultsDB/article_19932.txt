“They always celebrate Thanksgiving Day at his mom’s house,” added the insider. “And they like to stay at a cabin close by so they’ll have some privacy with the new baby.”
The Two and a Half Men star, 36, grew up in Cedar Rapids, where his divorced parents Larry and Diane and his fraternal twin brother, Michael, still live.
