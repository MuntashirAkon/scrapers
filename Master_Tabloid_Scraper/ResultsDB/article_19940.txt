PDA alert!
Kylie Jenner joined new beau Travis Scott in Miami over the weekend â€” and the two were seen canoodling and swapping spit after his show at the Rolling Loud Festival (above)!
Later, the KUWTK star and the 25-year-old hopped aboard a yacht for a dinner party at Miami's River Yacht Club with Miami nightlife guru David Grutman and his model wife, Isabela Rangel, where they all enjoyed a $2K meal, according to TMZ.
