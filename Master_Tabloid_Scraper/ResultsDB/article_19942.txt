Emma Stone's La La Land Dreams Come True Winning Best Actress At The 2017 Oscars!/n

We were hoping for at least one upset at this year's Oscars, but there's no denying the talent and charm of Emma Stone!
That's because the 28-year-old just won Best Lead Actress for her role in La La Land!!
Emma was overwhelmed by the honor (and by being next to presenter Leonardo DiCaprio) when she took the stage to collect her award â€” thanking her parents, friends, and, of course, costar Ryan Gosling.
The actress also gushed over the raw talent in her category, saying it was an honor to stand beside fellow nominees Natalie Portman, Meryl Streep, Isabelle Huppert, and Ruth Negga.
She wrapped up her speech by saying she'd use the award as a reminder for all the learning and growing she still needs to do. We think you're doing alright, Em!
Watch her adorable speech (above)!
