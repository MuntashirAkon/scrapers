Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott set sail for a private yacht party on Sunday (May 7, 2017).

The rumored couple set sail on a yacht to head to a dinner party at Miami’s River Yacht Club. Jenner and Scott got cozy on the deck while friends and bodyguards milled about the boat.
TMZ reports:
The romantic night out was pricey … they dined with Miami nightlife mogul David Grutman and his model wife, Isabela Rangel. We don’t know who picked up the tab, but it was $2,000 … and much of that was shots of Don Julio.
