Chanel Nicole, daughter of Coco Austin and Ice T, turned one year old last week and her parents went all out on Sunday (December 4, 2016). Thankfully, Austin documented every moment of the big day on Instagram.

The celebration happened a week after the girl’s actual birthday so the family could mourn the loss of their dog, Spartacus, according to People. Now that some time has passed, the family could donate all their attention to  Chanel’s special day.

The family narrated the party from Chanel’s point of view on her own Instagram. “Finally celebrating my birthday later on today!” the first post read, “They put me in this hat the minute I woke up.” The caption went on to state how sleepy the little girl still was.

She eventually woke up in time to hit her first birthday party in style. Minnie Mouse-style, to be specific.

When the cake came out and people started singing, Chanel was absolutely transfixed. Those gigantic candles might have also had something to do with it.



My Birthday was magical! So many people singing to me I was in a trance ( mom and I changed into Cinderella dresses from @isabella_couture headband by @miracle_bowtique Cake by @cakesbycoley ) #chanelnicole1

Also in attendance at Chanel’s birthday party were all the other Law and Order: Special Victims Unit babies. “Chanel and I made a change of outfits for the cake celebration,” Austin explained.

All in all, Chanel’s first birthday seemed like a big success. In one final Instagram post, Austin said it all went down beautifully. “Ice and I are proud parents,” the caption read.
