H&M;/Twitter

We all know Isabel Marant has amazing design skills, but did you know she can also model?That's right, the designer struck a pose to give fashion fans their first peek at her highly anticipated collection for H&M!The retailer tweeted a pic of the chic Parisian dressed in her designs earlier today."H&M followers, you're the first ever to see @isabelmarant wearing the #HMIsabelMarant collection! What do you think?"We're guessing Marant devotees won't be disappointed by the first look at her creations for the Swedish retailer. For starters, her blousy print dress is totally in keeping with her boho chic style, and the black-and-white design goes with just about anything in a gal's closet.

But we'd definitely pair it with the fringed booties Marant shoes off in the pic! Make no mistake about it, Marant—the woman responsible for the wedge sneaker craze—knows how to design a stylish pair of kicks. And since H&M is known for giving us designer goods at accessible prices, we'd say this is the perfect opportunity for fashionistas to follow in the stylish footsteps of Marant fans like Jessica Alba and Miranda Kerr, who have both stepped out in her wedge sneakers in the past.And given the fact that the slouchy boots have what appears to be a modest heel, we'd say they're just as comfy as her sneakers, which is just the way Marant wants it.

"I aim at creating something real, that women want to wear in their everyday lives, with a certain carelessness, which I think is very Parisian: you dress up but do not pay too much attention and still look sexy," she said in a release announcing her collaboration with H&M last month. "The collection is infused with this kind of easiness and attitude."Marant follows a long line of trendsetting designers who have teamed up with H&M, including Karl Lagerfeld, Lanvin, Versace, Stella McCartney, Roberto Cavalli, Marni, and Maison Martin Margiela.Past collaborations, like Cavalli's collection, have been known to sell out in a matter of hours, so we'd advise having a game plan set for your Marant purchases come November 14, when her items hit store shelves!
