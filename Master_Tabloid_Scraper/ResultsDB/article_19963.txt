Annette Benning and Warren Beatty's daughter Isabel has now joined an elite group of young women after she was formally presented at the Debutantes Ball in Paris over the weekend.The 17-year-old was seen entering the Theatre National de Chaillot alongside her famous mother dressed in a gorgeous teal gown.The teen was all smiles and dolled up for the formal event, wearing her hair half-up and sporting matching baubles.Meanwhile, the 56-year-old Oscar nominee looked equally as ravishing in an all-black ensemble with her hair swept off her face.

Both mother and daughter couldn't hide their smiles as they made their way into the prestigious occasion, and laughed for photographers while strolling around the City of Light.Isabel joined several other children to famous parents this year, including model Pat Cleveland's daughter Anna, computer magnate Michael Dell's daughter Juliette, Hannibal star Mads Mikkelsen's daughter Viola, and last (but certainly not least) Jamie Foxx's eldest daughter, Corinne.The Django Unchained actor's daughter made her modeling debut earlier this year with a campaign for Icing.The beauty isn't a stranger to the limelight, however, as she's been on her father's arm for multiple red carpet events since she was just 10 years old.

Back in 2011, Demi Moore and Bruce Willis' daughter Tallulah Willis attended the Hotel Crillon's debutante ball with her parents in tow.That same year Andie MacDowell's look-alike daughter Sarah Margaret stunned in a custom couture gown at the yearly ceremony. Earlier, MacDowell's eldest daughter, Rainsford Qualley, was also introduced to society.And in 2012, Rosanna Arquette was by her daughter Zoe Bleu's side for the black tie gathering dressed in custom-made Jean Paul Gaultier.Meanwhile, Clint Eastwood and Sylvester Stallone's daughters have been welcomed into the very beautiful, and small, circle of women.
