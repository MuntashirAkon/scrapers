When it comes to the wedge sneaker trend, we absolutely have Isabel Marant to thank.The second the French designer debuted these fashionable-yet-comfy kicks in 2012, they proved to be wildly popular among celebrities and style mavens everywhere, inspiring knock-offs of all kinds in the blink of an eye.And while they often say that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, Marant could actually do without.In fact, she tells Footwear News, that she won't even wear her own designs due to the abundance of unsightly copies.

"I don't wear them as often as I [used to] because I see too [many bad copies] in the street. I'm not saying mine are the most beautiful shoes, but they have a certain [style]," she explains. "And on the weekends, I'm so happy to have them because I feel so good in them. I don't want to throw them out."And for good reason! The sporty sneakers are comfy, stylish and add the illusion of heightâ€”all desirable qualities that every girl wishes for in a shoe.Though she adds, "There are a lot of copies, and the bad copies are super-ugly."Ouch!

And while Marant is decidedly moving on to create fresher designs for the masses, she reports that the wedge sneaker isn't going anywhere soon, knock-offs or not."People want [the original]. I'm still selling a lot."
