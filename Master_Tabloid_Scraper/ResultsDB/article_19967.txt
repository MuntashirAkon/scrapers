Stylish minds think alike!Just take a look at Kirsten Dunst and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, who wore identical sheer patterned dresses within just one day of each other.The blond beauties clearly have excellent taste in fashion (as well as swanky VIP status), as their matching feminine frocks are from the yet-to-be-released Isabel Marant for H&M collection.The fabulous designer collaboration line doesn't officially hit select stores until Nov. 14, but it looks like being famous totally has its fashion perks!

We're guessing the gorgeous gals were just recently gifted the flirty pieces mere days ago and the momentum to showcase their highly-anticipated pieces made it a no-brainer when getting dressed this week.In other words, a twinsie time occurrence was inevitable!

The leggy model, who was seen leaving a doctor's office in Beverly Hills, paired her must-have dress with suede fringed boots from the same collection; while the actress emerged from the hospital after tending to an injured right hand, in simple black flats and a coordinating leather bucket bag.Whether dressed up or down, this playful fall piece is scoring big points with us.Are you excited for the Isabel Marant for H&M collection?
