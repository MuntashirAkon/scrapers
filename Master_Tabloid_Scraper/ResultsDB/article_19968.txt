Cameron Diaz is living out every female celeb's worst nightmare. She's wearing the same outfit as Rosie Huntington-Whiteley—after Rosie wore it. There may be no greater fashion hell.Of course The Body Book author has just an enviable a shape as the Transformers: Dark Side of the Moon actress, but that just makes the battle of who wore it best trickier. But if this is a question of who had more fun wearing it, the answer is obviously The Other Woman star.

Since the Isabel Marant one-piece is such a simple, black design, we have to judge on accessories and overall styling. The British beauty chose a classic tan overcoat and Jackie O glasses with equally sophisticated hair. The Cali native went in the exact opposite direction, rocking an edgy statement necklace, sexy strappy heels and bed head (of the best variety).But we can't leave out the facial expressions when providing our final say. Rosie may be an impressive catwalk star but Cameron's grinding pout face is impossible to top.Agree or disagree?
