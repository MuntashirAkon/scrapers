Kim Kardashian Beats Her Maid ... In Court/nKim Kardashian kicked butt in a lawsuit filed against her by a maid.As we first reported, Kim's former maid, Isabel Hernandez, filed suit against both Kim and her former hubby, Damon Thomas, claiming they stiffed her to the tune of $29,000 in back wages between 2006 - 2008. Kim's defense was simple -- she moved out of the house in 2003 and divorced Thomas in 2004 ... so she had nothing to do with it. Isabel folded like a cheap suit and filed a dismissal against Kim. We're told Kim didn't have to pay her a penny. Isabel's suit against Damon is still active.     More Kim Kardashian      Maid to Kim Kardashian: Clean Up Your Act!
