Isabel Wants No Part of Adrian's Entourage/nIsabel Lucas broke up with Adrian Grenier, NOT the other way around. Despite reports to the contrary, Isabel walked out before Shia LaBeouf's car crash. Our spies say right around Adrian's birthday (July 10), Isabel heard a female friend from out of town was coming to visit him. After this, Lucas was blunt ... him having  "girl " friends was a deal breaker. So she ditched him and he's been begging her to come back ever since! We're told Adrian made a play for Isabel after the accident, but she had nada interest in working things out.
