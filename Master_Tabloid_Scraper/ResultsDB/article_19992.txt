It was a battle of the curves at the 2012 ALMA Awards, where Eva Longoria and Christina Aguilera showed off their fantastic figures in sexy dresses. 
Longoria rocked a stunning Monique L’huillier gown on the red carpet, but it was her Alberta Ferretti strapless number inside the show that really got our attention, while Aguilera poured her curves into a lace accented Michael Kors gown, jazzing it up with embellished Christian Louboutin heels, Neil Lane bling and a Judith Leiber clutch.

As for wacky, Lady Gaga sassed up the tents of Philip Treacy’s London Fashion Week show, wearing a garland of flowers style face mask.
