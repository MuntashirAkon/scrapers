The Cannes Film Festival is by far the glammest film fest in the world, with Hollywood’s hottest stars invading the South of France in the most luxurious designer duds – but not all of them get dressed to impress! RadarOnline.com has all the wardrobe winners and sinners from the first two days of red carpet festivities.  
Eva Longoria is clearly letting the world know that she is ready to evolve into a big screen bombshell! The former Desperate Housewives star hit the opening ceremony and the premiere of Moonrise Kingdom in a stunning Marchesa gown that featured a dramatic train, following it up at the opening night dinner in a beautiful black Alberta Ferretti number.
