Lil’ Kim was dressed to shock – no surprise there! The sassy rapper hit the stage Down Under, performing in Sydney in totally tacky S&M style duds, which included a fishnet and leather bra-baring corset top and a single, silver MJ inspired glove.

As for wacky, Snooki definitely grabbed attention in Sin City, hosting a pool party in her version of, um, retro? The Jersey Shore firecracker brought her trademark pouf back for the soiree, adding a headband to the mix.
Other style scores included Zoe Saldana in Prabal Gurung, Julianne Moore in Bottega Veneta and Kristen Bell in Alberta Ferretti.
