8-Year-Old Girl Disqualified From Playing In A Tournament For Looking Like A Boy — WTF?!?/n

This is SO not okay.
An 8-year-old girl from Nebraska was barred from playing in the finals for the Springfield Soccer Club's girls tournament as organizers for the event insisted she was a boy. WHAT???

Apparently, Mili Hernandez's short hair left officials CONVINCED the soccer-loving youngster was a boy trying to play in the girls tournament. On her decision to keep her hair short, Mili explained: 

"When my hair starts to grow I put it short because I've always had short hair. I didn't like my hair long."
The ruling to disqualify Mili and her Omaha Azzuri Cachorros teammates from the competition obviously left the kiddo "in shock." According to Mr. Hernandez, his daughter was incredibly distraught over the situation. He revealed:

"She was crying after they told us… They made her cry."
How awful. To make matters worse, Mili's family tried to prove her gender by showing her insurance card. Shockingly, this proof wasn't enough for event organizers. Smh.

Miz Hernandez's brother added:

"They didn't want to listen. They said the president made his decision and there wasn't any changing that."
This is just straight up discrimination. In fact, Mili put it perfectly to one news outlet:

"Just because I look like a boy doesn't mean I am a boy. They don't have a reason to kick the whole club out."
Hear! Hear!
Thankfully, Mili hasn't been deterred from playing soccer altogether as there are other tournaments she can play in. Not to mention, organizers have said if Mili and her family want to challenge the disqualification they can appeal it with the Nebraska State Soccer Association. However, we should probably mention the officials also have an attorney advising them at this time.
Shady, shady, shady.
