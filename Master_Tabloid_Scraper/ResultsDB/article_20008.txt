TMZ reports the model claims in a new lawsuit that she was harassed from the very beginning at her job at the Alberta Ferretti boutique, with inappropriate comments and unwanted advances leveled at her for four months in 2015.
She further claims that on October 1, her manager spanked her in front of coworkers during a staff meeting and also assaulted her by shoving her head. She further states that things only got worse when she complained and that HR didn't help at all.
Naima added that she began having panic attacks and ultimately had to resign from her job.
The Alberta Ferretti boutique did not comment on the suit.
