Recently, the Oscar winner spoke about her plans to direct. Amid news that she’s signed on to helm a feature called Project Delirium, Lawrence told Entertainment Weekly, “I have wanted to direct as long as I’ve wanted to act. I just don’t talk about it because I’d rather just do it.”
She continued, “I’ve wanted to direct since I was 16 and always thought I should start making steps towards that. If I had tried to do it earlier, I wouldn’t have been ready. Now I actually feel ready.”
