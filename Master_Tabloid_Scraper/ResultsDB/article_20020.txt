The Revenant, which also stars Will Poulter, Domhnall Gleeson, and DiCaprio’s BFF Lukas Haas, is drawn from Michael Punke’s 2003 novel of the same name and the real-life adventures of American fur trapper and frontiersman Hugh Glass.
From 20th Century Fox:
In an expedition of the uncharted American wilderness, legendary explorer Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) is brutally attacked by a bear and left for dead by members of his own hunting team. In a quest to survive, Glass endures unimaginable grief as well as the betrayal of his confidant John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy). Guided by sheer will and the love of his family, Glass must navigate a vicious winter in a relentless pursuit to live and find redemption.
The Revenant opens nationwide on Dec. 25 (just in time for awards season).
