 Yep, that’s Leonardo DiCaprio and his man bun speaking to us from across the border.
On Monday, the 39-year-old actor, along with some good ‘ol Canadians, took a break from their tour of the tar sands in Alberta to complete the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge.

DiCaprio, who was challenged by a shirtless David Beckham one week ago, went on to challenge Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper.
