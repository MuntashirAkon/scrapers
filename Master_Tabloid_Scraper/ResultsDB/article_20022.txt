Austin Mahone Wants You/n
Yes, you. Do you want Austin Mahone? Probably? He’s a “thing” now, I hear. A thing for if you’re looking for a less problematic version of Justin Bieber. That counts as a thing! Hashtag youth! Today’s winning captions are also a thing. Hashtag all the things!

“Look, there goes Justin Bieber’s talent” – Alberta
“Pull my finger…I dare you” – Marilyn
“Boom. Pregnant” – Mufaro
“ET phone home….” – Ashley
Congrats to our winners! Visit our Facebook Page for a new Caption Contest each and every weekday. It’s never too late to add a caption, so do so in the comments!
