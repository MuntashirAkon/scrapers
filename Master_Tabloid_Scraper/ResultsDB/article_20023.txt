Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth Reunite in Canada/n
Could Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth find their true north in the Great White North?
After weeks apart amid speculation of a split, the on-again, off-again couple has reunited in Canada. Cyrus, 20, and Hemsworth, 23, were snapped strolling the scenic lands nearby the Jasper Fairmont Park Lodge in Alberta, where they are reportedly staying.

Cyrus, in a Tupac tee, bikini bottoms and white Adidas slip-on sandals, and Hemsworth, wearing a dark shirt, khaki pants and sneakers, even posed with a fan for a photo op.
The “We Can’t Stop” singer is in town to visit her fiancé while he’s stationed in Canada to shoot his role in Matt Shakman’s upcoming thriller Cut Bank.
This marks the first time the couple has been spotted together since last month, when they stepped out arm-in-arm at Arclight Cinemas in Hollywood, Calif. But before that date night, the pair — who have been engaged since May 2011 — hadn’t been snapped together in five months.
Rumors of Cyrus and Hemsworth calling off their engagement first started to swirl when the couple attended separate events on Oscar night in February — with the latter allegedly seen canoodling with Mad Men actress January Jones at an Academy Awards after-party.
But Cyrus has continued to deny any trouble in paradise, even confirming just last month: “I’m engaged. I’m engaged.”
