Selena Gomez Announces Worldwide Arena Tour/n
Selena Gomez may be coming to a city near you.
On Monday, the 20-year-old announced that she will be embarking on 56-city world tour — dubbed her Stars Dance Tour 2013 — starting this summer.
“I couldn’t be more excited to tour again but this time around the world,” she wrote on her Facebook page.

The big announcement came after SelGo’s performance of “Come & Get It” at the 2013 MTV Movie Awards, where she was seen sporting a bindi that caused many fans to tweet in protest of the cultural appropriation.
Love her or hate her though, there’s no denying that Gomez is having one heck of a year so far.
After splitting up with tween heartthrob Justin Bieber, the former Disney starred in the much-hyped about Spring Breakers before joking to talk show host David Letterman that she had made her famous ex cry.
