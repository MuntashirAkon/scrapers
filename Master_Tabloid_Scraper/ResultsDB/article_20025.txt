Nikita and 24 Actress Alberta Watson Has Died/n
Canadian film and television actress Alberta Watson has died. She was 60.  
Watson – who was best known for her role as special agent Erin Driscoll on the Fox drama 24 – died Saturday at Kensington Hospice in Toronto after a lengthy battle with cancer, her agent confirmed to PEOPLE.  
“It is with heavy hearts that we announce the passing of the luminous Alberta Watson,” agent Pam Winter wrote in a statement. “Alberta died in the arms of her beloved [husband] Ken.”  
Watson was diagnosed with lymphoma just as she was settling into the role of Senator Madeline Pierce in the second season of La Femme Nikita, according to a tribute posted by the Toronto-based Gary Goddard Agency.  
Watson also acted on the silver screen, playing memorable roles in films such as director David O. Russell’s 1994 feature, Spanking the Monkey, and the 1978 romance drama In Praise of Older Women. She also acted in the 2001 film adaptation of Hedwig and the Angry Inch and 2007’s The Lookout, alongside Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Jeff Daniels and Isla Fisher.  
Details of a memorial service have not yet been finalized, according to her agent.
