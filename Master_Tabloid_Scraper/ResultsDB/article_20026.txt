The wait is almost over! Alberta Ferretti’s capsule collection for Macy’s bows on April 17 — but you can catch a glimpse of the styles here before you go shopping.
Today, Macy’s released images of the collection, which includes lacy tops, bright, summer dresses, delicate floral patterns, a few white staples and some dramatic longer dresses.
“The collection I created is fresh and bright, featuring light summer clothing that evokes the spirit of my beautiful country [Italy] and is at the same time true to my style,” Ferretti said in a statement back in February.
Two of our favorite pieces include the perfect pink wrap dress (left, $69) and a tiered blue maxi (below, $109). A one-shouldered orange maxi dress ($99) is another standout, as is a sweet aqua cocktail frock with pleated skirt (also $99).
Ferretti is a favorite of stars like Amanda Seyfried and Eva Longoria, and recently cast Solange Knowles in her runway show. She also collaborated with Emma Watson last year; the pair created an eco-friendly capsule collection together. Tell us: Will you shop Alberta Ferretti for Macy’s?
