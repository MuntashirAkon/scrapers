Doo.Ri’s designs for Macy’s haven’t hit stores yet (mark your calendar: Feb. 15!) but the store is already looking forward to its next big collaboration, this one with Alberta Ferretti. The Italian designer’s collection of dresses, pants, blouses and knitwear will hit Macy’s stores and macys.com on April 17.
“The collection I created is fresh and bright, featuring light summer clothing that evokes the spirit of my beautiful country and is at the same time true to my style,” Ferretti said in a statement. “Macy’s numerous prestigious locations, as well as its important online presence, have been a unique and exciting opportunity for me to gift my ‘Italian Dream’ to a vast and diverse audience.”
Ferretti’s collection for Macy’s includes looks “from bohemian styling to garden party fashions,” according to a release, and offers oranges, pinks, teals, teans and whites perfect for summer. The maxi dresses, boho blouses and prints will run from about $49-$119.

The designer is a favorite of stars like Amanda Seyfried and Eva Longoria, and recently cast Solange Knowles in her runway show. But her biggest celebrity fan is likely Emma Watson, who designed an eco-friendly capsule collection with her last year. “The young are the future,” Ferretti told PEOPLE at the time, “and I am always inspired by new ideas.” Tell us: Will you shop Alberta Ferretti for Macy’s?
