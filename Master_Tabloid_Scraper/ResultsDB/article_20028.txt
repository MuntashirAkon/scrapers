Emma Watson's Alberta Ferretti Collection Debuts/n

Courtesy Pure Threads/Alberta Ferretti; Inset: Bru

Does Emma Watson ever sleep? She’s modeled for Burberry, collaborated with People Tree, started work for Lancome — and don’t forget her day job acting in the Harry Potter movies! Recently, she announced she was designing a small collection for Alberta Ferretti, called Pure Threads, and today, the line goes on sale exclusively at albertaferretti.com. It consists of just five pieces: two dresses ($1010-$1080), a shirt ($670), a long skirt ($880) and a pair of denim shorts ($340), all enriched with lace embroideries and made with organic fabrics such as cotton poplin, cotton muslin and hemp. According to Ferretti, Watson really made the line her own. “Emma was very much involved in the design process, and was very particular in how she wanted the collection to look and feel,” she tells PEOPLE. “Emma has a great freshness about her and is very intelligent, and this made it a pleasure to work with her.” Though a second collaboration isn’t planned (yet!), Ferretti says she’s happy to work with more rising stars. “I am always keen to seek new talent,” she shares. “The young are the future and I am always inspired by new ideas.” Tell us: Will you buy a piece from Watson’s line? —Kate Hogan
