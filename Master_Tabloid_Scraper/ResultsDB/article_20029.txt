Shortly after announcing her second eco-friendly fashion collaboration, Emma Watson has expanded her stylish résumé yet again, this time for a “green” capsule collection with Italian designer Alberta Ferretti. According to WWD, the line, called Pure Threads, consists of five pieces: two dresses, a shirt, a long skirt and a pair of denim shorts, all enriched with lace embroideries and made with organic fabrics such as cotton poplin, cotton muslin and hemp. “Emma had a Jane-Birkin-in-the-Seventies image in mind,” Ferretti told WWD about the starlet’s inspiration. A portion of proceeds from the collection will be donated to People Tree, a nonprofit organization Watson supports. “I’m pleased that a luxury brand such as Alberta Ferretti has decided to create ecological clothes,” said Watson. “I believe this is a big step forward for all of the international fashion industry, but also an important step for an increased sensitivity to the problem of ecology.” Pure Threads will be available exclusively on albertaferretti.com beginning March 21. –Kim Peiffer
