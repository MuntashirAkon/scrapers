Alberta Ferretti to Send Camilla Belle and Other 'Real Women' Down the Runway /n

Ramey

While they may be a ways off from “real women,” the announcement that notables like actress Camilla Belle will be walking in Alberta Ferretti’s upcoming runway show in Italy came as a welcome surprise. “My muses are always the women of today. I wanted to show my outfits on women, not only on models like in Milan,” Ferretti told WWD  of the limited-edition collection that she designed and will show at the international exhibition Pitti Uomo on Jan. 11. While the fashion industry has come under fire for its employment of too-thin models, Ferretti’s choice to send a psychologist, lawyer and blogger along with Italian socialites and actresses down the catwalk next month comes just a few months after designers Zac Posen and Jean Paul Gaultier cast plus-size model Crystal Renn to walk in their shows during Paris Fashion Week. In conjunction with the unorthodox line-up, Ferretti joins Aeffe Group to pledge a donation to The Jordan River Foundation, a nonprofit Jordanian organization that works to empower women and children. About the upcoming collection, which she described as “demi-couture,” the designer says, “This show will be about women and not only the clothes.” Tell us: Do you think the push for “real women” as models is a step in the right direction for the fashion industry? —Justine Harman
