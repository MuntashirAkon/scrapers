Forget the recession! On Wednesday night, Hollywood fashionistas welcomed Italian designer Alberta Ferretti with open arms.  Ferretti celebrated the launch of her 4,500 square foot U.S. flagship store on Melrose Ave., showcasing the Alberta Ferretti Collection, Philosophy di Alberta Ferretti, Alberta Ferretti Girl, accessories and footwear.  “This is a great location and a big deal,” said Elisha Cuthbert.  Attracting the likes of Lucy Liu, Marisa Tomei and Nicole Richie, Ferretti kept it simple and sweet — just like her frocks.  “It’s a very good evening for me.”  Inside the store, Richie and Joel Madden sipped on Martin & Rossi champagne with friends Nicky Hilton and David Katzenberg inside the innovative space.  “People are depressed – they drink and they shop, which is what I’m going to do right now!” said Mad Men‘s January Jones, who summed up her take on the current state of economy.  “I got a beautiful purple silk coat that’s reversible that has light purple fur on the inside. Its kind of pimpy — I’ll pimp it out occasionally,” said Jones, who admitted to receiving a very kind discount from Ferretti.  “How thrifty am I?” — Kimberly Lansing
