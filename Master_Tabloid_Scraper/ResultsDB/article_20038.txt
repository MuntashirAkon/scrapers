Hold up: These outfits are really cute and really expensive.As the countdown continues for the birth of Beyoncé's twins, the "Crazy in Love" singer decided to share new photos of her Mother's Day celebration on Instagram Friday night.In the candid pictures, Beyoncé and her daughter Blue Ivy Carter were spotted wearing hydrangea-print chiffon dresses by Dolce & Gabbana during their visit to the Museum of Ice Cream in Los Angeles.While a private group tour for up to 10 people costs $1,500, Beyoncé's dress for the afternoon outing came to a whopping $5,395.This isn't the first time the "Irreplaceable" singer has shown off some designer looks during her pregnancy journey with twins. 

While there is plenty to discuss about fashion, we can't help but also point out the cultural phenomenon that is the Museum of Ice Cream.During Beyoncé's visit that also included Jay-Z and Tina Knowles, the family played in the iconic life-size sprinkle pool, ate gummy bears and went on the swings.

"Being at the ice cream museum makes you feel like a kid again," Tina shared on Instagram after the visit.And pretty soon, two new beautiful kids will be part of this famous family. We can't wait to meet them both.
