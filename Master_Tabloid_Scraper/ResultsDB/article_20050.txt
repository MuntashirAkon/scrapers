'Bachelorette' Couple -- Stuck in the Mud/nOne year after they hooked up on  "The Bachelorette " -- Jillian Harris and Ed Swiderski are still gettin' down and dirty. The couple -- still engaged by the way -- went on a camping trip back in Jillian's hometown of Peace River, Alberta recently and decided to take a couple of ATVs into mud country. Jillian tells us they got stuck more than 30 times ... and were completely covered in the brown stuff. Check out the pics -- it's pretty messy./n
