Garth Brooks, 5 Millionth Fans ... You Get a Car, You Get a Car!!! (PHOTOS)/nGarth Brooks is nothing if not ridiculously generous ... he surprised a husband /wife who became the 5 millionth fans to take in his world tour with not one, but 2 cars. Sources at the arena tell us the couple scored a Lexus SUV and a Nissan truck before Friday's Edmonton, Alberta concert.  They also got a $5k Amazon shopping spree, a $5k Edmonton mall spree, a trip for 2 to the Wynn in Vegas, and a bunch of Garth and Trisha Yearwood merch. By the way ... Garth broke his own concert attendance record. Back in the 90's his tour hit 5 million tickets sold in 100 cities.  This time around it was 5 mil in just 60 cities. It's like winning the lottery in low places./n
