Jenkins Hanged, Cops Search for Mystery Blond/nRyan Jenkins was found dead in Canada yesterday -- hanging from a coat rack in a motel room -- but the investigation into the murder of his wife, Jasmine Fiore, continues.Authorities in Canada are looking for the woman who allegedly drove Jenkins to the Thunderbird Motel in Hope, B.C. on Thursday and checked him in. The manager of the motel says she was in her early 20s and drove a silver PT Cruiser with Alberta license plates. The woman stayed with Jenkins for about 20 minutes and wasn't seen again. The woman paid upfront for three days -- in cash. The manager claims he never got a good look at Jenkins because he waited in the car while the mystery blond checked him in. When Jenkins didn't check out Sunday as planned, the manager of the motel and his nephew went to check on him. When there was no answer, they entered the room and found Jenkins hanging by his belt from a coat rack. Cops say they believe Jenkins' death was  "an apparent suicide. " He was wearing a t-shirt and jeans. There was a laptop open on a desk inside the room.Jenkins had to be IDed through his fingerprints.Royal Canadian Mounted Police Sgt. Duncan Pound said last night,  "At this present time the investigation into the circumstances of his death is continuing, but preliminary evidence suggests that he took his own life. Any further details will not be released at this time as this investigation remains in its infancy. "Jenkins was wanted for the murder of his wife, swimsuit model Jasmine Fiore.
