Eric Clapton Sued Over Paying the Wrong Guy!/nEric Clapton made millions off his MTV  "Unplugged " album, but gave credit -- and royalties -- for one of the songs to the wrong blues artist ... according to a new lawsuit. The estate of Bo Carter -- a blues guy in the 1920s and '30s -- says Clapton incorrectly ID'd the song  "Alberta " as a tune from Lead Belly. In the lawsuit, it says Clapton's performance is really a famous rendition of Carter's original song  "Corrine, Corrina. "  Carter's lawyers say Bo wrote and owns the copyright to  "Corrine, Corrina " ... which over time, with many different people covering it ... became interchangeable with  "Alberta. "  Carter's camp points out Clapton's  "Unplugged " went on to sell millions of copies, and all those royalties mistakenly paid to Lead Belly's estate should have gone to Bo's. The estate is now suing Clapton -- not to mention a slew of media and music publishing companies -- for every penny they made off the song.  We've reached out to Clapton for comment ... so far, no word back./n
