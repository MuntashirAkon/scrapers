Ivanka Trump Is Surprised By The 'Viciousness' Of Trump-Haters â€” Did She Forget Who Her Father Is?/n

Can't we all just passively ignore the blinding red flags of Donald Trump's crooked presidency?
That's the country Ivanka Trump wishes her father was running â€” but instead, the first daughter was "blindsided" by haters on every coast and border!
In an interview with Fox and Friends on Monday, the 35-year-old admitted she was caught off guard by the "level of viciousness" in Trump opposers amid the Russia investigation.
