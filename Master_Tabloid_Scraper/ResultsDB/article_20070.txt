Celine Dion Just Taught Us The Art Of Pivoting A Conversation With The Help Of Rihanna's Diamonds!/n

Shine bright like a diamond, Celine Dion.
The legendary singer was trying to free, free fall her way right out of this extremely awkward interview with a journalist who tried asking her about her dating life.
As you recall, Dion's husband, René Angélil, passed away after a long battle with cancer in January of last year.

Anyway, when the reporter asked:
"How are things going? It's a whole new world for you. You're a single woman now."
Celine responded by breaking out into Rihanna's Diamonds and Tom Petty's Free Fallin' to avoid the personal interrogation. ICONIC!
Watch it all go down (below)!
