Ben McKenzie and Morena Baccarin are officially husband and wife.

The Gotham co-stars quietly wed Friday (June 2, 2017) at the Brooklyn Botanical Gardens in Brooklyn, New York. According to People, the couple held a small, intimate ceremony for family members and close friends to celebrate the union as well as Morena’s birthday.
Ben and Morena, both 38, welcomed a daughter named Frances in 2016. They confirmed their engagement eight months later.
As reported, Morena previously stated in her divorce papers from film producer Austin Chick that she had every intention to get married again. In legal documents filed by the actress in 2015, she wrote she was in a “committed relationship” with Ben and “am planning to re-marry.”
Morena is also the mother to a son named Julius from her previous marriage.
