OF COURSE Katy Perry Is Collaborating With Calvin Harris For His New Album!/n

So much shade, so little time.
On Tuesday, Calvin Harris announced his star-studded lineup of collaborations for his upcoming album, Funk Wav Bounces Vol. 1, which will be out for your listening pleasure on June 30.
So who are the "greatest artists of our generation" who offered services for the project? Well, the better question is who isn't the producer working with?

From Frank Ocean, Travis Scott, Kehlani, Future, Pharrell, Big Sean, John Legend, Khalid, Migos, Schoolboy Q, Ariana Grande, Young Thug, D.R.A.M., Nicki Minaj, Lil Yachty, Jessie Reyez, PARTYNEXTDOOR, and Snoop Dogg — we'd say Calvin is covering all of his bases!
But that's not all as the 33-year-old has also enlisted the help of his ex Taylor Swift's rumored arch nemesis, Katy Perry, to really take things to the next level! This song should be shady AF!
