One Direction may be on a hiatus, but that doesn’t mean Niall Horan isn’t keeping in touch with his bandmates.

The “Slow Hands” singer tells Billboard he’s still very close with the remaining members. Though Harry Styles is now a solo artist and Liam Payne and Louis Tomlinson have become fathers, Horan says he’ll always have a soft spot in his heart for the 1D boys.
“I see Louis and [his son] little Freddie all the time. He lives around the corner from me [in Los Angeles],” he shares, adding he’s also picked gifts for Payne’s newborn son with Cheryl Cole, though he hasn’t been able to present them yet due to conflicting schedules.

“I really enjoyed them,” Horan says of Styles’ new songs. “He’s smashin’ it.”
As for Zayn Malik, the man who made One Direction into a foursome with his 2015 departure, he has nothing but love for but the “Pillowtalk” crooner. In fact, despite Malik’s recent criticisms against his former group, Horan believes the former boy bander will reunite with them eventually.
“Oh, pfft. I know what Zayn’s like — outspoken, and fair play to him,” the 23-year-old quips. “When it will be, I don’t know. I ­prefer not to do it after I’m 40. I’d prefer the next few years.”
“We haven’t even had a ­conversation about how long we think the break will be,” he adds. “I told my ­managers from the start: When One Direction comes knocking, fook what I’m doing. I don’t give a shit if I sold out arenas or won Grammys. I wouldn’t be doing this if it wasn’t for that.”
