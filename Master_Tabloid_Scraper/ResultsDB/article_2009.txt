Listen To This: Everything Is Nothing Without You!/n

What do you get when you have an anthemic Rihanna-esque song and add some old school Nelly Furtado to it?
You get Canadian/Colombian singer Jessie Reyez's Great One!
This also has touches of Sia and is very different - fuller - from Jessie's breakout track, Figurez.
Was this produced by Jeff Bhasker? It's got his greatness all over it too!
Check it out above!
