MSNBC Host Embarrasses Congressman For Protecting Hillary Clinton/n
Trust, but verify! One congressman learned that lesson the hard way this week, when MSNBC host Andrea Mitchell caught him repeatedly making false statements about Hillary Clinton‘s email scandal on air.
On Andrea Mitchell Reports, the host brought on democratic congressman Adam Schiff to discuss the email use. The congressman was quick to defend Clinton, saying the report showed that “going back at least four secretaries of state each of them has either in full or in part used private email to conduct official business…”
But the MSNBC host corrected him, telling him Madeline Albright and Condoleezza Rice never used any email. Colin Powell used personal and state emails as did John Kerry. Hillary Clinton used her personal email address, as well as a personal server.

“She’s the only one who had a private server,” Mitchell said. “She’s the only one who did not cooperate with the investigators, and she’s the only one who was not out front about it.” The host went on to say of Powell that he only used private emails to “try to send a signal to the workforce to start using emails, to drag the State Department into the 21st century.”
But Schiff argued, “Powell was the first secretary of state to use personal email exclusively for official business. He didn’t provide any of those emails when he left office.”
Mitchell insisted that was not what the report said, however. “The facts are that when Secretary Kerry came into office, it was long before anybody knew about the private server. And he was transitioning from the senate and immediately archived those…[Clinton] is the only secretary of state who not only used a private server, but turned over nothing.”
