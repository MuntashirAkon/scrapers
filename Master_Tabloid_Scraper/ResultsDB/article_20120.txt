My Five Wives Heartbreak: Polygamist Family Struggles With Children Leaving The Home/n
Paulie Williams, one of the mothers in a plural marriage on the new reality show, My Five Wives, breaks down in tears in an emotional episode as she struggles with the fact that all of her children are leaving her at once.
In a sneak peek obtained by RadarOnline.com, the senior mother in Brady Williams‘s polygamist family has a heartbreaking conversation with her daughter Madeline, who tells her that she is moving out, going to college and won’t be around to hang out with her mom anymore.
“I have a lot of things I want to do,” the teenager reluctantly tells her mother. “I think it would be good for me to go out and be on my own.”

“It’s almost like they don’t need me. It really is just a mom thing, you worry about your kids,” Paulie tearfully admits.
