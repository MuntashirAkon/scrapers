  Not So Plus-Size Anymore! Super Skinny Crystal Renn Strips Down For Agent Provocateur.../n
It’s hard to believe that Crystal Renn once wore a size 16!
The super svelte 26-year-old, who battled anorexia in her younger years and became a successful plus-sized model and eating disorder activist before returning to sample sizes once again, stripped down into sexy lingerie for the latest Agent Provocateur campaign – and RadarOnline.com has the photos.

Wearing ultra racy bra and panty sets complete with thigh-high stockings and garter belts, the brunette bombshell, who was featured in the 2012 Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition, steamed up the luxurious lingerie company’s Spring/Summer 2013 campaign with her incredibly hot body.
As RadarOnline.com previously reported, Renn, who even penned a book about her eating disorder called Hungry: A Young Model’s Story of Appetite, Ambition and the Ultimate Embrace of Curves, has lost a lot of weight over the past few years, which hasn’t gone over well in the plus size community.

“Everyone rallied around her and now she’s turned against us,” PLUS Model Magazine Editor-in-Chief Madeline Jones told Radar in an exclusive interview. “We have been betrayed by her.”
