Model with Down Syndrome Madeline Stuart Stars in New Romantic Wedding Photoshoot/n
Madeline Stuart is revolutionizing the modeling world one runway and photoshoot at a time. She headlines a beauty brand, is a fitness model and runway regular. Now the 19-year-old Australian model with Down Syndrome is transforming the bridal business with a new (gorgeous and romantic!) photoshoot.

The shoot was organized by Isadora Martin-Dye and her husband Ben Rinder, the owners of Rixey Manor, a wedding venue in Virginia, in an effort to diversify the wedding-planning industry. “A lot of newly engaged women cannot see themselves as a bride because all the images magazines use are of these tall, thin models,” Martin-Dye said in a statement. “I think that being a bride is a life experience that every women should be able to see herself doing — and definitely not stressing about the fact that they wont look ‘perfect’ on their wedding day.”

So the duo tapped Stuart to star alongside male model Quaid Coxsey in a shoot located on the grounds of the manor photographed by Sarah Houston. (And to kill any speculation that the two were really an item, Stuart joked on Instagram that it was “just a photo shoot guys lol 😎😎😎“).

She modeled two elegant, traditional wedding gowns (provided by Ava Laurenne Bride) one, a tiered princess ballgown with beaded bodice and a second romantic all-over lace number, paired with Somersall jewels.

Houston described the shoot as “magical” saying Stuart was “so sweet and full of love, laughter and pure joy” on set.
Stuart had a whirlwind 2015, walking New York Fashion Week, teaming with the fitness brand Manifesta and becoming the first with Down Syndrome to land a beauty brand contact — hers is with Glossigirl. And she predicted last December that 2016 would be her best year yet, “I think we’re going to have an amazing year to come,” Stuart said.

This year, that will include working New York, Milan and Tokyo fashion weeks, launching her own clothing line, and organizing a charity fashion show.
