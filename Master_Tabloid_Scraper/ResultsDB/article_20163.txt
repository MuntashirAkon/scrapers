Madeline Kahn Battling Cancer/n
Veteran funnywoman Madeline Kahn, known for her scene-chewing, guffaw-inducing antics in Mel Brooks' Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein, announced today that she is undergoing "aggressive treatment" for ovarian cancer.      The 57-year-old actress has been battling the disease for the past year, shuttling in and out of hospitals and receiving chemotherapy. She is currently at home being cared for by husband John Hansbury, according to gossip maven Liz Smith, who first reported Kahn's illness.      The actress released a brief statement saying, "It is my hope that I might raise awareness of this awful disease and hasten the day that an effective test can be discovered to give women a fighting chance to catch this cancer in its earliest stage."      A gifted actress adept at both slapstick and high drama, Kahn initially made a splash as Ryan O'Neal's fianc√©e in 1972's What's Up, Doc?--a role that earned her the first of four Golden Globe nominations. She's twice received Oscar nods, for her turn as exotic dancer Trixie Delight in Paper Moon and as German vixen Lili Von Shtupp in Brooks' Blazing Saddles. She also teamed memorably with Brooks in Young Frankenstein, High Anxiety and History of the World: Part I. More recently she appeared in Oliver Stone's Nixon and as Gypsy the moth in last year's A Bug's Life.      Kahn is also a Broadway vet, winning a Tony for The Sisters Rosensweig. More recently, she was a fixture on Cosby until she took ill. In her statement, she thanks her "entire extended family on Cosby who moved heaven and earth to make me as comfortable as possible."      Says Hansbury in Smith's column: "Madeline is in good humor, hoping to continue to work."
