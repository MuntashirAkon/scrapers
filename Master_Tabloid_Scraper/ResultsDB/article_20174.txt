'Californication' Star Madeline Zima -- Smashes Car on Sunset Blvd./n "Californication " star Madeline Zima smashed her car into another vehicle on Sunset Blvd. Saturday night. Madeline rear-ended another car in West Hollywood.  It was bad enough that Zima's car had to be towed. No injuries to speak of.Madeline's friends consoled her -- she was clearly shaken up. Our photog asked her what happened ... but the 28-year old wasn't in the mood to talk.  Maybe that was wise ... right to remain silent and all that.USEFUL TIDBIT:  If you rear-end another car, you're pretty much screwed.  No defense./n
