Melissa McCarthy's Weight Loss Wonder/n
Anyone who’s followed Melissa McCarthy recently knows this: There’s a lot less of her to see! Over the past couple years, the Ghostbusters star has dropped a whopping 75 pounds. And what’s amazing about her accomplishment is that she’s done it so casually—without that desperate post-a-workout-selfie drudgery that so many celebrities to fall prey to.
Part of that attitude has to do with her healthy body image: “I feel sexiest when I feel comfortable, when I feel most myself, when I’m not trying to be anything other than who I am,” she has said. “[I love] all of it: my flaws, my shortcomings, my body parts that you’re like, ‘Well, couldn’t that be better?’ I think, especially after have kids, I go, ‘Well, the alternative is pretty bad. I’ll take me as I am.’”
So how did Melissa manage a healthy trim-down? “I stopped over analyzing, overthinking,” she’s explained. “I stopped being constantly worried about it. Loosening up, bizarrely, has worked.”
Not that Melissa hasn’t made physical changes as well. A higher protein diet, along with regular walks with her daughters Vivian, 9, and Georgette, 6, has helped, as well as a newfound commitment to Pilates workouts. And of course, bustin’ ghosts also makes her look and feel good!
