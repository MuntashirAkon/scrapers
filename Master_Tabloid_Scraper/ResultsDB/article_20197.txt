 Kiss & Tell! Tara Reid Dishes On Hooking Up With Tom Brady, Before He Upgraded To.../n
It’s safe to say he upgraded.
New England Patriots star quarterback Tom Brady has been married to supermodel Gisele Bündchen for nearly five years, but an old fling has crept back up — and she’s kissing and telling!
During an interview on Wednesday with Australia’s 2Day FM Kyle and Jackie O Show, actress Tara Reid played a game where the hosts would rattle off famous Hollywood playboy’s and the Sharknado star would reveal whether or not she’d ever kissed them.
“I have kissed,” Reid admitted when asked about Brady, 36. “Yeah he’s pretty good looking.”

In fact, Reid, 38, reportedly dated the now three-time Super Bowl winner for a month in 2002, when his NFL career was still fresh.
Of course Brady went on to marry Bündchen, 33, in 2009 and the gorgeous couple have two children together; Benjamin Rein Bundchen Brady and Vivian Lake Bundchen Brady.
