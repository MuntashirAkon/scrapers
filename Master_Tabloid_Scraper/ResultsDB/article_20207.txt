According to The Sun, the actor reportedly contacted the venue and asked for Viviana's number so that he could call her and apologize for getting her sacked.
A source said: 
"Orlando got her number from the Chiltern Firehouse in London and called to make sure that Viviana was okay. The call will have come out of the blue – he is a gentleman and he genuinely had no idea what had happened after he left he Chiltern Firehouse. He just said, ‘I am sorry about what happened.'"
How proper! How sweet! What a guy!
As we previously reported, Viviana is said to have no regrets about the night and toe-curling sex. We're sure she'll find another waitressing job soon. And who knows, maybe all this publicity will even get her an acting gig!
Good luck out there, Viv!
