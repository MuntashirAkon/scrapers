Last night (Sept. 21, 2016) marked the first time in two years that Gisele Bündchen and Tom Brady made a red carpet appearance together, and they celebrated with lots of PDA.

The couple stepped out to celebrate the season two premiere of the National Geographic series Years of Living Dangerously along with Arnold Schwarzenegger, American Ferrera, Joshua Jackson, Nikki Reed, Ian Somerhalder, and much more and looked more in love than ever as they gazed into each other’s eyes.

Brady and Bündchen held hands as they walked down the red carpet, pausing to pose for pictures together and laugh at private jokes. The model took to Instagram before the premiere to share a picture of herself and her husband looking absolutely giddy before heading out for the night.

While last night’s public appearance was a rare one, the couple seems stronger than ever. Brady couldn’t help but gush about his wife of seven years to Entertainment Tonight, “She’s my best friend. We spend as much time as we can together, and you know, it’s a busy life we have and we have three kids.”
