When he’s not winning Super Bowls as the New England Patriots’ quarterback, Tom Brady is hanging with his family.
Speaking with Entertainment Tonight at his new “Do Nothing” campaign for UGG, Brady spoke about how his life revolves around his wife, supermodel Gisele Bündchen, and raising their two children – Benjamin, 6, and Vivian, 3 — as well as 9-year-old John, whose mother is actress Bridget Moynahan.
Brady said, “Well, [off time] is usually focused around the kids, you know, you spend so much time with them and trying to be a parent — which is such an important part of our lives — so, whatever they’re into, that’s kind of what you do. You try to support them and the things that they’re doing, and encourage them in different ways.”

He also gushed about his special relationship with Bündchen, who celebrated their seventh wedding anniversary in February. “She’s my best friend. We spend as much time as we can together, and you know, it’s a busy life we have and we have three kids.”
The one though that’s really got him wrapped is daughter Vivian. “It’s the worst, well, it’s not the worst for me, I think it’s the worst for my wife who’s trying to instill some discipline in her and I just give her whatever she wants. But isn’t that what men are supposed to do for daughters?”
