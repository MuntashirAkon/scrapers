The couple are also parents to son Eric Thomas II, 18 months. Of being a family of four, Eric previously told PEOPLE, “It’s great because they’re starting to play together.”
“Eric is getting to an age where he can move around and hold his own with Vivi, so that’s been a fun transition to see from him being a baby to more of a toddler and on the ground playing,” said Eric, adding, “It definitely makes it feel like the house is complete when you have two little ones running around and playing.”
