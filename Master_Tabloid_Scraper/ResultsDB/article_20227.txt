PHOTO: Gisele Bündchen Practices Yoga with Her 'Little Partner'/n
Practice makes perfect – and anything involving Gisele Bündchen’s little girl, Vivian, 7 months, is definitely perfection!  
The Brazilian model, 32, shared a sweet photo Wednesday of herself striking a yoga pose with her littlest charge in tow.
“Practicing yoga with my little partner before going to work . Enjoy your day!” she wrote with the Instagram shot, which has Vivian sitting next to her mother on the floor with a couple of pillows beside her so she doesn’t topple over.  
The makeshift yoga studio was decidedly feminine, with a bowl of fruit and a beautiful orchid sitting on a table nearby – and noticeably devoid of boys! Gisele’s New England Patriot husband Tom Brady and their 3-year-old son Benjamin must have hit the field for some football instead.
