Vivian Campbell, Def Leppard Guitarist, Undergoing Cancer Treatment/n
Def Leppard guitarist Vivian Campbell says he is being treated for cancer.  
In a statement Monday, the 50-year-old says he has Hodgkin lymphoma and has been in chemotherapy for two months, with four months of treatment remaining.  
Says Campbell: “I feel fortunate that my cancer sent me an alarm call in the form of ‘the cough that wouldn’t quit.’ ”  
Campbell says he still plans to hit the road this summer with Def Leppard. The first show is at the Hellfest music festival in France on June 21. The tour wraps up July 17 in Canandaigua, N.Y.  
Campbell also played in the bands Dio and Thin Lizzy.
