Gisele Bündchen Takes Baby Vivian for a Stroll/n
It seems like only yesterday baby daughter Vivian was just a bump on the beauteous bod of her mother, Gisele Bündchen – because it was.  
But now the 32-year-old model mother and her 5-month-old daughter, in what appeared to be long-sleeved matching white tops (Duchess of Cambridge, are you watching?), are out and about in New York, just as the city is finally warming up to spring. Mom is cradling Vivian, who looks to be serenely enjoying the pacifier in her mouth.  
As for the boys in the family, Gisele’s handsome New England Patriot husband Tom Brady and their 3-year-old son Benjamin, they weren’t in this picture.  
Bündchen and Brady did, however, enjoy a glam evening out at the recent punk-themed Met Gala in New York.
