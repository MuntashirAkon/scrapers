Def Leppard Guitarist Vivian Campbell Slams Donald Trump as a "Clown" Although Donald Trump might not have the long flowing hair required to be a rock star, he is set to share the stage with and introduce '80s hair metal band .../n
Although Donald Trump might not have the long flowing hair required to be a rock star, he is set to share the stage with and introduce '80s hair metal band Def Leppard on Aug. 15 at the Iowa State Fair. But not if guitar player Vivian Campbell has anything to say about it!The axe-shredder isn't pouring any sugar on a brutally honest Facebook post directed at the presidential hopeful, "I really, really, really hope that there's no truth to this rumour. Def Leppard have never been a political band, and if we were, I for one wouldn't be associating my name with this clown."
