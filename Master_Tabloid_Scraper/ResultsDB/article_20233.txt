Gisele BÃ¼ndchen Defends Riding ATV With Baby Vivian and No Helmets/n
But Gisele knows what works best for her when it comes to taking care of Vivian, Benjamin and sometimes 6-year-old stepson Jack (whose mother is Tom's ex, Bridget Moynahan).And because she's confident in her mommy skills, she wasn't too upset by what any other mothers might have had to say about her and Viv's ride. She Instagrammed a shot from her H&M upcoming campaign Tuesday, Jan. 14, of herself gleefully jumping on the beach, appearing to be having a great time mixing parenting and photo shoots in paradise!
