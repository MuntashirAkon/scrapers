Vivian Campbell is assuring fans that there's no need for Hysteria.The Def Leppard guitarist revealed today that he is two months into a course of chemotherapy to treat Hodgkin's lymphoma; he says he has four months of treatment left and is "feeling rather spiffy, all things considered.""I feel fortunate that my cancer sent me an alarm call in the form of 'the cough that wouldn't quit,'" Campbell said in a statement posted on Def Leppard's website. "Otherwise, how would I have known?"

He continued: "After several months of trying every inhaler known to man, my doctor finally had me X-rayed. A further CAT scan revealed that enlarged lymph nodes were doing wrestling manoeuvres on my windpipe—hence the cough. What was causing the enlarged lymph nodes, however, was yet to be determined, so I underwent a surgical biopsy on March 11th, the first day of Leppard rehearsals for our Viva Las Vegas shows. Obviously, I didn't make it to rehearsal that day, but it's okay; I know the songs by now." 

"Hodgkin's has an over 80% cure rate, so by my reckoning, if you're going to have a cancer, Hodgie's is the one to have!" Campbell wrote. "The reason I'm sharing this with you is because, despite cancer and chemo, me and my new aerodynamic hairstyle (read: no hair) are going on tour this summer with the band and I don't want anyone to be so shocked by my new look that they ask for a refund. Simple economics, really."

"Thank you for all the kind words for Vivian. Join us in sending him our best well wishes for a speedy recovery," Def Leppard tweeted today.And the 50-year-old Northen Irish rocker isn't willing to miss a beat."My family, friends and bandmates have all been extremely supportive through this and I look forward to a summer full of shows with both Def Leppard in June/July and the debut of Last In Line this August," Campbell concluded.Last in Line is the reunion of the guitarist with some former bandmates from Dio, the band fronted by the late Ronnie James Dio, which is hitting the road under the name of their 1984 album, The Last in Line.
