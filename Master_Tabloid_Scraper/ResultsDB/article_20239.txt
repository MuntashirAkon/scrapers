Forget supermodel. Gisele Bündchen looks like a supermom.The Brazilian beauty struck the most cuddly and loving maternal pose ever with her 1-year-old daughter, Vivian, in a picture she posted recently to her Instagram account."The best love in the world! ❤ O melhor amor do mundo!" she tweeted in both English and her native Portuguese.Vivian, of course, is Bündchen's second child with NFL superstar husband Tom Brady who arrived last December to great fanfare. She joined big brothers Benjamin and John (Tom's son with ex Bridget Moynahan) in the couple's ever-expanding brood, and by the looks of this adorable photo, she's certainly got mama's full attention.

Gisele and Tom have been enjoying parenthood to the hilt lately. The duo were spotted last week taking the kids to Disneyland, including making a pit stop at Cars Land to hang with Red the Fire Truck while the 32-year-old Bündchen also posed for a pic with Princess Sofia, the star of Disney Junior's popular animated series Sofia the First.Since giving birth to Vivian, the erstwhile Victoria's Secret Angel meanwhile has quickly shed the baby weight and looks as gorgeous as ever thanks to an intense workout routine that includes kung fu training and regular yoga practice.Getting her body back into flawless model form was also a priority since she signed a deal in February with Chanel to be the face of its new makeup line, Les Beiges. The collection's advertisements, which were photographed by Mario Testino, debuted in March.As for Brady, no doubt he's enjoying the family time before he gets back to the grid iron after agreeing to a three-year contract extension with the New England Patriots.
