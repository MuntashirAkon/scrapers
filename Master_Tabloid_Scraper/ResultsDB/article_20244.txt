Sailor Brinkley Cook Reveals Shocking Details About Mom Christie's Nasty Divorce/n
Christie Brinkley’s nasty divorce from her fourth husband, Peter Cook, was so traumatic that her young daughter admitted she was forced to counseling over her parents’ dreadful split.
Sailor Brinkley Cook’s father was caught having sexwith his 18-year-old assistant, and the supermodel promptly dumped him in 2006.
They ended up going through one of Hollywood’s most hideous breakups, with the architect accusing Brinkley, 63, of “gross exaggerations, revisionist history and self-serving dishonesty ,” in an email to Radar in 2014.
Sailor, now following in her famous mom’s modeling footsteps, confessed how the ugly split, where her mom called her dad a “narcissist,” ended with her in counseling.

“My parents had just gotten divorced and I was so confused about everything,” Brinkley Cook, 19, wrote on an Instagram post where she was wishing her best friend a happy birthday.
“There was this little after-school counseling session for kids with divorced parents that the school put me in called “banana splits”. Basically all we did was make banana splits and talk about how we have 2 christmas’ and how that was a plus lol (sic).”
During the horrendous divorce, Brinkley said her “50s weren’t easy,” because she “went through a miserable divorce while trying to be a pillar for my kids.”
In second grade at the time of her parents’ brutal divorce, Brinkley Cook wrote about her friend helping her out in the sad situation.

Okay, story time: I met emma scott when we were in 2nd grade, we were both new to school and didn’t know anyone. My parents had just gotten divorced and i was so confused about everything. There was this little after-school counseling session for kids with divorced parents that the school put me in called “banana splits”. Basically all we did was make banana splits and talk about how we have 2 christmas’ and how that was a plus lol. I remember throwing a temper tantrum during a session one day and i remember a very shy and very small girl i had never seen before (whos parents also put her in banana splits) calming me down and telling me about her parents and how its all gonna be okay. That was the start of a lifetime of friendship. I immediately became co-dependent haha. Everything i did was with emma scott from playing dress up every day after school, to being on the same sport teams even if i didnt have the skills you did, to first high school parties and boys and emotions, all the way to graduation. We were literally stuck to the hip for 10 years. (Literally. When we weren’t put in the same class we would protest at the principles office lol) Now we’re heading into our 20’s and although we have figured out how to live our lives independently… You will always be my rock and I will always be yours. Thank you for giving me the best childhood ever. I’m so excited to be there to watch your exciting life grow for another 10+ years ♥️😭👯 HAPPY BIRTHDAY scotty!!!!!!!! I love you so much and I always will!!!!
