What better way to celebrate a friendship than with a tattoo?

Drake made his bromance with Lil Wayne permanent by getting the rapper’s face inked on his bicep. Drizzy debuted the Wheezy design when he stepped out for the Houston Appreciation Weekend.
Via Revolt TV:
Over the weekend, Drake made that notion clear with the reveal of his latest portrait tattoo: Lil Wayne.
Adding Lil Wayne to his collection of body art, Drizzy’s latest tat now joins inked-out portraits of Aaliyah, Sade, and his parents.
