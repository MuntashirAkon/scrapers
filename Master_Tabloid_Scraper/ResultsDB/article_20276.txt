The names of Beyoncé and Jay-Z’s newborn twins have been revealed.

According to TMZ, the powerhouse couple named the pair Rumi and Sir Carter. The unique moniker were discovered when Bey and Jay’s company filed documents on Monday (June 26, 2016) to trademark the names.
The organization responsible for the filing was the same one that sought out to copyright Blue Ivy’s name earlier this year.
As previously reported, Beyoncé gave birth June 12 and suffered a “minor issue” in their delivery.
The babies — who were premature at birth — remained in the hospital under supervision until this week. They were since relocated to a $40,000-a-month estate in Malibu, where the parents-of-three are currently staying as they continue to find a more permanent home in Los Angeles.
Beyoncé and Jay-Z have yet to confirm the sexes of the babies, though many reports claim the twins are a boy and a girl.
