Beyoncé and Jay-Z’s newborn twins are already living a life of luxury.

The two are reportedly home with their parents after an extended stay at the hospital following their premature births. According to reports, the twins are currently staying inside a lavish mansion in Malibu as Bey and Jay continue to find a more permanent home on the west coast.
Via TMZ:
The boy and girl now join Blue Ivy and their parents at a spectacular $400,000-a-month Malibu rental … as the Daily Mail first reported. It sits on 6.3 acres with jetliner views of the Pacific.
We’re told they will be spending the summer at the estate, and they’re still looking for a permanent L.A. home.
