Train Like an American Ninja Warrior Competitor with This Workout Challenge Created by Jessie Graff
/n
American Ninja Warrior star and stuntwoman Jessie Graff will compete along with the rest of USA’s Dream Team as they take on some of the world’s best ninjas on Sunday night’s “USA vs. The World” special on NBC, and getting to her level of fitness came with a lot of hard work.
Want to train like a Warrior? Graff is breaking down the best moves you can do at the gym to prepare to take on the show’s super-challenging obstacle courses.
“Every Ninja Warrior course is different, and adapting to obstacles you’ve never seen or touched before may be the hardest part,” Graff, 33, tells PEOPLE. “Here’s a simple test of strength to see if you’re strong enough to complete a City Finals Course (or to figure out how far you could get). While none of these exercises prepare you for any specific obstacle, doing them all together in this format gives a rough idea if you have the pull up strength and grip endurance to complete City Finals. If you can maintain strict form and complete the routine, you definitely have the strength to get through!”
You may take up to 30 seconds of rest between each move:
10 Speed Skaters
