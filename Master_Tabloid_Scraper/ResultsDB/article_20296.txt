 'My Life Was Being Threatened': Woman Who Accused Phaedra Parks Of Running Fraud.../n
Wig pulling and cat fights are the order of the day on Real Housewives of Atlanta, but off-screen, life can be much more dangerous for Georgia peaches. Phaedra Parks‘ former friend Angela Stanton claims that after she wrote a book accusing the RHOA star of running a fraud ring, not only was she slammed with a defamation lawsuit from Parks, but also, she received anonymous death threats!
When Parks filed the lawsuit, Stanton said in a deposition transcript obtained by Radar, “I was receiving death threats. [Apollo Nida’s co-conspirator in his alleged fraud scheme], Everett Tripodis had called my home personally.”
“I have no idea how he found out where I live at,” she said. “I was afraid.”

Stanton continued, “I knew this case was serious. I knew that a lot of stuff was getting ready to come to light, and I felt as if my life was being threatened. Even now I still feel the same way, and was just talking to my attorney about why Ms. Parks had to have my personal address [to serve the lawsuit]. I still feel that something may happen.”
It is not known whether Stanton ever called police about the threats or if there is any evidence to suggest who made them.
Parks has dismissed Stanton’s previous claims as libelous and is currently suing her for defamation.
