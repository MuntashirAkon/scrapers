While in town, Aniston, 42, and Theroux, 39, helped Ben Stiller celebrate his wife Christine Taylor‘s 40th birthday. (They will have deja vu by next week, as Justin turns 40 on Wednesday.)
“They are acting like regular tourists,” a source told People. “They have been touring the island in a rented Jeep … Justin is beyond sweet and attentive to her. They have been jogging by their villa and they are both in great shape.”
