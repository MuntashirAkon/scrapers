After spending two years refurbishing the entire property down to the finest detail and then putting it on the market and getting an astounding $36 million for it, the Horrible Bosses actress threw a lavish bash for friends and family at the impressive hillside mansion on the last weekend before she turned the keys over to the new owner.
