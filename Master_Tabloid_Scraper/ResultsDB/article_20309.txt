Speaking to MailOnline about the role in which she plays a sex-starved dentist, Jennifer said: “It was a ball, I had a blast. I got total freedom. I got to be a crazy buffoon.”
When asked if she ever found any of the film’s raunchy sex scenes uncomfortable, Jen responded: “Not with those guys.”

Speaking of the ‘guys,’ Aniston was joined at the premiere by her ‘Horrible’ co-stars Jason Bateman, Charlie Day, and Jason Sudeikis, as well as the film’s director, Seth Gordon.
Jen was later seen leaving an after-party in an equally elegant black cocktail dress with new beau, actor/screenwriter Justin Theroux; it was the first time we’ve seen the couple showing affection in public.
