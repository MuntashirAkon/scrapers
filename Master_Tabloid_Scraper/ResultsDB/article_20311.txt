Glenn Close To Sing National Anthem At Mets game /n
Legendary actress Glenn Close is set to belt out the National Anthem at the New York Mets baseball game Saturday and she’s bringing the entire cast and crew of her legal drama Damages with her, RadarOnline.com has learned.
The 64-year-old diva will step on the Citi Field diamond Saturday to give her rendition of the Star Spangled Banner in front of more than 40,000 fans before the Mets play the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim.

Close has previously said she was terrified when she was dared to sing the song twenty years ago and that it’s a difficult song to sing – especially if you forget the words.
But that was years ago and we’re sure Close will nail the song this time around!
Close’s performance will help to raise money for her mental health charity, Bring Change 2 Mind and she invited her co-stars along for support.

Shooting on the fourth season of Damages, which also stars Rose Byrne, Ted Danson and John Goodman, just wrapped filming and will premiere in July.
Close, of course, is no stranger to singing.  In 1995, she won a Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical for playing Norma Desmond in Sunset Boulevard, and in 1980, she was nominated for Best Featured Actress in a Musical for Barnum.
