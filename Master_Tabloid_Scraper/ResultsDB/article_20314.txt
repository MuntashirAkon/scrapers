Along with Saturday Night Live vets Vanessa Bayer and Aidy Bryant, the funny ladies entertained the crowd to raise funds for Safe BAE, a nonprofit that works to prevent sexual assault through education. 
Amy posted the pic of the exclusive event (above) to her Instagram, writing: 




Last night we raised money for @safe_bae and had a blast. Thank you @vanessabayer @aidybryant @miacomedy @juddapatow @chrisrock @rachelfeinstein_ @bridgeteverett and Jennifer Lawrence who even with the stomach flu put me right on blastA post shared by @amyschumer on Jul 20, 2017 at 6:48am PDT

Luckily, the crew had plenty of comedic backup as Chris Rock and Judd Apatow were also at the event.
We wonder if Jen would ever try her hand at standup for real… She does have some experience speaking in front of a crowd. Granted, she had an Oscar in her hand most of those times…
