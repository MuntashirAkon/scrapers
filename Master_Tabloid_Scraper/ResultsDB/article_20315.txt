Leonardo DiCaprio Has Strong Words For Donald Trump And His 'Careless Decision'!/n

Remember when Leonardo DiCaprio was willing to meet with President-elect Donald Trump to discuss clean energy and green jobs?
Yeah, those days are over.
Hour for hour, the Celebrity Apprentice star has been the worst POTUS we've ever had for the environment, culminating in his decision to withdraw the United States from the 195-country Paris Climate Accord.

We're guessing Leo won't be invited to any more closed door meetings as he had some understandably harsh words for Trump, accompanying a photo of the White House:

"Today, the future livability of our planet was threatened by President Trump's careless decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement."

Today, the future livability of our planet was threatened by President Trump's careless decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement. Our future on this planet is now more at risk than ever before. For Americans and those in the world community looking for strong leadership on climate issues, this action is deeply discouraging. Now, more than ever, we must be determined to solve climate change, and to challenge those leaders who do not believe in scientific facts or empirical truths. It is time for all of us to stand up, organize, fight back, and channel our energy into grassroots political action.
