After a few weeks of vocal rest, Beyoncé resumed her Formation World Tour on Saturday night (Sept. 10, 2016) in St. Louis.

While every single Beyoncé concert is a magical experience, St. Louis’ concert goers were in for a particularly sweet treat. About half way through the concert, just as Beyoncé and her dancers were performing the iconic “Single Ladies” dance, Bey halted the entire show telling the audience there was a special guest she wanted to bring out on stage.

Out walked John Silver, the longtime boyfriend of Beyoncé’s dance captain Ashley Everette, who proceeded to give a heartfelt speech, get down on one knee, pull out a ring and pull off the proposal of a lifetime, all in front of a few thousand people.

Silver and Everette weren’t able to celebrate their engagement for too long, because as they say, the show must go on.
