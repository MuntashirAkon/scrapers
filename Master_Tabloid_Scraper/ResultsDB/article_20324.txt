The most dramatic season finale ever. 
Inside Amy Schumer ended season 4 with Amy Schumer going full Real Housewives with Andy Cohen. The two spoofed the Bravo show with a reunion special that included self-tanner, some eye rolling, and a whole lot of drama. The comedian was even joined by sister Kim Caramele, Bridget Everett from Trainwreck, and Greta Lee from Girls.

The drama starts when the host reads a fan’s question about why Schumer uses the P-word so much. “On my life, never, never have I ever said that word,” she responds. “On my life, on my children’s lives, on my children’s children’s lives, never have I said that word. That’s family, and you don’t do that to family.” Cohen later airs a minute-long montage of proof.
