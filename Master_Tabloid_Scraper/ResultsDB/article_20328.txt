The most epic girls night ever. 
Sixteen years after the film’s release and these ladies have not aged a bit. Reese Witherspoon caught up with her Cruel Intentions co-stars Sarah Michelle Gellar and Selma Blair on Thursday night (May 28, 2015) for a night of good fun and some girl-on-girl kissing.
The happy trio attended a showing of The Unauthorized Musical Parody Of Cruel Intentions together at Rockwell: Table & Stage in Los Angeles, Calif, where things got crazy. One fan caught Blair and Gellar recreating their movie kiss at the event.

That totally brings us back. The gals also spent the night posting pictures on Instagram. “Best girls night of the year!!! #cruelintentions,” Witherspoon captioned one photo of her and her two co-stars smiling outside the Rockwell Table and Stage.

“#cruelintentionsthemusical @reesewitherspoon @sarahmgellar together again,” 42-year-old Blair wrote as she shared another snap, taken inside, of the trio hugging one another, and smiling happily. Only one missing to complete this photo is Ryan Phillippe.
