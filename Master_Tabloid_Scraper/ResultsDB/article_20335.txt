Hit Rock Bottom with Rising Comedy Star Bridget Everett/n
Maybe you’ve seen her on Comedy Central’s Inside Amy Schumer. Or maybe you remember her as a drunk party girl in the Sex and the City movie. Either way, after you see comedian/chanteuse/cabaret queen Bridget Everett, you’re not likely to ever forget her.  
Everett currently stars in the one-woman show Rock Bottom, co-written by Adam Horovitz (Ad-Rock of the Beastie Boys), Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman (Hairspray) and pianist Matt Ray, at the legendary Joe’s Pub in New York City. Everett’s bawdy performance is about 90 percent hilariously raunchy, sexual songs and drunk-ish banter – and perhaps even more shockingly – 10 percent beautiful tearjerker power ballads. The New York Times recently featured one of those tunes (probably the only one we can show you):  
Some have compared her to Melissa McCarthy and Bette Midler, and they’re not wrong. But that doesn’t even come close to describing the outrageous presence and force of nature that is Everett. Check her out on YouTube (Alert: NSFW!) for a greater sense of this singularly obscene talent. Ferociously funny with an unbridled enthusiasm for debauchery, Everett wouldn’t surprise us if she gets her own HBO special in the near future.   
Did you hear that, HBO? Get this woman a special – and another bottle of chardonnay – STAT!  
Everett’s Rock Bottom show runs through Oct. 11 at Joe’s Pub in N.Y.C. Follow her on Twitter to find out what’s next.
