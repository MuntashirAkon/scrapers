Neil Everett Marries Stephanie Krohn in Oregon/n
One ESPN anchor has a new top play: His wedding.  
Neil Everett, the SportsCenter funnyman, married longtime girlfriend Stephanie Krohn in Oregon on Thursday.  
“They did their ‘I dos’ on the beach in beach attire,” a source tells PEOPLE.  
The couple held a reception on Saturday at an art gallery to follow the intimate nuptials from earlier in the week. 
Honoring his Hawaiian ties – Everett lived there for many years and often begins his broadcasts by saying “Howzit,” Hawaiian slang term meaning, “How is it going?” – Everett donned a white flowing shirt and lei.  
The couple – who both attended school at University of Oregon – reportedly met five years ago at a fundraiser at the Tiger Woods Center while Everett hosted an event that Krohn worked.
