Saved's Tom Everett Scott/n
▪ NOW PLAYING
Wyatt Cole, a paramedic with a gambling problem on TNT’s Saved, premiering June 12.
▪ SEX, STAT!
In the pilot, Scott and Elizabeth Reaser (who plays Cole’s ex-girlfriend) steam up an ambulance. “This is the hottest love scene I’ve ever done,” says Scott, 35. So hot that it almost makes him forget the one in 1997’s An American Werewolf in Paris? Says Scott: “I had sex on Jim Morrison’s grave as I transformed into a werewolf. How did I read that and say, ‘This is the part for me’?”
▪ HANKS FOR THE ADVICE
Scott’s acting idol? Tom Hanks. “I watched Bosom Buddies religiously,” says Scott. “I memorized Splash. I wanted to be him.” Perhaps Hanks picked up on that when Scott costarred in his 1996 feature film directorial debut, That Thing You Do! Hanks helped him learn to keep it simple on-set. “He saw me getting pressured,” says Scott. “He told me less is more. He basically said don’t sweat it.”
▪ GUILT TRIP
One major downside to his new gig has been leaving his wife, Jenni, 35, daughter Arly, 6, and son Finn, 20 months, at home in Sherman Oaks, Calif., while Saved shoots in Vancouver. Though they’ll join him once school’s out, admits Scott, “I’m not crazy about it. [My wife] is Supermom now with two kids by herself. My shrink says I’m supposed to tolerate my feelings of guilt.”
▪ CARD SHARK
While Scott doesn’t share his character’s gambling addiction, he is definitely into poker. “That was convenient,” says Scott. And turns out he’s no joker at the game either—he placed third in the 2005 WPT Invitational on the World Poker Tour.
