Madonna, Everett to Do "Best Thing"/n
Snapping up yet another film role after her lengthy maternity leave from Hollywood, Madonna--along with pal Rupert Everett--will star in the romantic comedy The Next Best Thing.          Madonna's gonna have to stretch for this part. She'll play a thirtysomething single mom who convinces her best friend (Everett) to father her child.          Wacky hijinks ensue as Madonna's character falls in love with another man. (No word yet as to whether Everett's role will be that of the "gay best friend"--the same one that launched his career in My Best Friend's Wedding.)          Written by Tom Ropelewski (Look Who's Talking), the Best Thing will begin shooting later this year. No director has been announced for the picture. The film will be produced and distributed internationally by Lakeshore Entertainment, with Paramount handling North American distribution.          Madonna, who's often-maligned film work has included Evita, Desperately Seeking Susan and the should-be-filed-in-Lourdes'-diapers Body of Evidence, is already scheduled to start production on the indie The Red Door this summer.
