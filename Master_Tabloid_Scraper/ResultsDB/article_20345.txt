 Hey, Isaiah Washington, next time you wanna spew some antigay rhetoric, call Rupert Everett. The openly gay actor says he doesn't mind derogatory names thrown his way. "I like being called faggot, queer. Everyone's got phobias, even gays for straights," he told Planet Gossip's Matt Donnelly during a reading of Everett's memoir, Red Carpets and Other Banana Skins, at West Hollywood's Book Soup bookstore.  How does Everett justify verbal gay bashing? "I'd rather be called a faggot by someone who felt it—then you know where they stand," he said. "It's so much better to say what you feel." GLAAD president Neil Giuliano doesn't buy it. "Most of the time it's used to degrade, hurt and humiliate people," Giuliano told me at the GLAAD Media Awards cocktail party at Sundance. "The bottom line is, it's not a good thing."
