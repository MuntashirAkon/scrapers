Everett Weston and Lindsay Hubbard are starting the season off a couple, but will they still be that way by the time summer turns to fall on Summer House? We're already worried.In this sneak peek at the premiere episode of Bravo's newest reality series, exclusive to E! News, a festive Fourth of July weekend spent among friends at their beach house in Montauk quickly sours for the lovebirds when Lindsay sees a text on Everett's phone from a female she's never heard of. Everett's defense? She's a new girl who works in his building simply looking for recommendations of places worth hitting up in the Long Island beach town. But Lindsay's not having any of it.

Summer House follows nine friends who spend their weeks working hard to make their money, but on the weekends between Memorial Day and Labor Day, they share a summer rental to let loose in a big way. Expect a season full of drama, boozy brunches, bonfires, and jaw-dropping beachfront hookupsâ€”AKA, your newest Bravo obsession.Summer House premieres Monday, Jan. 16 at 10 p.m. on Bravo.(E! and Bravo are both part of the NBCUniversal family.)
