Rosie to Oprah - C'mon, Fight!/nRosie O'Donnell is picking a fight with Oprah over the talk queen's controversial interview with kidnapped teen Shawn Hornbeck. Lots of people are outraged, and many are screaming exploitation. But will O v. Ro turn into another Trump-scale nuclear conflict?Sources tell TMZ that Oprah's M.O. is always the silent treatment, and that she's not going to get into a Trump-Rosie-style war with O'Donnell. For instance, sources say that Oprah can't stand Dr. Phil McGraw, who she thinks is utterly ungrateful to her. But rather than smack him down publicly, she's dissed privately by not showing up to significant events in his life.O's given the same treatment over the years to others who have displeased her, like David Letterman and Tom Cruise, publicly denying that there was any feud. That may still not stop Rosie, who's easily triggered when she thinks kids are exploited.

Pitt went along for the class, and now he no longer picks up strippers' clothes.  "Strippers changed my life, " admits Pitt.

" Even though Washington's being  "educated " by GLAAD and other groups on the dangers of name-calling, and will do public-service announcements, keeping things bottled up isn't necessarily the best thing, thinks Rupert.
