Paul Walker's Daughter: My Dad Would've Made $80 Million/nPaul Walker could have banked up to $80 million off his acting had his life not been cut short. Universal executives had already committed to 3 more 'Fast and Furious' films while Paul and company were filming the seventh installment ... this according to legal docs in the wrongful death case filed by Paul's 17-year-old daughter Meadow.    Meadow claims the additional movies -- plus other projects -- would have made his bank account swell by anywhere between $30 and $80 million. Paul's earning prospects was a big factor in the settlement Meadow struck with the estate of the driver, Roger Rodas. The estate -- most likely the insurance co. -- paid her $10.1 million. According to the docs ... Meadow and her mom got court permission to use $2 million from the settlement to buy a new house. /n
