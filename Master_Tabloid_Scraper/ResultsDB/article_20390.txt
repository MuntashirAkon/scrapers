Cate Replaces Sienna/n
Sienna Miller has been replaced by Cate Blanchett in Ridley Scott‘s upcoming Robin Hood flick Nottingham.
Blanchett is said to be playing love interest Maid Marian, opposite Russell Crowe as the notorious king of thieves, Robin of Locksley. No explanation has been given for the parting though, age-wise, the 39 year-old Cate might make a more plausible love interest for older-man Crowe than the 27 year-old Miller.
Still, kinda gives ‘middle ages’ a new meaning, huh? /n
