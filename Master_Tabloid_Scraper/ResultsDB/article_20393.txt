Wonder Woman Is Promoting Diet Bars Now???/n

We're guessing a male exec thought this one up…
The Wonder Woman movie has partnered up with Think Thin nutrition bars in one of the most tone deaf marketing moves EVER!

Wonder Woman is supposed to be strong and empowering, not worried about her diet or working on losing weight. What is this supposed to teach impressionable young girls who look up to the character? It took long enough to finally even GET a female superhero with her own blockbuster movie, and now this? Pathetic!
Twitter's not happy about the diet bar promotion, either! You can ch-ch-check out some of their pissed off reactions (below)! 

Wonder Woman character believes women are perfect the way they are. Having the character on a diet bar sends the wrong message.

@dcwomenkicknass This enraged me. Male characters marketed to hell & back, Wonder Woman on a diet bar called Think Thin. Unacceptable.

Shilling body-shaming "think thin" weight loss bars is a betrayal of Wonder Woman's character, which is par for the comics course right now

Warner Bros. doing a tone-deaf "think thin" diet bar promotion for Wonder Woman is the most Warner Bros. thing ever.

Wonder Woman is all about empowering women to believe in themselves and take action, and tying her in with a diet bar is practically sacrilege.
Sigh. We can't have anything nice.
What do YOU think of this promotion, Perezcious readers???
