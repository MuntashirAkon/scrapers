Marc Anthony Has Moved On From His Divorce â€” He's Rebounding With A 21-YEAR-OLD Model!/n

Marc Anthony is in no way lonely!
As you may recall at the end of December, the Vivir Mi Vida singer filed for divorce from his third wife, Shannon De Lima. However, it seems the A-lister wasted no time in finding a new love as he's reportedly now dating model Mariana Downing. Someone moves on quickly!

According to TMZ, the songwriter has been seeing the 21-year-old Wilhelmina Miami model for the last couple of months. It's said Marc scored the up-and-comer's phone number after they met at a dinner party. Apparently, Mr. Anthony was immediately smitten with the youthful beauty and called her the day after they met.
And Mariana is definitely acting like a girlfriend as she joined the 48-year-old in the Caribbean for a vacay AND traveled with him to one of his shows. Now, despite the significant 27 year age gap, the twosome's relationship isn't really sketchy since Marc and Shannon have been separated since November.
Since Jennifer Lopez's baby daddy is known for rushing into serious relationships, and his divorce was only finalized on Monday, we're hoping Marc takes it slowly with this romance. But that's like wishing for a miracle, right?? LOLz!
