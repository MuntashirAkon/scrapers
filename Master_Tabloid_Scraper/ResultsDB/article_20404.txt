The new teaser promises an explosive new romance…

Today (Aug. 12, 2016), the first trailer for Robert Zemeckis’ WWII thriller Allied dropped, offering the seductive first images from this highly-anticipated release.
The film, reportedly based on a true story, stars Brad Pitt as Max Vatan, an American spy who falls in love with Marianne Beausejour (Marion Cotillard), a French spy, while both are on a mission to kill a German officer in 1942 Casablanca.
The images from the trailer include the couple in a firefight, plenty of Nazis milling about, and the co-stars locking lips in one particularly steamy scene. The whole atmosphere hints at a love story undermined by the turbulent war that surrounds them, seemingly forcing Vatan to question everything, including whether or not he trusts Beausejour. 
Allied arrives in theaters Nov. 23, 2016.
