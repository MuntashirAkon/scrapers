It seems animation is the quickest way to a star's young heart. Emma Watson, for example, unapologetically revealed recently that she's been harboring a secret crush on her Beauty and the Beast non-human counterpart. "There's something a bit sad about when he transforms," she told Yahoo! "You're like a bit...oh...okay you were quite nice before. He is hot. The Beast is hot."She's not alone in crushing on childhood characters. Her Harry Potter co-star Rupert Grint recalled the moment he first saw his own cartoon dream girl as a kid. "I liked Bo Peep in Toy Story….Lois Griffin, Family Guy….I think it was probably two different parts of my life. Toy Story was when I was a lot younger and Bo Peep is quite… wholesome in a kind of quite traditional way, I suppose," he explained to Marie Claire. "Lois Griffin… I don't really have an explanation for…I like her voice."

Riiiight...When Graham asked Eddie about the actor's affinity for Maid Marian from Robin Hood ("she's a fox"), however, Anna had to agree."I had that, too!" she exclaimed, though she was referring to the titular—and equally foxy—hero . "In Eddie's defense, they draw them really sexy! Because Robin Hood was quite sexy."

Graham also outed Liam Neeson as a Wilma Flintstone fan and quizzed cyclist Bradley Wiggins about his animated amour—and it turns out Bradley and Eddie liked the same Thundercats character!(Originally published December 19, 2014 at 6:56 p.m. PST)
