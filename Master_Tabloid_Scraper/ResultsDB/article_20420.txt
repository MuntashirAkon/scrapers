Looking gorgeous, ladies!Michelle Obama, along with daughters Sasha and Malia and her mother, Marian Robinson, were all smiles in Beijing, where the group posed for a photo with Chinese President Xi Jinping and his wife, Peng Liyuan, at the Diaoyutai State guest house on Friday.Of course, the first lady managed to look fashionable while still appearing classy and proper, wearing a bright red dress with matching red pumps, which was similar to her youngest daughter Sasha's look, as the 12-year-old beauty also wore a red frock, although she paired her number with black tights and silver flats.

Meanwhile, Malia, 15, looked more grown up than ever in a high-waisted skirt and matching crop shirt (although, in an appropriate move for the occasion, she didn't bare any midriff) while Obama's mother choose a patterned green dress for the occasion.Quite the head turners in China!The FLOTUS' trip to Beijing marked Obama's first meeting with her Chinese counterpart, Peng Liyuan, whose husband has served as the president of China since 2013, and it also marks the first time a first lady has visited China independently.And apparently the trip was a success, with Chinese media celebrating a budding relationship between the pair while calling the first lady "Mrs. Diplomatic," according to reports.
