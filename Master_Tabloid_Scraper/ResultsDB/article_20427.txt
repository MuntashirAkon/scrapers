Another wrote: “Don’t leave!!! We need girl power in fast 9!!!”
Rodriguez, who has starred in five out of the eight films as the love interest of Vin Diesel‘s character Dominic, has long been an activist for women’s rights.
“I have such a strong sense of self, there are certain lines I just won’t cross,” Rodriguez told Interview Magazine in 2015. “I’m really picky about the parts I choose. I can’t be the slut. I cannot be just the girlfriend. I can’t be the girl who gets empowered because she’s been raped. I can’t be the girl who gets empowered and then dies.”

As Radar can report, the franchise’s latest film The Fate Of The Furious did bring another female character to the light, with stunning Charlize Theron on the role of Cipher. However, she was portrayed as a villain with no mission but that of destroying humanity.
Another female lead, Elsa Pataky‘s Elena Nives character, was killed after four movies.
Rodriguez is scheduled to appear in the franchise’s upcoming films— do you think she’ll keep her promise? Let us know in the comments below.
