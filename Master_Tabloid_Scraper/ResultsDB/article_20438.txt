Shocking New Couple! Demi Moore Dating Newly Single Ex Tobey Maguire/n
Demi Moore isn’t letting ex-husband Ashton Kutcher’s happy home life get her down. The troubled actress is back together with another former lover — the newly single Tobey Maguire!
In a shocking exclusive, RadarOnline.com has learned that the 54-year-old cougar pounced on the opportunity to reignite an old flame when Maguire’s marriage to Jennifer Meyer fell apart this fall.
“Demi and Tobey had a brief but steamy affair in 2002 before Ashton swept her off her feet,” an insider revealed. “But now that they’re both single again, they’re discovering the spark is still alive and well.”
According to sources, the mother of three embarked on a campaign to win back her 41-year-old ex by showering him with sexy texts.

“Demi reached out to Tobey a couple weeks ago, and it didn’t take long for things to heat up,” the source told Radar. “At first it was all pretty tame, but then Demi started reminiscing about all the good times they used to have and it just went on from there.”
Moore has bounced from one boy toy to another following her split from Kutcher, 38, in 2011.
She has been linked to Australian diver Will Hanigan, 33, Heidi Klum’s art dealer boyfriend Vito Schnabel, 30, and restaurateur Harry Morton, 35.
“Demi is still a sexy, attractive woman, and Tobey is just her type — younger, smart and kind of goofy,” the source told Radar. “She’d like more than a hookup.”
“She’s very lonely these days and looking for someone to share her life with. Who knows where this will go?”
