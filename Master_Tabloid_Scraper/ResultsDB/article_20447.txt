Disney's Live Action Jafar Is Too Fucking Hot!/n

This is going to be Hans from Frozen all over againâ€¦
According to Variety, Disney has cast Marwan Kenzari to play Jafar in the live action version of Aladdin.
Frankly, we can't get behind this casting. We mean, how is Jasmine supposed to choose the titular street thief over this guy? Prince Ali can show her the world, but he can't show her that six-pack (see above)!

LOLz! We kid! We're actually really happy for the Dutch-Tunisian actor, whose star has been rising fast ever since his sexy, award-winning turn as a kickboxer escaping a life of crime in 2013's Wolf.
You may not have noticed him in the background of all those monsters and Tom Cruise in The Mummy, and he may be the only cast member of Murder On The Orient Express who isn't a huge movie star, but he's popping up more and more in English language films.
And something tells us when America gets a good look at that face in Aladdin, it's not going to be long before Kenzari is a household name.
