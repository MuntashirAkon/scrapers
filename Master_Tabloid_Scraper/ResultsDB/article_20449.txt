Dev Patel didn't land the lead part in the live action Aladdin movie, but he might be playing a street rat with a much darker fate.
Variety reports that the Lion actor is in talks to join Ben Stiller in the upcoming murder movie Chippendales, a true crime saga surrounding the male strip show!
The film revolves around the expansion of the Chippendales nightclub during the 1980s by Paul Snider and immigrant Somen Banerjee, who later pleaded guilty to attempted arson, racketeering, and murder for hire before being found dead in his jail cell in 1994.

Patel is eyeing the role of Banerjee while Stiller has been locked since 2014 to portray Nick De Noia, Banerjee's partner who was murdered in 1987.
Snider killed himself and Playboy Playmate Dorothy Stratten, designer of the iconic Chippendale collars and cuffs, in 1980, an aspect of the story previously told in the film Star 80.
Yikes â€” at least we won't be expecting a happy ending!
