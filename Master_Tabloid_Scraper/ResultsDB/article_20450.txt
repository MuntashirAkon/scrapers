An eyewitness told Page Six of seeing the pair while out to lunch:
"Naomi Watts and Billy Crudup walked in holding hands. We didn't know they were a couple. Pretty cool seeing two big stars so into each other."
Adding:
"[They] looked happy and were laughing a lot, then left again holding hands."
Ooh la la! We'll be keeping our eye on these two!
