Previously, Banks sat behind-the-camera as an executive producer while singer Rita Ora took over the hosting gig when the show was rebooted on VH1.
“I’m overwhelmed and humbled by the intensity of the ANTM fan base whose deep affection for the show led me to have a change of heart,” Banks says in a statement. “After giving it a lot of thought, I realized that remaining behind the camera wasn’t enough because ANTM is woven into my DNA.”
“Tyra has always been the heart and soul of the franchise and her absence was deeply felt by our fiercely loyal fans who missed their Queen of the Smize,” executive producer Ken Mok adds in the press release. “We’d like to thank Rita Ora for being a great partner and total pro. She infused this new iteration of ANTM with passion and creativity and we wish her nothing but the best in her future endeavors.”
The new season of America’s Next Top Model will begin this summer on VH1.
