A viewer of Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen took the opportunity to ask Naomi Campbell about her rumored beef with Rihanna during Campbell’s appearance on the show on Tuesday night.

An observant fan brought up how Campbell and Rihanna seemingly unfollowed each other on Instagram and stopped communicating on social media entirely. Celebrity samaritan Andy Cohen followed up on the viewer’s question by asking Campbell if everything was okay between her and RiRi.
“Everything’s fine. Of course it’s fine,” Campbell cooed. “I’m an actress now, Andy.”
The supermodel then expanded upon her response. “I don’t have beef. I don’t have beef especially with black women who I think are powerful and out there. We’re all doing the same thing, doing the same struggle.”

Campbell previously came to Rihanna’s defense at Paris Fashion Week 2015 when she got into a physical altercation with Cara Delevigne at Garage Magazine’s event at Castel.
“Naomi accused Cara of ‘disrespecting’ Rihanna and started yelling, before Naomi pushed Cara, who pushed back,” a source told Page Six.
“Cara pulled Naomi’s weave, but it didn’t come off,” added another witness.
Delevigne and Campbell both denied that this ever occurred on Twitter.
