Kendall Jenner gave the audience a surprise with a turn at a New York Fashion Week show.

Kendall was strutting the runway for La Perla along with Jourdan Dunn, Stella Maxwell and Naomi Campbell, and stole the show in her sheer gown … with a little help from her ass.
There’s no catching up to do when you’ve got this behind.
