The therapist is in, but that doesn't mean she's going to do you any good. The first sneak peek for Gypsy, the new 10-episode Netflix drama starring Naomi Watts, is here and it's a sight to behold.In the psychological thriller, Watts plays Jean Halloway, a therapist with what seems like the perfect life. Seems being the operative word. Soon Jean begins to develop intimate and illicit relationships with the people in her patient's lives. Professional and personal become blurred as "she descends into a world where the forces of desire and reality are disastrously at odds."

Watts got her start doing Australian TV. The Oscar nominee appeared in the short-lived series Sleepwalkers in 1997, played herself on BoJack Horseman, and will appear in Showtime's revival of Twin Peaks later this year.Gypsy premieres Friday, June 30 on Netflix.
