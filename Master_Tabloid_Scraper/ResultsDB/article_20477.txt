"The struggle to do your best and multitasking and all of those things, I think every single mother even if you've given up your work, you're just plagued by guilt from day one," she said.

(The two announced their separation in September after being together for 11 years.)"I try to do my best," Watts said of raising her children. "There are days when I feel I've just got it right down and then there are days in which you go, 'I wish I handled that better.'"Watts was honored with CinemaCon's Distinguished Decade of Achievement in Film Award last night during its annual closing night gala.She told me she wouldn't be sticking around to indulge in any Las Vegas activities because she wanted to get home in order to drive her kids to school today.
