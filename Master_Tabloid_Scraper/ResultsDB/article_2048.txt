TNA Star Robbie E -- Yoga Makes Me Fart ... But It Helped Me Prep for 'Amazing Race' /nTNA wrestler Robbie E might take the wind-relieving pose a little too literally ... 'cause even though yoga helped him prepare for the  "Amazing Race " ... it turned him into a human gasbag. Robbie and his GF Brooke Tessmacher teamed up for the CBS reality show -- which has already been shot and premieres in September -- and Robbie tells TMZ the yoga helped him get mentally and physically ready for the grueling challenges on the road. In fact, Robbie got some support from fellow wrestlers DJ Z and Jessie Godderz who teamed up for some  "broga " sessions before and after the  "Race " ... where Robbie fessed up to the pose that turns him into Captain Flatulation! Meantime, Brooke used other methods to prepare -- mainly something we like to call,  "Puttin' In Twerk. " Miley Cyrus would be proud .../n
