One dedicated fan noticed Naomi Campbell and Rihanna unfollowed each other on social media, so when Campbell appeared on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen Tuesday night, the observer decided to get the scoop to see if there was a feud between the two celebrities by asking the Star actress about it."Everything's fine," Campbell said after hesitating. "Of course it's fine."But host Andy Cohen seemed skeptical. "I'm an actress now, Andy," she quipped. When push came to shove, Campbell explained that she tries not to get embroiled in drama with anyone.

Both models later denied any of the events occurred via Twitter."Don't know where this story has come from about @Caradelevingne and I fighting! It is completely untrue, ignore the rumours XN," Campbell tweeted. Delevingne retweeted the statement and backed Campbell's denial, tweeting, "@NaomiCampbell people love to make a drama out of nothing."(E! and Bravo are both part of the NBCUniversal family.)
