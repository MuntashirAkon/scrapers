Diddy: My Birthday Warm Like ... Hot Apple Pie/nDiddy's pals know him well ... they threw the mogul a surprise 46th birthday party Wednesday night and, in true Diddy fashion, plugged the hell out of the new apple-flavored booze he just launched. Naomi Campbell, LA Reid and Andre Harrell ﻿threw the bday bash at Butter in NYC ... and Chris Rock, Ne-Yo, Trey Songz, Tyson Beckford﻿ and Maxwell all made the guest list. The apple theme trickled into the decorations and the desert table, which hilariously spelled out ALL of Diddy's nicknames -- IN HOT APPLE PIES!!! There were only 42 total ... 4 shy of Diddy's age. Maybe needs one more nickname. Happy birthday, Puff Pockets!/n
