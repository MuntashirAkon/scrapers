Bradley Cooper: Hot Breakfast With Naomi Campbell/nBradley Cooper doesn't have the elusive Oscar yet -- a la Leonardo DiCaprio -- but arguably he has something better ... a breakfast date with Naomi Campbell. Bradley and the supermodel were together Saturday morning at a West Hollywood restaurant and even drove off together. BC was with Irina Shayk for several months before this ... so clearly, he's got a type -- smoking hot supermodels. Brad has a lot in common with Leo, just get him an Oscar. Although Naomi will do just fine, for now./n
