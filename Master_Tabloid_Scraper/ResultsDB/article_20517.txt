Marilyn Monroe was the first Playboy cover girl in 1953 and the venerated gentlemen’s magazine is hosting the Playboy Presents The Marilyn Monroe Film Festival at Grauman’s honoring the iconic star.
A different classic Marilyn movie will be screened starting on her birthday June 1 through June 7 at the world famous Grauman’s Chinese Theatre beginning with Some Like It Hot.

In a tribute to the late superstar, who died 50 years ago this summer, Lindsay Lohan posed as Marilyn in the January/February 2012 issue of Playboy and Hugh Hefner spoke about her cover and nude photos.
 “I had mixed emotions. I could not have anticipated, quite frankly, that it would turn out to be such a newsworthy event or that the pictorial would turn out so well.”

On opening night there will be a Marilyn Look-A-Like Contest where the first 200 look-alikes who register at Grauman’s Chinese Theater will be admitted free.
Marilyn’s prints are a favorite tourist spot in Los Angeles and she once said the theater was the place she went for inspiration.

“I used to go to Grauman’s Chinese Theatre and try to fit my foot in a celebrity impression. It really meant to me that anything is possible … almost.”
