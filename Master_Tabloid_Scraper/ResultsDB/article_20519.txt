Never-before-seen photos of Hollywood’s most iconic blonde, Marilyn Monroe, taken by her beloved makeup artist Allan ‘Whitey’ Snyder, will be auctioned off this Saturday – and RadarOnline.com has a sneak peak of the candid photos that are expected to fetch between $40,000-$100,000.
PHOTOS: Never-Before-Seen Photos Of Marilyn Monroe 
In the photos, taken on the 1953 set of one of Marilyn’s first movies, Niagara, the then-27-year-old star shows off a playful side as she hams it up for her pal, who worked with her for 16 years and even did her makeup for her funeral.  
The photos have remained in Snyder’s family since his death in 1994, and they recently decided to sell them through Julien’s Auctions.

“A lot of people say they knew Marilyn, but Whitey really knew Marilyn,” Darien Julien, the president and CEO of the auction house, told the Daily News.
“These images were never meant to be released to the public. He had personal access to her like no one else. They would spend holidays together when she wasn’t dating anyone.”
