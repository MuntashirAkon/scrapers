PHOTOS: The Sexiest Swimsuit Babes Of All Times
She was the world’s first and most famous Bond girl, and she rocked a bikini like no other! Swiss siren Ursula Andrews scorched up the screen of 1962’s Dr. No in a white hot bikini that screamed sexiness. The movie, as well as her bikini body, will never be forgotten.
Bo Derek and Farrah Fawcett both proved that one-piece swimsuits can be just as scandalous and sexy as a barely there bikini! Derek steamed up the screen looking nearly naked in a nude swimsuit with cornrow braids hitting her tan skin in the movie 10, while the late Fawcett was the object of millions of boys’ affection when she posed for a famous photo wearing a sheer, red number.
Michelle Williams and Lindsay Lohan have both channeled the Old Hollywood glamour of big screen goddess  Marilyn Monroe, but neither of the stars can rock a bikini quite like good ol’ Norma Jean. Monroe stripped down into a polka-dot bikini in 1951, flaunting her famous curves in breathtaking fashion.
Foxy French actress Brigitte Bardot was one of the earliest supporters of the bikini, even starring in a movie called The Girl in the Bikini, while Raquel Welch, one of the most celebrated beauties of all times, posed in a cave girl bikini in the 1966 movie One Million Years B.C.
