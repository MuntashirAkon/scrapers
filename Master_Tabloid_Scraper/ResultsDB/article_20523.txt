The 23-year-old Barbadian beauty, who was named Esquire magazine‘s Sexist Woman Alive for 2011, might have another year with the crown if she keeps us like this, as she showed off her beautiful body in the sheer-cut Norma Kamali swimsuit. 
The pop star tweeted a few pics of herself in the suit, writing in one pic of her rear end: “Wake…Bake…#CAKE.” 
She also wrote, “Swimming with Sharks is one of my favorite things I’ve ever done.”
As RadarOnline.com previously reported, Rihanna won another accolade recently. Extra-marital dating site Ashleymadison.com polled 25,000 of their subscribers asking which female celebrity people would most want to cheat with.
