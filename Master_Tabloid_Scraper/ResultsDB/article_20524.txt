By Radar Staff
It’s a very happy Monday for one Marilyn Monroe fan, who purchased the images, negatives and copyrights from the blonde bombshell’s first-ever photo shoot for $352,000 at a celebrity auction in Beverly Hills Sunday.
The 1946 shots of the then-20-year-old Norma Jeane Dougherty were sold at Julien’s Auctions’ special Icons & Idols event, which features top-shelf celeb swag.

The winner of the auction reserves the right to sell or distribute the photos, which were placed on the block after a judge commanded the photographer, Joseph Jasgur, to sell them off to pay his debts.
Other prime ticket items included Lady Gaga‘s Born This Way prop gun for $7,680; and a 1969 drawing by John Lennon of he and Yoko Ono for $90,000.
