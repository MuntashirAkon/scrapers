NFL's Eric Decker -- My Famous Wife Gave Birth ... I've Got a Son! /nIt's a good thing Eric Decker signed that $36 million contract last year, 'cause he's got a brand new mouth to feed.  The New York Jets WR's famous country singer wife Jessie James Decker has given birth to their son -- their 2nd child. Decker tweeted about the situation saying,  "Thanks for all well wishes! Mama and baby boy are doing great!! Vivi is the sweetest big sister! " It appears Decker was at the hospital for the birth -- which is pretty amazing considering the Jets are finishing up training camp and gearing up for the season.  Congrats!! /n
