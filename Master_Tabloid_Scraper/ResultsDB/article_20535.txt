Scott Disick is over the Kardashians!

The reality star, who shares three children with Kourtney Kardashian, looks to have severed ties from his ex-girlfriend and her famous family. Aside from unfollowing his baby mama on Instagram, the 34-year-old has also removed Kourt’s sisters — Kim, Khloé, Kendall and Kylie — as well as Kris Jenner off his feed.

Lord Disick noticably scrubbed his friends’ list clean of the Kardashians after Kourtney posted a bunch of photos from her vacation with new boyfriend Younes Bedjima.
“Scott is having a tough time and is really struggling with watching Kourtney fall for a young guy like Younes,” an insider told HollywoodLife. “Scott can’t stand watching the mother of his kids chase Younes all over the world. Scott unfollowed Kourtney’s Instagram account a while ago and is trying to avoid social media because it is too upsetting for him to see pictures of Kourt in a bikini with some other guy. This is the first real boyfriend Scott has ever seen Kourtney with and it’s driving him crazy. He wants nothing to do with it.”

As reported, Kourtney jetted off to Egypt with Younes, 24, earlier this month for getaway to someplace she’s never been before. In photos shared online, the two were seen riding camels, hitting the beach, and canoodling by the Great Pyramid of Giza during the trip.
As of press time, Scott is still following his ex and her family on Twitter. Kourtney has yet to remove Scott from her Instagram.
