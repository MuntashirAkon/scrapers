Goodbye Norma June/n
The beginning of the year is always filled with thoughtful reflection. Thankfully Here Comes Honey Boo Boo returned this week to help us avoid judging ourselves and put that criticism where it counts! It was a Halloween special – not in the way it's always terrifying, but because it was actually Halloween. Mama June made an effort to free the blonde bombshell inside her by getting herself a Marilyn Monroe makeover. And she certainly did look blonde!Mama June's husband was so thrilled with her new look, he risked public execution by revealing she'd turned him into a "horny bear." In fact, the transformation was so convincing, Hollywood is remaking Marilyn's most famous movies with Mama June in the starring role.
