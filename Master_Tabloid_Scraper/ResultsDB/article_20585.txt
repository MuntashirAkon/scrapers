Bruce Beresford-Redman's Dad -- You Got Served/nA bunch of cops just showed up to the home of Bruce Beresford-Redman -- but they don't want Bruce ... they want to serve his father. We're told L.A. County Sheriff's officers just made the house call to serve Bruce's father, David Beresford-Redman, with the temporary restraining order that was granted against him yesterday.As we first reported, the TRO was requested by Norma Paula De Ahlf -- the general manager of the restaurant owned by Bruce's murdered wife -- who claims in the legal docs that David wants to kill her because she knows secrets about Bruce's marriage.According to the TRO -- which was granted by the judge and expires on June 22 -- David must stay 100 yards away from Norma.UPDATE: David just emerged from the house and admitted that he was served with the TRO -- and also said he doesn't own a gun./n
