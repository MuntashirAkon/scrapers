Tyrese's Ex -- Judge Okays Israel Trip ... Now Passover My Kid's Passport /nTyrese's notion that his ex is kidnapping their kid won't fly ... according to the judge who ordered Norma Gibson be allowed to take their daughter to the Middle East. Monday morning a judge instructed Tyrese to hand over the passport of their 7-year-old daughter, Shayla, so that Norma can take her to Israel for two weeks over spring break. Last week, Tyrese tried to block the March 27th trip through the courts because he argued as an Israeli citizen Norma is allowed to stay permanently, but she fired back saying international law ensures why she'll bring Shayla back safe and sound. We're told Norma has agreed to share all of the travel details with Tyrese but remains adamant ... she's tied to L.A. and any notion she's a flight risk is absurd.Â  Shalom./n
