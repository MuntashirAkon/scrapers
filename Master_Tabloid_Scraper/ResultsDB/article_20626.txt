Hey Rihanna, Are Those Pinstriped Scrubs You're Wearing??/n

The amount Rihanna's style can vary from day to day is truly amazing!! 
For instance, just over the weekend the Barbadian beauty was spotted at her favorite restaurant wearing a very feminine pink silk slip dress. 
But a few days later, RiRi showed up to have lunch with her friend in West Hollywood wearing something that couldn't be more different! 
She rocked a gray pinstriped ensem that kind of looked like a fancy version of hospital scrubsâ€¦which were styled with reptile shoes and a clean-cut Delvaux purse. 
A pop of ravishing red lipstick and a pulled-back ponytail completed her look!
