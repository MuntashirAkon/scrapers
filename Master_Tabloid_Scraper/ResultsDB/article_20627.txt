Rihanna Grabs Sushi With Adriana Lima In LA! See What They Wore HERE!/n

Besties!!!
Rihanna and Adriana Lima had sushi dinner yesterday night at KOI restaurant in LA, which was kind of an unexpected event, although they have spent time together in the past.
Guess they really bonded after RiRi performed during the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show in 2012!
Also, have you noticed how the last half of the supermodel's name is basically Rihanna but spelled with one "n" and no "h"? AdRIANA! We just realized it right now.
Surely, it's some kind of serendipitous occurrence!
The two were arm-in-arm as they stepped out of the restaurant, with Adriana looking sexy in a teal dress and strappy sandals while Rih was unusually dressed down, considering she was on a date with a fashion model. 
She basically just wore sweats, New Balance sneakers, and a Pigalle cap. 
It could be argued that her $5,000 Delvaux handbag made up for her casual clothes, but we're not convinced. 
Thoughts???
