Menswear Dog Dresses Up Like Celebs!!/n

OMG! This is so crazy CUTE!
An adorbz 3-year-old shiba inu doggy called Menswear Dog is all about, what else, menswear!!
He loves to dress up and model and he looks damn good if you ask us!
His owner described him, saying:
"Menswear Dog is a 3 year old shiba inu living in NYC with a panache for all things style. His interests include never washing his selvage denim, lurking around Soho for someone to notice his steez, and sniffing fine a$$ bitches."
Ha! That's HIGHlarious!
He's also a big fan of movies and music!
Menswear Dog did a tribute to Mad Men, Ryan Gosling, Daft Punk and more!!
He's seriously so cute!! Love the pics!
