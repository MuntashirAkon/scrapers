Sienna Miller Is Such A Doll At Vanity Fair's Tribeca Film Festival Party/n

Sienna Miller took a well-deserved night off from playing mommy for a girls night out with her lover and baby daddy Tom Sturridge's sister Matilda.
The British actress took her +1 to the Tribeca Film Festival opening night party hosted by Vanity Fair looking mod and chic in a black, floral embroidered baby doll dress. 
Jeweled heels, a red Delvaux shoulder bag, and 'do reminiscent of her Alfie character Nikki completed her look.
We wish her hair was a little less messy, but if it were perfect, it wouldn't be Sienna.
