Katie Holmes Steps Out In Her Birthday Suit In The Big Apple/n

No, not that kind of birthday suit!
Katie Holmes celebrated her first post-Tom Cruise birthday in New York City on Tuesday, treating it like it was just any regular old day.
The just-turned-34-year-old celebrated with daughter Suri Cruise earlier in the afternoon, then stepped out on the town solo later that night.
Dressed in a long gray trench coat tossed over a gauzy, lightly sequined white dress, the actress gave her typical lopsided little smile to photogs.
This is actually a much better outfit than some of her previous looks!
She accessorized with her fave Delvaux Madame black & red leather shoulder bag and black rag & bone boots. 
Happy birthday, Katie, and many happy returns!
