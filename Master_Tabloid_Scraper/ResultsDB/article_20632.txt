Birthday’s may only come once a year, but that doesn’t make a belated celebration any less special.
Ashton Kutcher took Mila Kunis out to dinner last night (August 25, 2015) in honor of her 32nd birthday, which was August 14.

Kutcher was spotted leaving the restaurant with presents in hand: a vibrating fitness roller.

Let it be known that Kutcher is the kind of guy that’ll gift you something practical, something you can use once a day or only once in a while.
An eyewitness at Toca Madera restaurant told E! news,
They sat in the back garden and kept a low profile, Ashton wore a ball cap while Mila opted for a nice black and blue striped dress. Leaving Wyatt at home, the two were joined by another unidentified couple for the night as they dined on fresh Mexican cuisine.
Mila was seen opening presents from Ashton, which turned out to be a vibrating exercise roller. Laughing hysterically as she opened the gift, Mila leaned in to give Ashton a kiss after opening her gift.
ET reports that they dined with actor Al Shearer and his wife, model Niresha Kalaichelvam.
