 Grammy-nominated pop star Adam Lambert and Grammy-winning hip hop star Chamillionaire both participated in the second annual Grammy Social Media Rock Stars Summit held in Los Angeles this past Friday.
Moderated by well-known music reporter John Norris, these two stars spoke alongside social media experts Naveen Selvadurai from 4square, Ethan Beard from Facebook, and Tim Westergren from Pandora. Lambert and Chamillionaire covered such topics as the impact of fan involvement in their careers, to the occasional drunk tweeting that may cause a public uproar.
“I use [Twitter] as more of a personal thing for fans to really get to know me,” Chamillionaire replied when asked about how social media brings artists and the general public together. “I want to create a reaction from them and know what they want from me.”
Lambert, the “Whataya Want From Me” singer, discussed his choice to have a personal Facebook account on top of his public fan page because he too wants to be able to keep in touch with friends like everyone else who is registered on the site.
Of course, there’s a limit to how they use their social media outlets so as to not offend anyone.
“You have to be to be careful … drunk tweeting is not good,” Lambert added to a room full of giggling media and lucky music fans who were able to attend.
The whole panel agreed with John Norris when he noted how social media gets people to be “more aggressive in their discovery of music”.
