NBC dropped the first promo on Friday for their upcoming TV extravaganza Hairspray Live! and we can’t wait to dance along.
The fun teaser shows the A-list cast in costume together for the first time, including Harvey Fierstein as Edna Turnblad (who returns to the role after originating it on Broadway), Jennifer Hudson as Motormouth Maybelle, Kristin Chenoweth as Velma Von Tussle, Martin Short as Wilbur Turnblad, Derek Hough as Corny Collins, Ariana Grande as Penny Pingleton, and introducing Maddie Baillio as our fav character, Tracy Turnblad. Watch!





The whole Hairspray phenom started in 1988 with the quirky John Waters film, starring Ricki Lake as Tracy and Divine as Edna and told the story of an overweight teenage girl living in Baltimore in the early 1960s who dreams of appearing on a popular TV dance show.
It was then turned into a smash-hit Broadway musical in 2002, with Tony-winning Marissa Jaret Winokur and Fierstein in the lead roles of Tracy and Edna, respectively. The musical was then made for the big screen in 2007 with John Travolta playing Edna and newcomer Nikki Blonsky as Tracy.

So, Baillo is the latest new face to play the effervescent Tracy. When she got the role, she had to keep it a secret for a little bit. “I only told my mom and my dad,” Baillio told E! News after her big reveal in June. “I’ve known for like two weeks. It’s been the hardest thing ever, to not tell everyone. I don’t know how they do it on Game of Thrones. I am so excited that I get to be part of this huge thing.”
Hairspray Live! premieres Wednesday, December 7 on NBC.
