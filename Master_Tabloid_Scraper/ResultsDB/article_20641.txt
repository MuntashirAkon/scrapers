 This is life after 30 Rock after all. Alec Baldwin announced he will return to Broadway in spring 2013 in an upcoming mobster play.
For the dark role,  Baldwin will portray Harold, a mobster who is kidnapped and held by two troubled brothers in Lyle Kessler’s 1983 drama Orphans, the show’s producers said on Wednesday. The play will be directed by the Tony Award winner Daniel Sullivan (The Columnist, Proof.)
Baldwin said in a statement to the NY Times that he had dreamed for years of collaborating with Mr. Sullivan on the play.
The 30 Rock actor isn’t the only star heading to Broadway. 

Earlier this week, Miley Cyrus’ dad, Bill Ray Cyrus, announced that he is taking on the role of criminal lawyer Billy Flynn in Chicago for a seven-week engagement beginning Nov. 5, the AP reports.
In the musical, Cyrus plays a lawyer who defends the musical’s  murderesses Velma and Roxie by using their celebrity status to win over  the public in Prohibition-era Chicago.
