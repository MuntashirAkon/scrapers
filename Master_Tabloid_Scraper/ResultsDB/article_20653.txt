Chicago isn't Mya's kind of town just yet. The Grammy-winning R&B songstress had been scheduled to make her Broadway debut May 12, playing husband-offer Velma Kelly in the Bob Fosse production, but a broken left foot has forced her to lay her fishnets aside for the time being. Mýa's run was set to last for nine weeks, but it's unclear when she'll end up joining the show. There's no word on who might take the stage in her absence. "We are sometimes forced to deal with circumstances beyond our control," producer Barry Weissler said in a statement. "But speaking for the entire Chicago creative team, we all wish her a speedy recovery, and look forward to experiencing her portrayal of Velma Kelly as soon as possible." The "Ghetto Supastar" harmonizer isn't completely new to the Chicago cellblock, however—she already sharpened her claws playing merry murderess Mona in Rob Marshall's 2003 Oscar-winning feature adaptation.
