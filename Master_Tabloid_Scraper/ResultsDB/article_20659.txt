I got spritzed with Hairspray last night. I, along with a whopping 1,200 or so others, packed the Mann Village Theater for the premiere of Hairspray, the movie adaptation of the Tony Award-winning Broadway musical. Stars like John Travolta, a blond wig-wearing Queen Latifah, Michelle Pfeiffer, James Marsden, Amanda Bynes, Zac Efron, Brittany Snow, Allison Janney and newcomer Nikki Blonsky were all there, as were Channing Tatum, Johnny Knoxville, Chris Tucker, Forest Whitaker, Carmen Electra and Hairspray's creator, John Waters (who almost didn't make it because his flight from Baltimore was late).There were giant cans of hairspray and young women dressed in cotton-candy-colored 1960s garb in the lobby to greet guests.

As I first told you this morning in my Planet Gossip Now video blog, Ms. Pfeiffer, 49, looks incredible. She wore a simple cream-colored dress with sky-high heels. She was one of the first people to hit the dance floor at the after-party, dancing with a group of kids to "Pretty Woman."Looking better than ever last night was Amanda Bynes. In the past, I've taken Bynes, who plays Penny Pingleton in the movie, to task for some of her less than stellar fashion choices. But last night, she redeemed herself by going soft on her makeup and choosing a summery D&G light green chiffon babydoll dress. The party, which took place at nearby UCLA, felt like a '60s-era high school sock hop (Hairspray takes place in 1962). The menu included hamburgers, hot dogs, baked beans and even Frito-Lay corn chips. Stylists at a hair station gave party guests beehives and updos. There was no gift bag, but I did go home with a can of—what else?—hairspray.As regular readers of my column know, I couldn't wait to see this movie. And I'm happy to report that I loved it.I was a little apprehensive about a dragged-up Travolta playing Tracy Turnblad's mom, Edna, but it didn't take long to get used to it. Sure, it's a little startling when Travolta first pops up on screen, but he pulls it off. Director Adam Shankman said it best when he introduced Travolta before the movie began last night: "Wait till you see this bitch dance!" And after seeing Travolta dance and sing, I wish he had more musical numbers in the movie.Pfeiffer is deliciously sinister as the aging beauty queen, Velma Von Tussle. She's a concoction of Cruella DeVille and Meryl Streep's Miranda Priestly from The Devil Wears Prada.The real standout for me (as well as for the pal I brought along to the premiere with me) was Elijah Kelley, who plays Seaweed J. Stubbs. What a screen presence, not to mention an incredible voice. Of course, I must give props to Blonksy, who makes her big-screen debut as the perky and plump Tracy Turnblad. Until this flick, Bronsky had no major acting experience. When she was discovered in a nationwide search, she was scooping ice cream at a Coldstone Creamery on Long Island, New York.Blonsky's voice booms, her dancing is infectious and she just oozes sweetness. Let's just say her ice cream days are long behind her.Click below for my Planet Gossip Now video blog report on the premiere (and to find out what Sienna Miller was doing last night New York City!).
