Leah Messer’s Special Needs Daughter Falling More, Seeking School Aid/n
Leah Messer’s daughter Ali suffers from a rare form of muscular dystrophy – and it seems her condition is worsening. Messer revealed in a Teen Mom 2 clip that her 7-year-old daughter might need an aid in school.
“The email was just saying that she has been falling a lot more in school,” Messer’s ex-husband Corey Simms explained.
Messer, 25, responded, “The teacher told me today when I picked her up, that I should push for her to get an aid. My question is, if she gets an aid, will she be separated in a different class?”

But Simms insisted an aid is necessary.
“Whether that means she needs to be in a special class, it’s going to happen,” he said. “We gotta do it while she’s young so it will be normal. It is just first grade. It’ll be like that until 12th grade, but hopefully not.”
Ali’s struggles with the disease have been documented on Teen Mom 2. She often relies on a wheelchair to get around and was forced to quit tumbling classes on a recent episode because it became too hard.
