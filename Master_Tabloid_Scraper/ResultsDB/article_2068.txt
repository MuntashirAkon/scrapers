 Naomi Watts CAUGHT In PDA With On-Screen Hubby Billy Crudup After Split From Liev Schreiber.../n
Adding to another one of Hollywood’s love setups, Naomi Watts and on-screen husband Billy Crudup are now reportedly dating in real life, RadarOnline.com has learned.
The co-stars who play a married couple on Netflix series Gypsy, were spotted by Page Six holding hands just this past weekend, while strolling the streets of New York City.
They “looked happy and were laughing a lot, then left again holding hands,” said an onlooker who watched the new couple share a romantic lunch at a local café.

An eyewitness told the outlet they spotted Watts, 48, and Crudup, 49, holding hands as they walked into a cafe for lunch. The witness said they “looked happy and were laughing a lot, then left again holding hands.”
Watts, 48, remains close friends with ex Liev Schreiber, with whom she had an 11-year relationship and currently shares custody of their two kids.
Earlier this month, Radar revealed Schreiber was caught sharing some steamy PDA with Morgan Brown, while he and Watts had agreed to not be seen on public dates for at least a year after their split.

After he broke the pact, the actress was livid, and a source close to the blonde beauty claimed she would likely be hooking up with “another beefy, leading-man type” very soon.
As Radar can report, 49-year-old Crudup dated actress Mary-Louise Parker until 2003 when he left her – while six months pregnant with his child – for bombshell Claire Danes. They split four years later.
