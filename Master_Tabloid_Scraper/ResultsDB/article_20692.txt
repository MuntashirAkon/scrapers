According to TMZ, the Klu Klux Klan members who agreed to appear in the upcoming A&E series, Generation KKK, were not paid for their participation.

The show aims to profile several families deeply involved in the Klan and attempt to show them a way out of the hate-fueled organization.
The subjects of the show agreed to have cameras follow them in an effort to change the public perception of the notorious group, according to TMZ’s sources. Since the show was conducted like a documentary, those filmed weren’t paid for their time.

TMZ also reported that some things they shot were so volatile, including rallies, that the show’s crew had to be accompanied by armed security while filming the show.
Yesterday (Dec. 21, 2016), the show’s first promotional clip was released, causing an uproar because many simply assumed the show’s subjects and network were profiting from promoting hate.
