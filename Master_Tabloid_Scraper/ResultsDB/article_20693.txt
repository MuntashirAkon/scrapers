A+E has reportedly ordered a new series exploring the Klu Klux Klan in modern America titled Generation KKK. According to the New York Times, the show has been in production for a year and a half, filming the lives of some Klan members and their families.

The show’s creators aim to shed light on the fundamentals of the organization and to attempt to convince some members to leave it behind, or at the very least to not expose their children to the Klan.
“The struggles we were most drawn to were the struggles with the internal families,” said Aengus James, the show’s executive producer. “We had a stance, and we were clear with folks that we were hoping for them to see the light and to come out of this world. It’s an incredibly destructive environment for anybody to be in, let alone children.”
