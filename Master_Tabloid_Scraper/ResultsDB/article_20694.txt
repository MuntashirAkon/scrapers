News of their divorce comes one month after the couple announced their separation. The couple made this announcement one day after Anthony locked lips with his ex Jennifer Lopez on stage at the Latin Grammys. While both Lopez and Anthony were quick to argue the kiss was nothing more than a gesture of friendly affection between longtime friends, sources say Anthony still has feelings for his ex-wife.
