Leah Remini continued her vocal opposition to the Church of Scientologist and it’s practices during a recent interview with Larry King, during which she discussed the organization’s most-famous and devoted celebrity: Tom Cruise.

When asked hypothetically what the Jack Reacher: Never Go Back star might say to Remini now if given the chance, the actress responded that he wouldn’t dare speak to her because of the church’s striking teachings.
“He wouldn’t say anything to me, because he thinks I’m the devil,” she said while on hand to promote her new A+E show Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath. “He honestly believes … Tom and most Scientologists, all Scientologists are taught to believe that people like me are literally the devil, that we mean them harm.”

Later, King asked Remini if he would define Cruise as “delusional.” Instead of speculating on the A-list actor’s frame of mind, she explained the difficulty she had coming to terms with things she was taught in the church that she later realized weren’t accurate.
“I could say that about myself, yes,” Remini stated. “I didn’t want to look, I didn’t want to believe that what I’ve been involved in my whole life was a lie, that it was damaging and hurting people. Yeah, you could say I was delusional.”
