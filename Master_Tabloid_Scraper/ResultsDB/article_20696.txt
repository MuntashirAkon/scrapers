John Travolta says he’s not planning to watch Leah Remini’s new A+E show, which explores her claims of sometimes troubling, sometimes downright-illegal practices within the organization.

“[Scientology has] been nothing but helpful to me for 40 years, through all my losses of my mother, my girlfriend, my son,” Travolta explained to E! News at the 22nd Critics’ Choice Awards. “They never left my side, so why would I want buy into something that’s not what I feel?”

The eight-part series, which premiered on Nov. 29, 2016, covers many things Remini discussed during her Reddit AMA last month, including the Church of Scientology’s surveillance practices and even alleged sexual misconduct.
Travolta went to admit that he’s “kind of” surprised Remini chose to participate in the docuseries, but ultimately isn’t fazed by her actions.
“As long as I get to still do it and my family gets to do it, I’m happy,” Travolta stated.
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath airs on Tuesdays at 10 p.m. EST on A+E.
