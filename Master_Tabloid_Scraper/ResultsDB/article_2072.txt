Mad Mel Strikes Again! Gibson’s 26-Year-Old Girlfriend Is Pregnant/n
Mel Gibson, 60, is expecting a baby with his 26-year-old girlfriend, RadarOnline.com has learned.
Gibson is already a father to eight children: Hannah, 36, Edward, 34, Christian, 34, William, 31, Louise, 28, Milo, 26, and Thomas, 17, were all born to his first wife, Robyn Gibson, whom he divorced in 2009. Lucia, 6, was born to Oksana Grigorieva, a year before their 2011 split.
The new lucky lady, Rosalind Ross, is a decorated equestrian, and has been dating Gibson for two years. According to People magazine, she is due early next year.
“Mel loves being a dad and he and Rose can’t wait to be parents together,” a source told the magazine. “The last two years have been some of the happiest years he’s ever had.”

Indeed, Gibson’s life had taken a dark turn over the last ten years. In summer 2006, he was arrested on suspicion of drunk driving in L.A. and launched a hateful racist rant in which he blasted “f*****g Jews” and called a cop “sugar tits.” Gibson later admitted to the “belligerent” outburst and apologized to the Sheriffs and his fans. He pleaded no contest to DUI and got probation.
Then in 2010, Radar exclusively released bombshell audio that featured Gibson using the N-word, calling Grigorieva a “f*****g pig in heat,” and much worse. In 2011, a court granted her a $750,000 settlement in their custody case, but after she discussed it publicly that number was dropped down to $250,000 — a mere fraction of the $15 million Gibson had originally offered.
