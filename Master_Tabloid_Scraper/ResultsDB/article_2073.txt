It will air following a special on the network called The Unauthorized Beverly Hills, 90210 Story, starring Dan Castellaneta.
As RadarOnline.com previously reported, the daughter of TV great Aaron Spelling is currently embroiled in a legal battle with the restaurant chain Benihana over burns she said she suffered there this past spring, but likely won’t broach the subject as it’s still in the courts.
Tori Spelling: Celebrity Lie Detector airs on Lifetime Saturday, October 3 at 10/9c. /n
