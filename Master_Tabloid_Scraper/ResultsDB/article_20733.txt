Peteski Productions -- which produces  "Dr. Phil " -- is suing Leah Rothman for stealing a video shot on board a private plane back in 2014 ... and the company says she specifically targeted a portion of the footage. In docs, obtained by TMZ, the company argues Rothman accessed a database without authorization a year later ... and recorded a 9-second clip of Dr. Phil speaking to producers on her iPhone.
