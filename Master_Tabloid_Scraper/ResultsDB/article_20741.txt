NFL's Devon Still -- My Daughter's Cancer's In Remission!!! /nGreat news for the Still family -- Cincinnati Bengals lineman Devon Still just announced his 4-year-old daughter Leah is WINNING her battle against cancer .... because it's officially in remission!!! You know the back story ... Leah was diagnosed with Stage 4 neuroblastoma back in June and doctors said she had a 50 /50 chance to live.  Despite the fact he wasn't supposed to make the team, the Bengals signed Devon to a contract so he would continue to get health insurance to cover Leah's medical bills.   Leah's been fighting like hell ever since ... and Wednesday, Devon announced the tide has turned in her favor.   "Today we received news from Leah's oncologist that her cancer, stage four neuroblastoma, is officially in REMISSION! After 296 days of daydreaming about what it would feel like to hear the doctors say my daughter is in remission, I finally know the feeling. "  "When I look at my daughter all I can do is smile and hug her. "  "I'm so proud and blessed to call her my daughter. She has made an impact on me and on the world, at the age of four, that I can only wish to make in a lifetime. "   Thank you to my family and friends for the support through all those tough days. Thank you to everyone who has sent a letter to give Leah and our family motivation to keep fighting, a toy that helped Leah get through her days in the hospital, and more importantly a prayer that helped God hear our cries for healing. "  He added,  "Thank you to the Bengals for taking on my situation and standing by me and my family and for helping to raise money to fight pediatric cancer. "  "Leah is not done with treatments yet. She still needs more to make sure the cancer cells do not return and to build back up her immune system and other damage from the chemo but I know my little warrior will get through it! "/n
