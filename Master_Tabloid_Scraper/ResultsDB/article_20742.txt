Devon Still -- Throwing Anti-Cancer Bash ... to Celebrate Daughter's Remission/nThere's only one way to celebrate a 4-year-old girl beating cancer ... and that's with a Disney princess themed anti-cancer party! Cincinnati Bengals defensive lineman Devon Still and his adorable daughter Leah will be doing just that, now that her cancer has gone into remission.  The two were on FOX 29’s “Good Day Philadelphia " on Thursday where Devon talked about how he broke the good news to Leah.   He explained,  "For the past 296 days, I’ve been daydreaming about what that feeling would be like, and then finally, I just looked at my daughter and started crying. She knew why I was crying and she asked me ,‘Did I beat up cancer?’ And I told her ‘Yes’ and we just kept hugging and kissing. " Leah, who still has one more round of chemo to go through, talked about wanting to get a pony and about her upcoming party to celebrate her good health ... complete with all the princesses from  "Frozen.
