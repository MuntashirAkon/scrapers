ShamWow Ex-Scientologist -- Leah Remini's Life Is in Danger/nYou don't attack the Church of Scientology and get away with it ... not by a long shot -- so says one famous ex-Scientologist Vince Offer (the ShamWow Guy), who tells TMZ, Leah Remini is lucky she's still alive.Offer was out in L.A last night -- and it's clear he's still concerned about L. Ron Hubbard's followers after his highly-publicized split from the Church ten years ago ... because he was VERY hesitant to talk about Remini's situation.You'll recall, the  "King of Queens " actress recently left the Church, then filed a missing persons report regarding Shelly Miscavige, the wife of Scientology leader David Miscavige. The Church was PISSED.Offer called Remini's move  "brave, " but said he couldn't say much more because he values his life ... and he wasn't kidding. You have to see how scared this guy is.As for Scientology -- reps for the Church have repeatedly stated that Miscavige is fine ... and rumors of mistreatment are nothing more than defamatory lies./n
