Jennifer Lopez: First Video Inside Las Vegas Show ... No Lip Sync, No Problems/nJ. Lo launched her Las Vegas residency with a preview show for family and friends that went off without a single hitch.  Jennifer ran through her  "All I Have " show at Planet Hollywood Monday night, and even though the front row was loaded with familiar faces -- like BFF Leah Remini, her mom and kids -- she nailed the routine. Video from the VIP gig shows J. Lo hitting her marks (like a Fly Girl should) -- and, apparently, really singing instead of lip syncing. Jen's performing on Britney Spears' off days in the same theater, and shows for the public begin Wednesday night./n
