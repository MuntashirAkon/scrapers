Louis C.K. Claims He's $2 Million In Debt After Funding His Own Show — Is This Another Kanye Situation All Over Again?!/n

Are we supposed to feel bad about celebrities funding their own projects at a loss?
As you probably remember, Kanye West made headlines back in February after he claimed he was $53 million in debt because of The Life of Pablo.
Well, it seems as though this may not be as unique a situation as we originally thought because Louis C.K. says he just personally put himself back $2 million as well!

Apparently, the comedian's web series called Horace and Pete starring himself, Steve Buscemi, Edie Falco, Alan Alda, and Jessica Lange was created completely out of Louis' pocket, and the $2-$5 per episode price tag is not raking in a profit.
The Louis star sat down with Howard Stern on Monday and revealed that he's only just now promoting the series because he's "millions of dollars in debt," saying: 

"I got so excited about having the show appear from nothing. So I made the first four, and I didn't tell nobody and it made a nice little amount of money. When I got to episode four, I was like, 'Hey gang, I don't have any money…' So I had to take out a line of credit.
I'm gonna hit hard like I would never promote it before… By the summer, the whole show will have paid itself off."
We sure hope he's right…
On the plus side, at least the reviews are universally positive!
