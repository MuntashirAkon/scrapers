Nicki Minaj Throws Shade At Chrissy Teigen's Butt & Her Response Was Flawless! Then The Barbs Lost Their Minds!/n

In case you were wondering, Chrissy Teigen just won Twitter again!
The Sports Illustrated cover girl is known for her witty sense of humor, and she just stepped things up a notch with this one!
Nicki Minaj tried to throw shade at models like Kate Upton, Nina Adgal, Lily Aldridge, and Chrissy, by posting pics of their booties and writing “acceptable.”
Well, instead of seeing this for the shade that it was, Chrissy turned it into a positive, tweeting the pic, saying: 
I WILL TAKE ACCEPTABLE RT “@NICKIMINAJ: Angelic. Acceptable. Lol http://t.co/LePgAezLK0”

Unfortunately, Nicki’s Barbs just didn’t get it and went on a full Twitter attack, saying NSFW things like:
@chrissyteigen all those dicks you've taken and your still built like a boy.

But of course, Chrissy’s responses were perfect, saying things like:

No one is "dragging" anyone. Can twitter have an age limit?

I don't give one single fuck either way. You kids need the drama then go head.

Ha! Oh, Chrissy! Nicki tried, but you just slayed the Internet! 
In fact, San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick agreed, tweeting at the 28-year-old model:
@chrissyteigen thank you for my entertainment for the night! 😂😂😂
— Colin Kaepernick (@Kaepernick7) July 25, 2014

The funniest part is that Nicki fans didn’t even care to realized that Miz Minaj posted a bootylicious picture of herself, with the caption, “Unacceptable.”
So, obviously the entire thing was all for fun! Though, still a little bit shady of Nicki anyway!
