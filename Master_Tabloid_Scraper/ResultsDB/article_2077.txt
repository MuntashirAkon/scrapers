Mick Jagger Sets Up Fashion Scholarship As Memorial To Late Love L'Wren Scott/n
Mick Jagger has set up a scholarship to London’s Central Saint Martins in memory of late girlfriend L’Wren Scott, who tragically killed herself last year.
The Rolling Stones frontman’s scholarship will award the honors — which covers tuition and a portion of living expenses — to a master’s degree student. Scott had ties to the Central Saint Martins, with a longtime friendship with late course director Louise Wilson.
The institution’s Fabio Piras, who currently serves as the course director, said the school was “very grateful to receive this extremely generous scholarship package.”
