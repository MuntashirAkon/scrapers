Tiger Woods Impersonator Busted For Something Even More Outrageous Than The Real Golfer's Sex Scandal!/n

Talk about taking method acting to a whole new level!
A former Tiger Woods impersonator named Canh Oxelson was arrested and charged with aggravated harassment  after he threatened to make inappropriate pictures and texts from his ex-girlfriend public!
The 42-year-old, who is now the head of college counseling at Horace Mann School in New York, allegedly sent multiple messages to his ex which included nude pictures of her and said "Canâ€™t wait for folks to see this one," and "Good luck loser."
Canh's impression of Tiger circa 2009 earned him a restraining order along with several charges, and it may end up costing him his new job!
Horace Mann spokesperson Jon Elson spoke out about the scandal, saying:
"The Head of School has directed Mr. Oxelson to work from home and refrain from coming to campus until further notice. We take this matter seriously and are reviewing the facts."
For now, Canh and his lawyers are denying all charges and say he's 100% innocent.
In the meantime, he might want to consider hanging up his Nike polo and turning off his phone for good!
