Disney Creating Live Action Cruella de Vil Movie!/n

The character who has never felt anything close to puppy love in her life is set to get her own live action film!
Bad news for PETA, great news for Disney fans!
That's right, Disney recently barked to all of the world that they'll be working on a live action movie about the furaholic Cruella de Vil â€”  news which is awesome in 101 ways!
Although Glenn Close isn't confirmed to reprise her role as the stylish villain in Cruella, she's acting as an executive producer. 
Hmm if not her to play the person with a reputation with canines even worse than Michael Vick, then who?
Well Cruella is a notorious driver and loves smoking cigarettes, so Lindsay Lohan might be a safe choice! 
Or with her love of fur and the taxidermy of little beasts, perhaps Miley Cyrus?
Regardless, with the scribe who adapted Devils Wears Pongo Prada penning the script, looks like we'll have a real Dalmation plantation! And perhaps Meryl Streep can be the one screaming for Jasper and Horace!
CLICK HERE to see who we'd love to play her on Once Upon A Time!
