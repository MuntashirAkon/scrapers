Miranda Cosgrove Is All Grown Up & Showing Skin At The School Of Rock 10 Year Reunion!/n

We remember her as sassy little student, Summer Hathaway, in School Of Rock!
But nowadays, Miranda Cosgrove is all grown up and looking back on her musical schooling while fiercely strolling the red carpet!
The 20-year-old iCarly star attended the film's 10 year reunion screening in Austin, Texas Thursday night where she rocked a black cut-out number with gold button detailing.
It's a far cry from the uniform she wore at Horace Green prep school!
Miranda completed her graduated look with some killer black and tan platform peep-toe sandals, flowing locks, and a pretty pink lip.
Can we get an encore for this stellar fashion performance?!
Ch-ch-check more party pics (below)!
