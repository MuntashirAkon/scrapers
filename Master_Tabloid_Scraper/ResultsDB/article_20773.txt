Taylor Swift: School For The Deaf Disqualified From Winning Concert/n

Because Papa Johns and Chegg don't like their own rules, they've decided to disqualify the Horace Mann School For The Deaf from winning a Taylor Swift concert!
They claim it's because they didn't agree with how the school got their winning votes, and while we agree that it's pretty lame for anyone to do this as a joke, the fact that people rallied to have the school win should be recognized no matter if it started as a mean internet prank!
We're sure they would have loved it â€” and why take that away from them??
Hell, even the Boston Globe asked the school's principal how he felt about it, and he said that he didn't mind the "mean-spirited" reasons behind the votes because his students "love live music," and winning would make them happy.
THAT'S WHAT SHOULD MATTER HERE.
Though, as a consolation prize, the sponsors donated $10,000 a piece to the school's music program, and Cover Girl, American Greetings, and Taylor Swift herself followed suit with $10,000 each. That's $50,000 if you're keeping track!
Then, Taylor decided to give free tickets to the school to see her perform live when she's in town!
Still, we think it's kinda bullshizz they were disqualified in the first place!
