As if the release of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child script isn’t exciting enough, the website Pottermore just announced that J.K. Rowling will be releasing three new eBooks (part of a new short-form series dubbed Pottermore Presents) on Sept. 6!

“Pottermore Presents is intended to supplement the Harry Potter book series with short-form content that is entertaining and thematically curated by the Pottermore editorial team,” Pottermore CEO Susan Jurevics said, via Time.
The three new stories, which will cost around $3 each, will explore everything from the history of Azkaban prison to the Ministry of Magic, there’s even a story about Horace Slughorn.

True to form, Rowling’s titles for her new books are as fun and evocative as ever: Hogwarts: An Incomplete and Unreliable Guide; Short Stories from Hogwarts of Power, Politics and Pesky Poltergeists; and Short Stories from Hogwarts of Heroism, Hardship and Dangerous Hobbies.
According to Pottermore: “Pottermore Presents is a series of bite-sized eBooks that dig deep into the Harry Potter stories, with titbits taken from Pottermore’s archives and original writing from J.K. Rowling. The series offers Harry Potter fans added insights into the stories, settings and characters and were all lovingly curated by Pottermore.”
It’s going to be a good fall…
