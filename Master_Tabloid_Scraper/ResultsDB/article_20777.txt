The nominations for the 2016 Emmy Awards were announced by Gilmore Girls’ Lauren Graham and black-ish’s Anthony Anderson on Thursday (July 14, 2016).

Joined by Bruce Rosenblum, the chairman and CEO of the Television Academy, Graham and Anderson presented this year’s roster of nominees from the Wolf Theater in North Hollywood.
Game of Thrones led the pack with 23 nominations for its sixth season with The Americans, Better Call Saul and Homeland among its list of competitors. The People V. O.J. Simpson tallied right behind GoT with 22 nominations, including a nod for Sarah Paulson. Fargo came in third with 18 nominations followed by Veep, the awards show favorite starring Julia-Louis Dreyfus, with 17 nominations. Other contenders in the comedy category include Aziz Ansari’s Master of None and Tina Fey’s Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt.
Jimmy Kimmel will host this year’s show for the second time after his inaugural gig in 2012.
“I am excited to be hosting the Emmys again,” said Kimmel in a statement. “I have a feeling I’m going to be great.”
