show on Lifetime that followed the behind-the-scenes drama of a Bachelor-ish show? Get on board! Laurie Metcalf, Getting On, The Big Bang Theory and Horace and Pete Yes, Laurie Metcalf is up for THREE Emmys this year. Three. The Good Wife OK.../n
How can the Emmys get it so right and so wrong year after year? Because they're the Emmys. The 2016 Emmy nominations were announced today, Thursday, July 14, by black-ish star Anthony Anderson and Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life's Lauren Graham. There were your shoe-ins—hi, Julia Louis-Dreyfus—and then your very pleasant surprises—hi, Laurie Metcalf—and of course the snubs—hi, Outlander.Without further ado, get angry with us about the snubs—and then get happy or confused by the surprises!SNUBSOrange Is the New BlackThe Netflix series, which has been nominated for 16 Emmys in the past, only received one nomination this year and it was for casting. Uzo Aduba, we still love you.Lady Gaga, American Horror Story: HotelShe got the Golden Globe, but no Emmy love.

Rachel Bloom, Crazy Ex-GirlfriendThe Crazy Ex-Girlfriend co-creator and star made it on everybody's list as a shoe-in…but, well, she wasn't. She got the Golden Globe though and The CW series was nominated for Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics for "Settle for Me."Michael McKean, Better Call SaulSure, Bob Odenkirk and Jonathan Banks and Better Call Saul got nominations, but McKean owns that show just as much as Odenkirk and Banks.Christine Baranski, The Good WifeSeventh time wasn't the charm for Baranski, but she did pick up a nomination for The Big Bang Theory.Julianna Margulies, The Good WifeSay what you will about The Good Wife's final season (we watched it too), but Margulies never rested on her laurels.Jim Parsons, The Big Bang TheoryHas the TV Academy forsaken TV's No. 1 comedy except in the guest acting categories?

Jane Krakowski, Unbreakable Kimmy SchmidtKarkowski is straight up brilliant as Jacqueline White. We know this category was a tough one, but…what gives?American IdolFox's singing competition couldn't get by on swan song nostalgia and was shut out of the reality series race.Full Frontal With Samantha BeeArguably one of the smartest and funniest shows on TV right now, somehow the TV Academy failed to nominate it alongside other Variety Talk Shows. Lame.Christian Slater, Mr. RobotFurther proof winning Golden Globes doesn't guarantee you a nomination.OutlanderWe know it's good stuff. TV Academy, listen to us! The show was shut out of the main acting categories, but the show picked up a nod for costumes and production design.The Late Show With Stephen ColbertEmmy favorite Stephen Colbert was shut out of his race. Growing pains? There's always next year.Cat Deeley, So You Think You Can DanceSigh. She is the best, TV Academy. The best!Krysten Ritter, Jessica JonesThere's always season two to rectify this, but Ritter's performance as the reluctant hero was beyond riveting.

SURPRISESRami Malek, Mr. RobotIt's a good surprise here. There's a new kid on the block!Matthew Rhys, Keri Russell and The AmericansHi TV Academy! What took you so long? So pleased you've come around to recognizing FX's masterful spy drama.Constance Zimmer, UnRealRemember when everybody scoffed at a show on Lifetime that followed the behind-the-scenes drama of a Bachelor-ish show? Get on board!Laurie Metcalf, Getting On, The Big Bang Theory and Horace and PeteYes, Laurie Metcalf is up for THREE Emmys this year. Three.The Good WifeOK, Carrie Preston and Michael J. Fox picked up nominations for guest acting, but the real surprise was Robert and Michelle King were nominated for writing the series finale...which was divisive to say the least.

Kit Harington & Maisie Williams, Game of ThronesGame of Thrones ruled the supporting categories. Lena Headey, Emilia Clarke and Peter Dinklage were obvious, but welcome to the party Jon Snow and Arya Stark!Tatiana Maslany, Orphan BlackTV Academy knows what's up and honored the BBC America star for playing 523 roles (exaggeration).Maura Tierney, The AffairThe Affair's first Emmy nomination—and a much deserved one.RuPaul, RuPaul's Drag RaceCan you imagine what the acceptance speech would be if Ru took home the Emmy for Reality Show Host?Cuba Gooding Jr., The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime StoryWe have to admit we were puzzled when Gooding Jr. put himself into the Lead Actor in a Miniseries or TV Movie category, but it paid off and he nabbed a nomination. But his role was so minimal…Ellie Kemper, Unbreakable Kimmy SchmidtThis is a very good surprise. She was inexplicably absent from last year.Agree? Disagree? Tell us in the comments below!
