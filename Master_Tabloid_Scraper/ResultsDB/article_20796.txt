Horace Grant -- Michael Jordan Crushes LeBron James ... As An Actor (VIDEO)/nDon't hand LeBron James the crown just yet when it comes to NBA stars turned actors -- Bulls legend Horace Grant is riding with his old teammate Michael Jordan until LBJ passes one big test. Horace was at LAX when asked him to grade King James' debut in  "Trainwreck " against Jordan's movie skills. As Ho explained ... for him, MJ still takes the cake until he sees some receipts from LeBron.  But check out the clip, because Horace couldn't stop gushing about Jordan in a bunch of other areas too. You name it, Jordan's the best at it -- although HG did diss him on one topic! God, it's almost like Michael helped this guy win 3 of his 4 NBA rings./n
