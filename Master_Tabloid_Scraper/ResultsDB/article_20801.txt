Signs Of A Killer: New Show Uncovers 'Psycho' Murderer's Monstrous Transformation/n
Everybody remembers Norman Bates, the crazed cross-dressing killer from the Alfred Hitchcock thriller Psycho. But few know about the real-life killer that inspired the classic character — until now.
Ed Gein was a Wisconsin farm hand who robbed graves and fashioned costumes from the bodies of the women he dug up before turning to murdering his own victims.
But Geins proved to be even more twisted than his deranged fictional copycat, stalking his prey before using their remains for his grisly costume designs.

After killing his very first victim, Mary Hogan, Geins’ behavior became even more erratic. The local farmer broke into laughter for no reason, his farmhouse was alarmingly cluttered, and he made many frequent visits to the town’s local hardware store — where his next and final victim, Bernice Worden, worked.
The Shocking Truth features archival material from Alfred Hitchcock, crime scene photos and a new interview with one of the few people still alive who knew Ed Gein, the serial killer behind it all.
Psycho: The Shocking Truth, airs Friday June 9, at 9 p.m. ET/PT.
