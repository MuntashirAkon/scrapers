'Can I Hold Your Breasts?' Heather Accuses PodcastOne Boss Of Sexual Harassment/n
Heather McDonald may be a comedienne, but she doesn’t find PodcastOne exec Norman Pattiz‘s comments funny.
McDonald, 46, accused Pattiz, 73, of sexually harassing her on multiple occasions — and even released audio of his most recent attack.
She explained in her latest “Juicy Scoop” podcast that she had been recording ad spots for an older episode (under PodcastOne) when Pattiz walked into the room. He complimented her ratings, and stuck around while she filmed a spot for a “miracle bra” made out of “memory foam.”
“Can I hold your breasts?” Pattiz asked in-between takes. “Would that help?”

“No!” McDonald awkwardly laughed. “Not memory foam hands.”
“My memory!” he laughed back.
He then left the room, and McDonald left PoadcastOne shortly after.
She told her followers that she had enough of his comments on her outfit choices and jokes about following her into the bathroom. She tried to work from home, but Pattiz would threaten other companies that would host her audio.

She lawyered up, and was finally able to leave as an independent contractor after a lengthy battle.
McDonald was afraid to come forward sooner, as Pattiz claimed to have a gun in the office, but was inspired by Gretchen Carlson‘s suit against Roger Ailes. She also claimed she didn’t want to be perceived as “hard to work with” after her feud with Chelsea Handler went public.
PodcastOne has already removed all traces of McDonald from their website, and has not released a statement yet.
