Diane Kruger & Joshua Jackson Call It Quits On Their 10-Year Relationship/n
Diane Kruger and her longtime boyfriend, Joshua Jackson, have called it quits on their 10-year relationship.
“Diane Kruger and Josh Jackson have decided to separate and remain friends,” reps for the couple told People.
However, as Radar reported last December, Kruger was spotted “wildly making out” with her Sky costar at a bar in New York City.
“They were laughing and having fun and then she just literally got out of her chair and straddled him and we were all like, ‘what the hell,'” one shocked onlooker said. “They were all over each other. She was a lot more aggressive than him.”

Perhaps not so coincidentally, Kruger, 39, and her 37-year-old ex-boyfriend Jackson haven’t been spotted out together since February.
On April 14, the actress insisted in an interview that “it’s never too late” for another chance at love, a possible nod to the cheating scandal and her tryst with Reedus. /n
