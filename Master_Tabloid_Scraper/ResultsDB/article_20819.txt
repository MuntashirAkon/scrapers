Ariel chose a skin-tight latex MESHKI black dress with red Tamara Melon pumps, which was MEH but typical dress for the Modern Family actress. CGM picked a more timeless old Hollywood look, pairing her ankle-length black dress with cute curls and a poppin' crimson lip.
Zendaya was clearly the standout in a sparkled ombré suit. YAS girl!
