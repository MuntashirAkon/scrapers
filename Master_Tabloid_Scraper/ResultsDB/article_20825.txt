Diane Kruger doesn’t have any bad blood with her boyfriends — past or present.

Following her best actress win at the 70th annual Cannes Film Festival, ex-boyfriend Joshua Jackson quickly took to social media to congratulate the 40-year-old on the big honor. Despite splitting just 10 months ago after more than a decade together, Jackson, 38, couldn’t help but to gush about Kruger.
“Yes she Cannes,” he wrote on Instagram. “Having witnessed the integrity and dedication that you bring to every job, I’m over the moon to see you getting the recognition you deserve. Only question is what took ’em so long! CONGRATULATIONS, Josh.”
