Kaley Cuoco may be a fan of The Bachelor, but she’ll never be dating like one of its contestants.

During her latest appearance on Jimmy Fallon’s lat night talk show, the Big Bang Theory star revealed she had gone on a date with boyfriend Karl Cook that was more of an extreme date on The Bachelor than a romantic outing. While vacationing in New Zealand with family late last year, the two decided to go on something called a “canyon swing.”
However, the swing was anything but a gentle, breezy ride.

“I felt like I was on The Bachelor,” Cuoco recalled. “‘Can you jump off with him? This is the next step in your relationship.’ I’m like, ‘Am I gonna get the rose out of this?'”
“It’s a bungee jump and if my boyfriend calls it a swing one more time, I swear I’m going to kill him,” she continued. “You dangle and you hope that you’re going to see your family again.”
So, how did she feel after the date?
“It was horrible,” she quipped. “I got the rose.”
