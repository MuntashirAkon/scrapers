Nick Viall may have been eliminated from Dancing with the Stars, but he still has big plans for his future.

Despite receiving two nines and two eights from judges for his Argentine tango with partner Peta Murgatroyd, the Bachelor alum was axed from the dancing competition on Monday night (May 1, 2017). Shaking off the loss, the 36-year-old was still all smiles with fiancée Vanessa Grimaldi during a cast after-party at Los Angeles’ Mixology 101.
The bash was attended by remaining cast members Simone Biles, Bonner Bolton, Sharna Burgess, Rashad Jennings, Emma Slater, Normani Kordei, and Val Chmerkovskiy.
“What an amazing experience!! Sad to see it end,” he wrote on his Instagram following his elimination. “@petamurgatroyd thanks for being such an amazing partner!”

The husband-to-be also told E! News he plans to use his free time to expanding his grooming line and spending more time with his fiancée. “Vanessa and I, we’re going to keep doing our thing,” he said. “Dancing’s over, that’s a bummer, but I’m really looking forward to the future and definitely spending more time with the business and Vanessa.”
Niall added fellow Bachelor Chris Soules’ recent car crash was a “terrible situation,” saying, “Obviously more than anything my heart goes out to the person who passed away and their family and I’m just praying for everyone involved.”
