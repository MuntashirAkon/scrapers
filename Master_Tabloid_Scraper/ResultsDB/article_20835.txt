Fans of Kaley Cuoco were put on high alert on Wednesday (Feb. 22, 2017) when she shared an Instagram post in which she was wearing a sizable rock on her ring finger.

Cuoco called out her boyfriend Karl Cook in the caption of the cute Boomerang featuring her new toddler friend below.
“Look out @mrtankcook … there’s another man in my life!” wrote the Big Bang Theory actress.
When Cuoco’s followers noticed what appeared to be an engagement ring on her finger, she edited the caption to clarify that the ring was only a prop for her Big Bang character Penny.
“Once again NOT my engagement ring people,” she added. “PENNY IS MARRIED.”



Look out @mrtankcook … there’s another man in my life! 👼🏼 (once again NOT my engagement ring people. PENNY IS MARRIED! 💍👄)

On the show, Cuoco’s character Penny is married to Leonard, who is played by Cuoco’s real-life ex, Johnny Galecki. Cook and Cuoco have been together since last spring following her divorce from Ryan Sweeting. Things between her and Cook appear to be going well given that they endured their first time shopping for furniture together.



Thrilled to announce @mrtankcook and I are still happy after our first time shopping for furniture together 😂 phew! 💖
