Ariel Winter joined in on this year’s red carpet trend of dresses with hip-high slits at the Vanity Fair and L’Oreal Paris Toast to Young Hollywood event on Tuesday, Feb. 21.

Winter put her best leg forward in a sexy black skirt by the House of CB over a bodysuit embellished with a cutout on the abdomen and a tie at the waist. Beyond the hip, a delicate, sheer fabric draped to the floor over her strappy stilettos. In signature Ariel Winter fashion, the back of the dress was see-through and flaunted her bottom, which she recently showed off in a bikini photo on Valentine’s Day.
