Norman Lear, Who Created Bigoted Archie Bunker, Is Boycotting His Kennedy Center Honors Award Because of President Trump
/n
Norman Lear, the 95-year-old TV legend who created the bigoted Archie Bunker for 1970s sitcom All in the Family, is boycotting the Kennedy Center Honors – rather than receive the lifetime achievement award from President Donald Trump.
The New York Times reports that Lear will be one of the few honorees to snub the prestigious honor, which takes place every year in Washington, D.C. and is usually a rare moment of bipartisan togetherness.
Lear has been an outspoken critic of Trump, telling The Daily Beast that “Archie Bunker was far wiser of heart” than the president and that “Donald Trump is a thorough fool.”

The 40th Annual Kennedy Center Honors will air Dec. 26 on CBS.
