Everything you know about The Walking Dead's Daryl Dixon is a lie. Well, not entirely true, but Norman Reedus revealed his character was supposed to have a very different mode of transportation instead of his signature motorcycle: a horse."I saw it written and I'm kind of afraid of horses, with their big eyeballs and they can smell your fear and all that stuff" Reedus told Conan O'Brien when the host asked if it was true that he nixed the horse.But it wasn't just the fear that had him ask for the change to the now iconic motorcycle. Reedus previously had horse-riding experience on screen in a movie with Robert Redford. He was supposed to have an entrance on a horse and spout some lines, but he had difficulty controlling the horse and keeping it on mark.
