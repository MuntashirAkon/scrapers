Never say Norman Reedus doesn't have a sense of humor. After all, he was bitten by a fan and lived to tell the tale and The Walking Dead star appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live in a new sketch as Daryl Dixon taking on one of the most annoying things in while: hoverboards. Yeah, those things that keep catching on fire."What the hell is this?" he says as Daryl in the filmed sketch where he finds a locked car full of hoverboards. "Two-wheel self-balancing electric scooter? Futuristic funky personal transport? What the fâ€”k?"As Jimmy Kimmel explained, this is "from next week's episode" where The Walking Dead is getting updated to be more modern. Even in the zombie apocalypse those things are a nuisance.
