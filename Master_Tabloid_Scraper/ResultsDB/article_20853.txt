Norman Reedus channeled Daryl Dixon at the The Walking Dead season 6 fan premiere in New York City on Friday with a spectacular entrance.He didn't fire any crossbows at unsuspecting squirrels...or walkers, but the actor rode through the stadium on a motorcycle, wearing a tux, all the way up the stage. Talk about making fans thirsty!The event took place at Madison Square Garden. Reedus, an avid biker, was joined by a slew past, present and upcoming stars from the hit AMC zombie show, including Andrew Lincoln (Rick), Danai Gurira (Michonne), Lauren Cohan (Maggie), Steven Yeun (her husband Glenn), Emily Kinney (her sister Beth), and Tom Payne, who plays a new character nicknamed Jesus.

Michael Cudlitz (Abraham), made it a Scottish affair, arriving in a kilt. He got cozy on the red carpet with co-star and pal Josh McDermitt, proving that yes, he really is helpless against the seductive power of Eugene's mullet.Cudlitz attended the premiere with his wife, Rachel. The actor was also seen with co-star Alanna Masterson, who showcased her baby bump in a green and gray printed mini dress. She is pregnant with her and boyfriend Brick Stowell's first child.Meanwhile, an actress who made her debut last season, appeared very happy to be there!The Walking Dead returns to AMC on Sunday at 9/8c. Check out more photos from the red carpet premiere.Remember when Norman Reedus and Steven Yeun were on The Soup?
