Kylie Jenner’s makeup company, Kylie Cosmetics, is in hot water again.

The lip kit queen is getting blasted with hate after revealing the names of her five matte blushes. Ranging in colors from fuchsia to pale pink, the new line of products, which goes on sale this Friday (March 24, 2017), features cheeky and titillating monikers like “X-Rated” and “Hot and Bothered.”
However, fans were not pleased when Jenner unveiled a blush named “Barely Legal” and another one dubbed “Virginity.” Taking to Twitter, many accused the 19-year-old of blatantly using sex to sell.

Now I do love @KylieJenner but I do find labeling something”Barely Legal” inappropriate especially when the theme is so sexual. pic.twitter.com/vkVQ3Cfue5

Seriously @KylieJenner, choose better names for your products. You have 12+ year old fans! “Barely Legal” “Virginity” 🙄

Kylie naming her blush “barely legal” makes me uncomfortable on so many levels.

I can’t be the only one who thinks Kylie’s blush names are kinda cringey

Others took the liberty to using the “Barely Legal” name to poke fun at Jenner’s relationship with her 27-year-old boyfriend, Tyga, whom she started dating when she was still underage.

However, having somewhat of a “sex scandal” in the makeup community is actually nothing new. In 2015, Kat Von D had to defend her choice in naming a lipstick from her popular cosmetics line “Underage Red.” At the time, the tattoo artist claimed it was an attempt at a “feminine rebellion.”
“It has NEVER been a goal of mine to inspire sexualization of any sort, let alone promote a destructive lifestyle,” she wrote in a lengthy Facebook post. “Anyone who knows or follows me, is very aware of my personal lifestyle choices which include celibacy, sobriety, conscious living and [above feminism], human rights. Although, I would never force my views and opinions onto others, I most definitely find it offensive being accused of the opposite.”
Previously, Jenner received flack for allegedly stealing another makeup brand’s ideas, repackaging old lip kit colors, having faulty brushes, and shipping out empty boxes in lieu of actual product.
