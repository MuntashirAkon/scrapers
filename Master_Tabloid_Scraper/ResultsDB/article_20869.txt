Chris Christie -- 'He's Wrong' to Root for Cowboys ... Says NJ Mayor/nThe Mayor of Bergenfield, New Jersey is calling out Chris Christie -- telling TMZ Sports the Governor is  "wrong " for jumping on the Dallas Cowboys bandwagon.Of course, Christie has been under fire from all sorts of Jerseyans for bear-hugging Jerry Jones in the owner's box at Cowboys Stadium yesterday when when Dallas solidified their lead over the Detroit Lions. Mayor Norman Schmelz says he loves Christie and thinks he's a great governor ...  "but when it comes to football, he's wrong. "We also spoke with ex-NFL star Jon Runyan -- a former U.S. Congressman from NJ -- who says Christie's allegiance to Dallas is  "unfortunate " ... especially with so many people from Jersey being fans of the Eagles, Giants and Jets.  "Truly, I get why people are upset. But I love his passion for the game. It's unfortunate he's rooting for [the Eagles'] arch rival. "Though Runyan says he does respect the fact that Christie  "doesn't let anyone tell him what he can or can't do. "As for Mayor Schmelz ... he tells us there's one way for Chris to get out of his doghouse --  "If he can get Bergenfield enough state aid to lower our tax burden here locally, I'll become a Cowboy's fan as well.
