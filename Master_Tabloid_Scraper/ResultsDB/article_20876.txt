Norman Reedus -- Hints that Glen on 'Walking Dead' is Dead /nNorman Reedus did not say for sure if Glen on  "Walking Dead " is toast, but he sure hinted it was so. We got Norman at LAX Saturday and our photog initially knew better than to ask straight up if Glen was dead. Â Instead he asked if Glen was like Jon Snow, who could actually still be alive in some form on  "Game of Thrones. " Norman gives an interesting answer, and then our photog can't help but ask the question he initially resisted asking./n
