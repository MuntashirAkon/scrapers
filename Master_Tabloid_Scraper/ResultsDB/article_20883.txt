Sexless Marriage! Kim Kardashian & Kanye West Back In Separate Beds/n
Kim Kardashian and Kanye West are no longer sleeping in the same bed, RadarOnline.com can reveal.
The news comes as a blow after they called off a potential divorce earlier this summer, and had been doing couple’s therapy.
An insider told Radar: “Kim booted Kanye to the spare room blaming his snoring, but there’s way more to it than that.”

“The truth is that they’ve lost that spark and never recovered it. Kim’s telling people she doesn’t have the time or energy to keep the spark alive in the bedroom anymore with two young kids and another on the way.
“She’s basically settled for a sexless marriage, while Kanye mopes around hoping for a miracle.”
Kim, 36, stood by her 40-year-old husband when he went through a very public meltdown late last year, but the marriage never seemed to recover.
