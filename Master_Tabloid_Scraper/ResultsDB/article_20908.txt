Ashlee wanted to ask Caitlyn about the star's continued support of Donald Trump, and how anti-transgender rights the GOP president has been, and Miz Jenner didn't take things very well.
She was on the defensive from the very start, and it's really a sight to see to watch the entire confrontation go down (below): 

WOW!!

Caitlyn claims she's not down with Trump any more — even though she still wears his hats in public — but she obviously doesn't have much support in the transgender community, either.
