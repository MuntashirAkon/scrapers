The opening credits of American Horror Story have become an iconic part of the series. Last year’s installment, Roanoke, lost the jittery sequence for the meta-season. But, thankfully, they’re back for this fall’s AHS: Cult.
And the new opening sequence has some familiar faces — namely Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. Both of the politicians’ faces are seen on masks in the credits. Co-creator Ryan Murphy has said that the season was influenced by the election and begins after that fateful night in November 2016.

A couple things to note: the score has been given a military-esque spin and only five of the main actors are listed in the credits: Sarah Paulson, Evan Peters, Cheyenne Jackson, Billie Lourd, and Alison Pill. The season also features Billy Eichner, Colton Haynes, Adina Howard, Leslie Grossman and Chaz Bono.
