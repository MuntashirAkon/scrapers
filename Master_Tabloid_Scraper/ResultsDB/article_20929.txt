Trump’s tweet was first public comment on Bannon’s ousting, which he teased earlier in the week.
“We’ll see what happens with Mr. Bannon,” the President said at a Tuesday press conference where he addressed last weekend’s violence at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va.

Bannon revealed to the Weekly Standard following his departure that he will resume his duty as executive chairman of right-wing news website Breitbart, where he said he would “crush the opposition.”
“The Trump presidency that we fought for, and won, is over,” Bannon said in the interview. “We still have a huge movement, and we will make something of this Trump presidency. But that presidency is over. It’ll be something else.
“There’ll be all kinds of fights, and there’ll be good days and bad days, but that presidency is over,” he added.
