Top 9 Gas Grills





Grilling season is here! The popular and economical Weber Spirit family of gas grills adds a more fully featured E-330 model to the lineup in 2016. The new Spirit E-330 grill includes a handy 12,000 BTU side burner for cooking accompaniments and a 7,500 Sear Station Burner that boots heat to quickly sear foods, then turns off for regular grilling.
Other features include long-lasting porcelain-enameled cooking grates and porcelain-enameled Flavorizer Bars. Positioned above the burner tubes and below the grates, these V-shaped Bars shield burner tubes from port-clogging debris. They also serve to catch and vaporize food drippings, creating the smoke that flavors food. The Spirit E-330 LP gas grill carries a 10-year warranty on the porcelain-enameled lid and burner tubes and a 5-year warranty on grates and Flavorizer Bars. Not available in natural gas.

AMAZON PRIME DEAL TODAY ONLY: Char-Broil The Big Easy TRU-Infrared Oil-Less Turkey Fryer Bundle with 2 Leg Racks and Kabob Set, now 35% off! The Char-Broil Big Easy TRU-Infrared Oil-less Turkey Fryer is the stress-free way to fry your turkey. With no hot cooking oil to purchase, splatter, or dispose of, the Char-Broil Big Easy gives you a delicious, safe, and simple alternative to oil-fried turkey. The Big Easy uses infrared heat to cook a turkey from start to finish just as quickly as oil-frying – and, of course, food cooked without oil is healthier, too! The meat is always cooked evenly inside of a double-wall cylindrical cooking chamber, powered by a fully enclosed propane burner: Char-Broil’s patented Heat Wave infrared technology prevents flare-ups, eliminates hot and cold spots, and delivers juicy, crisp, and flavorful results every time.
Safely cook a turkey (up to 16 lbs.) or chicken in about 8 to 10 minutes per pound – there’s no waiting for the oil to heat up. Roasts and most other large cuts of meat cook for slightly longer. You can prepare your bird or meat with the same injectable marinade you already use, or you can use seasoned rubs on the outside – which is not an option with traditional fryers. Experience the flavor when infrared heat circles the cooker to penetrate the meat evenly and seal in juices. The result is a bird that’s moist on the inside and crispy on the outside without the risk, hassle or added fat and calories of oil.
