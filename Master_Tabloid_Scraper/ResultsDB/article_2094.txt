We didn’t know angels could swim!

Alessandra Ambrosio was spotted enjoying the sand and surf with her family today (July 1, 2016) while on vacation in Ibiza.
Onlookers glimpsed the world-famous supermodel’s famous figure as she, her businessman husband Jamie Mazur, and her kids Anja Louise and Noah Phoenix relaxed and swam in the Mediterranean.
Ambrosio wore a strapless pattern bikini for the excursion, and afterward enjoyed the day in a sleeveless kaftan and straw sunhat.
Not long after their beach outing, the proud mama shared a photo of herself and her four-year-old son sporting some color.
