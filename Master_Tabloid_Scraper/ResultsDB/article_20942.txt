Late-Night Hosts Slam Donald Trump Over Transgender Military Ban Plans/n
As for the "tremendous medical costs" Trump mentioned? "It's estimated that healthcare for transgender personnel would add between $2.4 million and $8.4 million per year to the military's healthcare budget. To put that number in perspective, the military spends five times as much on Viagraâ€”and if your erection lasts for more than four hours, that's too bad, because you're stuck on a submarine for the next six months. Why so much Viagra? Is that why they don't use bayonets anymore? They just put an edge on that thing? Just sharpen that thing up to a mirror polish? Clearly, it's not about the money or the military, because the Pentagon seems to be unaware that Trump has decided to bar transgender people from the military," he added.
