LeBron James Trolls Donald Trump with 'MAGA'-Like Hat During DJ Sesh/nLeBron James found a way to troll President Trump with his own catchphrase by rocking a hat with a similar sentiment ... and he did it while DJing live at a club. LeBron grabbed dinner Saturday night with his wife, Savannah, at Komodo in Miami., after which he joined the restaurant's owner, David Grutman and Kim K pal Jonathan Cheban﻿, for some partying in their upstairs lounge. We're told LeBron was put at the helm of the turntables and DJ'd for 2 hours straight -- all while sporting a red hat that said ...  "Strive for Greatness " ... which looks an awful lot like Trump's  "MAGA " hat. Bron didn't address Trump during his DJ set, but the timing seems like anything but a coincidence considering the violent protests in Charlottesville the same day ...and his longtime stance as an anti-Trump guy. Plus ... there's this:   It's sad what's going on in Charlottesville. Is this the direction our country is heading? Make America Great Again huh?! He said that🤦🏾‍♂️ — LeBron James (@KingJames) August 12, 2017  LeBron ... making not-so-subtle shots great again. /n
