Judge Jeanine Pirro Mum on Trump, But Whistles to Hail a Cab/nJudge Jeanine Pirro has a mean wolf whistle that can stop traffic. We got the FNC host in rainy NYC Tuesday and she impressed our photog by blowing hard to get a cab. As proud and loud as she was over hailing a taxi, she was radio silent when it came to Donald Trump's flip-flop over his  "condemnation " of white supremacists and neo-Nazis. Pirro has been a staunch Trump supporter -- unflinching in her loyalty -- but Trump's rant on Tuesday may have pushed even her over the line./n
