President Trump Eclipses President Obama ... in Corny Retweets/nPresident Trump is a sucker ... for 3-day-old Twitter memes ... especially ones that proclaim him to have somehow eclipsed President Obama. Early Thursday morning, as POTUS scanned his social media, he couldn't resist retweeting a pic showing 45 eclipsing 44 with the caption,  "The best eclipse ever. " Truth is ... the opposite image, in support of Obama, made the Internet rounds too. Again ... THREE days ago. Bottom line:- Absurd use of the President's time? Check- Late jab? Check- Ridiculously petty? Check  Yeah. Someone definitely shoulda worn more appropriate eyewear during the actual eclipse./n
