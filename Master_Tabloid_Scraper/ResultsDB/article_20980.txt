 What Feud? Jill & Jessa Post Pic Of Double Date, Squashing Rumors Of Tension Between.../n
Disaster averted?
After weeks of reports detailing brewing tension between Jill and Jessa Duggar, the sisters and their husbands looked like they couldn’t be happier while enjoying a dinner double date with their spouses on Monday.
Jill posted an image of the get-together to her Instagram page, in which she’s all smiles with her husband Derick Dillard, and Jessa and her husband Ben Seewald. She wrote: “@jessaseewald and @ben_seewald are here for dinner!
“So fun to hang out with our siblings! #familydinner #19kids #beansandcornbread.”

The couples later went to a Christmas-themed recital at the home of their parents, Michelle and Jim Bob.

Jill wrote, “I [love] christmas time!” alongside an image of the activities at the Arkansas home base of the reality TV clan.
As RadarOnline.com previously reported, the sisters, both newlyweds, had dropped a number of subtle clues via social media that there might be a bit of strain between them.
While Jill, expecting her first child with Dillard, follows most of her relatives, she was not following Jessa and Seewald. In addition, while Jill’s husband does follow Ben and Jessa, neither of them follow him, in turn.

Jessa herself admitted that things in the expansive family are not always hunky dory, telling Penn Live earlier this year that the public always approaches her and her relatives with the false idea that the Duggars always get along swimmingly.
“People always ask us ‘Do you have any problems? Do you all ever fight? Are you normal?’” Jessa said. “Yes, we are.” /n
