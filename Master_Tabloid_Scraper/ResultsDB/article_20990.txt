As you surely know, at the end of October news broke of the twosome's romance — and since then the ginger royal has asked the media to stop harassing Miz Markle and her loved ones. Poor thing!
However, it seems like Meg is doing just fine these days as her IG post was pretty uplifting! Perhaps Markle is getting more accustomed to the attention that goes along with being a royal's main squeeze? *shrugs*
Despite the unwanted media attention, the Horrible Bosses actress' relationship with Harry is certainly progressing forward. Reportedly, Meghan's met BOTH Prince Charles and Prince William. With the holidays right around the corner, we'll definitely be keeping our eyes peeled for any romantic outings these two take!
Stay tuned!
