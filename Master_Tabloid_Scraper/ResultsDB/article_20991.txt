Drake Just Got A Date With A Sports Reporter — By Wearing A Shirt With Her Face On It!/n

Note to other men out there: this will NOT work for you. Because you are not Drake.
The Canadian rapper once again sat courtside to watch his beloved Toronto Raptors play on Wednesday night, but he wasn't wearing a jersey of his favorite player.
Nope, that's a pic of Doris Burke, a 50-year-old NBA sideline reporter for ESPN and ABC, with the words "WOMAN CRUSH EVERYDAY" stenciled underneath.

The 6 God used the opportunity of getting the mic for Drake Night to make his feelings clear.
When ESPN's Israel Gutierrez asked about the shirt, Drake said on camera: 

"My inspiration is Doris, I think she is a stunning woman, incredible at what she does. I wish she was here tonight, but I'm sending all my love to her. I don't know what camera to look at, but blowing a lot of kisses…
Dinner at my house any time. As long as she comes alone."

Dang, girl! Get it!
Actually, that's exactly what Doris might do! She tweeted after the game:

@Drake dinner is on ❤️️

Wow. Drake hotness or not, we cannot believe that half court shot went in! LOLz!
Of course, he has enough game to create an opening before making such a big pass. Doris told The Cut back in June that Drake had flirted with her before:

"Drake turned around — my seat at Game 6 was right behind him — makes a heart shape [with his hands], and points at me. I'm looking around behind me to see who's there, turn back to him, and then he points and he does it again. I texted my daughter and said, ‘You need to know Drake just did this to me.'"
Doris' daughter Sarah is 23 btw — so we have no doubt she's impressed!
Would this move work on YOU??
