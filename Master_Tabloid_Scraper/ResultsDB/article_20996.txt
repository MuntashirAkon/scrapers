The cast and crew of La La Land have at least a dozen things to celebrate after the Broadcast Film Critics Association announced their nominees for the 22nd Annual Critics’ Choice Awards.

The film received 12 nominations, including a nod for Best Picture, two nods for Ryan Gosling — one for Best Director and Best Actor, and one for Emma Stone in the Best Actress category. Moonlight, which received early praise at the Gotham Awards and the Film Independent Spirit Awards, and Arrival both scored ten nominations each and are in contention for Best Picture along with La La Land. 
There’s a recurring theme of double nominations this year: Denzel Washington received two nominations for Fences as an actor and director, Andrew Garfield is up for two acting awards for his work in Hacksaw Ridge, as is Ryan Reynolds for Deadpool.
“This year’s nominees showcase the best that Hollywood has to offer, spanning a wide array of genres, subject matters, time periods, and more,” said BFCA President Joey Berlin. “We hope that they will serve as a roadmap for viewers, offering guidance for movie lovers and ticket buyers as we launch this awards season. We are so thrilled to be able to recognize these incomparable artists and look forward to bringing them together for an unforgettable evening!”
The Critics’ Choice Awards, hosted by T.J. Miller, will broadcast live on A&E on Dec. 11, 2016, at 8 p.m. EST. See the full list of nominees below.
