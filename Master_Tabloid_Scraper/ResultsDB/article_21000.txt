Legendary WWE wrestler Chyna passed away at 46 years old as a result of a speculated drug overdose.

Chyna, whose real name is Joanie Laurer, was last known to be at her apartment in Redondo Beach, CA. Law enforcement tells TMZ that she had not been seen or heard from for days before a friend went to check on her late Wednesday evening (Apr. 20). The friend found Chyna unresponsive in her bedroom and called 911.
The scene is being investigated as an overdose, mainly due to the wrestler’s history with drugs. Officials say that there were prescription pill bottles found in her home, but none of them were illegal.

Chyna was one of the original members of D-Generation X and was the first female to enter the Royal Rumble. She posed for Playboy, appeared on The Surreal Life in 2005, and released six pornographic films between 2004 and 2013. Chyna addressed her addiction to drugs during her stint on Celebrity Rehab back in 2008.
Update — Apr. 21, 2:51 p.m. ET:
Police officials are led to believe that there was no foul play intended in Chyna’s death given that no suicide note was left in her home. TMZ reports that the former wrestler had been deceased for at least a “day or two” when her friend found her body.
The bottles of prescription pills left on the property were not emptied and were described to TMZ as “nothing out of the ordinary”.
