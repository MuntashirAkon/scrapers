Your Pet Can Be Part of Doris Day’s 95th Birthday Celebration/n
An avid animal lover and advocate, legendary actress Doris Day has one wish for her 95th birthday (and it’s not her 93rd birthday, as she had initially thought!).
The star wants to see you with your cuddly, adorable, precious pets! All you have to do is post a photo or video of you with your furry friend on any (or all) social media networks with the hashtag #DorisBirthdayWish and tag the Doris Day Animal Foundation (DDAF) with the tag @ddaf_org.
After looking over all the sweet submissions, Day and her foundation will choose 95 photos/videos to be turned into a digital birthday card, which will be presented to Day for her 93rd birthday, on April 3, and featured on the DDAF website and right here on People.com.
“While I am just learning what a ‘hashtag’ means, I can’t wait to see you all share your love for animals on social media,” Day said about the campaign. “What a fun way to get new generations involved in this cause, and I’ll be watching so be clever!” 
You heard it from the Hollywood icon herself: be clever, be cute and be sure to share pictures of you and your pets so they have a chance to find online stardom and make the #DorisBirthdayWish come true.
