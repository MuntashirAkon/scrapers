Uh, hey, Mary-Louise Parker. Hate to do this to you, but...Frodo called and he wants his travel muumuu back! Seriously, friend, what's going on? Hitting The Late Show With David Letterman dressed like a pantless Hobbit is simply unacceptable.We're not sure how you do things in Middle Earth, but in New York City, and on network television, a fatigue-green toga paired with heels the color of Elijah Wood's icy eyes doesn't fly. Those colors don't blend, and they're making your skin look pasty instead of milky.Also, your shoes are suede-y, but your dress is some kind of potato sack material? That is a major clash, lady! Next time you journey from your premium cable nook to the national stage, think more Liv Tyler's Elven princess than Bilbo Baggins, 'K?If you could wave Gandalf's staff, how would you fix MLP's outfit?
