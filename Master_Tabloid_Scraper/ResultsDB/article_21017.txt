Everybody loved Doris Roberts—including pop phenomenon Lady Gaga. After the acclaimed star of Everybody Loves Raymond passed away at 90 years old on Sunday, legions of stars shared their condolences for the loss of the legend. Many celebrities, like her co-stars Ray Romano and Patricia Heaton, were known to have shared special relationships with Roberts both on and off the screen, but this famous fan may come as a surprise. During an interview with the sitcom's creator, Phil Rosenthal, he recollected the final time he was with his beloved colleague and the intriguing star they met. "The last time I saw her, my wife and I took her to see Lady Gaga and Tony Bennett at the Hollywood Bowl," he described to The Hollywood Reporter. "We had a lovely time and we went backstage and we met Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga, and Lady Gaga gushed all over."

"She couldn't believe she was meeting Doris. She loved Doris," Rosenthal continued. "She watched the show and was a fan and that was something, because here's somebody that you wouldn't expect to be an Everybody Loves Raymond fan or a Marie Barone fan."After her death, her castmate Romano echoed what many family members, friends and fans like Gaga celebrated about the star. "Doris Roberts had an energy and a spirit that amazed me. She never stopped," Romano said in a statement to E! News. "Whether working professionally or with her many charities, or just nurturing and mentoring a green young comic trying to make it as an actor, she did everything with such a grand love for life and people and I will miss her dearly."
