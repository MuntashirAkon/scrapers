Mary-Louise Parker insists she did not hurl a derogatory gay slur at a New York antique shop owner.While a rep for the Weeds star has confirmed to E! News that the actress did go to the Saugerties, N.Y., establishment on Jan. 2 with a friend, the story attributed to the National Enquirer claiming the actress used the word "f-g" and threatened physical harm against the proprietor, Daniel Seldin, is simply untrue.According to the rep, an argument involving money owed to Parker's friend did take place, but Parker herself was not involved in the spat.

Seldin reportedly filed an incident report in which he claims Parker not only used the slur, but that she also remarked, "Do you want to wake up tomorrow? I'll make one phone call."Meanwhile, the rep added that Parker not only left the establishment as things began to get heated between her friend and the owner, but she is simply not the kind of person to even use the word she is accused of spewing.
