Hank was the breakout character from the biggest blockbuster of 2016. Thirteen years passed between the releases of Finding Nemo and Finding Dory, and now, audiences are hoping that Disney•Pixar will give Hank a standalone film. It's not an impossibility, either. "I've spent eight years with fish. I really don't need to spend another four," Andrew Stanton, director of both films, recently told E! News in an exclusive interview. "I'm hoping somebody else will pick up the mantle and run with it. Everybody wants Finding Hank—everybody I talk to! So, we'll see."In the meantime, fans can celebrate World Septopus Day before Finding Dory's home release.
