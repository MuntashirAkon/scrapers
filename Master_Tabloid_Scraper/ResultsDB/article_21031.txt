Bruce Jenner Faces Wrongful Death Suit By Victim's Stepchildren/nThe stepchildren of the woman who was killed in the Bruce Jenner car crash are gearing up for a wrongful death lawsuit, TMZ has learned, and what's especially interesting is that we're told they had virtually no relationship with their stepmom. Kim Howe was driving her Lexus on Pacific Coast Highway on February 7th when Bruce slammed into her, sending her car careening into the lane of oncoming traffic where a Hummer demolished her car. Howe has no direct relatives. Her husband died in 2003, and it appears her parents are deceased as well as other immediate blood relatives. Kim does have 2 grown stepkids, neither of whom live in California. We spoke with people who were extremely close to Kim who tell us she had  "virtually no relationship " with either stepchild. Nonetheless, were told both stepchildren have lawyered up, because they're the only remaining people who have a legal right to file a wrongful death lawsuit. In California, stepchildren have legal standing to sue, even if they were estranged from the stepparent. Sources tell us, the lawyer for one of the stepchildren has already asked his client to find as many pictures and other evidence showing some relationship between himself and Kim ... presumably to help establish damages in the lawsuit. One thing we know ... the stepchildren will not inherit Kim's property. We're told she has a trust with millions in assets that are earmarked for charity. And there's a will with a modest amount -- $55k -- that also benefits various animal charities, including, PETA, Lange Foundation, PAWS (Performing Animal Welfare Society), Doris Day Animal League and The Elephant Sanctuary of Tennessee./n
