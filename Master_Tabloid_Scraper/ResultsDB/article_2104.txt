We all know what happens when people get too competitive at the ballet: They Black Swan-out and end up having lesbian fantasies about their co-star before committing suicide on stage for reasons that the director never really explains.Which is why we hesitate to judge in this three-way fashion face-off from last night's American Ballet Theatre opening celebration in New York. Let's do this, before we start seeing black feathers pop out of our skin.First up: Mary-Louise Parker, who wore this custom Anne Klein stunner—correctly—to the event. Low-key makeup, lower cleavage, simple jewels? Right on.

Onward to the big gun: Christian Siriano, who will burn all of you bitches with a single stare of disdain. Who was he wearing? Does it matter when he's Christian Siriano, golden child of fashion and wearer of a shiny dijon-colored shirt that only he, Christian Siriano, can pull off?Finally, here comes Solange Knowles in top-to-toe Dolce & Gabbana paired with a Diane von Furstenberg clutch. We have no quibble with it, even though we might've liked a less showy lip, which competes with the dress. It's a tough call, but we give this one to Parker. What about you? Which look do you think rocked the ballet best?
