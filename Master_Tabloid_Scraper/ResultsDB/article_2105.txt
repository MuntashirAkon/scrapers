While we're getting over the bombshell release of the Demi Moore 911 call, there's another related story that's been making the rounds today.Namely, according to reports, that producers of Lovelace, the Linda Lovelace biopic starring Amanda Seyfried currently shooting in L.A., are in talks with Mary-Louise Parker about subbing for Demi Moore in the role of feminist icon Gloria Steinem.

Malin Ackerman subsequently took over the part.â€”Reporting by Sharareh Drury
