ABC Accused Of Stiffing 'General Hospital' Creators /n "General Hospital " is one of the longest running daytime soaps in the history of television ... and the children of the couple who created the show claim they've been screwed out of a major part of their cut. TMZ has obtained a lawsuit filed by the estate of Frank and Doris Hursley -- the couple who created the show back in 1963. According to the lawsuit, the Hursley's daughters claim their parents struck a deal with ABC way back when ... to reap 10% of all profits from the syndication of the show ... but ABC hasn't honored the deal. The daughters allege ABC has cooked the books for years -- and has failed to pay the full amount owed to the creators. The Hursley children do not specify how much money they believe ABC owes -- but they want a judge to force ABC to open up its books to an audit ASAP./n
