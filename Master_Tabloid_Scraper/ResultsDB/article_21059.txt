Lindsay Lohan's Chateau Marmont Meltdown/n
By Radar Staff
Look, no hands!
Like something from a circus act, Lindsay Lohan left the Chateau Marmont on Saturday night juggling a cigarette, her Porsche and a face of make-up fit for a clown.
The troubled young star looked upset as she left her favorite Hollywood hotspot under the cover of darkness.

Lindsay – who totaled a rented Porsche 911 just last month – clearly hasn’t been deterred from getting behind the wheel of a car both on screen and off and took to Twitter to express her hopes at recreating the car crazy chick flick Thelma & Louise.

“Jennifer Lawrence in ‘The Hunger Games‘ is genius,” she posted on July 20. “I want to do Thelma&Louise w/her but ala Natural Born Killers (style wise) 2 girls-2 guys.”
Let’s hope she leaves the driving up to Jennifer.
