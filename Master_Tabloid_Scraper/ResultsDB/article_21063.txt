EXCLUSIVE PHOTOS: Brad Pitt On Set Of Cogan’s Trade
The Missouri-born A-list hunk, 47, has been spotted in recent weeks on the set of the film, in which he plays Jackie Cogan, a no-nonsense professional enforcer who investigates a heist that went down during a mob-protected poker game.
The film — which hits theaters on March 3, 2012 — co-stars Sam Rockwell, Ray Liotta, James Gandolfini and Sam Shepard.

The Thelma And Louise clearly loves the New Orleans area, and New Orleans natives clearly love him: remember, it was just two years ago when natives of The Big Easy were clamoring for Pitt — who made great strides with his Make It Right charity bringing life back to parts of the area following Hurricane Katrina — to run for mayor. 
“I’m running on the gay marriage, no religion, taxation and legalization of marijuana platform,” Pitt, who’s also a die-hard Saints fan, jokingly told Ann Curry when asked if he’d seriously consider a political campaign in the area. “I don’t have a chance, no.”
