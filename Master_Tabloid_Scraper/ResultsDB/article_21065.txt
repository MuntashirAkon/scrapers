EXCLUSIVE: Michael Madsen's Mega Grammys Snub/n
All of the finest from the entertainment world of music gathered Sunday at Los Angeles’ Staples Center for the highly anticipated 52nd annual Grammy Awards.
But one A-lister that won’t be spotted on the star studded red carpet or sipping champagne during the live broadcast ceremony is Hollywood hell raiser Michael Madsen – despite being a nominee.
A source close to the Thelma and Louise actor tells RadarOnline.com exclusively that Madsen has been snubbed by the Grammys – so much so that he didn’t even know he was nominated for one until a friend called him to congratulate him after the nominations were announced to the public!
Madsen, who is nominated in the Best Spoken Word category, for his work on The Maltese Falcon, had no idea he was a nominee but after finding out decided he wanted to attend. But when his publicist called award show organizers to arrange it they were told there was no ticket available for him and that he would have to buy one himself and sit with the general public!
“Michael is not happy about it,” says the source. “First off to not even be told he is nominated, then to be told he has to buy his own ticket, it’s like a major snub.
“Needless to say he won’t be attending, or watching on the TV!” /n
