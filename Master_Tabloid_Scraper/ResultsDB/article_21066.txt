VIDEO: Diane Sawyer Talks About Leaving GMA To Anchor World News  /n
The very first moments of Good Morning America on Thursday weren’t devoted to some major breaking story – instead, it was devoted to the news that co-anchor Diane Sawyer would be leaving the morning show to take over anchoring ABC’S flagship news program, World News, when Charlie Gibson retires at the end of the year. 
Sawyer’s co-anchor Robin Roberts turned to her and said:  “I just can’t stop looking at you. I’m going to cherish the moments.”   Then, addressing the viewers, Roberts added: “Surely you have heard our beloved friend and dear colleague Charlie Gibson yesterday announced his retirement at the end of the year. And My Thelma will be replacing Charlie on World News.”

Sawyer responded: “Looking for Louise the whole time.”
Sawyer said that Gibson was the reason both she and Roberts came to ABC, and then added: “It’s such an honor to be a member of any team he’s captained, any time at all.”
Sawyer estimated she had anchored roughly 2,500 mornings on GMA over the past ten-and-a-half years. /n
