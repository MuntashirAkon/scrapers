Dayum! It's like touch-a touch-a touch-a touch me all over again!
Susan Sarandon proved she has plenty of video vixen miles left on the odometer Wednesday when she starred in Justice's brand new music video for Fire.
Not only does she do some welding (HOT!), she also dances all sexy and rides in a convertible — it's just like Thelma & Louise if Thelma was a couple French EDM guys.

Director Pascal Teixera said:

"On a hot summer afternoon, Gaspard [Augé] and I were in Xavier [de Rosnay]'s kitchen, collectively daydreaming about washing a car. The year we like for car design, the make, where that could take place, how much soap, the mood, the sun, and there should be a woman to go cruising with, an iconic mix of cool, allure and strength. Susan Sarandon of course!"
Ch-ch-check out the last gasp of summer — just three months late (below)!
