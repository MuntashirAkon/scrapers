Susan Sarandon Blasts Woody Allen At Cannes Over Sexual Abuse Allegations — See What She Said HERE!/n

Susan Sarandon is NOT a Woody Allen fan.
On Sunday, The Meddler actress told the world how she really feels about the controversial director during Variety and Kering's Women in Motion sit down with her Thelma & Louise costar Geena Davis at the Cannes Film Festival. Whoa.

The 69-year-old shared: 

"I think he sexually assaulted a child and I don't think that's right."
Oh snap! As you may know, the Oscar winning filmmaker has been at the center of attention at the film festival after a French comedian Laurent Lafitte made Allen the center of a rape joke at the opening ceremony of Cannes — days after his son Ronan Farrow penned an essay where he commented on the abuse his father allegedly inflicted on his sister Dylan.
Intense stuff.
While Susan was not afraid to speak her mind about her thoughts on Woody, it appears she didn't want to waste much time on the matter. Miz Sarandon added:

"I have nothing good to say about him. I don't want to go there."
Well, well. The Rocky Horror Picture Show alum has never been one to keep her opinions to herself, but it'll certainly be inneresting to see if Mr. Allen claps back at the A-lister with a response.
Stay tuned!
