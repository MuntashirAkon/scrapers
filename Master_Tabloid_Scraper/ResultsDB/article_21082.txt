Tellin’ it like it is. Or, at least how it should be.
Geena Davis delivered a passionate speech about gender equality in Hollywood while at the Global Symposium on Gender in Media. The actress’ own Institute on Gender Media presented the event, where Davis shared her thoughts on women in Hollywood.
“We are unwittingly training generation after generation to see men and women as unequal. We need to dramatically change the way women are depicted to children aged 11 and under,” she stressed. “Surely in the 21st Century we should be showing kids that boys and girls share the sandbox equally. Let’s not embed a negative image.”
Geena went on to speak about how many in Hollywood think this is a non-issue, or that it’s already been solved. She thinks otherwise. “I’d ask executives about gender inequality and to a person they would say ‘that’s been fixed,’” she said. “I can’t imagine why that is. Perhaps Hollywood writers think women don’t gather!”

“Women are seriously under-represented in almost every sector of society across the world,” she added, and also included a powerful call to action:
“I want reaching parity in films to seem fun and easy and creative. Give female characters more to do, more to say, greater aspirations … give them more clothes. And don’t listen when people say it’s been fixed. We need to look to the numbers and make the sweeping changes that need to happen and make them now.”
