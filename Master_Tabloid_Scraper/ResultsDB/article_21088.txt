‘Thelma and Louise!’: Kate Hudson and Stella McCartney Roadtrip to Music Festival/n
Kate Hudson and Stella McCartney are feeling footloose on their girls trip to the California desert.
On Friday night, the designer took to Instagram to share a selfie of the pair en route to Indio, California, for weekend two of the Desert Trip music festival.
“Thelma and Louise heading to coachella!! x Stella,” McCartney, 45, wrote in the post.

Hudson, 37, shared the same photo, captioning her post, “The eagle has landed #RoadTrippin @stellamccartney.”
Later that night, Hudson Snapchatted the duo rocking out to Bob Dylan and The Rolling Stones, who kicked off the festival’s second weekend. In one post, the dynamic duo sing along to Dylan’s encore performance of his hit song, “Like A Rolling Stone.”
“We love you Bob … Congrats,” Hudson captioned a video of herself and McCartney, perhaps congratulating the legendary folk singer on his Nobel Prize win earlier this week.

Hudson shared another sing-along video with McCartney during the Stones’ set. The pair, both in casual black tank tops and toting the festival lanyards around their necks, sang the band’s hit, “Honky Tonk Women.”
“Gimme the honky tonk blues,” a beaming Hudson and McCartney chanted from the crowd.

Hudson has been spending a lot of quality time with her closest girlfriends, including her pal of 25 years, Reese Witherspoon. On Friday, the two hung out at the star-studded Tiffany & Co. flagship relaunch in Beverly Hills, California.
“25yearsStrong#LoveMyGirlfriends #AboutLastNight@reesewitherspoon,” Hudson captioned a black and white photo with Witherspoon on Instagram.
