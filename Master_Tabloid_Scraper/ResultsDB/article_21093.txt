Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis Reunite in the 1966 Ford Thunderbird from Iconic Film Thelma & Louise/n
Geena Davis will forever be the Thelma to Susan Sarandon’s Louise.   
And the pair proved just that during a real-time throwback Thursday when they reunited in their 1966 Ford Thunderbird after 25 years of filming their iconic movie Thelma & Louise at the Good Morning America studios in New York City.   
Sarandon, 69, sported a silver satin Teamsters bomber jacket and a pair of classic aviators, while Davis, 60, looked ever so chic in a light pink form-fitting dress.   
But this isn t the first time the pair excited fans with a reunion – and they just may be the selfie originators!

“Inventors of the #selfie at it again. #ThelmaAndLouise,” Sarandon tweeted last year with the images, of them then and now.
