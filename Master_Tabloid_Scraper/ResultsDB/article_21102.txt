Attention drivers: Mother Monster is behind the wheel!By herself, that is. Potentially. Lady Gaga, 30, revealed Friday in an Instagram post that she had obtained her driver's license.The singer shared a photo of her behind the wheel of what appears to be a used Ford F-150 SVT Lightning pickup truck, with a female friend in the passenger's seat, situated alongside a dry, grassy and rocky hill. Lady Gaga sported denim overalls over a  black crop and wore a black trucker hat backwards."Thelma and Puhleaaaze (And yes I FINALLY got my license after years of driving w an adult present and a learners permit)," she wrote. "I'M FREE...Rollin w the homies."

A year later, she was photographed in Beverly Hills, behind the wheel of a wheel of a new silver Audi R8 GT, along with a friend. The singer ranted online about the paparazzi following her during a driving lesson."Maybe while I'm learning to drive you don't need to sneak up on me and stick your GIANT camera IN A MOVING VEHICLE," she tweeted.Lady Gaga has been photographed driving other cars over the past few months. This past March, she posted on her Instagram page a photo of herself behind the wheel of a black Chevrolet El Camino.
