Paige VanZant: Ronda Beef Is Temporary ... 'We'll Bury The Hatchet'/nThere's one person who thinks Ronda Rousey won't hate Paige VanZant's guts forever ... Paige VanZant ... who says she's more than confident she and Rousey will be gal pals again. You know the story ... Ronda went nuclear on Paige at a VIP event earlier this year -- cussing her out in public ... all because PVZ congratulated Holly Holm after she punched Ronda's face in. You'd think Paige would still be pissed, right??  Wrong.  Check out the clip -- Paige thinks they'll be all Thelma & Louise again before you know it (they were friendly before the incident).  Hope .../n
