Watch: Exclusive Clip From the New Drew Peterson Special/n
Here’s some for true crime fans to sink their teeth into. Investigation Discovery is airing a two-part special called Drew Peterson: An American Murder Mystery. The highly publicized case revolved around the disappearance of Stacy Peterson, and her husband Drew’s lack of interest in finding her.
The 23-year-old mother of two went missing on October 28, 2007. And her husband quickly became a suspect. This wasn’t the first time the police sergeant has been suspected of foul play. His third wife, Kathleen Savio, was found dead in a dry bathtub three years prior to his fourth wife’s disappearance.
