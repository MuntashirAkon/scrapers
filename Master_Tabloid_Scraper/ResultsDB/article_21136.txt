 Enough Is Enough! Joe Biden's Son Files To Make Divorce Private After Drug, Hooker Claims.../n
Hunter and Kathleen Biden have decided to settle their divorce privately after a series of explosive allegations, RadarOnline.com has learned.
The couple filed a motion yesterday to take the legal brawl to mediation and end the public war that unfolded this week.
“The parties recognize the benefit to themselves, their children, and their families in moving to finalize their divorce amicably and privately,” the documents state. “It is the mutual desire of the parties to work together to resolve those matters related to the dissolution of their marriage by way of settlement and without the need for continued litigation.”

As Radar reported, ex-VP Joe Biden‘s son split from his wife in 2015, and subsequently took up with Hallie Biden, the widow of his brother Beau, who passed away from brain cancer that same year.
In December, Kathleen finally filed for divorce, accusing Hunter of a laundry list of dark deeds, including spending more than $100,000 on booze, hookers, and more. Hunter responded by asking Kathleen to provide documents that could prove she cheated on him.
Meanwhile, Hunter and Hallie are going strong.
