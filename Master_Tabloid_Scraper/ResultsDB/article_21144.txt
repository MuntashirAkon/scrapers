Such a sweet thing to do.
In case you didn't know, Kathy and Joyce's brother, Gary, passed away from cancer back in 2014. At the time, Kathy shared:




This AM my brave brother Gary Griffin passed away in palliative care after a brutal struggle w cancer. Our last real conversation, w my brother I loved so much, was just a few days go when I got him this signed picture from his idol, @JoeWalsh. He loved the Eagles, 70s rock, The Chicago White Sox and the Xavier "muskies"… Oh & he was funny as sh*t.A post shared by Kathy Griffin (@kathygriffin) on Jan 22, 2014 at 10:12am PST


Sending all our best to Joyce! Get well soon!
