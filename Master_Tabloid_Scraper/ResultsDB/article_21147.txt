'Many People Will Die' — See All The Strong Reactions To The GOP Finally Passing Their Devastating Obamacare Replacement Bill/n

Republicans were finally able to pass their replacement for the Affordable Care Act — apparently without even reading it!
The GOP-run House held their vote after several amendments were added to it but before the bill could be read or its Congressional Budget Office score could be determined — though the latest CBO score showed 24 million fewer insured by 2026, and word is all the changes just made it worse.
And it's already basically just a huge tax cut for the wealthiest 2% of Americans.

Republicans reportedly celebrated finally getting rid of Obamacare with a keg party. Meanwhile Democrats weren't laughing. Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida said:

"Make no mistake, many people will die as a result of this bill."
After the horrifying news, some are angry, many are despondent — others look to the fight ahead in the Senate (who reportedly WILL at least examine the GD bill)!

Trumpcare isn’t a health care bill. A bill that destroys health care for millions to shovel cash to the rich isn’t a health care bill. #AHCA

This isn’t football. It’s not about scoring points. #AHCA will devastate Americans’ healthcare. Families will go bankrupt. People will die.

Disease, sickness, old age touches every family. Tragedy doesn’t ask who you voted for. #AHCA

Health care is a basic human right. We’ll fight as long & hard as we can to make that a reality for everyone in America. #AHCA

The House Republican bill, H.R. 1628, does not rescue health care. It is an attack on the poor, the sick, the elderly, and the disabled.

The Affordable Care Act saves lives. The GOP health care plan? This plan will destroy lives.
— Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) May 4, 2017


Don't believe Ryan. Repealing health care is not about fulfilling a promise to voters. It's about a giant tax cut for the rich. #VoteNoAHCA

This cruel bill cuts off access to reproductive health care for millions who depend on @PPFA.

Dear #Maga Americans. Making people die without insurance while the rest of the world enjoys coverage doesn't Make America Great Again. https://t.co/8RWSjHUccj

The #MAGA C.H.U.D.S. on Twitter right now, cheering the #AHCA being passed.
Cattle cheering McDonald's.

Americans who voted for Trump: it brings me no joy in letting you know YOU will be hurt the MOST by Trumpcare. #AHCA
— Amy Siskind (@Amy_Siskind) May 4, 2017


I call the #AHCA the Caesar bill because it's going to die on the floor of the Senate. #obamacare

I will toast the 20 republicans who voted no. They were brave or smart enuf to be the band on the Titanic. #AHCA

GOP passed a law denying people healthcare and MADE THEMSELVES EXEMPT FROM IT.
Even District 1 sent Tributes to The Hunger Games.

Republican lawmakers are now literally throwing a keg party on taxpayers' dime to celebrate taking healthcare away from 20 million people.
— Matthew Chapman (@fawfulfan) May 4, 2017


I think we Americans should choose and decide what health care coverage should our politicians get like they do to us! #AHCA

House Republicans literally cheered as they voted to strip millions of Americans off healthcare. Shameful. #AHCA

A sexual assault offender can become President, but a sexual assault victim cannot get healthcare. #AHCA
— A. Paxton Carriere (@APaxton_Demoin) May 4, 2017


just to be clear: a man who bragged about sexually assaulting women is denying victims of sexual assault access to healthcare
— Jhorts (@JhonRules) May 4, 2017


This is what I fought for? What I risked my life for? So that rich people could strip poor people of their health care?
— Myke Cole (@MykeCole) May 4, 2017


Speaking as a doctor: passing the #AHCA through the House without a CBO score is one of the most shameful things I've seen in politics.
— Rany Jazayerli (@jazayerli) May 4, 2017


I've never seen a group of people so excited to strip healthcare from poor and sick people. It's sickening. #AHCA
