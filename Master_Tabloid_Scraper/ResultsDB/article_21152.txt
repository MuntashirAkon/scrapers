Robert Durst, the millionaire who was the subject of HBO’s excellent docu-series The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst, has been extradited from an Indiana federal prison and is now in an L.A. County jail, TMZ reports.
Durst has been charged with first-degree murder of his close friend, writer Susan Berman., who was found shot to death in her L.A. home in 2000. Authorities believe Durst killed Berman because she knew information about the mysterious death of Durst’s first wife, Kathleen, who disappeared in 1982.
In The Jinx, which aired in 2015, filmmaker Andrew Jarecki examines the complicated life of reclusive the real estate heir, the key suspect in a series of unsolved crimes, including Kathleen’s disappearance, Berman’s murder, and also the death of Durst’s neighbor, Morris Black, in Galveston, Texas. Durst admitted to killing and dismembering the neighbor but was acquitted on grounds of self defense.

At the end of the series, as mounting evidence had surfaced against Durst on the Berman case, he was heard off camera, making a statement that sounded very much like a confession. He uttered the words, “killed them all.”
Durst was arrested in New Orleans the day before the finale of The Jinx aired. According to TMZ, Durst will plead not guilty to the charge when he is arraigned in L.A. Superior Court on Monday (Nov. 7, 2016).
Durst has also hired a powerful, multi-state legal team, which includes Dick DeGuerin, Chip Lewis, David Chesnoff and Don Re, all of whom have won big murder cases. He is being held without bail.
