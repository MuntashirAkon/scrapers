As the rest of us struggle with getting our crush to return our texts, Making a Murderer’s Steven Avery has gotten engaged — again! — whilst serving a life sentence behind bars for the alleged murder of photographer Teresa Halbach. In an upcoming back-to-back episodes of Dr. Phil, Avery, calling in from a prison phone, talks about finding love again with legal secretary Lynn Hartman.

“I haven’t been in love my whole life. It’s not the same as the others. Everything is all different with her,” he tells host Phil McGraw, explaining that they fell in love when she started writing to him earlier this year. Avery, who met Hartman face-to-face only two weeks ago, adds that he wants to get married if he’s freed. “I want to wait until I’m out and I don’t think that’ll be too long; right around the corner.”
Hartman says, “The first time he told me he loved me was the first time we spoke on the phone.”
Found guilty of first-degree murder in 2007 alongside nephew Brendan Dassey, Avery claims that Dassey’s recently overturned ruling means he could get out of the slammer soon, vowing, “The truth is coming out and sooner or later all the truth will come out.”
Avery gained national attention after a 10-episode docu-series that chronicled and questioned his murder trial premiered on Netflix. Since then, a petition to pardon Avery was set up and Chicago attorney Kathleen Zellner filed a new appeal.
Avery’s interview will air on Oct. 3 and 4.
