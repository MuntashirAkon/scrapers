Steven Avery, the subject of overnight hit series Making a Murderer, is reportedly engaged to Lynn Hartmann, a legal secretary from Las Vegas.

Us Weekly reports:
“Steven Avery’s engagement to Lynn is one bright spot in an otherwise unbelievably tragic and unfair life story,” Kathleen Zellner, who is handling Avery’s wrongful conviction case, tells Us in a statement. “Cheers to both of them.”
Avery and Hartman, both 53, have been dating for eight months. Their relationship began with letters and phone calls, but the happy couple finally met face-to-face for the first time just last week when she visited him at Waupun Correctional Institute in Waupun, Wisconsin, according to the Daily Mail.
“She’s going to be my future wife. We’ll be laughing forever,” the subject of Netflix’s hit docuseries told the news outlet Friday, September 23. “I’m happy. She treats me decent, she loves me. She’s kind of spoiling me right now. I just want to be happy and enjoy my life. I think I did enough time.”
