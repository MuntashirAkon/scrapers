Being a single mom is tough, but whenever Katie Holmes feels overwhelmed she turns to one person for guidance: her mother Kathleen.

“She’s just so kind and has such a pure heart; she really leads with those two qualities, so I try to do the same,” Holmes told People when asked how her mother influences her parenting choices.
“She’s just so kind and very generous, so I try my best to embody that and pass that on to my own daughter,” the actress continued.
Holmes recently shared pictures from Kathleen’s surprise birthday party just a few days ago, including a few adorable snaps cuddled up with daughter Suri Cruise.

Holmes’ parents have been very hands-on grandparents since Holmes called it quits with Tom Cruise in 2012, which should come as no surprise given recent reports Cruise hasn’t seen Suri in over three years.
