Avery was the subject of the docuseries Making a Murderer, which explored his conviction in 1985 for rape and attempted murder. He was exonerated 18 years later by DNA evidence only to be convicted of Halbach’s murder under murky and troubling circumstances.

In the filing, Avery requests radiocarbon testing, “which could definitely establish the age of Mr. Avery’s blood found in the victim’s vehicle and determine, based on the age, if the blood was planted.”
