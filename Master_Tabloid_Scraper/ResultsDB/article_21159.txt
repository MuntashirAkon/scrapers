It looks like the addictive, true crime series is getting a second run.

On Tuesday (July 19, 2016), Netflix announced that their documentary series Making a Murderer is going to get new episodes. The series was a phenomenon among viewers for its (perhaps biased) depiction of the trial and conviction of Steven Avery in Manitowoc County, Wisconsin for the murder of Teresa Halbach.
The new episodes will reportedly explore Avery’s life since his conviction. It will also examine his nephew Brendan Dassey’s post-trial case; he was convicted as an accessory to murder.
Avery’s case is unique because prior to his conviction for the Halbach murder, he was exonerated for another murder from 1985, for which he served 18 years in prison.
Kathleen Zellner, Avery’s new lawyer, won a motion to present new evidence to the court regarding blood residue found on Halbach’s car in early 2016. Her process will likely find its way into the show’s new episodes as well.
Netflix has yet to divulge just how many episodes are on the way and when they will be available. Keep in mind, the first season was the result of 10 years of filming by the show’s co-creators Laura Ricciardi and Moira Demos, so we could be waiting a while.
