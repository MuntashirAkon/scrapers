Kathleen just wants to be normal again.In this clip, the Botched patient explains that she wants to meet with doctors Terry Dubrow and Paul Nassif to reconstruct her ears after she underwent a procedure called earlobe scalpelling. The process removes a part of the earlobe tissue to enlarge a stretched piercing."The person who did the scalpelling on me had at it, and I walked out of there," Kathleen says. "I went from one inch to 1 3/8 inch. I actually noticed that my skin was way too thin almost immediately."She reveals that her extreme appearance negatively affects her job at a car dealership, especially when customers call her "deformed" or ask to touch her earlobes.Watch the clip above to hear Kathleen's story!
