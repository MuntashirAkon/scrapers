Get the Glow: YouTube Star Kathleen Lights Shows Us How to Get a Red-Carpet Ready, Sun-Kissed Look/n
How does YouTuber Kathleen Lights shine bright for big events? By drawing inspiration from Latina celebrities and creating a warm, healthy glow.And after seeing so many stars radiate on the Billboard Latin Music Awards red carpet—compliments of glowing skin—the Cuban-American makeup maven is showing us how to get the sun-kissed look for ourselves.

First, Kathleen prepped for the look by incorporating Crest 3D White Whitestrips into her daily routine, starting two weeks before the big event. By brightening teeth, lip color is more likely to pop. Other must-do prep steps included applying foundation and concealer to cleansed skin and creating a subtle eye look by blending soft, matte brown shadow into the lid.

Next, Kathleen added that famous, red-carpet glow, starting with the cheeks. After dusting cheeks with a shimmery bronzer, she accentuated cheekbones by applying a matte bronzer to the hollows of her cheeks. To finish, she applied her shimmery bronzer to cheeks, forehead, temples and jawline for an overall glow. After adding highlighting powder applied to the highest points of her cheeks, her skin beamed as if lit from within.With glowing skin, Kathleen elevated the look by adding a pigmented lip—the perfect accessory to a bright, confident smile.
