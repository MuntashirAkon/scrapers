Katrina will now begin production in early 2018, and air as season three. Focusing on the 2005 hurricane and its devastating aftermath, Katrina will star Annette Beningas Louisiana governor Kathleen Blanco, Matthew Broderick as FEMA director Michael D. Brown, and Dennis Quaid as President George W. Bush. Originally, the two seasons were supposed to film somewhat simultaneously and then air nearly back to back next year. No premiere dates have been announced for either installment. 

The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story will air sometime in 2018. Filming is currently underway in Miami Beach, and you can see comparison photos of the main cast members in our gallery.
