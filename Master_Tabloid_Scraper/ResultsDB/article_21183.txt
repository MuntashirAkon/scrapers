Amy Schumer: I Don't Steal Jokes and I Can Prove It! (VIDEO)/nAmy Schumer is fighting back against 3 other female comedians who ripped her on social media for allegedly stealing their jokes.  Amy's repeatedly denied joke theft, but now she's taking it a step further after Tammy Pescatelli, Kathleen Madigan and Wendy Liebman each claimed she jacked their material. Gotta hand it to her, Amy's plan to prove her innocence should boost ratings on her Comedy Central TV show too. That's how ya bank on a conspiracy.  On my life, I have never and would never steal a joke. — Amy Schumer (@amyschumer) January 20, 2016/n
