"Moment of Truth" to Catch a Killer?/nA well-placed source tells TMZ that reps for suspected wife killer Drew Peterson have contacted the producers of the new show  "Moment of Truth, " asking to hookup their client to a lie detector test on national television.Peterson's fourth wife Stacey has been missing and presumed dead since last October. Peterson's third wife, Kathleen Savio, was found dead in a bathtub in March 2004. At the time, her death was ruled accidental, but since Stacey's disappearance, Savio's body was exhumed for forensic examination and officials determined her death to be a  "homicide staged to look like an accident. " Stacey's family has continually asked Drew to submit to a lie detector test -- which he has repeatedly refused to do, until now.Peterson denies any involvement in Stacey's disappearance, insisting she left him for another man.A FOX spokesperson had no comment.
