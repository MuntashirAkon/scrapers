“Oh, c’mon, not personal stuff,” although mentioned that her ex-husband is “someone that will always be in my life.”
Wang, once a figure skater herself, met Lysacek in 2009, when she designed several of his costumes, but The Daily News reported that their relationship escalated in July 2012 when she invited him to move into her Beverly Hills mansion. /n
