In the segment, Aniston came out to a pathetic version of the Friends theme, and seemed awkward and disoriented by the vibe in the room. Galifianakis introduced Tila to Aniston as the star of a reality dating show.
“You’re in a reality show?” Aniston asked Tila. “How did that go?”

Aniston said she was there to promote her new film Just Go With It, which co-stars Adam Sandler, who Tila said she’s worked with, as well.
“He’s really nice,” Tila said of Sandler.

“One of the nicest!” Aniston agreed.
Aniston ended the tongue-in-cheek segment walking off set in a huff, before giving Galifianakis a piece of her mind for ‘ambushing’ her with Tila.

In an email to RadarOnline.com, Tila said: “Look it finally came out! HILARIOUS! Jen really had no idea that I was going to be there so that was really her reaction when she walked in! LOL. Check it out!”
Just Go With It hits theaters Friday.
