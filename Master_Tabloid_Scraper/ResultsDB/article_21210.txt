Guardians Of The Galaxy Cast Teams Up With David Hasselhoff For The Weirdest Music Video You've Ever Seen/n

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is coming to DVD and Blu-Ray, and the cast is celebrating in the only acceptable fashion: by starring in a weird af music video with David Hasselhoff!
Zoe Saldana, Karen Gillan, Dave Bautista, and Michael Rooker appear in an ‘80s-style vid for the original song Guardians Inferno — and it's so delightfully cheesy, all your troubles will instantly burn away!
The song was co-written by Guardians director James Gunn, who shared the clip of "The Sneepers ft. David Hasselhoff performing Guardians Inferno" on Facebook to promote the sequel's upcoming home release.
