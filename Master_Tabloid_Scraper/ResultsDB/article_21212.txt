Although the now 20-year-old faced up to 20 years in jail, on Thursday, she was sentenced by Juvenile Court Judge Lawrence Moniz to two-and-a-half years, though she is only required to serve 15 months. As reported by AP, she also received five years of probation.
Prior to the decision, Michelle's lawyer Joseph Cataldo asked the judge to spare his client jail time, and instead requested probation and mandatory mental health counseling to deal with her bulimia, anorexia, and depression. The attorney told the court: 

"Miss Carter will have to live with the consequences of this for the rest of her lifeâ€¦ This was a horrible circumstance that she completely regrets."
The jail-bound woman was 17 when she committed the crime, which is why she was tried and convicted in juvenile court.
