Twitter Has Something To Say About Trump's Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci Quoting Disgraced Joe Paterno!/n

Once again, you just really can't make this stuff up.
As the White House Communications Director, you'd think Anthony Scaramucci would know better than to name drop Joe Paterno ‚Äî the disgraced football coaching legend who was fired from Penn State for his role in the Jerry Sandusky child sexual abuse scandal ‚Äî when talking about "honor" and "dignity."
But, here we are.
On Thursday, Scaramucci called into CNN's New Day where he went on a rant suggesting his financial disclosure report was leaked, even though it was public information.

Donald Trump's adviser said: 
"Remember Joe Paterno? What would he say? ‚ÄòAct like you've been there before.' Act with honor and dignity and respect and hold the confidence of the presidency in his office."
All of us:

Wanna know the best part?
"Act like you've been there before" is originally a Vince Lombardi (NOT JoePa) quote! LOLz!
Ch-ch-check out Twitter's confused reactions (below)!!

Anthony Scaramucci just positively quoted Joe Paterno‚Äìwho, you know, condoned the rape of children‚Äìas a way of responding to criticism. üôÉ

Of course, Anthony Scaramucci cited Joe Paterno as someone to emulate:

Scaramucci quoting Joe Paterno makes sense since his job for the foreseeable future will be covering up the wrongdoings of his coworkers

Yesterday Gooch compared Trump's effort to overturn ACA to Lincoln abolishing slavery, today he quoted Joe Paterno in reference to 'honor'.

Anthony @Scaramucci says the White House staff should have the honor of Joe Paterno.
Frankly I think they already do.

You know the dumbest part about Scaramucci's "Joe Paterno" gaffe? "Act like you've been there before" is a VINCE LOMBARDI line.

This isn't even a Joe Paterno quote. It's been said by both Vince Lombardi and Bear Bryant.

It's fitting how Scaramucci quotes Joe Paterno who was the same man that protected a sexual predator like he now is paid to protect Trump pic.twitter.com/ZHMDk7wUf1

The irony of @Scaramucci quoting Joe Paterno about honor isn't being lost here, is it?

White House believes good employees keep secrets the same way Joe Paterno protected sexual abusers of kids. Got it. pic.twitter.com/poxPb3QeO0

But if officials who keep their mouth shut are like Joe Paterno that means DT is Sandusky which means the working/middle class ppl are‚Ä¶ oh
