Liam Payne cannot say enough nice things about his pregnant girlfriend, Cheryl Cole.

The One Direction singer, who first met Cole when he was only 14 during The X Factor auditions, calls the 33-year-old his “dream girl” for as long as he can remember. Opening up about their relationship dynamics to U.K.’s Rollacoaster magazine, the British star says Cole is “so ace” despite their 10-year age difference.
“This is the thing: In a non-cliché way, it’s weird waking up every day and literally living out your dream,” he gushes. “Obviously I have the most beautiful girlfriend in the world, and she’s absolutely amazing.”

“She is a wonderful, wonderful person, and it’s amazing to have someone who can relate to so much of things—someone who’s taken greater steps than me,” Payne continues, adding that he’s a fan of her music as well. “Her solo career was amazing. She’s been in the industry for 14 years now.”
The couple went public with their relationship in February 2016 before revealing later in the year that they are expecting their first child together. Last month, Cole proudly flaunted her baby bump in an ad campaign for L’Oreal and The Prince’s Trust.
“We’re super happy. It’s a very personal, precious time for us,” he says of their relationship dynamics during the pregnancy. “I’m still learning. I’m only 23.”
