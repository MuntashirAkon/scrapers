This Is the Man Who Changed to Hollywood Sign to Read ‘Hollyweed’/n
The prankster who altered the iconic Hollywood Sign to read “Hollyweed” has been arrested and identified.

Zach Fernandez turned himself to the Los Angeles Police Department on Monday for recently vandalizing the L.A. landmark, according to multiple reports.  Accompanied by his attorney, the 30-year-old surrendered to detectives around 12:10 p.m. at the Hollywood station, where he booked for misdemeanor trespassing.
He was released after posting a $1,000 bond.

Police say Fernandez’s stunt, which occurred during the early hours of New Years’ Day, did not cause any permanent damage as the letters were changed using removable colored flags that were strategically placed on support beams.
Fernandez is scheduled to appear at the Los Angeles Superior Court on Feb. 15.
