It’s true, Justin Bieber has sworn off Instagram, even stating, “Hell is Instagram” during an on-stage rant. But that doesn’t mean the Biebs won’t embrace other video platforms…if the right friend asks. That’s presumably why the pop singer appeared on Ellen DeGeneres’ Snapchat recently where he treated fans to a line from a well-known Taylor Swift song.

In the clip, the crooner sings the chorus to Swift’s 2012 hit “I Knew You Were Trouble” as the studio audience cheers closeby.

True Beliebers know that this isn’t the first time the Bieber has covered the track. He and DJ Martin Garrix casually sing the song together in a video shared over the summer.
And if that still isn’t enough Bieber for you – check out the singer showing off his biceps while leaving an L.A. gym in the gallery below…
