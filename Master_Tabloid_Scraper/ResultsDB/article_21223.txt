After months of dodging pregnancy rumors, Liam Payne and Cheryl Cole have seemingly confirmed reports they’re expecting their first child together.

Cole, who went public with her relationship with Payne this February, was photographed with a budding bump underneath her dress when she stepped out with her boyfriend on Tuesday (Nov. 29, 2016). Beaming from ear to ear, the couple looked positively ecstatic as they arrived at the Fayre of St. James concert in London. Come on, just look at that smile!
Last month, Cole’s Girls Aloud bandmate, Kimberly Walsh, hinted about the singer’s pregnancy, telling the Daily Star, “I don’t really want to go into too much detail on that because I feel it’s something that she should speak about, but to know she’s happy makes me happy.”
Around that same time, Payne also dropped a song on Instagram featuring cryptic lyrics about a baby.

Payne, 23, first crossed paths with Cole, 33, when he auditioned for her during the 2010 season of The X Factor. He then went on to form One Direction. 
If the rumors are true, this will be the second One Direction baby after Louis Tomlinson welcomed son Freddie this January. Needless to say, the 1D fandom is freaking out over the possibility of Payne and Cole having a child together.
