In his new film Keeping Up with the Joneses, Jon Hamm plays a deadly spy attempting to halt an international crisis before it’s too late. As you can guess, comedy ensues along the way as his character’s neighbors, Zach Galifianakis and Isla Fisher, get involved and quickly find themselves in over their heads. Now, Hamm’s not a lethal undercover agent in real life, but he was able to help his real-life neighbor when it mattered most.

“My neighbor here in L.A., one weekend I heard this ruckus next door and I looked over this wall, and he had fallen off of the ladder and threw his head onto the driveway and was bleeding all the way down the driveway,” Hamm told The Hollywood Reporter at the film’s premiere. “It’s this 90-year-old man. I was like, ‘What happened!'”

The 45-year-old actor said he flew into action to try and help the fallen man.
“I just [jumped] over the thing and I’m thinking, ‘Cub scouts, what do you do?’ I got him untangled from the ladder and all of the tree branches off of him, and I undid his collar and I put some stuff on his head to put pressure on it,” he continued. “He didn’t speak English so I was having a hard time explaining to him, ‘Breathe, breathe, breathe.’ And the ambulance came and took him away. He was fine, thank god, but it was terrifying.”
How neighborly!
Keeping Up with the Joneses arrives in theaters on Oct. 21, 2016.
