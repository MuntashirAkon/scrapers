Kanye West is responding to Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week creator Fern Mallis' not-so-nice comments about him.Earlier this week, Mallis was asked what she thought of the rapper turned designer at New York Fashion Week. "I'm kind of over Kanye," the 66-year-old former CFDA executive director bluntly stated. "I mean, I'm not a fan of his music, and the attitude and the agenda is not my style."Now, the 37-year-old Grammy winner and fashion enthusiast is calling out Mallis in a series of surprisingly calm tweets.

"To Fern Mallis: I just want you to understand that attempting to do clothing has been very difficult and I have encountered countless amounts of bigotry along the way," Kanye tweeted today. "I have millions of ideas and I represent a new generation just trying to express themselves in a broken world. I don't call myself a designer as I was not allowed to go to Saint Martins because I was too famous by the time I realized I wanted to design."He continued, "Fame is often looked down upon in the design world, so it's actually been something I had to overcome. All we have are our dreams, and you can step on our dreams and ideas all you want, but we won't stop fighting. We want to innovate and we will win someday. If you wanna have a drink with me, book a table at the spotted pig when I'm back in NY."Way to take the high road, Kanye!
