Hillary Clinton Relives Every Sexist Question She's Probably Ever Been Asked on Zach Galifianakis' Between Two Ferns/n
Conversation then turns to Clinton's political rival Donald Trump, where Galifianakis questions whether or not she'd make like many anti-Trump supporters' claims and flee the U.S. for Canada if he's elected. "I would stay in the United States and try to prevent him from destroying the United States," she responds, to which Zach asks, "So you're going to lead the civil war?" "No, I wouldn't take up arms. I think that might be a little extreme," Clinton offers, adding, "I really regret doing this."And like many reporters who've interviewed Hillary during the presidential race, Galifianakis couldn't help but question her wardrobe choice for Monday's upcoming debate. Clinton replies, "There's this thing called the double standard, so I think about what should the first woman nominee of one of our two major parties where to the debate, and I have no idea..."

Hillary does have a prediction for her Republican opponent's outfit for the event ("that red power tie"), whereas Zach muses, "Or maybe like a white power tie?" Clinton reflects, "That's even more appropriate." Shots fired. Watch the rest of Clinton's delightfully awkward Between Two Ferns interview in the video above.
