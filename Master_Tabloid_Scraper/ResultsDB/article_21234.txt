Obama's appearance on Between Two Ferns is another attempt to encourage young people to sign up for health insurance before March 31.But when the Affordable Care Act was brought up, Galifianakis remarked, "Yeah. I heard about that.

"You need to get on healthcare.gov because that's one of the most disgusting things I've ever seen."Fortunately for us, this interview was one of the funniest things we've seen.
