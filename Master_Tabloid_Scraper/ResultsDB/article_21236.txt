Zach Galifianakis Between Two Ferns is the gift that keeps on giving.In a successful attempt to add some awkwardness to this jolly season, the actor turned host gave yet another memorable performance of his sit-down interview show, with his guests "Samue L. Jack's Son" and "Toby," or as we know them, Samuel L. Jackson and Tobey MaguireAfter taking some unwelcome advice on how to start the show from Maguire, Galifianakis kicked off the "Happy Holidays edition of Between Two Ferns!"

The special focused less on the holidays and more on Jackson's career choices (as well as trying to ignore Tobey).As Maguire just kinda sat there, the Pulp Fiction star talked about his films Die Hard and Turbo, while Zach made jokes about Snakes on a Plane. But, to be a good host, Galifianakis did include Tobey in some conversation. Well, he made a Cider House Rules joke (that was pretty funny), and that was it.The Hangover star was in the giving spirit, and gifted a DVD copy of his film The Campaign to his guests. Jackson threw it back, and Maguire just signed it and handed it over. Well, it's the thought that counts.Then the trio enjoyed a performance of "Little Drummer Boy" by Arcade Fire, while fanning away falling asbestos.
