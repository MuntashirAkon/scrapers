Zach, 43, tried to get back to business, asking Justin what goes through his mind during a concert. "Sometimes I'm really like, 'Damn I wish I was watching Cops right now,'" Justin quipped.The "Believe" singer wasn't amused when Zach asked what's next for his career after his "three hairstyles," saying, "So, you think that my hairstyles are the only thing that's happened in my career?" Awkward silence.Eventually, Zach had enough. "You know what? I don't like your attitude, to be quite honest," he said. "Because you know what? You're too young to be smoking pot and pee peeing in buckets and driving up and down the highway fast! I don't think your mom would really mind if a stranger whipped her son."And with that, he whipped off his belt and gave the Biebs a good spanking!
