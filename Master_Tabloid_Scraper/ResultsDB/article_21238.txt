The latest installment of Between Two Ferns features Zach Galifianakis interviewing James Franco. Or, more appropriately, the character Zach Galifianakis (created for Funny or Die) interviewing the character James Franco (created because there's no way anyone is really that weird, right?)Yet, the interview starts off normally, with Zach asking James about his "tasty" "sausage" and wondering whether he'll ever actually host the Oscars. It almost veers into hard-hitting journalism when Galifianakis asks the question that everyone wants to but never has, "Of all the art projects that you've done, what has made people roll their eyes the hardest?"But then there's a surprise.(WARNING: The below video contains explicit language and possibly NSFW imagery.)

The surprise is musical guest The Lonely Island (including SNL alumn Andy Samberg), who premiere a Spring Breakers-inspired song about, well, sprang breakkk forever, bitches! And same sex marriage. Featuring a cameo by Edward Norton.

On a somewhat related note, yesterday Delaware legalized same sex marriage. Congrats!
