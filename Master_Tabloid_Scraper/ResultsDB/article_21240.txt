Those surreal conversations Zach Galifianakis has been having online are coming to a television set near you.Between Two Ferns, the popular web series in which the comedian sits down (between two ferns, natch) and banters weirdly with various celebrities, will morph into a 30-minute episode, premiering on Comedy Central May 6 before the channel's annual Comedy Awards.

Ferns co-creator Scott Aukerman announced the news on his Comedy Bang Bang podcast. The producer hatched the original sketch idea back in late 2007 as a pilot that eventually found success after it was posted on the website Funny or Die, where it became a sensation.The parody interview show has featured in the past such guests as Charlize Theron, Sean Penn, Natalie Portman, Bruce Willis, Jennifer Aniston, and fellow funnymen Ben Stiller, Will Ferrell, and Steve Carell.Slated for the hot seat on the TV special, dubbed Between Two Ferns: A Fairy Tale of New York, are Jon Stewart, 30 Rock star Tina Fey and Sir Richard Branson.
