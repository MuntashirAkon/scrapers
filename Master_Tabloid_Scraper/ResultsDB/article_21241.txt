Britney Spears Hijacks Vegas Dance Class For 'Happy' Surprise/nBritney Spears gave a bunch of dancing queens a huge surprise when she commandeered their class, and choreographed a new routine for them. Fern Adair, the owner of a Vegas dance studio, says Britney's people contacted her a couple weeks ago, and said Brit wanted to reconnect with her dance roots. Just a few days later, Spears showed up to a class filled with kids aged 8 to 18. We're told she spent an hour teaching them some steps to Pharrell's  "Happy. " So, mission accomplished. Roots connected.      A video posted by Britney Spears (@britneyspears) on Nov 10, 2015 at 8:11pm PST/n
