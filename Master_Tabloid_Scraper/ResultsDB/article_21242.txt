Mandy Moore: I Want Out Of Marriage & My House in the  Woods/nThe house Mandy Moore and estranged husband Ryan Adams shared during their nearly 6-year marriage is on the market, and it looks like it's straight out of an alt-rock song. The couple is selling their heavily-wooded pad in L.A.'s Los Feliz neighborhood for $3.199 million. It's a steep price considering the lot is less than one-third of an acre, but the location is baller ... right near Griffith Park. Mandy bought the 5 bedroom, 5 bath pad in 2002 for $1.725 mil, but according to their divorce docs they've been splitting the mortgage. Unclear if they'll also split profits from the sale.Â  She filed for divorce January 2015./n
