Janice Dickinson Banned from Fashion Shows/nThe self-proclaimed  "World's 1st supermodel " transformed last night's Ed Hardy fashion show into a living hell for event organizers -- and now we're told she's been banned from future L.A. Fashion Week runway shows! According to inside sources, Janice Dickinson refused to sit in the seat assigned to her -- claiming she wasn't close enough to the media -- and instead sat in seats assigned to Fern Mallis, lead organizer of Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week, and Davis Factor, co-creator of Smashbox Studio. Though she was heard yelling,  "I'm not moving for anyone, I don't care who it is, " she switched seats after being reprimanded by Factor himself. Dickinson wasn't done causing trouble just yet though. She then trashed Ed Hardy clothing to reporters, saying  "Those t-shirts are worth $5 ... it only cost them $5 to make in China, " but added they may be worth money in twenty years. The model /trainwreck then caused a scene backstage when she stuck her foot in a giant tub of ice after claiming a model  "broke her toe. "Dickinson has since been requested not to attend future shows  "by the powers that be " at IMG, a leading talent agency. TMZ spoke with Christian Audigier, CEO and creator of Ed Hardy, who said,  "Janice is a good friend of mine, and she was fine at the show. It was a great situation and we would be more than happy to have her back. "  Related Article      Janice Dickinson:  "Britney's Brilliant! "/n
