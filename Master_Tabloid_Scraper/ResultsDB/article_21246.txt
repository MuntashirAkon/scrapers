 Deathbed Request: Anna Nicole Smith's Cancer-Stricken Mom Begs For Visit From Granddaughter.../n
Anna Nicole Smith’s mother, suffering from a rare and incurable cancer, is pleading with Larry Birkhead for one last visit with granddaughter Dannielynn, The National ENQUIRER has exclusively learned.
Virgie Arthur, 63, and Birkhead battled for custody of the infant Dannielynn in the months after Smith’s drug overdose death in 2007, causing some bad feelings between them.
“Virgie has been sick for a very long time,” a source close to the Birkhead told The ENQUIRER. “Larry occasionally sent her photos, but hasn’t allowed visitation because there is a lot of bad blood with her.”

But as Arthur’s condition worsens she is desperately hoping for a visit from Dannielynn, now 8. Smith’s father, Donald Hogan, died of lung cancer in 2009 and was unable to see Dannielynn in the months before his passing.
Arthur, meanwhile, has been in and out of the hospital since being diagnosed with multiple myeloma, an incurable cancer that affects blood cells in the bone marrow. “It’s day by day,” the source said. “The minute they release her, she goes back in.”
Arthur’s family is hoping Birkhead will have a change of heart. “It would be wonderful, but so far nothing has happened,” said a source. “Dannielynn’s growing up and will want to know about her mama’s family — and if you just pray to God, it’ll all work out.”
