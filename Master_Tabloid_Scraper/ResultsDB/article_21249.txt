Finally!
Anna Nicole Smith's estranged mother Virgie Arthur leaves a court house in the Bahamas on Monday during the first day of the inquest into the death of her grandson Daniel.
The Playmate's former "lover" and lawyer, Howard K. Stern was also there.
Daniel died well over a year ago, in September of 2006, of a suspected accidental drug overdose.
Speaking outside court during a lunch break, Virgie told reporters she was finding it hard listening to details of Daniel's death.
