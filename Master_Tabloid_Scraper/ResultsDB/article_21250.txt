Virgie's Revenge!/n

Anna Nicole Smith's estranged mother, Virgie Arthur, has filed a lawsuit against Howard K. Stern.
She calls him a "manipulative, deceitful, and dangerous person."
Oddly enough, Virgie is suing Howard over statements Anna Nicole made about her on Entertainment Tonight.
Shit, why not just sue Anna's estate????
The best part of the suit is when Arthur claims that she knew Howard was not Dannielynn's father "because of the type of person Stern is." 
Hmmmâ€¦..
Wonder what she was getting at there?
