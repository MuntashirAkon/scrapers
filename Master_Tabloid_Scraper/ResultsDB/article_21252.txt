Stabbing The Knife In Her Dead Corpse/n

Oh, mommie dearest!
Anna Nicole Smith's estranged mother, the famewhoring Virgie Arthur, has flown to New York for a little dose of attention-seeking.
The Texan will make an appearance at Pacha in Manhattan tonight at the book party for Rita Cosby's new Anna Nicole tell-all, Blonde Ambition: The Untold Story Behind Anna Nicole Smith's Death.
Yesterday, Smith's former lawyer, Howard K. Stern, filed a $60 million lawsuit against Cosby and her book publisher for claiming that he and Larry Birkhead were gay lovers.
Virgie is loving this shiz!
