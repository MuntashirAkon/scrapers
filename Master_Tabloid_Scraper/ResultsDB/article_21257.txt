Laude was a sex worker and Pemberton was in the Philippines participating in joint military exercises.  
This summer, Pemberton testified in court that he choked Laude during a fight that ensued soon after he discovered she was transgender. He claimed she was still alive when he left the hotel room.  
But Laude’s family has long maintained that she was dead when Pemberton vacated the room.  
In an interview with MOOVZ, an LGBT social network, prosecutor Virgie Suarez said Pemberton “turned evil” when he realized Jennifer was transgender and that “the evidence” against him “was overwhelming.”  

Said Suarez: “Jennifer was killed simply because she’s a transgender. You do not become a lesser person because you are a member of LGBT. We are all equal. We are all human beings.”
