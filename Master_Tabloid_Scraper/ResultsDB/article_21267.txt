It has just been revealed that Virgie Arthur had an affair with her stepbrother, David Luther Tacker, which resulted in the birth of her first son (guess that would make him Anna's stepbrother, David Luther Tacker Jr.). So, the question is, does this technically count as incest? Because first you have to take several factors into account: How old were they? Was it a Flowers in the Attic situation? Were they sober? And finally, did anyone explain the rules of stepsiblings to them? Internet consensus is it's definitely weirdâ€”like weird enough to keep her far, far away from Dannielynn. But what's your take on the sordid situation?
