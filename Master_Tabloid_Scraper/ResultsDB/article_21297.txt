Battle Continues Over Anna's Body/nHoward K. Stern and Anna Nicole Smith's mother, Virgie Arthur, are back in Florida today, where an appeals court is considering a request by Arthur to bury Anna in Texas. Last week, the offbeat Judge Seidlin decided that the court-appointed guardian for Smith's daughter would make the decision as to where Smith's body would be buried. The guardian said she'd be buried next to her son Daniel in the Bahamas.Both sides will be given 20 minutes each to present their arguments this morning, Anna's potential baby-daddy Larry Birkhead will not be present at the hearing.
