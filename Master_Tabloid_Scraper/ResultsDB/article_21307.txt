 Raunchiest Housewife Ever! Danielle’s Bathroom Romp With BF Caught By ‘RHONJ’ Cameras.../n
Danielle Staub still can’t keep her romps to herself, RadarOnline.com can exclusively reveal.
The RHONJ star stopped her sex tape from leaking after she left the show eight years ago, but now her rendezvous with her new man Marty Caffrey could be aired on Bravo!
Multiple insiders confirmed to Radar that Staub and Caffrey had sex in the bathroom while filming the opening celebrations at Gorga’s Homemade Pasta & Pizza in May — and her costars were far from impressed from her humble brags about his ejaculation on her shoe.

“Dolores Catania went nuts calling her a pig,” an insider said, noting that Catania made it clear there were children present at Teresa Giudice, Joe Gorga and Melissa Gorga’s family event.
The insiders did not mention if Staub’s daughters, Jillian and Christine, were in attendance.
Staub, 55, and Caffrey, 65, began dating in April 2016, just seven months before she teased her TV return to Radar. Their relationship began shortly after she split from fiancée Joe Masalta.
“My new relationship is public so whatever I do whether it’s this show or another show or anything I do with my life, yes, it’s here to been seen,” she told Radar at the time.
