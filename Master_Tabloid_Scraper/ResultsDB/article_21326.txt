Bill Cosby Admits He Bought Drugs To Give To Women For Sex, According To Read Testimony/n

Will this piece of evidence put Bill Cosby in prison? Time will only tell.
Back in 2005, the actor said in a deposition he received seven prescriptions for Quaaludes over a period of two to three years, with the intent of giving them to women he was going to have sex with.

On Friday, this testimony was read on the fifth day of his sexual assault trial against alleged drugging victim Andrea Constand. According to onlookers, The Bill Cosby Show star put his head in his hands, as the prosecution recited the revealing statement.
In his 2005 words, the comedian said he never gave the drugs to women without their consent, nor did he take them himself. He obtained the sedative because: 

"Young people were using them to party with, and I wanted to have them just in case."
Also, in the deposition, the now-79-year-old said he gave the medication to a woman named "Teresa," and promised to tell Constand's mother what pills he gave her daughter but later changed his mind in fear that their conversation would be recorded.
On Thursday, Cosby said via deposition he gave the former Temple University employee three Benadryls. To make matters more complicated, forensic toxicologist Dr. Timothy Rohrig says both Benadryl and Quaaludes could produce similar side effects (i.e. blurred vision).
The prosecution rested its case on Friday.
