Former Real Housewives of New Jersey cast member Dina Manzo and her boyfriend Dave Cantin were brutally beaten when their townhome in Holmdel, New Jersey was invaded over the weekend.

E! News confirms that Cantin and Manzo flew to New Jersey from their other home in California over the weekend to celebrate Teresa Giudice’s daughter’s first communion because Manzo is her godmother. When they arrived at their townhome after the communion celebration Saturday evening, they were greeted by two masked individuals who rushed towards them.
“Cantin was struck several times with a baseball bat by one of the assailants, while Manzo was punched multiple times by the other assailant,” the report reads. “They were then bound together within the home.”
The robbers escaped with cash and jewelry shortly thereafter. Manzo and Cantin were able to free themselves and call the police, who promptly arrived on the scene. A joint investigation has been initiated by the Holmdel police and the Monmouth County Prosecutor’s Office.

“Dina and David are obviously shaken up from the traumatic and violent home invasion and robbery,” reads a statement from the couple’s attorney. “No one should ever have to go through what they did. They are grateful to law enforcement and the other emergency responders and appreciate everyone’s concern and well-wishes.”
Manzo and Cantin were treated for facial injuries, but they are expected to make a full physical recovery.
