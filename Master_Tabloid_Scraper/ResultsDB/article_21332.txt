The wait for more Making a Murderer episodes is coming to an end.

The true crime docu-series will likely debut its second season later this year, People reports. Though there’s “no launch date set as of yet,” a spokesperson for Netflix says the streaming service hopes to release more episodes before the end of 2017.
Co-creators Moira Demos and Laura Ricciardi are reportedly in Wisconsin’s Manitowac County at the moment gathering footage for the new season.
“Laura and Moira are shooting regularly and working on what the right story is to tell in the next set, so we’re deferring to them on when it will be ready,” Netflix Vice President Cindy Holland told USA Today. “We don’t know when for sure new episodes will be coming.”

Making a Murderer became an instant hit when it debuted in late 2015. Filmed over the span of a decade, the 10-parter followed Steven Avery, a man who was previously falsely imprisoned on a sexual assault charge, as he is tried for the murder of 25-year-old photographer Teresa Halbach. Chronicling Avery’s trial and subsequent conviction, the docu-series raised questions about ethics and the law enforcement in Manitowac County.
Avery’s nephew, Brendan Dassey, who is currently in jail for being a party to Halbach’s murder, was ordered to be released last year when it was determined that his recorded confession was involuntary. However, an appeals court overturned the ruling last November, ordering Dassey to remain incarcerated pending the resolution of an appeal to the overturned conviction.
