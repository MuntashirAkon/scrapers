John Legend and Chrissy Teigen didn’t become household names by laying low and taking it easy. That means this is a family that travels nearly constantly. But these two make it work by taking the time show their affection and keeping the bliss in their marriage!

“You just have to make time for each other, go on little trips like we did for her birthday and go to dinner just the two of you sometimes,” Legend told E! News. “You still have to have romance time.”
“Yes, and travel away from each other a lot. That helps,” Teigen added.

Surprising? The 31-year-old explained that she and her hubby believe that absence makes the heart grow fonder.
“We’re not together 365,” she said. “It’s nice to be able to really be like, ‘Oh my gosh, I miss you. I miss you so much.’ That works for both of us.”
And although these two don’t hide how much they enjoy hitting the sand and surf together, the arrival of baby Luna has definitely shifted priorities.
“You know, John and I have been traveling for so many years now. We go somewhere tropical. It’s our big time of the year where we can actually get away and he’s not touring or working so we go away and we go to a beach but now it doesn’t feel right to go to some romantic resort,” Teigen said. “We want to be at home with the baby and experience Christmas.”
