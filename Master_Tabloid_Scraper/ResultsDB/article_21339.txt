Just when Brendan Dassey got so close to freedom that he could almost taste it, a federal appeals court just ruled that the Making a Murderer subject, who has spent almost a decade behind bars for the murder of photographer Teresa Halbach, will not be released from prison.

According to TMZ, the appeals court told Wisconsin prison officials to ignore the ruling of a lower court, which ordered for the release of Dassey this week, because prosecutors should be granted the time to appeal the ruling that the 27-year-old’s conviction was unconstitutional.
As previously reported, Dassey was ordered to be released when his conviction was overturned on Aug. 12, 2016. It was determined that his basic constitutional rights were violated when authorities interrogated the then 16-year-old without an adult present and coerced a confession for the murder.
Dassey and his uncle, Steven Avery, were sentenced to life in prison after going through separate trials where the teen’s confession played a big part in the prosecution’s argument.
The lack of oversight in the handling of the cases was the focus of Netflix docu-series.
