Teresa Giudice Has ‘Low-Key’ Birthday with Family as Husband Joe Serves Out 41-Month Prison Sentence/n

 
Teresa Giudice is ringing in her 45th birthday with family by her side as she waits for her husband to come home.
According to a source close to the reality star, “Teresa had a small private family party last night at her house. It was very low-key.”
On Thursday, she shared a post to Instagram with her four look-alike-daughters — Gia, Gabriella, Milania and Audriana — and cake!
“Celebrating my Birthday 🎉 with my girls ❤️🎂,” the Real Housewives of New Jersey star captioned her beaming photo.
Giudice’s husband Joe Giudice — whose own 45th birthday falls on Monday — was absent. He is currently serving out a 41-month prison sentence for bankruptcy fraud at the Federal Correctional Institution in Fort Dix, New Jersey. In January 2015, the Bravolebrity began her own 15-month sentence for fraud.
Giudice told PEOPLE in September that, thanks to her girls, she’s able to face each and every day without as much loneliness.
“What keeps me busy is my girls. I swear, that’s what makes the days go by. If I didn’t have them, I’d probably go crazy,” she said.
“Then I would really think about him 24/7 and it wouldn’t be easy,” she continued. “That’s what he said, too: ‘That’s what got me through the day was the girls. They kept me busy.’ And that’s how I am, I’m going through the motions of each day. I just can’t wait for each day to pass by for him to come home.”
RHONJ co-star Dolores Catania wished Giudice her “best year yet,” captioning her Instagram post, “Happy Birthday to one of my oldest and dearest friends! Teresa you are one of the strongest women I know and I am blessed to have you in my life. Cheers to you love🍾💕 I hope this year is the best yet for you!”
Sister-in-law Melissa Gorga also got in on the social media fun, posing with Giudice and her cake.
