Teresa Giudice Shares Photo of Dina Manzo Taken Just Hours Before Violent Home Invasion: ‘We Love You’/n

Teresa Giudice is sending all the love to her former Real Housewives of New Jersey costar Dina Manzo in the wake of her violent home invasion.
Giudice, 44, took to Instagram on Tuesday to share a photo of her daughter Audriana, 7, alongside Manzo, 45, at Audriana’s First Communion party on Saturday — which was snapped just hours before Manzo and her millionaire boyfriend David Cantin were beaten and bound by intruders at their New Jersey townhouse.
“Audriana & Godmother,” Giudice captioned the post, adding a heart emoji. “We love you @dinamanzo & Dave.”





 Audriana & Godmother ❤️ We love you @dinamanzo & Dave 🙏

Manzo and Cantin, 37, returned home just before 11 p.m. on Saturday to the townhouse they share in Holmdel. They were then attacked by two assailants who rushed at them as they opened the door, according to the Monmouth County Prosecutor’s Office.
One of the assailants hit Cantin several times with a baseball bat, while the other punched Manzo “multiple times,” according to a release from the prosecutor’s office. The thieves tied the couple up and made off with personal belongings, including cash and jewelry, the release states.
According to the release, Cantin was able to free himself and call police. Holmdel police and detectives with the prosecutor’s office arrived on the scene and Manzo and Cantin were transported to a local hospital. Cantin suffered “significant” injuries to his face, including a broken nose, according to the prosecutor’s office. Manzo was treated for facial injuries, and she and Cantin were later released.

Police are continuing to look for suspects, and Andrew B. Brettler, an attorney for the couple, told PEOPLE the two are “are obviously shaken up from the traumatic and violent home invasion and robbery.”
“No one should ever have to go through what they did,” Brettler added. “They are grateful to law enforcement and the other emergency responders and appreciate everyone’s concern and well-wishes.”
