Teresa Giudice and Danielle Staub Reunite and Not a Table Was Flipped/n
Are pigs flying? Because Teresa Giudice and Danielle Staub just hung out without any drama!In fact, the two reunited in just the opposite manner: practicing patience and calmness while attending a yoga class together on Wednesday (yes, our mouths dropped, too).Giudice took to Twitter to prove they're no longer enemies, sharing a photo from their yoga mats together while posing with their hands at heart's center.  "Loved catching up & bonding this am with @daniellestaub at JZT Dance & Yoga," she captioned the picture alongside the hashtags, "#RHONJ #OG'S #NAMASTE."

So does this mean Staub could be making her return to the Real Housewives of New Jersey? A source tells E! News, "I think her name is definitely being discussed. I mean, look at Andy's reaction to Teresa's tweet."Meanwhile, we also discussed the potential of her return with Cohen in August who told us, "I never say never."

He added, "The Housewives are like the mafia, once you're in you're in. I always love the idea of a dramatic return. It's really cool. I think if you look at OC at the end of the season we're always kind of having former Housewives at least come back for a cameo at the end of the season."We can't wait to see what unfolds now!
