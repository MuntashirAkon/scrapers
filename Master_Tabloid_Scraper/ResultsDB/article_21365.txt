Teresa and Joe Giudice -- No More Financial Funny Businesses ... Ordered to Keep Money Separate/nTeresa Giudice and hubby Joe Giudice are each criminals, but together they are diabolically criminal ... so says the sentencing judge who ordered each of them to put a wall between the other's finances.According to court docs ... the  "Real Housewives of New Jersey " stars were ordered to keep their personal and business accounts completely separate.They've each been ordered to pay more than $400K in restitution.  It appears at the very least the judge does not want Teresa to pay Joe's debt and vice versa.  Fact is ... it's unclear what Joe really does for work, so he's the one who apparently is screwed by the order.Another point in the docs ... the judge said she did not consider  "anonymous letters and phone calls from the public in regards to sentencing. " We're guessing those letters and calls did not contain the word  "mercy " ... at least for Joe./n
