Teresa Giudice -- No Poussey For You In Prison!/nTeresa Giudice will serve time in the prison that was the inspiration for  "Orange is the New Black " ... but there will be no hookups AND she won't be as fashionable.We got hold of the prison handbook for the Federal Correctional Institution in Danbury, CT -- where she'll serve her 15 months -- and the rules FORBID intimate relations between inmates -- a la Poussey and Taystee.And she can forget prison chic -- the official uniform is grey, khaki, white, or pastel green. Giudice will get family visits ... where kissing and touching IS allowed ... but her 4 daughters and Joe will max out at 12 visits a month.  She'll also have to work ... most likely in one of the prison factories -- those jobs generally go to inmates who have to pay off huge restitution debts, so she qualifies.As for buying stuff ... inmates are limited to $320 /mo. at the prison store. She's allowed to beautify herself at the prison barber shop. Come to think of it ... it's a lot like Jersey./n
