Teresa Giudice -- Prison Beauty Regimen ... Coffee Grinds and Vaseline/nTeresa Giudice doesn't have access to MAC products, but a company has jerry-rigged a Sephora-like experience that will keep her fresh and young-ish.PRIV -- an app that sends a beauty expert straight to your door -- sent Teresa a letter offering beauty hacks for pretty women behind bars. The products generally have a primary purpose that is not cosmetic, but they work in a pinch. They include:-- Vaseline, which acts as a lip exfoliant. PRIV advises that Teresa gently use a toothbrush to buff her lips with the lubricant, wipe with cool water and dab dry. -- Advil Liqui-Gels. Break open the capsule. It's great for acne.-- Protein Powder. Add a few scoops to the commissary conditioner. It boosts hair growth and locks in the moisture and shine. -- Uncooked Oatmeal and Coffee Grinds. Great for the skin. Combine in equal parts and add just enough water to make a paste for a simple scrub. The oatmeal soothes while the coffee invigorates the skin.It's like if MacGyver went to beauty school./n
