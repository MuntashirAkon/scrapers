'Real Housewives' Star Sued -- She's a Cheapskate with Dirty Laundry/n "Real Housewives of New Jersey " star Teresa Aprea has been slapped with a huge laundry bill -- her employees claim she shorted their checks and made 'em pay to clean their own uniforms. According to court docs ... a former bartender and server at Aprea's NYC restaurant Angelo's of Mulberry St. says Aprea and her husband would only pay them for 7 hours -- even though they routinely worked 10 hour shifts. They also claim they paid out-of-pocket to wash their unis ... but NY law requires employers to pony up.  It's gotta sting ... Aprea famously told Teresa Giudice  -- serving 15-months for fraud --  "karma's a bitch " ...  but now she's the one facing a class action suit. The employees' attorney -- David Gottlieb -- is demanding the Apreas shell out up to $2500 per worker for unpaid wages and overtime, uniform cleaning costs, plus an unspecified amount of damages. Bravo, Karma./n
