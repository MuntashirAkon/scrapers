'Little Women' War! Lila Call SLAMS 'DWTS' Star Terra Jole In Epic Diss/n
Lila Call isn’t voting for Terra Jole on Dancing With the Stars anytime soon!
Call, 37, revealed to RadarOnline.com exclusively that she refuses to make up with Jole, 36, even though she’s a “pioneer” for little people in the dance community.
“I’m totally stoked for her in all honesty, and just being humble, like what a pioneer,” Call told Radar. “I keep saying that, she really is forget about being little, she just had a baby!”

Radar exclusively reported that Jole welcomed Grayson Vicent Gnoffo earlier this summer.
“She actually is doing a really great thing by trying [to compete],” she explained, noting that the completion is unfair due to her much shorter legs. Call then suggested she should have been casted with Jason Perez, or another little person professional dancer instead of Sasha Farber.
“Terra is probably a little taller than me, I know she’s fatter than me, but she’s taller than me,” she added of her nemesis.

“She’s huge!” she continued. “Did you ever see that big fat cupcake a**?”
“I try to slow it down to look at the footwork to see if technicality and things like that were there, I don’t think there was,” she confessed of watching Jole’s performances. “I don’t think it’s possible — our bodies just don’t do that.”
