Kate Moss Marries -- Congratulations Mrs. Hince!/n
By Radar Staff
Congratulations, Kate Moss, or should that be Kate Hince?
The 37-year-old super model wed long time love Jamie Hince in Southrop, Oxforshire on Friday afternoon and RadarOnline.com has the photos. The ceremony took place in St. Peter’s Church and the controversial cat-walker wore a white vintage inspired John Galliano gown, despite rumors that she would design her own wedding dress.

Moss paired the stunning gown with Manolo Blahnik pumps and adorned her golden blonde hair, worn loose and natural, with a floral headband and veil. Equally fashion-forward Jamie, who plays guitar for the band The Kills, wore a light blue suit and sunglasses.
The happy couple posed for photos surrounded by their super cute pint-sized bridesmaids and in true newlywed style, happily kissed for the camera.

Fifteen bridesmaids attended to the bride, including Kate’s eight-year-old daughter, Lila Grace. The wedding is said to have cost over $500,000 and will last three days. Fellow model Naomi Campbell arrived moments after the bride in an eye popping, bright yellow, skintight dress.
Ever the party girl, Kate hit up her local pub, The Swan in Southrop, the night before the nuptials and enjoyed a glass of champagne with her brother Nick and ex-boyfriend and baby daddy, Jefferson Hack.

Kate was previously engaged to actor Johnny Depp, and embattled Libertines frontman Pete Doherty, but neither ever made it to the altar.
