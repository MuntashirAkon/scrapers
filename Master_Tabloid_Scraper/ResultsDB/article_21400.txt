The Daily Mirror reported that the supermodel wore a sheer white gown and walked down the aisle barefoot in the small ceremony, which was kept under wraps so the paparazzi wouldn’t catch wind of it.
Moss, 36, and Hince, 40, met in 2007 after being introduced by Jude Law’s ex-wife Sadie Frost backstage at a Kills concert just three months after Moss had ended a relationship with another rocker, Pete Doherty.
