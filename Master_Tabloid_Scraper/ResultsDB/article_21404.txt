Kate Moss Engaged To Kills Guitarist Jaime Hince/n
Supermodel Kate Moss and her musician boyfriend Jamie Hince are engaged.
Hince, the guitarist for The Kills, proposed to Moss on her 36th birthday, meeting up with her on the West Indies island getaway of Mystique, where she was working on location.
Moss and Hince met in 2007 after being introduced by Jude Law’s ex-wife, Sadie Frost, backstage at a Kills concert just three months after Moss had ended her relationship with another rocker, Pete Doherty.
Moss has an 8-year-old daughter, Lila Grace, from her previous relationship with ex-boyfriend Jefferson Hack, a former magazine executive.
“Kate and Jamie are in a very good place,” a source told the UK Daily Mail. “They already live together and this is the next step to settling down for good.” /n
