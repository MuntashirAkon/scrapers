Kourtney Kardashian is taking the plunge with her new man!

Just a day after she was spotted attending church with Younes Bendjima, 38-year-old reality star enjoyed a sexy fun night out at new West Hollywood hotspot, Poppy. Clad in a cleavage-baring LBD and matching black booties, the mom-of-three hit up the nightclub with her young beau in tow as they partied late night the night.
An onlooker told Celebuzz the couple held court in their own private VIP booth before Kendall Jenner, who was dining at sister lounge Delilah nearby, joined them inside Gucci-inspired club.

“It was Kourtney’s night to let loose,” our insider dished. “She just wants to have fun with Younes right now.”
Other celebrities spotted checking out the newly opened bar that night included Adam Lambert, Johnny Galecki, Madison Beer, Gigi Gorgeous, and director Len Wiseman.
According to The Hollywood Reporter, the space is expected to attract A-listers like Gwyneth Paltrow, Justin Bieber, Kanye West, Kate Hudson, and Drake in the coming months. Katy Perry — a longtime patron of h.wood Group’s establishments around town — has already rented out the place for her VMAs after-party this weekend.
