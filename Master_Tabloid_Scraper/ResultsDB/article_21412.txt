With a collaboration on the way, Jennifer Lopez and Drake’s blossoming romance seems to be a match made in PR heaven. But is it really legit?

As the two continue to flaunt their love on social media and live out our #RelationshipGoals, a source close to Lopez is saying that the relationship is actually “the real deal.”
“They’ve gotten very close fast,” the insider dishes to Us Weekly, adding that Lopez “gets really excited to see him” when Drake’s in town.
“He’s not only a sexy guy,” the JLo confidant explains, “but it’s great for her image to be dating the hottest rapper in the game.”

As previously reported, the duo first sparked romance rumors when Drake, 30, was seen attending two of the “Ain’t Your Mama” singer’s Las Vegas shows in one week. Days later, the Canadian rapper shut down West Hollywood hotspot Delilah and invited Lopez, 47, to an intimate shindig he was throwing for only a handful of friends. They were spotted leaving the private party together that night.
Last week, the couple shared a photo of them cuddling before attending a winter wonderland-themed formal together. According to a source, Drake threw the bash after learning that Lopez had never attended prom.
“He wanted her to have that experience,” the insider says. “She was his childhood crush!”
The source adds, “They’re both single, attractive and have a lot in common, so it’s natural. They really like each other.”
