Sealed with a kiss! Drake and Jennifer Lopez just confirmed that they are more than friends by locking lips in a series of Instagram videos.

Days after they were photographed cuddling together, the rumored couple attended a prom-themed winter formal party, where they were filmed kissing on the dance floor after being named king and queen of the evening. In several clips that surfaced online, Drake and Lopez couldn’t keep their hands off each other as they traded smooches and danced along to what sounded like their soon-to-be released collaboration.

The twosome even happily posed for pictures in the photo booth, where Drake cozied up with Lopez as his hand rested just slightly above the “Ain’t Your Mama” singer’s signature booty.
“Jen loves the attention and she seems very happy to be spending time with him,” a source told People. “Drake is very charming. He treats Jen with lots of respect. She seems very smitten.”

The duo first sparked romance rumors when Drake was seen attending two of J.Lo’s Las Vegas shows in one week. Days later, the Canadian rapper shut down West Hollywood hotspot Delilah and invited Lopez to an intimate shindig he was throwing for only a handful of friends. The couple were spotted leaving the private party together that night.
