Drake and Jennifer Lopez have been spending a lot of time together lately. So naturally, when two single and famous people are seen in the same space, romance rumors are are swirling.

Apparently, sources are telling TMZ that it’s “only a matter of time” before the two music powerhouses take their relationship to the next level. Though the two are currently just close friends working on music together, Drizzy and J.Lo are “pretty clearly going in that direction,” according to the publication.
Dating rumors first sparked when Drake was seen at not one, but two of Lopez’s Las Vegas shows in the span of one week. At the time, the Canadian rapper shared a selfie with the singer on his Instagram, captioning the photo with a “😍” emoji.

On Monday (Dec. 19, 2016), Drake reportedly shut down West Hollywood hotspot Delilah, where he hosted his 30th birthday party earlier this year, for an intimate dinner with 20 other guests. Amongst the attendees was none other than Lopez, who just finished her final All I Have performance for the year.
Should we start calling them Dralo now?
