Just days after she was photographed canoodling with Val Chmerkovskiy, Amber Rose continued to fuel romance rumors when she was spotted out on a quiet dinner date with the Dancing with the Stars pro.

The rumored couple reportedly enjoyed an intimate and romantic evening together at new West Hollywood hotspot, Delilah, on Wednesday (Oct. 21, 2016). Cozying up at a private table at the posh restaurant, Rose, 33, and Chmerkovskiy, 30, were seen being “flirty” with their faces “super close” all night.
“They were sitting at a big booth and it was just the two of them sitting very close together in the middle,” an insider told E! News. “As they were sitting next to each other, their hands intertwined—definitely a date night.”

While nothing has been confirmed, Chmerkovskiy definitely didn’t deny his chemistry with the mom-of-one when he was recently asked about the dating rumors.
“I’d make a cute couple with a lot of people, you know what I’m sayin’?” the dancer, who is the brother of Rose’s Dancing with the Stars partner, recently told Entertainment Tonight. “I can’t control what people think. I live my life and I try to live it, you know, the way I want to live it.”
