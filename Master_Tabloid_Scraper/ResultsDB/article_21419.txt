Lila Says/n
Lila says a lot of things...a lot of tantalizing things. In Ziad Doueiri's adaptation of the sexually charged Gallic novel of the same name, Frenchie Vahina Giocante plays the titular vixen living in her county's poor Arab community. The Lolita teases the boys with her frank talk and short shorts, getting sensitive Mohammed Khouas and his pals especially aroused.

 But East quickly clashes with West when Khouas' coarse friends decide she must be humiliated for ignoring their foul-mouthed come-ons. Khouas is forced to take sides, and the picture's tense conclusion is, unfortunately, no surprise. But it's the performances make this film compelling, especially the subtle, noble vulnerability that Khouas brings to his role. He could've been played for a victim; instead he's a hero. Lila's nice and all, but it's Khouas whom we fall for in this flick.
