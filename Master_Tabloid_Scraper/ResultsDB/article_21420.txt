Kate Moss is used to gracing the cover of just about any edition of Vogue, but this month marks the very first time that the world-famous model has landed a cover shoot with her teenage daughter Lila Grace Hack.The look-alike duo posed for Vogue Italia's June issue, snapped by famed photographer Mario Sorrenti, and the gorgeous black-and-white shots are just now making their way online.The magazine posted the very first glimpse at the cover on Instagram, noting that the stunning mother-daughter twosome was both wearing Versace for the "it's all about family"-themed spread.

But it's important to note that this isn't Lila's big Vogue debut, as she was featured in the pages of Vogue back in 2011 when she was a bridesmaid in her mother's wedding to Jamie Hince.Earlier this week, Kate opened up to Net-a-Porter's The Edit about her parenting tips, saying, "I'm really strict, but I think they quite like it. [Lila] says that I'm stricter than other parents."She added, "I don't have to say anything. You've got to get a look down. Girls, you have to scare them, otherwise they will take over."And by takeover, does she mean the modeling world? Only time will tell for 13-year-old Lila!
