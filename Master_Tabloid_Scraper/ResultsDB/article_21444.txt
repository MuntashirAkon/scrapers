Josh Turner Slammed By PETA As New 'Walter Palmer' After Hog Hunt/n
Animal lovers caused uproar around the world after American dentist Walter Palmer gunned Cecil the Lion down last July in Africa.
Now, country singer Josh Turner, 38, is in the line of fire after posing for a picture with a wild hog he helped hunt down.
“The overwhelming majority of people today have condemned the Walter Palmer–style trophy hunters of the world, yet here’s Josh Turner grinning over an animal’s still-cooling body,” PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) Senior Vice President Lisa Lange told RadarOnline.com exclusively. “It took four grown men to lift this majestic animal’s corpse, but it takes a truly small person to gun down a living being just for a thrill.”

According to a press release, Turner joined Mike Pawlawski, a former football player, on a hunt for the pig in December during a trip to the West Coast.
The hunt was filmed for an episode of Outdoor Channel’s Gridiron Outdoors, which will be airing on Valentine’s Day.
“What an exciting day,” Turner said of the hunt. “Mike and the guys were great to hunt with and this hog is incredible.”
