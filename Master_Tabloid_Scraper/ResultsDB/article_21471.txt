The Ally for Equality Award recognizes the efforts of those who use their voice to stand with and for the LGTBQ community and is given to allies outside of the community who stand up on behalf of equality for all Americans. Streep is considered an icon to LGBTQ people and has starred in several roles that raise awareness of the unique challenges that LGBTQ people face.
