Yesterday (Nov. 10, 2016), the Hollywood Foreign Press Association made a historic announcement: instead of just one Miss Golden Globes next year, Sylvester Stallone’s three daughters — Sophia, Sistine and Scarlet Stallone — will all share the honor!

The announcement was made via Instagram from awards show’s own account. They included an image of the Creed star surrounded by his daughters while holding his prize for Best Supporting Actor.

Sophia, Sistine and Scarlet released a statement expressing their gratitude for the commendation and the chance to play a role in what is always a highlight of awards season.
“We’re thrilled to not only be part of the Golden Globe tradition, but to be making history as the first set of siblings ever chosen for the title and duties,” they wrote, via E! News. “We are proud to be part of the HFPA family, an organization that multiple times has recognized our father’s work in film.”
Last night, awards season unofficially kicked off with a glitzy event hosted by champagne label Möet & Chandon to honor the three newest Miss Golden Globes honorees. Guests included Jessica Chastain, Octavia Spencer, Casey Affleck, Emma Stone, Jenna Dewan Tatum, Stallone and more.
