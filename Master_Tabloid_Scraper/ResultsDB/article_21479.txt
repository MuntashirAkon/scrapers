Saturday Night Live continued their parody of the comedy-rich presidential race on Saturday (Oct. 15, 2016) by spoofing the second Town Hall presidential debate in their cold opening.
Naturally, both candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump were made fun of, but the Republican nominee received a few more jabs. The best part is Alec Baldwin as Trump stalking Kate McKinnon’s Clinton like the shark in Jaws. Watch below!





Up to this point, the real Trump has stayed quiet about all of SNL’s parodies, but last night he had enough, tweeting, “Watched Saturday Night Live hit job on me. Time to retire the boring and unfunny show. Alec Baldwin portrayal stinks. Media rigging election!”

Trump’s ire could have also been aimed at this SNL mock music video, in which Cecily Strong as Melania Trump, host Emily Blunt as Ivanka Trump and other women in Trump’s life parody Beyoncé‘s cheating-man anthem “Sorry.” This is just the best thing ever.





For her first hosting stint, Blunt did a fab job. Here are a few other highlights:










And musical guest Bruno Mars kickin’ it!
