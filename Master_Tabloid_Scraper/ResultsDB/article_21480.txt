It was one wild three-and-a-half hour ride at the 2016 Grammy Awards.
Kendrick Lamar had a huge night, while the biggest disappointment of the night was Rihanna cancelling her appearance.
Lamar gave the most powerful and politically charged performance of the show.

His performance at Sunday night’s Grammy awards was staged in a prison set, with Lamar leading a chain gang—handcuffs and all. He lurched into a medley of “The Blacker the Berry” and “Alright,” escaping from the chains to perform in front of a gigantic fire and eventually return to a solitary microphone.

Lady Gaga showed everyone how a tribute it done. David Bowie would have been more than proud with the medley of songs Gaga performed. The girl knows how to commit and deliver!
Unfortunately, Adele’s performance was one of the many plagued by poor sound and technical glitches that marred the show (she still slayed). I have a feeling some of the tech guys will not be coming back next year!

Other stand out performance were given by Justin Bieber, Demi Lovato during the Lionel Richie tribute and Taylor Swift’s Kanye West shade throw. At least we were blessed by Beyoncé‘s presence.
