Jericho the Lion -- Cecil's 'Brother' -- Alive and Well!!! (PHOTO)/nJericho -- the so-called  "brother " of Cecil The Lion -- is doing just fine, despite reports he met the same fate as the beloved fallen beast. Jericho was spotted early Sunday in Zimbabwe. Here's what's really interesting.  Jericho and Cecil were not related, but in the jungle it doesn't matter much.  There's such a  thing as  "cooperative coalitions " between unrelated male lions, who band together to protect their territories.   As the studies go, 42% of these coalitions involve lions who have no blood relation. It's kind of like a reality show, except way more awesome./n
