Another American Hunter -- Brags On Social Media About Killing African Animals/nSabrina Corgatelli, is catching a lot of heat after gushing about killing a wide range of animals at South Africa's Kruger National Park last week. Sabrina, an accountant at Idaho State University, displayed her  "kill shots " on Facebook where it sparked loads of criticism ... especially after the public outcry for Cecil the Lion. She doesn’t seem to understand the criticism though ... telling the Today Show --  "Everybody just thinks we're cold-hearted killers, and it's not that. There is a connection with the animal, and just because we hunt them doesn't mean we don't have a respect for them. " She tried to lessen the backlash by saying giraffes are very dangerous animals … but no one seems to be buying it … probably because she was the one making the kill./n
