Summer Shadow: Cle de Peau's Amazonite/n
Though best known for their ridiculously amazing concealer, Cle de Peau has an extensive makeup line, which we have recently become obsessed with! While many makeup products can dry out your skin, every eye shadow, mascara and lipstick we have sampled from the collection has left our skin feeling smooth and refreshed.
Cle de Peau’s Must-Have Concealer
One of our favorite new products, is their Satin Eye Color ($45).  Available in every shade under the sun, from Obsidian, a smoky black, to pink opal, a peachy pink, the luxuriously smooth shadow manages to stay on our lids all day, without ending up under our eyes.  We also love the sleek, navy blue compact the shadow comes in, which contains a mini mirror and brush.
