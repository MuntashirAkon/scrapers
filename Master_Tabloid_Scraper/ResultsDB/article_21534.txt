Donald Trump Jr. Comes For Ken Jennings After The Jeopardy Champ Makes Brutal Barron Trump Joke!/n

We'll take "Awkward Twitter Spars" for $500, Alex.
Ken Jennings is famous for holding the record for the longest winning streak on Jeopardy! — but some are calling the game show vet a big loser after he made a brutal joke about Barron Trump.

On Wednesday, Jennings tweeted a joke about Donald Trump's youngest son, poking fun at reports that the 11-year-old thought Kathy Griffin's photo shoot with his dad's decapitated head was the real deal.
He shared: 

Barron Trump saw a very long necktie on a heap of expired deli meat in a dumpster. He thought it was his dad & his little heart is breaking

Yeesh.
After some criticized Jennings for making a savage joke about a child fearing the death of his father, the former contestant redirected attention to the president, quipping:

But by then, it was too late. Conservatives came for Jennings on social media — including Barron's big bro Donald Trump Jr., who publically condemned Jennings' jab, writing:

It takes a real man to pick on an 11 year old. Yet another low from the left, but they will rationalize this away with their usual excuses. https://t.co/JDF3VsVEJ1

And soon, more conservatives fueled the already flaming dumpster fire.

Right-wing blogger Ginger McQueen pointed out Jennings writes children's books for Simon & Schuster, and encouraged Barron-defenders to threaten a boycott to the publishing house — which Donny Jr. couldn't help but jump at as well:

He writes children's books for Simon & Schuster. Call them at 1(800) 223-2336, then chose option 4. Yes, this is the jackass from Jeopardy. https://t.co/lVJGJ1SvyC

Good point, you would think that in this day & age @simonandschuster would have an issue with one of their children's authors bullying a kid https://t.co/S4Bxs7AnSs

But in the end, it was Jennings who got the last bitter laugh. The Jeopardy champ wrote a retort to DJ, referencing his widely-criticized affinity for big game hunting:

I will kill as many white rhinos as it takes to prove my masculinity to Donald Trump Jr. https://t.co/mm8YzH2NPB
