VOTE: Are #BarbedWireBrows Officially Taking Things Too Far??/n

So, apparently barbed-wire eyebrows are happening now…
And we were just trying to get over that whole feathered brow thing y'all were trying to get us on board with!
The new trend was coined by makeup artist Athena Paginton last month, and now it seems to be picking up a lot of steam in the fashion world!
