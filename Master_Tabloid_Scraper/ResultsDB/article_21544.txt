Other celebrity backers of the movement include Alicia Keys, Rihanna, and Beyoncé.
Black Lives Matter was founded in 2013 by Patrisse Cullors, Alicia Garza, and Opal Tometi and is, as its website describes, “a call to action and a response to the virulent anti-Black racism” permeating society that intends to broaden the conversation around state violence as it relates to the Black community.
