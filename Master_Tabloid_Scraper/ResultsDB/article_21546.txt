You may have noticed a disturbing domestic violence campaign out right now.
Famous faces including Kim Kardashian, Kendall Jenner have been digitally altered by artist and activist Alexsandro Palombo for his “No Woman is Immune from Domestic Violence” project. He posted these disturbing images of famous female celebs with black eyes, bruises, and cuts on their faces on his Facebook page.

Palombo said the aim of the project was to persuade victims of abuse to break the silence of their situation, as well as raising awareness that all women could be victims of abuse. However, TMZ reports that the Kardashian/Jenner clan’s lawyers are are issuing a warning to the artist for using their images without consent.
But, it turns out that the images used are from commercially-available paparazzi shots, therefore, technically he’s allowed to. His rep told ET, “This new series is a contemporary art series, so no need [to get] the consent of the celebrity.”
Despite the controversy and how disturbing the photos are, their shock value will hopefully motivate more people to take action against domestic violence.
