Meanwhile, E! News reports that Gigi is doing just fine since her split from Joe. “Gigi is doing amazing. She has so many friends and family around her at this time. She is still good friends with Joe. They don’t have any bad blood whatsoever, and they were always going to remain being friends,” a source told the publication.
We’d say based on her busy modeling career, Gigi will find a way to move on.
