President Barack Obama turned to song for comfort on Friday (June 26, 2015) when he delivered the eulogy at the funeral for Charleston shooting victim Reverend Clementa Pinckney.
Pinckney, a 41-year-old state senator and pastor, was one of nine people killed in a racially charged rampage last week at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C.
In the eulogy, Obama touched on the church being a sacred place “not just for blacks, or Christians, but for every American who cares about the expansion of liberty. That’s what the church meant.”
Obama also gave his two cents on the importance of removing the Confederate battle flag from places of honor.
“By taking down that flag, we express God’s Grace. But I don’t think God wants us to stop there… for too long, we’ve been blinded to the way past injustices continue to shape the present. Perhaps we see that now. Perhaps this tragedy causes us to ask some tough questions.”
The President then delivered the first few lines of “Amazing Grace” before the crowd inside the College of Charleston TD Arena joined in.
Watch the emotional moment, below.
