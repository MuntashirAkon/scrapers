Beyoncé has become the latest celebrity to share her thoughts of the pain being felt in Charleston, S.C. after posting a touching tribute to the victims of the church shooting.

In a 15-second montage the name of the nine worshippers, killed at the historically African-American Methodist Episcopal Church when a gunman opened fire, are scrolling against a backdrop of the church.






 My heart is with the families, loved ones, and all of those affected by the senseless tragedy in Charleston. May they rest in peace.

“My heart is with the families, loved ones, and all of those affected by the senseless tragedy in Charleston. May they rest in peace,” Beyonce wrote alongside the video.
A few hours earlier, Beyoncé’s sister Solange Knowles revealed her shock and grief following the tragedy on social media as well.


Was already weary. Was already heavy hearted. Was already tired.
Where can we be safe? Where can we be free? Where can we be black?

The suspect, 21-year-old Dylann Roof, has been taken into custody following a 14-hour manhunt. He was detained during a traffic stop in Shelby, North Carolina – around 250 miles away from the scene of the shooting.
Sources told NBC News that Roof confessed to the brutal slayings that left nine dead, adding that he claimed he “almost didn’t go through with [the shooting] because everyone was so nice to him.”
However, he eventually decided to “go through with his mission” after sitting with the parishioners for about an hour, sources said.
