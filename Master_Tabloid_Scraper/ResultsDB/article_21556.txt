“#kellyripahair we switched over to #OPAL last night. @sallyhershbergernyc @swartists #pravana no damage #btw,” her colorist Ryan Trygstad shared of the TV host’s new shade on Instagram. (In case you’re not well-versed on rare gemstones, opal stones show off a rainbow of different colors.) And we have to admit we’re amazed that Ripa’s hair still looks so healthy and shiny.

So why the quick change? “Kelly loved it [her blue hair], but was having a little trouble dressing the way she wanted to because the blue hair limited her a bit,” Trygstad told PEOPLE, adding, “It was fading a bit to green and of course, we didn’t want green. We knew this would happen, but we are having a blast playing anyways.”

Ripa’s latest transformation took three hours, according to Trygstad, who is based out of the Sally Hershberger’s N.Y.C. salon.  
“We start by doing a natural color base that is over 80 percent white, then we paint the hair with a low developer of lightener,” he explained of the process. “I always try and be very delicate with Kelly’s hair because it’s all about making sure it’s shiny and beautiful in the end. Then we play with the right tones to customize for her skin.” 
Trygstad added that when it comes to Ripa’s hair, “nothing’s off limits.” 
“I tend to push the softer more delicate tones but they are just more my taste. In the end, it’s whatever she wants.” 





 The healthiest hair in the world 😉 @kellyripa  What color is next ??? 💗💜💛💚❤️ @sallyhershbergernyc @swartists
