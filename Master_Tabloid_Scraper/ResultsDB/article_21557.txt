12 Days of Harry Potter Christmas: Katie Bell Finds the Cursed Opal Necklace/n
The 12 days of Harry Potter Christmas continue over at Pottermore, and Monday’s surprise featured a visual depiction of the moment Gryffindor’s Katie Bell finds the cursed opal necklace in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.  
But first, Potter fans had to solve the day’s riddle, which read: “In snowy Hogsmeade, there s a frightening scene, four students watch Katie Bell rise and scream, the Gryffindor student falls victim to a dastardly scheme, but what position does she play on the Quidditch team?”  
The answer: Chaser. Type that in and you’re rewarded with a short snippet showing the eerie scene in which Bell accidentally gets cursed. The necklace was intended to assassinate Albus Dumbledore.   
Author J.K. Rowling is sharing a new piece of Harry Potter content every day on the site over the 12 days leading to Christmas.   
On the first day, fans got a look at Professor Snape’s past in a short piece about his hometown of Cokeworth.  
Over the weekend, Rowling posted about Diagon Alley (including why she killed Florean Fortescue) and a history of potions and cauldrons. And for those of you who were wondering: No, a Muggle can’t make a potion, even with the right ingredients. Darn.  
More Potter surprises are revealed every day at 8 a.m. EST on Pottermore.
