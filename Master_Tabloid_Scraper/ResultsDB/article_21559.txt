Various Artists
Recording tunes with kiddie appeal doesn’t demand that you sing down to your audience. Keeping this in mind, artists like the Mighty Mighty Bosstones, the Fugees and Aerosmith singer Steven Tyler deliver tracks that even geezers can enjoy on this collection of songs from TV’s Sesame Street. Gloria Estefan, taking a welcome break from droopy ballads, offers peppy tropical pop on “Mambo I, I, I,” while En Vogue turns up the sassy funk on “I Want a Monster to Be My Friend.” Some of the Muppet cameos fall flat—Ernie sounds suspiciously like Kermit the Frog when singing a duet with singer-songwriter Shawn Colvin—but nothing can top the weirdo experience of hearing Kermit talking nonsense with Jimmy Buffett on a breezy confection called “Caribbean Amphibian.” (Sony Wonder)
