She couldn't stay blue for too long!Kelly Ripa has a new hair color y'all, just one week after swapping her bright fuchsia locks to striking teal blue. And this time, she's gone for a kaleidoscopic opal color, debuting the look July 15 on Live With Kelly and Michael.Kelly's colorist Ryan Trygstad posted a shot of the star rocking the new hair hue to his Instagram on Wednesday, writing, "#kellyripahair we switched over to #OPAL last night. @sallyhershbergernyc @swartists #pravana no damage #btw." (We're pretty jealous impressed that the star can jump hair colors three times in two months and still have healthy-looking locks). The beauty's opal locks are more muted than the loud blue look she's been sporting for the last week—but still an eye-catching statement color. To us, the hue is the perfect blend of blond, pink and lilac tones, and warms up Kelly's complexion.Now we just wonder if Justin Bieber likes his crush's new hair color.
