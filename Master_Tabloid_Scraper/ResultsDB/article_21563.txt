Well, Katy Perry Rihanna said it best: Last night was one to "shine bright like a diamond" for celebs taking to the 2015 Grammys red carpet.Music's biggest night brought us plenty of black sheer dresses, boob-baring get-ups and insane star-worthy bling. And on that last note, no one brought it better than The Queen herself: Beyoncé reportedly donned more than $10 million in Lorraine Schwartz diamonds, including 80-carat Colombian emerald-and-diamond chandelier earrings and over 100-carats of emerald and diamond rings.

For her stunning gospel performance, Beyoncé opted for a Monique Pean open collar necklace (made from recycled white gold and ethically-sourced diamonds) worth $132,680.

Queen Bey wasn't the only celeb who wowed in green statement jewels (a major trend from last night's red carpet): Our eyes were on Taylor Swift , who wore a cool $1 million worth of Lorraine Schwartz jewelry, including $350,000 black opal paraiba earrings and matching black opal rings. Lady Gaga, like Beyoncé, sported Lorraine Schwartz emeralds, which the singer wore in the form of 45-carat drop earrings and a sexy pendant necklace.

Rita Ora, meanwhile, complemented her sleek bob with $500,000 worth of Lorraine Schwartz diamonds, including her favorite rocker-chic cuff earrings.

Yes, we were able to spot diamonds amid all that dress: Rihanna's voluminous, tiered Giambattista Valli frock almost (we mean, almost) took the attention away from her flawless beauty look and equally flawless Chopard diamonds (we're talking nearly 40-carats worth of rings). For her performance with Paul McCartney and Kanye West, the singer changed into an oversize Maison Margiela pantsuit and an 81.88-carat platinum-set diamond necklace, also by Chopard. Bling on, RiRi, bling on.

Singer Meghan Trainor took to the red carpet in a stunning black gown (replete with sexy, leg-baring skirt) and Simon G. jewelry. Her simple drop earrings featured 2-carats worth of diamonds and retail for approximately $7,000.

Khloe Kardashian, who attended the GQ and Giorgio Armani Grammy after-party with sisters Kendall Jenner and Kylie Jenner, upped the earring ante with her shoulder-sweeping H. Stern pair, made with 18-carats of noble gold with rock crystals and diamonds. Want them for yourselves? These drop earrings will set you back, oh, just $5,400.—Additional reporting by Kathleen Rhames and Kathryn Eisman
