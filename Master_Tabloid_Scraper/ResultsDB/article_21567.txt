Next, Spears tested Opal's abilities by making him find something she had hidden inside Axis at Planet Hollywood, where her Piece of Me show takes place. "It's something kind of dangerous," she said. "I want you to find it." But, as Harris revealed to Jonas, "Britney has no idea what was hidden in the seats."Spears next appeared on stage with Patterson. "Can you be close to me at all times without anyone noticing?" she asked. Patterson said he could, prompting Spears to ask, "Even when I'm doing this?" As dancers surrounded her from all sides, Patterson attempted to blend in by dancing with them. Patterson claimed he was "very inconspicuous," but his actions said otherwise. Spears danced around Manning, who at one point told her, "You're full of surprises, you know that?"Oh, she knows that, all right.Best Time Ever returns in a new time slot Tuesday at 8 p.m. on NBC.(E! and NBC are both members of the NBCUniversal family.)
