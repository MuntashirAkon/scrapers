In our Insta-Beauty series, we bring you makeup looks inspired by our favorite, summer-worthy photo filters. It's picture perfection…all day long.Move over, Valencia. Maybe next time, Rise. There's a new warm-toned option at our fingertips, and it's giving us a serious summer glow. We're calling it Strobic, inspired by strobing, the highlighting trend taking over red carpets everywhere."Strobing means bringing out highlighted areas of the face even more," said makeup pro Karen Gonzalez. "People want to look luminous."Gone are the days of heavy contouring and super-defined features. This new technique illuminates the areas that natural light touches—the brow bone, cheeks, nose and tip of the upper lip—giving you a radiant complexion like Gigi Hadid or Sarah Hyland. 

"It pretty much looks like there's perfect lighting on your skin," Gonzalez noted. "It still will involve minimal contouring, but strobing gives you that healthy finish with creams and loose powders."The makeup maven suggested using Mac Mineralize Skinfinish in Soft & Gentle, Becca Shimmering Skin Perfector Pressed in Opal or Benefit High Beam Face Highlighter to brighten up your face.To get the look, start by creating a hydrated base with moisturizing skin care products and color-correcting cream or foundation. Then use concealer and highlighter to bring out the same features contouring would do, but without the dark, receding lines. Finish it off with a setting spray for a look that'll last at the beach—and beyond.To get the step-by-step tutorial, click here.
