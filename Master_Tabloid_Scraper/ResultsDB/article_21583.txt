 Lady Antebellum, Arcade Fire & Esperanza Spalding Among Big Winners At Grammys; Justin.../n
In a major upset, jazz musician Esperanza Spalding was named best new artist at the 53rd annual Grammy Awards in Los Angeles on Sunday, beating out favorite Justin Bieber.
However, it was a night for country trio Lady Antebellum which netted five trophies, including record of the year.

The haul also included best country album and album of the year for Need You Now; the title track won prizes for country performance by a group and best country song.
Eminem, who led the field with 10 nominations, walked away with only two prizes and lost out to Lady Gaga and rapper Jay Z, who won three awards each.

In a surprising twist to music’s night of nights, Bieber was left holding nothing at the end of the night after he lost Best New Artist to Spalding and Best Pop Vocal Album, which went to Lady Gaga for Fame Monster.
“I need to say thank you tonight to Whitney Houston,” Gaga said, as she accepted the award.

“I wanted to thank Whitney because when I wrote ‘Born This Way,’ I imagined she was singing it because I wasn’t secure enough in myself to imagine I was a superstar.”
