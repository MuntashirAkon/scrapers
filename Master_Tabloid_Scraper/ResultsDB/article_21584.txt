Dick Van Dyke Rings In His 90th Birthday With A Mary Poppins Flash Mob & Party At Disneyland!/n

Well this is supercalifragilisticexpialidocious, if you ask us!
Dick Van Dyke turned the big 9-0 on Sunday, and the living legend spent the weekend celebrating the big day with a Mary Poppins-themed flash mob and then took the party to Disneyland!
On Saturday, the iconic actor sang along and cheered as dancers dressed as chimney sweepers performed several numbers from the 1964 Disney movie Step In Time, Jolly Holiday, Chim Chim Cher-ee, and Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious. The dance was choreographed by Dena Spellman and Jenna Spellman and took place at The Grove in El Lay.

After the performance, Arlene Silver's husband joined the crowd and led them in singing Let's Go Fly A Kite.
The Dick Van Dyke Show star later tweeted:
"I am very grateful that at 90 years old, I can still go out and play!!"
So awesome!
Ch-ch-check out the highlights from the celebration (below)!
