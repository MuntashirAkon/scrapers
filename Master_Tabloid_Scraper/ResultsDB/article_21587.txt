Ray Sharkey's Daughter Accused of Beating Boyfriend's Mother to Death with a Baseball Bat/n
The daughter of late actor Ray Sharkey has been charged with capital murder after she allegedly bludgeoned her boyfriend’s mother with a baseball bat.  
The Los Angeles District Attorney’s office filed the single charge Tuesday against 26-year-old Cecelia Sharkey, who is being held on $1 million bail. She faces the death penalty if convicted, according to officials.  
Sharkey’s father played a mafia boss on the gritty TV drama series Wiseguy. He died in 1993 from AIDS – four years after his daughter’s birth.  
Prosecutors claim the bat-wielding Sharkey struck Patricia Metropoulos, 54, in the head during an argument early Saturday in Reseda, California. Authorities have yet to disclose what prompted the fight, which unfolded and escalated in Metropoulos’ own backyard.  
An ambulance that was summoned to the scene transported Metropoulos to a nearby hospital, where she was pronounced dead.  
Records indicate Sharkey doesn’t yet have a lawyer representing her. She has not entered a plea to the charge against her.
