Lily Collins and Sam Claflin Look Hot, Pose Pretty in a Stylish New Spread/n
What could be more exciting than seeing Lily Collins back (pun intended) on the red carpet? Seeing her spice up the latest issue of The Edit with her Love, Rosie costar, It Brit Sam Claflin. In the romantic comedy, based on the 2004 Cecelia Ahern novel Where Rainbow’s End, the two play best friends — and it seems they carry the intimacy of a years long relationship into this affectionate spread for the fashion mag.


The Edit


For the piece, Collins is outfitted in designers such as Stella McCartney and Saint Laurent by Heidi Slimane. And while we’re always drawn to the fashion plate’s feminine style, Claflin has created his own phrase for the actress. “She’s a sort of girly girl, like she likes her fashion, she likes her girly things…She’s a dude-y girl,” says Claflin in a video promoting their feature.

And Collins’s take on the actor? “Sam Claflin is an unexpected goofball … a gentleman, an old-school kind of fella,” she says in the video.
As for the duo’s obvious on-screen chemistry, says Collins in the issue, “The second I met Sam, I felt as though I had known him a year. I’d say he’s an old soul, so silly, a total bloke. He made me feel so confident. I trusted him right away.”

The film, which also stars model Suki Waterhouse, doesn’t hit theaters stateside until 2015. Until then, we’ll bask in the duo’s dreamy wardrobe (her dress above is Alessandra Rich, and his outfit Burberry) — and this trailer for the movie.

Are you going to check out the duo’s rom-com when it hits the US next year? Does the video convince you?
