Picks and Pans Review: First Office Family Photo Pam and Jim's Baby!/n

It’s a girl for The Office’s Pam (Jenna Fischer) and Jim Halpert (John Krasinski), who welcomed their pink bundle of joy on the March 4 episode.
Jenna Fischer was in the midst of a baby bonanza while shooting her Office delivery scenes—and not just because her child was played by two sets of infant twins. “The same week we were shooting this, I was becoming an aunt for the first time,” says Fischer, who successfully lobbied the show’s writers to name Pam’s baby after her new niece: Cecelia. Fischer, 35, consulted her younger sister Emily about the birthing scenes (“I was calling her all the time asking, ‘Pam is five centimeters dilated; what should she be acting like?'”) and celebrated Pam’s Office “maternity leave” by spending a week with Emily and Cecelia. “It was very good research!” says Fischer, who is engaged to writer Lee Kirk. “This made me more excited to experience that myself.”
