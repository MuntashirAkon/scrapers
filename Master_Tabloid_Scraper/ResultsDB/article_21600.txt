A New ‘Jersey Shore’?! Producers Secretly Filming Spinoff/n
Get ready for Jersey Shore: Redneck Edition!
RadarOnline.com has learned VH-1 cameras are currently rolling on a group of wild and crazy locals at a famous Panama City Beach bar that straddles the Florida-Alabama border. And the team behind the show is the same one that made Jersey Shore a national phenomenon, including Executive Producer Sally Ann Salsano.
Snooki, The Situation and their pals will NOT be on camera this time around.

This time, the new show will be titled Flora-Bama, after the famous roadhouse saloon that literally sits on the border of the two states.
So far, Radar has learned, all castmates are staunch Donald Trump-supporters…except for one defiant woman.
“Once the alcohol starts to pour and the castmates hit the bars or just kick it at home, it’s gonna get crazy really quick,” the source said.

A Panama City Beach Police official confirmed authorities have noticed “some TV producers poking around town.”
“The town doesn’t know what’s gonna hit them once the cameras roll!” the source told Radar.
