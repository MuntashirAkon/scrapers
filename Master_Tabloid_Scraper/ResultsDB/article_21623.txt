In case you aren’t aware, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck are from Boston, Massachusetts. That means these two Oscar-winners are super fans of Patriots quarterback Tom Brady. In a new video for the non-profit Omaze, Damon and Affleck put their competing bromances on full display with some amazing results.

First, the two movie stars log on to a Skype-like chat to tell viewers that a lucky winner is going to get the chance to hangout with all three New Englanders by donating just $10 to support their charities. But, before long, Damon and Affleck begin trading petty insults over who is a better friend to the NFL champ. The debate gets so heated that neither notices when Brady himself joins them on the call.

Some highlights include Damon’s half of a matching tattoo, some prolonged staring at the athlete’s chin, and one particularly sharp comment about Affleck’s near-universally loathed movie Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.
It’s clever and ridiculous and supports some good causes! Head over to Omaze to learn more and donate.
Check out the video above.
