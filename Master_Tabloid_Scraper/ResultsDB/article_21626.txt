Wait, really?

Over the weekend, the indie film Swiss Army Man starring Daniel Radcliffe and Paul Dano bowed in select theaters. As part of promoting the release, directors Daniel Scheinert and Daniel Kwan were asked about their dream projects. The duo had a pretty thoughtful (and completely surprising) answer.
“Every project we make is us trying to reach some sort of weird and silly cosmic dream,” Scheinert told The Hollywood Reporter at first. Then Kwan turned to his co-director and asked, “What about your White Chicks dream?”
That’s when Scheinert spilled the beans on his idea. Brace yourself…
“Oh! One of my dreams is to make White Chicks as a hard-R, Oscar-worthy drama, starring the original cast. It would be about gender and race relations in the 21st century, starring the Wayans Brothers. I don’t know if you have seen White Chicks lately, but it has a lot of meat to it and explores everything, like class, gender, race, the handicapped, age.”
In case you’ve forgotten, White Chicks is that universally-panned movie from 2004 in which Marlon and Shawn Wayans play two cops who go undercover as two demonic-looking Caucasian women to stop a kidnapping.
If you were to make a list of movies ripe for a remake, would this catastrophe be in your top 10? Your top 100?!
