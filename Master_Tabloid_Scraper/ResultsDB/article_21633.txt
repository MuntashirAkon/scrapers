Sherri Shepherd can't seem to shake her legal woes. The television personality's ex-husband Lamar Sally is now fighting for more child support to benefit the former couple's 2-year-old son, who was born via surrogate after Sherry and Lamar separated.In documents obtained by E! News, Sally requests the amount Shepherd pays per month be increased because he believes she now earns upwards of $3 million per year, a $1.8 million increase from what their previous support order was based upon. Additionally, Sally is requesting $75,000 to cover his legal fees.Earlier this year, Sherri suffered another setback when a judge denied her request to appeal an April 2015 court order mandating her name would not be removed from the child's birth certificate, and that she is still contractually obligated to finance expenses incurred by the "embryo carrier."

In Sally's most recent request, he explains their son suffers from a genetic disorder that requires he maintain a strict diet and visit the doctor frequently. As it stands, Sally says he works as a substitute teacher for Los Angeles Unified School District and makes between $140-$186 per day. The exes married in 2011, and began to pursue surrogacy using Sally's sperm and an egg donor. But upon separating in April 2014, their surrogate was already pregnant, prompting a legal battle over who would be financially responsible for the future of the child.Shepherd also has an 11-year-old son named Jeffrey with ex-husband Jeffrey Tarpley.

E! News has reached out to both Shepherd and Sally for comment.
