When Luke Met Harry & Sally/n
       Luke Perry's swapping ZIP codes--and continents--to star in a theatrical version of When Harry Met Sally...        The Beverly Hills, 90210 star will soon head to London's West End where he's scheduled to hit the boards in the role made famous back in '89 by Billy Crystal.        When Harry Met Sally... the stage show officially opens February 20 at the Theater Royal Haymarket for a limited 16-week run. Preview performances kick off February 10.              While Meg Ryan's utterly orgasmic role as Sally has yet to be cast, an American actress is expected to fill the bill, according to the show's producer. Jennie Garth is busy on the WB, but we think Shannen Doherty's free.              Indeed, imagining former teen heartthrob Perry assuming the mantle of New York nebbishness displayed by Crystal in the Oscar-nominated flick has produced some critical snickers, but producer James Tod remains unaffected.                "If you've got a great project and a great performer, then it doesn't really matter," he said.              Tod's got something of an experienced stage performer in Perry, who appeared on Broadway several seasons ago in a revival of The Rocky Horror Picture Show.               Of course, Perry's experience also extends to the seminal role of brooding Dylan Walsh on 90210, which made him a household name. Since the paean to spoilt teens ended, he's done a guest stint on HBO's Oz and starred in several cable series, including Showtime's Jeremiah and the Hallmark Channel's Johnson County War.              Perry & Co. hope When Harry Met Sally... can make the sometimes iffy transistion from screen to stage.              A recent theatrical adaptation of Mike Nichols' The Graduate enjoyed a lengthy run on the West End but didn't fare as well on Broadway; whereas The Full Monty was a hit on both sides of the pond. Others like Broadway's Footloose, Urban Cowboy and Saturday Night Fever quickly flamed out.             Meanwhile, a musical version of the Oscar-nominated film Billy Elliot is in development for the London stage for later this year. Also on the horizon, Broadway adaptations of Moonstruck, Get Shorty,  Legally Blonde and even Monty Python and the Holy Grail.
