Sherri Shepherd and her husband have split up.Lamar Sally filed for a legal separation last week after less than three years of marriage, citing irreconcilable differences as the reason and noting April 16 as their date of separation.Moreover, Sally is asking for primary legal and physical custody of their unborn child who's due on July 28, a son to be named Lamar Sally Jr., according to court documents filed May 2 and obtained by E! News. He asks that his future ex-wife be granted visitation rights.Shepherd, who is also mom to 9-year-old son Jeffrey from her first marriage, swapped vows with Sally on Aug. 13, 2011, in Chicago. The actress and daytime talk host said last summer that she and Sally were planning on adding to their family and had found a surrogate.

"We're starting the process of making sure the uterus that we picked is not crazy," Shepherd told Essence in June. "I put out there that I would give someone a free weave for a year and a free Hyundai. Literally, we'd be at the club and these girls would be like ‘I'll carry yo' baby.' I don't think so...So, it's been a journey trying to sift through the ones with drama and no drama so I think I have one, but I'll definitely keep everyone updated."Though Shepherd had kept mum about her marital troubles on The View and elsewhere, split rumors started to shadow the pair recently.A rep for the actress and morning-show host was not available for comment. Shepherd implied that she was going through tough times when she tweeted Thursday, "Don't underestimate the power of friendship... friends are the soft landing when you fall ... I love you both @JawnMurray & @BoneHampton."And aside from working out the details of their pending separation, Sally may have Barbara Walters to worry about now.According to a new profile about Walters in Vanity Fair, the veteran newswoman apparently told Sally before he married Shepherd in 2011, "'If you hurt Sherri, I'm going to hurt you.'"So it's nice to know that Shepherd has her View family to lean on, too.—Additional reporting by Claudia Rosenbaum(Originally published May 9, 2014, at 1:03 p.m. PT)
