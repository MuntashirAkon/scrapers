Kim Kardashian is all about bonding with the clan’s littlest ones this week.

The mom-of-two took to Instagram Monday night (Feb. 27, 2017) to share several adorable photos of her son, Saint West. Taken just a few months ago, the pictures showed the 1-year-old sitting in a highchair as the reality star snapped selfies.
In one frame, the tiny tot reached out to touch his mother’s face. How cute!

However, Kim’s sister, Kourtney Kardashian, wasn’t getting a lot of love from fans for her latest photo with her daughter, Penelope. When the 37-year-old shared a shot of little P wearing lip ring, Instagram users quickly blasted the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star for allowing her 4-year-old sport such an accessory.

“Our Oscar Sunday,” she captioned the picture. “Yes, that’s a lip ring. Thanks @kimkardashian.”
According to Kourt, the controversial bauble was given to Penelope by her sister, who had been seen rocking a fake lip ring earlier this year.
“A child shouldn’t have that. Period,” one commenter wrote.
“Why don’t you just add a belly button ring too,” another berated. “When I was her age I wasn’t even allowed to wear nail polish.”
The word still out on if Penelope’s lip ring is real of fake. Nonetheless, the so-called concerned moms of Instagram are definitely freaking out.
