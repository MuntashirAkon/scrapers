Sally Field May Return to TV/n
We liked her as Gidget, we liked her as the Flying Nun. Heck, to paraphrase her Oscar acceptance speech for Places in the Heart, we just really, really like Sally Field. Don't we?          Well, no one really cares what you or I think, anyway, but the folks over at CBS definitely have strong feelings for Field. So much so that they're ready to sign the perky performer to a TV deal, bringing Sally back for a CBS sitcom.          Field is contemplating a return to her small-screen roots, according to Daily Variety. The actress has been courted by ABC--where she starred in three TV series, including her two most famous sitcoms,  Gidget and The Flying Nun--but she reportedly declined the offer because she's pals with CBS president Leslie Moonves, who also wants her for a new project. (Field is so chummy with Moonves that she attended an Emmy pre-party at his house.) Moonves has recently inked deals with Paul Sorvino and Katey Sagal (Married...with Children).           No word on what exactly the "situation" in her situation comedy would be, but Field reportedly wants a comic role. The show is expected to be produced by Disney for CBS if it comes together, according to Variety. Disney has a prior deal with Field that includes a first look at her next TV project.           In addition to Gidget and The Flying Nun, Field starred on the tube in Alias Smith and Jones on ABC from 1971 to 1973 and The Girl with Something Extra, which aired on NBC from 1973 to 1974.           After graduating to the big screen, Field rode shotgun in Smokey and the Bandit before her Oscar-winning turns in Norma Rae and Places in the Heart. Her most recent roles include the mom roles in Forrest Gump and Eye for an Eye.
