Billie Lourd is speaking out follow the death of her mother, Carrie Fisher, and her grandmother, Debbie Reynolds, who passed away just a day apart.

A week following the sudden death of the iconic mother-and-daughter duo, the Scream Queens star shared a note on her Instagram, thanking fans for their support during this difficult time in her family.
“Receiving all of your prayers and kind words over the past week has given me strength during a time I thought strength could not exist,” the 24-year-old wrote on Monday alongside a childhood photo of her with the two actresses. “There are no words to express how much I will miss my Abadaba and my one and only Momby. Your love and support means the world to me.”
