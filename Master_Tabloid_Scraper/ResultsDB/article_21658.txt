Sherri Shepherd -- Anyone Who Knows Me Knows ... I'm Not a Hypocrite/nSherri Shepherd is scoffing at Lamar Sally calling her a hypocrite in their custody war ...  telling us anyone who knows her, knows Lamar is full of BS. Shepherd was judged today but not by Lamar ... by a real judge in a different custody fight she's having with ex-husband Jeff Tarpley over their nine-year-old son.   He now wants full custody.Sherri was mum about her fight with Sally on the way out ... but when we brought up his questioning of her Christian values ... well she just had to answer./n
