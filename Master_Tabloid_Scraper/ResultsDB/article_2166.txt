Reflecting on these last seven years in my empty room I called home. I will never forget this experience. I was so lucky to work with such amazing people who have affected my life greatly. I am so happy to know they will be my family from here on out. To the fans‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ what can I say other than I love you so much. Thank you for being on this journey with me and giving me so much support. I wouldn‚Äôt be here without all of you. I‚Äôm sad to say bye to Hanna‚Ä¶.. but I‚Äôm excited to see what the future holds and I‚Äôm so happy to know that all of you will be by my side ‚ù§Ô∏è

The day has come to say goodbye to my second home, a character that helped shaped me and so many people who mean the world to me. Bittersweet feelings today, but so proud of what we‚Äôve done. ‚ù§Ô∏è

From the first episode (this photo) until now ‚Ä¶ goodbye Aria. You became a huge part of my life and a part of my identity in a way. I‚Äôll miss you , your wacky wardrobe, your ability to do anything for love and your friends. Forever in my heart!!

I have kept so little in this room over the years, by Patti and Lo have been here through all of it. I guess I had hopes it would make it easy to pack up when the end came. Well, It took very little time but nothing about the packing was felt easy. Goodbye room (and my home for 7 years). Be good to the next girl. Whoever she is.

I can‚Äôt believe that the day has come. In a couple of hours I‚Äôll be going to work for the last time at my second home. Although this day will be filled with happy and sad tears, I‚Äôll be forever grateful to share them with the ones I‚Äôve come to call family. #pllfamily

It didn‚Äôt end there though, since Ian Harding, Tyler Blackburn, and Keegan Allen also said goodbye to the show and their PLL ladies.



This one has made every day of work a total joy. Thank you for putting up with my dumb songs and my affinity for not shutting up. You‚Äôre a gem miss Hale. I‚Äôll miss you tremendously. Much love and Happy wrap. @lucyhale

Repping Caleb Rivers forever. This is one of the most emotionally challenging days I‚Äôve had in a long time. I‚Äôm in a fog. Feeling grateful nonetheless. I love my #PLL family!

As I reflect on these years together in my dressing room on stage 6 on the WB lot (apparently James Dean once climbed above it and hid in the rafters) it is silent. I am unable to find the words to equate how tremendously emotional I feel. It is unlike anything I could ever explain. I will think about this often, and look back fondly on what we all shared together. I can‚Äôt even believe it. So grateful for the support of our fans and friends. I will miss this family so very much.
