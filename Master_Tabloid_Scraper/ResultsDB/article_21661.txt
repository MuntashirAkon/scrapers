Rolling Stones Mick Jagger & Ronnie Wood: Meat Me For Dinner/nRolling Stones' Mick Jagger and Ronnie Wood got all Brazilian with their MUCH younger chicks, but we ain't talking thongs -- we're talking meat. Tons of meat. The Stones hit up the carnivore mecca on Wednesday night ... Brazilian steakhouse Fogo de Chao in Bev Hills ... where it's a guarantee you'll leave FULL. Odd dinner spot for Mick -- who brought his 20-something ballerina GF ... but perfect for Ronnie and his pregnant 37-year-old wife, Sally. Cravings, man. Beef. It's not just for Mick and Keith Richards anymore./n
