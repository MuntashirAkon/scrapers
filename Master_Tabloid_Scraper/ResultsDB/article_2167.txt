Supergirl and Superman finally unite and show us what it truly means to be a hero in a clip for the Supergirl season two premiere. Trust us, it was worth the wait.

As news breaks of a potential explosion on the Venture aircraft, Clark Kent (Tyler Hoechlin) overhears the dilemma while his seemingly important phone call came to an abrupt end. Nonetheless, our hero in disguise runs through a back alley to rip off his shirt–revealing the Superman logo–and prepares for take off.
To his surprise, Supergirl (Melissa Benoist) beats him to the scene and quickly places herself in front of the aircraft.

Naturally, Superman flies over to Supergirl and says “need a hand?” as he falls into place beside her.
Casually, Supergirl replies, “hey cuz.”
After the mini-reunion session, the duo worked together to stop the aircraft from landing on the townspeople, nearly saving over 200 people with their heroic efforts.
 





“This looks like a job for the both of us,” Supergirl says.
We have to say, she may be on to something.
Surprisingly, the pair has not appeared on television together since the CW’s Smallville. But, Smallville ended five years ago. It’s safe to say that a family reunion is well overdue.
