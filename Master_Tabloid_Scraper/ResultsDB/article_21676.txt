The organization’s spokesman said the money will go to expanding the Badbaado health services clinic which helps 300 people per day.
The nation is currently experiencing its worst famine in 60 years and an estimated 29,000 children aged five and under have already died.

Speaking at an awards ceremony at the UN’s headquarters in Geneva on Tuesday, Jolie addressed the Somali issues.
“The desperation fueled by a vicious combination of drought, famine and conflict has driven tens of thousands of people from the Horn of Africa,” she said.

“We must try to imagine how desperate these people must be, when their only alternative is to risk death at sea and put their lives in the hands of ruthless smugglers.”
