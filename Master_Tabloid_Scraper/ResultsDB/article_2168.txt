Bella Thorne Flashes a Hickey and Leads This Weekend’s Hottest Star Sightings/n
Bella Thorne’s birthday was definitely one for the books.
The actress paraded around Los Angeles with friends and made the most of her day. We’re just mad that we didn’t ever get an invitation to this fun-filled day.
To celebrate her 19th, Thorne wore an edgy red halter bodysuit and jean shorts. To say the least, she looked like stylish perfection.
To start off the day’s festivities, she visited the Los Angeles cat cafe Crumbs and Whiskers with friends. The group enjoyed coffee and the company of cats, completely showing everyone the true meaning of squad goals.

Soon after, Thorne and her pals made a stop at Body Electric Tattoo and Piercing on Melrose, where she grabbed temporary tattoos and braved the pain to get a super edgy septum piercing. As a side note, make sure to keep a look out for the bright red mark on Throne’s neck (you honestly can’t miss it). We all have an idea where that came from–here’s looking at you, Tyler Posey!

Later on, she posted a photo on Snapchat thanking her “baby” for a bouquet of red roses. To say that Thorne had the perfect birthday is an understatement. Nonetheless, we are happy to see that she had a blast on her special day!
