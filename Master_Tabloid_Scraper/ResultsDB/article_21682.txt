Princess Kate's sister has broken up with Nico Jackson, a 37-year-old who had been her boyfriend of three years.
We're hearing that she and Jackson — who had moved to Geneva, Switzerland to work for a bank — apparently found it difficult to  reconcile the long distance between them in the relationship, and that's what led to the split.
The 32-year-old and her beau had been spotted publicly less and less over the past year, with Pippa even going so far as to hang with some ex-boyfriends recently, though there was allegedly nothing romantic about those interactions.
Nevertheless, sadz!! Pippa is smart, and beautiful, and sporty, and by golly, people still like her! She'll get back out there! LOLz!
What do U think of Miz Middleton's decision to go it alone??
