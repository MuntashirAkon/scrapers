Tyga Owes $80K In Unpaid Rent — And If He Doesn't Pay Up Today, He's In Big Trouble!/n

Pay up, Tyga!
The rapper — who has been in the news quite a bit recently — is making good on a bunch of back rent he owes a former landlord, and the checks are going to hurt!
Monday is the deadline for Tyga to give $80,000 to an ex-landlord after agreeing to pay off his outstanding debt rather than face punishment over it.

Considering that, with interest, the number would be nearly $125,000 — $80K is a pretty favorable deal for him!
Of course, if Kylie Jenner's "friend" fails to pay up by today, he'll be on the hook for the full amount.
Drama, drama, drama! Maybe he needs to make another club appearance or two to cover the costs?!
