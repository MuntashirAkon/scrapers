Tyga and Kylie Jenner were involved in a scary situation in Switzerland early Friday morning, (June 25, 2015).
The couple was in Geneva, Switzerland because Tyga had an appearance at a nightclub called Envogue Genève. Tyga was reportedly scheduled to perform at the club for an hour, but showed up late (along with Jenner) and only performed for 10 minutes.

According to TMZ, when Tyga left at 4 a.m. and got in his car with Jenner, the owner of the club chased him outside. A fight then broke out outside of the club and Tyga got out of the car. That’s when an eyewitness says that “someone in the owner’s posse flashed a gun.” When that happened, Tyga made his way back to the car.
Here’s a video of the incident:

Tyga took to Twitter to comment on the altercation:


My Switzerland fans know whenever I show up I perform. I appreciate everybody that came out yesterday.
