Kylie Jenner and Tyga are clearly unaffected by all the romance rumors surrounding them.  They’ve been spotted jet-setting together in Europe!
Though they continue denying that they’re a couple–probably for legal reasons, considering he’s 24 and she’s only 17–things are looking pretty serious as Kylie has joined his side for some of his European shows.

According to TMZ, the duo was first spotted at England’s Gatwick Airport on Friday.  Then they traveled to Bordeaux, France and Geneva, Switzerland before touching down in Athens, Greece where Tyga performed on Sunday night.

One fan took to Twitter to share a photo of the couple’s spotting in Bordeaux where they appear to be chatting casually while eating some grub.
It seems weird that Kylie would support Tyga in Europe if they’re “just friends,” especially since the legal age of consent in the countries they visited would make their love affair okay.
As TMZ reports: In England, it’s 16; France, 15; Switzerland, 16; and Greece, 15.

Meanwhile, just last week Tyga’s ex-fiance and baby mama Blac Chyna shared a photo of the two canoodling, which seemed to prove he and Kylie are definitely not a thing.
Things are getting all kinds of confusing up in here!
