Go Inside Jenny McCarthy’s $7K a Month Chicago Crib/n
Even though Jenny McCarthy’s taken over daytime TV as talking head No. 4 on The View in NYC, she’s still keeping her Midwestern roots.
The Big Apple may be her temporary digs, but her suburban spread just outside Chitown is where she really calls home. And CB! can take you inside.

The former Playboy Playmate has been renting the family pad since late 2012, according to property records, when she decided to leave the hustle and bustle of Hollywood for the quieter life in the ‘burbs of Geneva, Ill.
And the blonde bombshell got the 5-bedroom, 5-bath digs for a steal. Down from $9,500, she snagged it for $6,900 — and for the serene setting alone, it’s worth it.
The country estate is set on a secluded two acres in heart of the historic downtown area. And we can see why this is the place where she wanted to raise her 11-year-old son, Evan.
The cozy and rustic crib has tons of room with 6,400 square feet that’s perfect for entertaining with a chef’s kitchen flowing into a grand family room area and lined top to bottom with custom millwork, stone fireplaces, pine flooring, coffered ceilings and soaring windows. Not to mention, the tranquil picturesque views from her own private terraces and wrap-around decks that overlook the gardens, woods, and yes, there’s even a stream, are a few things she can’t find in Manhattan.
Take a look for yourself in the CB! gallery above.
