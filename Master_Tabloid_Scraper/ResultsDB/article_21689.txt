Paris Hilton Still Looks Really Good In A Bikini/n
We get it, Paris Hilton. You look hot in a bikini.
Paris Hilton got a little selfie happy over the past few days on Instagram, showing off a slew of bikini looks straight from her stay in Honolulu, Hawaii. The socialite was hot off the set of her Honey Bunch ad campaign and decided to give fans a sneak peek, posing solo in stringy lip-smacked two-pieces and sky-high pumps. She also snapped shots of her on a boat (classic Paris!) and shared a pic of her and 21-year-old model beau, River Viiperi.
Paris has been hanging in sunny Hawaii for the past week. Before that she made a pit-stop in Geneva, right after hitting up the French Riviera for the Cannes Film Festival. The blonde babe attended the premiere of Sofia Coppola’s The Bling Ring, which she makes an appearance in, and enjoyed the company of Hollywood’s finest at parties galore. Oh, to be a Hilton!
Check out more pics of Paris and her bikini looks, above.
