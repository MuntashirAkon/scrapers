Bill and Giuliana Rancic welcomed their first child Edward Duke into the world in Denver, Colo., on Aug. 29th.
Now, the proud parents have finally taken their newborn son back home to Chicago!

According to PEOPLE, the E! News host, 37, and The Apprentice season one winner, 41, have left “The Mile-High City” and headed home to Chi-town where Bill is originally from.
A source close to the couple tells the website that Bill and Giuliana are gushing over the arrival of their 8-day-old son.
“They are so happy right now. It’s beautiful to see,” the source said. “They love that little guy so much. He’s so sweet.”

Giuliana also tweeted about her new bundle of joy.
“He’s a dream…” she tweeted Friday. “It’s true what they say (and what u all told us)… @BillRancic and I couldn’t love little Duke anymore than we do.”
This is the first child for Bill and Giuliana and they conceived baby Duke via gestational surrogate — meaning that the Rancics are Edward’s genetic parents.

Edward Duke was born measuring 20 inches and the Rancics were in the room through the entire four-hour delivery, with Bill cutting the umbilical cord and Giuliana the first to hold the baby.
Edward’s arrival couldn’t come at a better time for the happy couple, who just celebrated their fifth wedding anniversary on September 1st.
Congratulations to Bill and Giuliana on their new arrival and their wedding anniversary!
