Princess Diana may be the People’s Princess, but Kate Middleton has won the hearts of schoolchildren at a North Westminster school this Sunday.
The Duchess of Cambridge, 30, headed to the woods with a group of inner city kids in Wrotham, England for a good old fashioned campout. Sporting Le Chameau wellies, Zara and Burberry tops, and a jacket by Really Wild, Kate explored the wilderness and taught the group of 8 and 9-year-olds how to make bread over a campfire.
During this particularly outing though, Middleton was nearly stumped when a curious student asked about her time spent on the throne.
Her response?

“It’s not actually my job yet!” Middleton responded tactfully, according to the Daily Mail.
However, the brunette stunner did spill about her duties as a royal figure.
“It’s very busy and great fun but I am very well looked after,” she told the children.
