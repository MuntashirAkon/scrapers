 There’s never a dull moment on Jersey Shore and it looks like this upcoming season will be no exception.
On Saturday, Jenni “JWoww” Farley was spotted on crutches around Seaside Heights, N.J. With her right ankle wrapped in bandages, the 26-year-old reality TV star hobbled her way into a local nail and hair salon for a spa day with pregnant BFF Nicole “Snooki” Polizzi.
How did JWoww come about her injury?
The fist-pumping guidette was allegedly caught in the crossfire during a bar brawl in Seaside Heights this Friday. According to TMZ, two men got into a scuffle with JWoww’s boyfriend Roger Mathews and housemate Ronnie Ortiz-Magro at Bamboo Bar, where she sprained her ankle during the fight.
The two victims — identified as Justin Viterito and Devon Chichele — are reportedly planning to sue those involved along with Viacom and MTV.
Celebuzz has reached out to a rep for JWoww and is awaiting comment.
