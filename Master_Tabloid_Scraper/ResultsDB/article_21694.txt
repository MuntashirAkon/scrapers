‘Pretty Little Liars’ Stars’ Sexy and Sassy Styles (PHOTOS)/n
June 5th is FINALLY here!
The much anticipated third season of the hit ABC Family original show Pretty Little Liars premieres tonight, so fans, rejoice.
When the show aired it’s finale in March, audiences finally learned that Aria (Lucy Hale), Emily (Shay Mitchell), Spencer (Troian Bellisario) and Hanna’s (Ashley Benson) tormentor, “A”, was Hanna’s supposed BFF, Mona Vanderwall (Janel Parrish). After a frightful showdown at a creepy motel and a car chase, Mona really showed her true crazy, so much so that it got her locked up in a psych ward. It also brought back Dr. Sullivan, who was being blackmailed to stay away, because she found out what Mona was up to.
What should fans expect for season three?

Since the finale left the audience with a huge cliffhanger, we can only hope that we will get answers like: Who it was in that red jacket that visited Mona in the last scene? What will happen with Aria and Ezra (Ian Harding) now that their relationship is out to everyone? Will Emily finally settle down with someone special? What does the future hold for Spencer and Toby (Keegan Allen) now that they’ve reunited?
Also more importantly, if Mona isn’t really “A”, then who is?
To prepare for the upcoming season, Celebuzz decided to showcase the ABC Family stars’ sexiest and sassiest looks.
