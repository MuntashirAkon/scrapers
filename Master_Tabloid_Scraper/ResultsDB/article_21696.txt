Celeb Yoga Instructor Reveals Ways to De-Stress After Pregnancy/n
Gwen Lawrence is the instructor for five New York pro teams, including the New York Giants. She has several online yoga classes on GaiamTV.com.
Last week, we honored Mother’s Day by acknowledging new moms and moms who have recently given birth. I shared some ideas about how to get back into pre-baby shape with great DVD suggestions from GaiamTV.com and simple at-home workouts to try.
This week, I’m stressing something very important: The de-stressing of mom.

Gaining weight and not being able to lose it is linked to the body’s response to stress. Whether your body increases cortisol – the hormone related to stress – or you tend to be a stress-eater and overeat, it’s imperative to take time for yourself each day by:

Finding a quiet space to read a page from an inspirational book
Stopping several times a day to take 10 conscious deep breaths
Drinking eight glasses of fresh, clean water each day
Limiting alcohol
Eating fresh, whole foods
Making sure to get plenty of uninterrupted sleep

Start with these simple tips and you will look and feel gorgeous on the inside and out.  You will have glowing skin like Jennifer Lopez, and a fresh radiance like Jennifer Aniston.
