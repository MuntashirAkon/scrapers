More than 100 people died in the series of coordinated terror attacks last month, when terrorists connected to ISIS opened fire at locations across Paris, France, including various restaurants and the Bataclan concert hall.   
An eyewitness to one of the attacks, on restaurant La Belle Equipe, told PEOPLE he saw “absolute carnage.”   
“I saw people die. I saw people die,” Jean Pierre said. “I had people die in my arms. There wasn’t anything you could do to help them.”
