George Clooney to Host Barack Obama Fundraiser in Geneva    /n
Fresh from the Venice Film Festival, George Clooney will appear Tuesday evening at a Barack Obama fundraiser in Geneva.   
According to reports from Swiss news agency ATS, the Burn After Reading star and longtime Obama supporter hopes to increase Democratic coffers by nearly $1 million at the event, held for U.S. citizens living overseas.  
According to planners, Clooney will address a cocktail reception – speaking and answering questions – of 170 U.S. citizens, who are each paying $1,000.
Afterwards, he will sit down to dinner with 75 guests, each donating $10,000 per plate. The reception and dinner will be held at the private Vielle-Ville home of U.S. attorney Charles Adams, the evening’s principal organizer.   
Hoping to score tickets? The twin events are already sold out, Adams, who also serves on Obama’s National Finance Committee, told journalists.   
Clooney has known Obama personally since 2004 and campaigned for him during his Ilinois Senate run. But the actor had previously begged off campaigning for Obama during his Presidential bid, explaining to reporters that he wouldn’t want to “damage” him.  
The fundraiser will be Clooney’s only active personal participation in the campaign, Adams told Geneve newspaper Le Temps. Said Adams, “I personally assured George Clooney that Geneva is a city where restraint is the norm and that he wouldn’t be assaulted by fans trying to tear the shirt off him.”   
The actor will be bringing “three or four people” with him to the fundraiser, Adams said.
