Rami Malek surprised everyone — including himself — when he beat out frontrunners like Kevin Spacey and Kyle Chandler to take home the Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series on Sunday night. So, what does he think of his win?

Like his character Elliot Alderson on Mr. Robot, Malek understands he’s an outsider in the industry. Speaking in the press room backstage, the actor stressed the importance of diversity in Hollywood, detailing the sacrifices his family made to get him to where he is today.
“I’m not the typical leading man,” Malek, who is of Egyptian descent said, “to come home with this speaks a lot of where we’re headed, and I think we can keep going further in that direction and strive to be as progressive as possible.”
He continued, “I grew up in a family that immigrated here and my Dad worked door-to-door selling insurance and my Mom was pregnant with my [twin] brother and I going to work, taking three buses to get there. It was so that she could give her child an opportunity to be special. My sister is an ER doctor, my brother is a teacher and I’m standing here today.”
“I think a lot of people can relate to wanting an opportunity. I wanted an opportunity and now I have it, I want other people to have an opportunity regardless, to not be stifled in this world but to be given a chance like I was given a chance,” Malek added.
This was Malek first Emmy nomination and win.
