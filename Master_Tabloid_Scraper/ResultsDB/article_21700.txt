Picks and Pans Review: Great Performances: Doctor Fischer of Geneva/n
PBS (Fri., Oct. 11, 9 p.m. ET)
A
This, one of the late James Mason’s last performances, is a delight. He gets to play a succulently evil character from a Graham Greene novel, a rich man who wants to prove that the rich have no pride, only a bottomless supply of greed. To do that, Mason throws parties for wealthy hangers-on and forces them to eat cold gruel while he eats caviar; they humiliate themselves and then get expensive presents for dessert. You meet this sterling snake through the eyes of Alan Bates, a gentle man who falls in love with Mason’s daughter, played by Greta (Heat and Dust) Scacchi. Devilishly delicious.
