Which celebrity goes best with eggs? You guessed it—Kevin Bacon.The 56-year-old Footloose and The Following actor stars in a new print and online campaign for Incredible Egg, backed by the American Egg Board, which promotes the consumption of eggs in the United States.In an ad, or web film, posted online on Thursday, Bacon is seen surprising a woman, Rescue Me actress Geneva Carr, as she's cooking breakfast. The video features several puns, which appears to annoy the actor, and innuendo.Star-struck, she asks, "What are you going in my kitchen?""Well, nobody knows eggs better than Bacon," he says, laying on a counter.

"You know, I love the smell of eggs in the morning," he adds, looking at the woman and then sniffing a plate of cooked eggs."And I love the smell of bacon," she replies, moving towards him and sniffing the air near his face.

Then someone else shows up and now it's even more awkward.

The puns continued when the cameras were off too."He's just been cracking everyone up all afternoon," Jay Hunt, creative director of production company Grey New York, says in a behind-the-scenes video.

Bacon has filmed other commercials before. In 2012, he started appearing in ads for the U.K. mobile phone service EE. His wife Kyra Sedgwick made a cameo in one released in 2013.

 In 2010, he played his own, nerdy fan in a commercial for Logitech Revue, a device that allows viewers to watch Google TV.

He has also provided voiceovers for ads for Buick and Hillshire Farm sausages and roasted turkey breasts.
