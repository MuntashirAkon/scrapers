Bravo Star Geneva Thomas -- Gets Off Light in Bottle Attack Case/n "Blood, Sweat and Heels " star Geneva Thomas should be thankful she's kept a clean record until now ... because it saved her ass big time in her bottle-cracking assault case. Thomas pled guilty Thursday morning to third degree assault -- a reduced charge -- and got 10 days community service. We're told she was eligible for the plea deal because she has no criminal record.  As TMZ first reported, Thomas was arrested in October for attacking co-star Melyssa Ford ... cracking her in the head with a vodka bottle.   Thomas also has to stay out of trouble for a year, and stay away from Ford .. unless they're shooting the show. That clause seems risky, since that's when they'd be most likely to fight. The bottle incident happened while they were taping. Side note: The guilty plea might make it difficult for Geneva to win the defamation suit she filed against Melyssa for calling her a violent criminal./n
