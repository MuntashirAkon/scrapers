Bravo Star Melyssa Ford -- The Stitches Are Out … Now I Want That Bitch Out (VIDEO)/nFormer  "Blood, Sweat & Heels " star Melyssa Ford is out of the wheelchair and back in her stilettos, but she’s still full of piss and vinegar over the brutal bottle attack. Ford was out late drinking “coffee” with her gal pals in NYC when our photog spotted her. She was all smiles until the conversation turned to her old 'BS&H' co-star Geneva Thomas, who smashed Melyssa over the head with a bottle.   Watch her come to a fast boil as she explains what needs to change for her to come back to the show./n
