Truce Between Paris and Nicole/nThe feud between  "The Simple Life " co-stars Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie appears to be over.TMZ cameras were there as Paris and Nicole broke bread (or beef) at Dan Tana's Steakhouse in West Hollywood last night. The pair arrived together in Paris' Range Rover and caused a frenzy at the front door not seen since Mikhail Gorbachev and Ronald Reagan met in Geneva in 1985. And after their meal, the newly reunited pair shared a little tender text-messaging time on a bench at the valet stand before zooming off into the night. The co-stars have been in a very public feud for some time now, some say triggered when Nicole Richie had a party and showed Paris' infamous sex tape to her guests. The spat spilled out onto their show and onto the social scene -- but whispers of a detente between the two celebutantes have been circulating. Still, this is the first time the pair have been seen out together in months. And, as TMZ observed, the two seemed to enjoy each other's company and to be glad to put their feud to rest. The question now is -- will Paris shake with Shanna Moakler?/n
