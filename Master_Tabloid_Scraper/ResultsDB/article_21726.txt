Jenny McCarthy -- Famous Friends Busted for Public Intoxication/nJenny McCarthy's latest fundraising event must have been a BLAST ... because a bunch of her famous friends got busted for public intoxication afterwards.The event -- a fundraiser for a local children's school -- began at a hotel in St. Charles, IL and eventually moved to a nearby bar called EvenFlow around 12:30 AM. It's unclear what happened afterwards, but at 5:45 AM  "General Hospital " star Kelly Monaco,  "Bones " actor Heath Freeman, pro dancer Serge Onik, and Jenny's sister Joanne McCarthy were all issued $50 tickets outside the bar ... for public intoxication.According to police reports, Joanne McCarthy told cops the group had been drinking inside EvenFlow up until they left the place around 5:45 AM, right before police arrived in response to a neighborhood noise complaint. We're told they were all waiting for cabs when police arrived.FYI, drinking establishments are supposed to stop serving booze after 2 AM in that area.Jenny McCarthy was NOT involved in the incident.H /T to the Kane County Chronicle./n
