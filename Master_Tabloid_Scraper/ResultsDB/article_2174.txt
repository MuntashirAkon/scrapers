Kim Kardashian Is 'Hating' Her Weight Gain, but Possibly Wears Butt Pads Nonetheless/n
AKM-GSI

Kim Kardashian West may be focused on losing weight after giving birth to her son Saint West, but when it comes to her famous rear, she’s committed to keeping things status quo.
A few weeks after flaunting her 60-pound post-baby weight loss, the star isn’t shy about the fact that she’s put a few pounds back on. Just a day before a post on her website revealed that she’s “Currently HATING – Gaining back a few pounds” the star attended her sister Khloé’s birthday with what appears to be potentially butt-pad-enlarged behind. (We did a deep dive into the world of butt pads, and while we will never know for sure what the star was sporting, it’s got a definite hint of this about it.)

So could it be that West’s rumored-to-be-insured rear end is faux after all? The star recently told PEOPLE that while she’s been working tirelessly to shed pounds, her butt hasn’t gone anywhere. “My butt and my hips are the last to go, but I’m not stopping,” she said.

But according to the possibly-enhanced cheeks that appeared underneath her skirt on Monday, she’s fine holding onto what’s left, so much so that she wants it to appear even larger. And judging by the two Instagram videos that she posted of herself shaking her stuff at her sister’s arcade soiree, she’s happy with what she’s got, and she doesn’t care who knows it.
