It was only about a week ago that the Riverdale star was discussing the anxiety associated with one's sexuality in several honest and heartfelt tweets.
Now, the 19-year-old has fully come out in a lengthy post also shared on Twitter:

The come-out seems to have been provoked in part by a tweet Shannon sent out regarding Betty/Veronica shippers who believe the two characters should be in a romantic relationship.
The tweet has since been deleted, but it appears the actress isn't exactly a fan of the shippers themselves.
In an effort to clarify her earlier comment, she wrote:

Ships are great, being horrible to people who don't ship your ship is not.

Lemme clarify, not angry at beronica stans. Not even angry at rightfully upset beronica stans. Disappointed with hateful people. Peace ‚úåüèª
