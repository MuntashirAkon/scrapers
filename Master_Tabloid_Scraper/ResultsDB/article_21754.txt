Riverdale, the CW’s view of the iconic Archie comics, is filled with six-pack abs, teen angst and something mysterious, dangerous and possibly supernatural. Natch.
The network premiered its first teaser for Riverdale on Monday (Nov. 28, 2016), and it shows how Archie Andrews (K.J. Apa) likes walking around with his shirt off, while dealing with ogling possible love interests — next-door neighbor Betty Cooper (Lili Reinhart) and new girl in town Veronica Lodge (Camila Mendes). Archie is also at odds with his best friend, Jughead Jones (Cole Sprouse).
Plus, there’s images of bloodied hands, a bag full of money and other hints at the darker things to come in the picture-perfect town of Riverdale (for a full synopsis, click here). Watch above!
Riverdale is set to premiere on Thursday, January 26th on The CW.
