Ascendant, the final movie in the Divergent series, is reportedly going to bypass the theaters and head directly to TV, with a standalone TV series to follow that would be set in the same world.
The final Divergent movie was to start filming this summer with a 2017 release, but sources told Variety that Lionsgate is rethinking their strategy after the last film, Allegiant, did poorly at the box office earlier this year.
Based on the popular books by Veronica Roth, the films tell the story of a post-apocalyptic world in which people are divided up by personality traits, and stars Shailene Woodley, Theo James and Ansel Elgort. The first Divergent was released in 2014, with Insurgent following in 2015, and both were considered successes at the box office.
No official word has been given, or whether the original cast will return in this new iteration, but Ascendant would introduce new characters, who would then carry on in the new TV series.
