Jennifer Aniston Shocks Us All, Wears a Crop Top (It's Still Black and White, But It's a Crop Top Nonetheless!)/n
This weekend brought out a lot of stop and stare moments (and we‚Äôre not even talking about outrageous Halloween costumes). Kendall Jenner ditched pants two days in a row, Jane Fonda out Jane-Fonda‚Äôd herself in an abs-baring dress and Jennifer Aniston wore a teeny tiny crop top at the American Cinematheque Awards.

The actress took the stage during the award ceremony honoring pal Reese Witherspoon in a black and white KaufmanFranco ensemble featuring a skinny bandeau top, with a high-waist black floor-length skirt paired with minimal jewels (she‚Äôs not a ‚Äúdiamond girl‚Äú) and her signature beachy waves.

She was among a slew of Hollywood heavyweights on hand to celebrate Witherspoon including Sofia Vergara, Jennifer Garner, Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey.

In her speech, Aniston talked about their time playing sisters during Witherspoon‚Äôs guest spot on Friends saying, ‚ÄúEven before Reese played my lovely, albeit somewhat spoiled sister, Jill, she somehow felt like family to me. Reese‚Äôs amazing talent, both professionally and personally, has long made her a very strong, and welcome presence in my life, and I‚Äôm sure in many people‚Äôs lives in this room. Reese is not only an extraordinary actress, she also knows how to make a really excellent first impression.‚Äù
Even though Aniston doesn‚Äôt usually show off so much midriff (she does love white, sexy strapless numbers and a good LBD) we‚Äôre loving that her newlywed wardrobe means stepping outside the box (even if that does include some questionable Justin Bieber-inspired drop-crotch cargos).
