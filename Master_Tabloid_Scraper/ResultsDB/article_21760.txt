Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard are one of the few couples in Hollywood who’ve managed to stand the test of time, and by that, we mean their relationship has yet to spontaneously combust.

And chances are, it won’t, because while it hasn’t been easy Bell and Shepard have found the perfect recipe to make their relationship last. “We fought a lot and I loved a dramatic exit. If I could slam a door, I felt so powerful. If I could get in my car and screech away, it was even better, ” Bell admitted in the upcoming  August issue of Redbook, when talking about the beginning of their relationship.

“He said to me, ‘If we have an issue, you can’t leave. We’re going to talk or I’m not going to do this with you.’ I loved him so much that I was like, I better get my act together.”

Now that Bell’s gotten her “act together,” the couple can worry about other things, like making sure Bell doesn’t watch Game of Thrones without her hubby. “He would rather I sleep with another man [than watch Game of Thrones without him], I swear to God,” the cover star confessed.
