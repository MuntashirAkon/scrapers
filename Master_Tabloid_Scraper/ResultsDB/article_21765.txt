She's in Charge's Veronica 'Pooh' Nash-Poleate's Opinions on Booty Shorts Are Unmissable
/n

If you’re not up on your viral YouTube sensations, you might not recognize the name Veronica “Pooh” Nash-Poleate. But those of us who are obsessed with all of the various minor stars who make the Internet a much more enjoyable place to spend time will likely recognize the school guidance counselor from her “Stay Outta the Shark’s House” video, which has already been viewed roughly 20 million times.

Due to the breakout success of that hilarious two-minute clip, Nash-Poleate landed her own reality TV show on TLC, She’s In Charge, in which she will help families, couples, and friends get to the root of their issue, debuting tonight, March 7, at 10:00 pm. In case watching the “Shark’s House” video another five times or so didn’t already have you pumped up enough for tonight’s premiere, this clip, in which she delivers her unfiltered thoughts on booty shorts, should do the trick. And well … Pooh can certainly speak for herself on the subject. We’ll give you one hint though: #BeastieYeasty.
