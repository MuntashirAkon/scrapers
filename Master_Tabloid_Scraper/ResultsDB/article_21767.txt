TV Land's 'Heathers' reboot casts its Veronica and JD/n
TV Land’s reboot of Heathers, the cult 1988 black comedy about a teen who teams up with a sociopath to kill the cool-girl clique in school, has cast its Veronica and J.D.
The roles, originated by Winona Ryder and Christian Slater, will be taken on by Grace Cox (Under the Dome) and newcomer James Scully, EW has learned.
Cox is no stranger to reboots — she’ll also appear in Showtime’s Twin Peaks installment coming in 2017.

The show, which was greenlit in September, will be a modernized, anthology series adaptation of the iconic high school film, with each new season presenting a new heroine dealing with her own set of mean girls. Veronica will still try to off her group of Heathers, but with an updated twist: Heather McNamara (Lisanne Falk in the original movie) is now a black lesbian, Heather Duke (Shannen Doherty) is a male identifying as gender-queer, and Heather Chandler (Kim Walker) “has a body like Martha Dumptruck,” according to The Hollywood Reporter.
