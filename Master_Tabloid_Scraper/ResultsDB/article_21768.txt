Tobey Maguire, Terrence Howard and More Attend Producer Brian Grazer's Star-studded Wedding/n
Brian Grazer and Veronica Smiley tied the knot in Santa Monica, California, this weekend, nearly two years after getting engaged.  
Tobey Maguire, Terrence Howard and George Lucas were spotted arriving at the wedding location while dressed in dark clothing.  
Grazer, 64, shared a photo of the former SBE hotel management executive on Saturday, wearing a peach colored tulle gown.  
“My bride,” he wrote, accompanied by an explosion emoji. (A rep for Grazer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.)

Two weeks earlier, the couple officially applied for their marriage license in Beverly Hills, California, with Smiley, 42, declaring, “It’s getting real.”

Grazer popped the question at Santa Monica’s Huntley Hotel in April 2014. The Oscar-winning producer has been married   three times previously: first to Theresa McKay-Roberts from 1972 to 1979, then to Corki Corman 1982 to 1992, and most recently to Gigi Levangie Grazer from 1997-2007.  



The father of four shares a son and a daughter with Corman and two sons with Levangie Grazer. Grazer was also engaged to Vietnamese concert pianist Nguyen Thi Chau Giang in 2011.
