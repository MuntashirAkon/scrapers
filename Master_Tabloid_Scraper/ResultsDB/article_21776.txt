Aww Yeah, Veronica Is Back!/n
Who killed the dean? Are Logan and Veronica over? And will Jason Dohring ever profess his undying love to me?These are the questions this particular die-hard fan wants to know as Veronica Mars returns tonight—woo woo!—for its next batch of so-good episodes. (Though, well, I suppose the third Q is fairly easy to answer, given that Jason's married and all. Hmph.)

I just caught up with Kristen Bell and the boys of Veronica Mars at the CW party, and they were all so adorable and scoopy and silly, I wanted you to see for yourselves. So, I put two clips (one of Kristen Bell and one of Piz and Dick, aka Chris Lowell and Ryan Hansen) in our fun little video player on the main page (the one with the boys plays after Kristen). You can also see the clip of my beloved Ms. Bell on this page.As for the question of LoVe (Logan and Veronica), if you caught the scandalous Veronica scoop in the latest chat, you know there is a rekindling of sorts in the works, but per usual, Logan reveals his bad-boy ways and Veronica might not be able to put up with it. Wahhh!"There is always going to be hope," Veronica mastermind Rob Thomas tells me. "But it is definitely going to be a rocky road for Veronica and Logan the remainder of this season." Double wahhh!Meanwhile, something tells me a little VePi (Veronica and Piz) is in the works this season. (Is it just me, or is it written all over Chris Lowell's face in that video clip?)Post your LoVe/VePi theories below—then check back after tonight's episode to let me know what you thought of it!Veronica Mars airs tonight on the CW. Do not miss it. Seriously. Don't even think about it.
