The CW's iZombie is essentially Veronica Mars: Zombie Edition (in the best way possible—who doesn't love a smart, blonde, pop-culture savvy crime solver?). While the show, also from Veronica Mars mastermind Rob Thomas, occasionally features VM fan favorites in guest-starring roles, it got its most blatant shout-out yet during Tuesday's episode.In "Real Dead Housewife of Seattle," our undead medical examiner heroine, Liv (Rose McIver), ate the brain of a murdered trophy wife. In between her manicures and blowouts, she had a new stylist friend over to go through her closet.While searching for the perfect dress to wear out, said stylist friend pulled out a nice blue number. Liv nixed it, saying that it belonged to someone else. "A long time ago we used to be friends," she lamented.
