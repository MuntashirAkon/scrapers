Life in Pictures: Ethel Kennedy/n
On a New England autumn morning, Ethel Kennedy pages through pictures spanning her 84 years. “I like action,” she declares in a still-strong voice, “where I’m doing something.” It’s hard to find a picture where she’s not doing something-ice-skating in Japan with husband Robert F. Kennedy, tennis, horseback riding, touch football, skiing. Recent images catch her skippering a 50-ft. yawl off Cape Cod with two generations of progeny on deck. Her scrapbook is, of course, more than personal memories. From the day Ethel Skakel, age 22 and from a Republican family, married into a Democratic dynasty, her life became history.
She is the widow of a political icon. But less is known about this mother of 11, who has rarely given an interview in three decades. Director Rory Kennedy, 43, wanted to change that and persuaded her mother to be the subject of a documentary, Ethel (premiering Oct. 18 on HBO). In it, Rory reveals a tough, funny single mom who let kids and pets (19 dogs, a stable of horses and, briefly, a pet seal) run free at their Virginia home. She also notes that several of her siblings have entered public life, a fact often credited to their father. During a joint PEOPLE interview, Rory tells her mother, “You and Daddy were on a path of service together. As a role model, you helped us stay on that path as well.” In a wide-ranging talk, Ethel spoke about when she knew she’d marry RFK (“As soon as I met him”), her relationship with Jackie (“I didn’t want to crowd her”) and how she coped with an inordinate share of loss: her husband to an assassin’s bullet, her parents to a plane crash, two of her sons in accidents, and this year the suicide of daughter-in-law Mary. She credits her Catholic beliefs for sustaining her. “I pretty well lived in the moment,” she says. “And I was blessed with faith.”
