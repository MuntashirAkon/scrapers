Okay, honestly, what's with all the "catering source" rumors lately?! First came the rumor that T.R. Knight was leaving Grey's Anatomy (started by someone with a "friend in catering"), and now, another harrowing rumor is making the rounds: that Veronica Mars has been canceled. This rumor is all over various message boards today (and was emailed to me) courtesy of someone who—you guessed it—has a "friend in catering." Well, I'm here to tell you that  "I have a friend in catering" just might be the official new term for "I'm totally BS-ing you."

 I just asked Veronica Mars executive producer and creator Rob Thomas whether the rumor is true, and he told me: "No. That's not true. We've been told nothing. We're treating the season ender as a season ender—not as a series ender. We would be devastated."Wouldn't we all? I'm gonna go on record to say that Veronica Mars has been some of the best television anywhere this season, and the CW would be stone-cold crazy to cancel it. I mean, honestly, it's pretty much the best thing going on the See-Dub these days, is it not? (I know those are fighting words. Feel free to let me have it in the Comments section below.)Oh, and by the way, Veronica fans, a little heads-up: There's going to be a shocker tonight. A big shocker. I'll have the dish for you right here tomorrow. (And, as always, a shoulder to cry on.)Long live VM!4:29 Update:  A rep for the CW says of the cancellation rumor: "Rumor!"
