This is not a drill, Marshmallows!That's right—Veronica, Wallace, Logan, and Sheriff Mars got back together and we've been freaking out! Kristen Bell, along with her Veronica Mars co-stars Percy Daggs, Jason Dohring, and Enrico Colantoni, reunited over the weekend to reward some of the kind people who donated to the Reading Rainbow Kickstarter fund. The Kickstarter campaign, started by Rainbow executive producer and host LeVar Burton, was aimed at bringing Reading Rainbow to the web.It raised $1 million in 10 1/2 hours, putting it way ahead of its $1 million in 35 days goal! By the time its end date hit, the campaign had more than 106,000 backers and raised $5.4 million (not to mention an additional $1 million from funny man Seth MacFarlane).

We know what you are thinking, what do our favorite foursome from Neptune have to do with this? Well, the reward for 33 Kickstarter backers who donated $750 was a special Reading Rainbow Live event with the Veronica Mars cast. Ah—maz—ing! Burton, Bell and the gang read to 122 attendees, most of them children, from the likes of The Rhino Who Swallowed A Storm (written by Rainbow's very own host), Quackenstein, and Memoirs of a Hamster. But the good time didn't end there— the kids were also treated to a super-cool magic show, a fantastic coloring station, a Q&A with the special guests and some yummy snacks. Oh, did we mention an impromptu performance of "Do You Want To Build A Snow Man" by Bell herself.Check out our exclusive photos below:
