Sean Combs or Diddy? Let the Numbers Decide/nCelebrities have been giving themselves the royal one-named treatment for years -- Prince, Cher, Madonna -- but not all the mono-monikers have stuck, Roseanne (Barr) and Jack√©e (Harry) among the prime examples. But professional numerologist Hans Decoz has applied his powers of analysis to several stars who either have or are nearing a switch to one-named status, and his detailed numerological deconstructions can be found on AOL Horoscopes. Madonna and Oprah, for instance, get a thumbs-up from Decoz. Her Madgesty's full name, Madonna Louise Veronica Ciccone, dominated by the numbers 3 and 9, projects charm and glamour, but lacks focus. Shifting to just Madonna, however, makes her more of  "a conqueror and visionary, " full of 8s and 9s. Good call, Madonna. Similarly, Oprah Winfrey's full name confers trust, but just Oprah gives her a spirituality that every media queen needs.Decoz also gives supermodel-talk hostess Tyra Banks his number treatment, and finds that dropping the Banks adds a strong will to succeed. And Sean John Combs, also known variously as Puff, Puffy, Puff Daddy, and on and on, might want to stick to Diddy: Decoz says that name is dominated by 1, 7, and 3, which makes him strong, decisive, and a pioneer. So there you have it...Diddy./n
