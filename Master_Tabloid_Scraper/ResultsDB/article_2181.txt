Motherhood certainly suits Lily Allen!The 26-year-old singer has kept a low profile since giving birth to her daughter Ethel Mary in November. But yesterday, she was spotted leaving a restaurant in London's Mayfair district after a dinner date with hubby Sam Cooper.Wearing a green dress, black tights, red pumps and a fur jacket (faux, we hope), Lily was almost incognito behind her oversize shades.Mom is looking great, but where's baby Ethel?

The undoubtedly adorable 4-month-old has yet to make her public debut.Still, Lily appreciates her fans' well-wishes. "Thank you for all the flowers and lovely messages everybody," she tweeted after Ethel's birth. "Very touching indeed. Nuff luv x x."When we do get to meet little Ethel, it'll certainly bring a "smile" to our face!
