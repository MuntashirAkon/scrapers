Although David, 49, was forced to admit in court that he “willfully and unlawfully used force and violence” against his wife, Shannon told Star magazine, “There was no abuse, no physical anything.”
He later pled guilty to misdemeanor counts of assault and “battery against cohabitant” and was placed on three years of informal probation, during which he completed the batterer’s treatment program.

“We had an argument that was resolved very quickly afterward,” Shannon insisted. “I just thought that if I called the police, the fight would end. We’ve moved on; it’s over and done.”
As for exposing herself and her family to the on-camera drama fueled by the Bravo franchise, Shannon has no regrets.
“We had a sit-down with the family, and I said, ‘If we do this, we’re going to go all in — no censorship,” said Shannon, who has three daughters —Sophie, 12, and 9-year-old twins Stella and Adeline, with David.
