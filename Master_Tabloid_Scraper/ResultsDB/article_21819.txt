The Best Tweets & Memes Clowning On The Fyre Festival!/n

With acts cancelling their performances, people scrounging around for food, and feral dogs eyeing their prey from the distance, concertgoers were left with nothing more than a raging desire to return to their homes ASAP.
The rest of us, from behind the safety of our computer screens, gleefully watched a bunch of millennial trust fund babies get mildly inconvenienced for 24 hours. And. It. Was. HILARIOUS.
Take another look at some of the best reactions to the mess (below)! 

#FyreFestival is an art installation where mediocre people realize what their lives would be like without rich parents.

If you paid $250,000 to go to a Ja Rule concert you deserve to get stuck at a financial advisory seminar. #FyreFestival

Do not let #FyreFestival refugees into the country. We cannot risk it if even ONE of them has been radicalized.
