One day prior to the Academy Awards the stars were out in full force at the 2016 Film Independent Spirit Awards today (Feb. 27, 2016) in Santa Monica, California.
The annual Spirit Awards tends to be an indie antidote to Hollywood’s biggest night, but this year, the contrast will be starker than usual.
Whereas the Oscars are dealing with a second straight year of all-white acting nominees, the Spirit Awards — which celebrate films made for $20 million or less — have five non-white acting nominees out of 20.
It was a big day for Spotlight which took home the Best Feature award, Tom McCarthy for Best Director, McCarthy and Josh Singer for Best Screenplay, Tom McArdle for Best Editing and Best Ensemble.

Tangerine actress Mya Taylor made history by being the first transgender person to win Best Supporting Actress.
After winning the award, Taylor said, “First of all, no one tells you how nervous you’re gonna be when you’re up against other big actors for an award. There are so many things that go through your head, like ‘Am I gonna trip on this long ass dress getting up here?'” she joked at the podium upon accepting her award. “I have had a long journey through my 2015 because I had some from almost nothing and then got his role and this movie, and my life just did a total 360.”
Taylor ended her speech with a message to filmmakers: “There is transgender talent. There’s very beautiful transgender talent. So, you better get it out there and put it in your next movie.”
