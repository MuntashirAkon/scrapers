The Age of Adeline star previously declared her love for Swift in September when she shut down rumors that she and the singer were feuding. Who can forget her hilarious post?

Love my Canadian family almost as much as I love Taylor Lively. I mean Swift. Ok, FIIINE we can hyphenate our last names. Xo Blake Swift-Lively 4eva.”
