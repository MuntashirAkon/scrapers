“It’s been a wonderful year,” Stuart, along with her mother Rosanne, tells TODAY.com. “We have made so many new friends and learned many more things about the fashion industry, but most of all, we have received so much love and support from our social media family.”
The 19-year-old from Queensland, Australia has close to 100k followers on Instagram and over half a million fans on Facebook who encouraged her as she pushed through the exhausting days, especially during NYFW.
“I think the long hours were the biggest challenge — and the huge amount of people backstage working at fashion shows!” she says.
But Stuart knows hard work — she’s chronicled her weight loss on social media and hits up the gym regularly for boxing, rowing, ropes and more.

And as her Instagram and Facebook friends inspire her, she helps them right back.
“People do contact us every day and say thank you for giving us strength and encouragement,” Stuart says. “Anything is possible.”
And now an even bigger year is on the horizon — Stuart says she’s already booked up for fashion weeks in New York, Milan, and Tokyo for 2016, and fundraisers in Uganda, Canada and Alaska.

“I think we’re going to have an amazing year to come,” Stuart says.
And in between adding stamps to her passport, Stuart will find time to launch her own clothing line, and put together a charity fashion show. But don’t worry about whether it’s too much for her to handle—Stuart says she’s prepared for whatever comes her way.
“I am a lot stronger now.”
