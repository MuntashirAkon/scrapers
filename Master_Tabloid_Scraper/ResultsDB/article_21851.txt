Careful, Blake Lively!The actress took a little spill while filming a workout scene in a forest on the set of her upcoming flick The Age of Adeline in Vancouver on Monday.Wearing a blue and white sweater and a matching headband, Ryan Reynold's missus slipped and fell down a hill during the hiking scene and appears to have cut her hand. Lively screamed in pain upon first examining the bloody cut before she started to laugh with the rest of the crew. The blond beauty began filming yesterday around 1 p.m. and shot until 4.Word on the set is that the 26-year-old actress, who is also a top-notch chef, has fallen in love with Vancouver food. She regularly orders from Blue Water Cafe and often eats breakfast at Medina Cafe.

In fact, Reynolds has been spotted visiting his ladylove on set and has even come by to take Lively out for lunch (presumably at one of her favorite spots). The couple has also recently been spotted enjoying a romantic dinner at a local Chinese restaurant in Vancouver.Directed by Lee Toland Krieger, who helmed Celeste and Jesse Forever, The Age of Adaline follows "the miraculous life of the 29-year-old title character (portrayed by Lively), who stops aging after recovering from a near fatal accident. Over the 20th century she embarks on an epic but isolated worldwide journey, keeping her secret, until she meets a man who forever alters her life."The flick, which marks Lively's first project since Gossip Girl ended in 2012 and also stars Ellen Burstyn, Michiel Huisman and Harrison Ford, is slated for release sometime in 2015.â€”Reporting by Michelle Falls
