As if we needed further proof Blake Lively's Instagram is just the best. The 27-year-old beauty took to the photo-sharing site on Wednesday to clarify her recent comments about breastfeeding (while proving she also has a sense of humor), sharing a silly shot with sister Robyn Lively in which the two siblings are poking each other in the face with a carrot and a celery stick. "...I can't understand why people don't take me seriously as a chef. #PleaseDontShowLeCordonBleu @RobynLively #WhoPutsTrufflesonTheirNipplesDearGodCan'tReportersTakeaJoke #ThatWasTheLongestHashtagEver," Ryan Reynold's other half captioned the goofy image.

Hilarious hashtags aside (and we thought #RyanReynoldsRocksMySocks would always take the cake!), Lively, who welcomed daughter James just before the New Year, posted the pic in response to a number of reports suggesting she rubs truffles on her nipples in order to enhance her baby girl's palate."I rub truffles on my nipples every day. You got to give her a very well balanced palate from a young age so she doesn't eat only beige food!" the former Gossip Girl star and self-professed foodie joked to reporters while promoting her new film The Age of Adeline in Los Angeles on Sunday, per People. But apparently, Lively's remarks were taken too literally by some, causing a series of ridiculous headlines, which she was quick to shut down.

This isn't the first the new mom has clarified reports surrounding her surely darling daughter. Over the weekend, she revealed the true identity of her baby girl's godmother after BFF Amber Tamblyn recently said that she and fellow Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants co-stars Alexis Bledel and America Ferrara are the newborn's godparents."I never named them my godmothers," Lively told E! News. "They're my dear friends. I would say my baby has a lot of fairy godmothers."She added that if, god forbid, something tragic were to happen, "My sister [Robyn Lively] would be the one to take care of my baby."
