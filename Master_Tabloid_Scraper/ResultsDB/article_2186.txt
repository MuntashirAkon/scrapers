Warning: The illusion is about to be shattered.Those who grew up watching Nickelodeon's Drake & Josh were shocked to find out that the sitcom's stars, Drake Bell and Josh Peck, don't exactly share the same brotherly love that they used to on-screen. Despite reuniting last year on Grandfathered, it seems as if Drake and Josh aren't nearly as close anymore... or at least not tight enough to score a wedding invitation. Bell was not present at his former co-star's nuptials to Paige O'Brien last weekend, which prompted the scorned actor to address their possible beef in a since-deleted Twitter spree. Yikes.

Some actors worked through their differences to bring us some of the greatest shows known to man, and some didn't keep it quite so civil.Read on to find out who didn't get along...but be wary of having some of your dreams crushed forever!
