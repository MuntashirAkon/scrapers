The I Am Jazz star became the youngest grand marshal EVER at the parade, but true to her intelligence and poise we've come to know, she wasn't thrown off by the pressure one bit!
Speaking to the media, Jennings reflected on how proud she was to have been at such an important event on Sunday in NYC: 

"Pride is about loving yourself and embracing your uniqueness. Admiring the triumphs that have prevailed throughout your life as well as accepting the challenges that you face. Pride is also about sharing all of those emotions of love and happiness with the community around you so we can stay connected, united, and prideful of ourselves and one another."
Awww!!
It wasn't just Jennings at Pride, though ‚Äî SO much went down in the city yesterday!
In addition to Jazz, other grand marshals this year included AIDS and LGBT activist Cecilia Chung, and Subhi Nahas, a Syrian refugee who also founded the very first LGBT magazine in his home country.

Other notable LGBT stars like retired NBA player Jason Collins were involved ‚Äî he actually rode a specific NBA/WNBA float the the parade, making that sports organization the very first league to promote in the march! Good for them!!
