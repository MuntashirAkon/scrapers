Cecilia Hart, who starred in CBS’s 1979 police drama Paris, has passed away, after a year-long battle with ovarian cancer at the age of 68, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Hart was the wife of Star Wars actor, James Earl Jones.

The couple met on the set of Paris in 1979 when Jones played Police Captain Woody Paris and Hart played a young detective. The pair were married in March of 1982 following a production of Othello, where they played opposite each other.
The news was first reported by Westport, Conn., news website Westport Now. Jones and Hart frequently appeared together onstage at the Westport County Playhouse. Most recently, they played husband and wife in the theater’s 2015 production of Bedroom Farce.
