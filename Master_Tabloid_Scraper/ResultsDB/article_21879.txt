Cecilia Cassini Rocks The Red Carpet Of The Young Hollywood Awards/n
At last night’s Young Hollywood Awards we caught up with Cecilia Cassini for some dish from the youngest fashion designer prodigy to hit the scene. Who better to get deets on what’s hot from?
First and foremost, we were dying to know who she idolizes as a fashion designer. She responded,

Karl Lagerfeld. I love him! I think he just has magical hands in a way that every time he touches fabric it turns into something magical.

We’re sure she’ll be able to give ol’ Karl a run for his money one of these days. For those of you who want to know what’s hot for the summer Cecilia is ready to break out her boldly colored tube dresses for some classic fun in the sun.
