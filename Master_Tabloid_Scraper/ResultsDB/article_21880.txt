Miley Cyrus Shows Her Support for Pre-Teen Fashionista Cecilia Cassini/n
Miley Cyrus may be moving in a mature new direction where her own career is concerned, but that doesn’t mean she’s not willing to be supportive of the young up-and-comers anymore.
The 17-year-old Hannah Montana sensation showed up at the trunk show of 10-year-old fashion designer Cecilia Cassini at the Fred Segal store in Santa Monica on Saturday, lending some star power to the prodigy’s event.
Maybe Miley can hook Cecilia up with her younger sister Noah? We can only imagine what kind of mind-bending styles the two could come up with.
