David Walton and Majandra Delfino are now the proud parents of two beautiful babies. A rep for the actors tells E! News that they welcomed son Louis Augustus at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in L.A. on Sunday, Nov. 10. The newborn weighed in at 8 lbs., 7 oz."Louis is as healthy as can be," Walton says. "We couldn't be happier with our very early Christmas gift." Walton, 35, and Delfino, 32, are already parents to 17-month-old daughter Cecilia Delphine.Walton—who starred in the short-lived NBC sitcom Bent—played Zooey Deschanel's love interest in a recurring role on Fox's New Girl. He next stars in NBC's mid-season comedy About a Boy, based upon the Nick Hornby novel of the same name.

Delfino, meanwhile, next appears in CBS' mid-season sitcom Friends With Better Lives. The half-hour comedy also stars Kevin Connolly, Brooklyn Decker and James Van Der Beek. It seems as the actress is already getting the hang of raising two babies. "Anything more heavenly than newborn asleep, toddler taking her nap & you in favorite chair with a chicken in chile verde with some Bullock?" she tweeted on Friday, Nov. 15.Congratulations to the happy couple!
