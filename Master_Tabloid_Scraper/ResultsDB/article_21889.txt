Eva Longoria's ALMA Awards airs tonight on ABC, but I have some backstage swag gossip for ya that you won't see on TV. When Longoria hit the Backstage Creations gifting lounge during Friday night's taping, she walked away with a load of goodies, including a Susan Farber miniclutch, a couture dress from Cecilia Pérez Atelier and a present for her pooch—a leather doggy carrier from Platinum Dog.

Terrence Howard picked up Sonic Impact's portable speaker system. He also left stylin' with a new shirt from Cubavera, as did Mario Lopez. Fantastic Four superhero Jessica Alba chose a clutch from Mimeki. Salma Hayek proved to be a real angel. The mommy-to-be donated her freebies to Longoria's pet charity, Padres Contra el Cáncer. But it looked like Hayek got some business in, too. She was spotted in the lounge chatting with Babel director Alejandro González Iñárritu for more than an hour. Hayek obviously isn't letting her pregnancy slow her down. The very next day, she made time for the fourth annual First Star Celebration for Children's Rights in Santa Monica. She was on hand to present the Visionary Award to MGM Studios honcho Rick Sands.
