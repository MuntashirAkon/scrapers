You know that scene from The Lion King where the whole kingdom comes to see baby Simba? That many animals is our guess.We get that it's cold in New York, Rihanna, but how 'bout you leave some fur for the rest of the world! We don't know whether the "Something More" singer's massive minx is real or faux, but we're more focused on the fact that she looks like our Aunt Ethel in route to a black tie wedding at the Waldorf. Though, Ethel would never pair her prized outerwear possession with a pair of sneaks and sweats.

The "Monster" belter is sporting the equivalent of sky-high Jimmy Choos with your yoga pants! Yes, the grey New Balance and heather pants technically match the cloud-colored coat, but that only make us think Ri-Ri was trying to make this look work!We don't blame the Barbadian beauty for owning a jacket that costs as much as our car, we just feel like this kind of drama deserves a bigger moment, like, say, the coronation of a king. Non animal, of course.
