How long do new beginnings last? From the looks of The Real Housewives of New Jersey, it could take just three episodes for the new beginnings to be new endings. After getting out of prison, Teresa Giudice and Jacqueline Laurita, formerly known as Lucy and Ethel back when they were friends, decided to start again. That included two outings, Dolores Catania's birthday party and Melissa Gorga's boutique opening, and then a home visit.On the next episode of RHONJ, Teresa and Joe Giudice head to the Laurita's pad for some catching up, but it doesn't look like the revived friendship stays on course."Any toxic people, I want to keep them away," Teresa tells Jacqueline in the preview that aired on Watch What Happens Live. "The last time I was here, you attacked me on your porch."Jacqueline calmly says she didn't attack her, but Teresa maintains she felt ambushed at the time. You recall the moment, it was the prolonged porch conversation that Caroline Manzo eventually crashed and asked why there was yelling.
