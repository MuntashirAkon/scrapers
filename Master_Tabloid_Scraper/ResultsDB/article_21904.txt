Daily Disgrace! Jon Stewart Secretly Helping Pervy Pal, Anthony Weiner/n
Ex-Daily Show host Jon Stewart could become the butt of some pretty nasty jokes if he isn’t careful about how he handles his relationship with disgraced politician, Anthony Weiner.
RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned that the 54-year-old comedian is still supporting and giving advice to the disgraced pervert estranged husband of Clinton advisor Huma Abedin.
“Jon’s very gently denounced Anthony’s behavior publicly, but behind closed doors he’s giving his old 1980s roommate all the advice he can to get through this,” said an insider of the two men, who were housemates in Dewey Beach, Delaware, for the summer of 1987.

As Radar reported, pervy Weiner, 52, recently checked himself into sex addiction rehab after he was caught up in his latest sick scandal.
In the fall, the former congressman was caught exchanging sexually explicit texts with a 15-year-old North Carolina girl.
“Jon has pledged to support Anthony when he’s ready to make some public statements but right now the plan is for him to stay far out of sight during Jon’s book tour,” said the source.
“Jon still really cares about the guy and was one of the people who insisted he get professional help — but even he knows he can’t afford to be associated with him.”
