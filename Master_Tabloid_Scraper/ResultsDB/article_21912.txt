Two Rags and a Baby/n
Demi Moore’s uterus is the latest battlegroundin the escalating war between the Star and Us Weekly. This week’sStar carries yet another “shocker” on Demi Moore’salleged bun in the oven, claiming the actress is in “baby denial”because she won’t publicly admit to being four months pregnant. Wedon’t know (or, frankly, care) whether Moore is carrying AshtonKutcher’s idiot spawn, but we’re loving the reaction fromUs. Wags at the rival weekly are sniping that it’s actuallyStar editor Bonnie Fuller who’s in denial — because Demiain’t pregnant. “It’s getting embarrassing,” says one.“They’re obviously going to have to run a fake miscarriage story toget out of this.”
Last week Us called bullshit on the pregnancyrumors, claiming they were started by Kutcher’s camp to generate press forhis two films, Guess Who and A Lot Like Love. Asked about thebaby drama, a Star insider says it’s actually Fuller’sL.A.-based stringers who have her convinced that the 42-year-old mother of threeis expecting a fourth — even though recent photos show the actress lookingthinner than ever. Still egg-faced from the infamous “It’s BabyTime!” cover on the eve of Brad and Jen’s breakup — the tabworld equivalent of “Dewey Defeats Truman” — Fuller is onceagain betting her credibility on her female intuit…er, journalistic instincts.Asked to defuse the baby brinkmanship, Moore’s publicist, Stephan Huvane,opted instead to mock Fuller’s track record, saying, “The Staris not known for its accuracy and good reporting. Just in the last yearalone they had Demi and Ashton married twice…. Personal questions about Demiare just that — personal — and not something anyone in the media isentitled to know.” What else would we want to know about — hercareer?
