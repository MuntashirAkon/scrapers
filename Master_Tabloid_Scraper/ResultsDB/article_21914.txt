Get Ready To Dive Into Your Vault Of Gold: Disney Is Bringing Back DuckTales In 2017! A Woo-Hoo!!!!/n

DuckTales! A woo-hoo!
Disney seems to be catering to the public nowadays, but almost as if the public consisted ONLY of kids who were in the process of growing up twenty years ago!!!
The corporation has announced that they're bringing back the old classic called DuckTales (which aired from 1987 to 1990) and it will be featuring its original cartoon cast: Scrooge McDuck and his family of Huey, Dewey, and Louie!!!
And we're SO excited by the wonderful news!

Here's what Marc Buhaj, senior vice president of programming and the general manager of Disney XD, said: 
"DuckTales has a special place in Disney's TV animation history, it drew its inspiration from Disney Legend Carl Barks' comic books and through its storytelling and artistic showmanship, set an enduring standard for animated entertainment that connects with both kids and adults. Our new series will bring that same energy and adventurous spirit to a new generation."
We have a good feeling about this revival!
Hopefully the next generation will take this series the same way the last generation did!
Basically like a duck would take to water, ha!
Keep up the good work, Disney!!!
