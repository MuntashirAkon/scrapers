But the 21-year-old wasn't always this confident.
Early in her career, the Lips Are Movin' singer had huge doubts, mainly due to the fact that her figure — though healthy and normal — is considered "atypical" for pop stars. She even questioned her ability to become famous!
She confesses in the March issue of Seventeen magazine: 
"When I saw photos of myself, I would think, I look awful. There's a double chin! I never thought I'd be a pop star. I don't look like Rihanna."
However, the Grammy nominee says that after the release of her All About That Bass video, the support from her adoring fans completely boosted her self-esteem and made her love her body!
She explains:
"When I was signing autographs, this girl came up to me bawling and said, ‘You make me feel pretty again. Thank you.' It really resonated with me that this girl was so gorgeous, and she didn't even know it. It's a mental thing. Just recently I was thinking, 'I'm confident now, and I look good,' and that's because I've started saying those words out loud more. So now when I see pictures, I'm like, ‘Oh my God, why would I hate myself at all? I look incredible in that picture!'"
And the feisty crooner DOES look incredible!
Now that she's topped the charts, the Massachusetts-native is seen as role-model for teens around the nation.
So, does she have any words of advice to give to her beloved followers?
Meg says:
"I guess the biggest thing that I've learned is, never doubt your dreams. No matter how big your dream is or how ridiculous you think it is, you can't doubt it—you have to believe in it. Because it will happen."
Awww! This is 100% true!
Meghan Trainor: beautiful inside and out.
