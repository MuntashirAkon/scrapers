Disney Remakes The Duck Tales Opening With Real Ducks Because The '90s Were Awesome & You All Needed This!/n

Remember the Disney show Duck Tales from the late 80's/early 90's?
Ya know, the one about Scrooge McDuck and his nephews Huey, Dewey, and Louie and their various adventures?
Well, have you ever wondered what the opening theme would look like with ACTUAL ducks instead of the animated ones everyone loves?
Well, even if you didn't let this thought keep you up at night, Disney decided to answer that question with an AH-MAZING YouTube video anyway.
Boy are we glad they did because this video is total cuteness OVERLOAD. 
It's absolutely incredible!
Try not to say awwww at the adorable remakeâ€¦AFTER THE JUMP!!!

C'MON! How much cuter can you get??? 
Ducks + nostalgia = a total win./n
