Post-Baby Bod Alert! Megan Fox Makes Her Red Carpet Return At The Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Sports Awards! See What She Wore!/n

Helllooo, hawtness!!
After a year and a half hiatus, Megan Fox FINALLY made her red carpet return at the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Sports Awards in Westwood on Thursday. And she certainly didn't disappoint! 
The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles star decided to go full turtle on everyone, rocking a chic turtle green Dolce & Gabbana dress that featured golden skeleton key embellishments all over the fabric. 
Her figure looked STUNNING in the curve-hugging number â€” hard to believe she gave birth to her second baby boy 5 months ago, right??
The actress' legs were also perfectly accentuated, thanks to her sky-high Christian Louboutin wedges. While we normally wouldn't love those shoes with that dress, the fact that they weren't overly sexy made them great for the kid-centric event! 
A black Ferragamo box clutch, dewey makeup, and soft wavy hair completed her look. Fab!
