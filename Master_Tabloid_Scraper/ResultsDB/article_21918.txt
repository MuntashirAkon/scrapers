Kylie Jenner Is Polished For Prom On Seventeen! Might As Well Give Her The Crown Now!/n

Was there a better gurlie to cover the annual issue of Seventeen Prom than Kylie Jenner?? 
We thinks not!
Sure, she sometimes dresses older, but her biggest fans would say that's just the maturity coming through from this 16-year-old! 
And the youngest Jenner totes rocked the cover with a fun n' flirty pose in an embellished turquoise gown, featuring a sweetheart neckline and empire waist. 
We especially love the sweet, silver bow necklace!
Inside the spread, there's no lack of details or embellishments — exactly what you'd expect from prom queen worthy ensems! 
In one shot, Kylie seductively lays out on sun chairs in a light pink gown, dripping in pearls. Then in the next, she sets a different pace in a two-piece combo, including a lacy crop top and an über chic black and white polka dotted skirt.
With all these stunning looks, Kylie should have no problem putting together an one-kind-look for her very own prom!
Whatever your opinion of her may be, one thing's for sure — she definitely reminds us of a lot of prom queens we know! 
Ch-ch-check out the sneak peek in the gallery (below)!
