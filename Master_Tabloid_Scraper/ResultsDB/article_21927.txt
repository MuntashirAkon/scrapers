Courteney Cox and David Arquette Sign On For ‘Scream 4′/n
Yes, it’s true! There will be a fourth Scream film!
David Arquette has confirmed that he and wife Courteney Cox have signed on to reprise their roles as Deputy Dewey Riley and Gale Weathers. The couple first met on the set of the original Scream back in 1997.
“We are going to be doing Scream 4,” Arquette told E! today. “Kevin Williamson is writing the script at this moment, and hopefully Wes Craven is going to direct.”
“I fell in love with my wife on Scream, so the opportunity to bring [Dewey] back to life and for my wife to play that really bitchy character again, it’s just going to be really fun,” Arquette said. “It’s just great.”
While Arquette was more than happy to announce the good news, he remained mum on the details of the new plot, saying “Kevin has sort of put out the broad strokes, but I don’t think I’m at liberty to share any of that.”
Will Neve Campbell be back on board as Sydney? She has reportedly turned down a chance to star in the latest sequel, but Arquette still has hope, saying, “I hope Neve does it. I really hope so.”
