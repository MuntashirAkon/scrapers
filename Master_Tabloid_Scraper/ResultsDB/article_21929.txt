"Dewey" A Must-Read for Cat Lovers/n
If you’ve ever loved a cat dearly, you simply must pick up the new book “Dewey: The Small-Town Library Cat Who Touched the World.” 
It’s the story of an unforgettable feline named Dewey Readmore Books who was discovered cold and shivering in a library book drop and ended up becoming the mascot for an Iowa library, touching the lives of scores of people who walked through its doors.
The orange kitty became a worldwide sensation – magazines and newspapers profiled him, a film crew traveled all the way from Japan to film the bookcase-hopping cat. He truly was small-town Spencer’s star and now he’s immortalized in this new book by librarian and cat caretaker, Vicki Myron.
The way Myron describes the connection a person can have with a cat is precious yet honest and the message of this book clearly resonates with readers – it’s become a New York Times bestseller.
