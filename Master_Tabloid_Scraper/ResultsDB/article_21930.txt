For Your Little Library: Dewey's Story, Retold for Kids/n
If you read Vicky Myron’s 2008 best-selling book, Dewey: The Small-Town Library Cat Who Touched the World, about the special orange kitten abandoned in a book depository at an Iowa library, then you know that the story should have come with a box of tissues. But now Myron has teamed up with illustrator Steve James to adapt that heart-warming tale for younger audiences – minus the tears! 
The colorfully illustrated book ($16.99) is called Dewey: There’s a Cat in the Library and includes some of the fluffy feline’s most amusing adventures – like climbing into the book cart, snooping in open drawers and running around with rubber bands. Just when you think things might turn sad with a melancholy little girl reading a book, Dewey swoops in to save the day just like a trusty library cat should. 
It’s the purr-fect bedtime story to add to your little one’s library.
