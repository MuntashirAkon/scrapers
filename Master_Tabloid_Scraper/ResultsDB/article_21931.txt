'Dewey' Author Adopts New Kitten Named Page/n
Another orange feline has found a place in the heart of best-selling author, Vicki Myron. Myron’s cat, Dewey Readmore Books, who was the subject of her popular book Dewey: The Small-Town Library Cat Who Touched the World and came to her via the book drop at the Spencer, Iowa library where she worked for 20 years, passed away in November of 2006.  Her new kitten was found in the street on a very cold day last month, according to USA Today. “It was snowing quite heavily and she was covered in snow. She had ice chunks hanging from her. She had twigs and leaves tangled in her fur,” says Mryon’s friend, Sue Selzer, who rescued the kitty. “I took her back to my office and dried her off, put some warm water on her and cleaned her up.”
When Selzer offered up the kitten to Myron, she “fell in love instantly.” In the spirit of all things book-based, Myron has named the cat Page. “She’s a sweet, loving cat, very affectionate, very easy going,” she says of Page, who looks very similar to Dewey. “She’s definitely a girl but eats like a pig, probably because she was a street cat that probably had to fend for herself.”
Myron, who retired as library director last year, had intended to wait a year or two before bringing a new feline into her home because she’s been on the road frequently promoting her book. But she says the timing was just right with Page’s arrival. “I knew if the right one came along at the right time I’d get one, but I was hoping it would be a couple of years down the road because I’m not around much,” she says. “But here she is. We kind of found each other.”
Myron’s new kitty won’t be Dewey’s successor at the Spencer library though, the newspaper says. Kay Larson, the library’s current director, says the board will discuss getting a new cat at its Jan. 8 meeting.
