Meryl Streep to Star in "Dewey" Movie/n
Hot on the heels of Marley & Me, another best-selling pet novel is heading to the big screen. We just read that actress Meryl Streep will star in the film adaptation of Vicki Myron’s best-selling book, Dewey: The Small-Town Library Cat Who Touched the World. The tear-jerker is about an orange cat named Dewey Readmore Books who became the mascot for the Spencer, Iowa library that Myron worked at for 25 years. The book traces the life of the cat and its caretaker’s – through cancer, divorce and scores of library patrons – over 18 years.
