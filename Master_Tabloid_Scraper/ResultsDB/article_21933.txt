John C. Reilly Hits the Road as Dewey Cox/n
With the late-night talk shows darkened during the writers’ strike, John C. Reilly is bringing his flashy, pompadour-ed, ’50s-era rock character, Dewey Cox, directly to the stage.   
 Reilly, 42, played a VIP concert in character at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum in Cleveland on Wednesday, part of a mini-tour to promote his upcoming mock biopic, Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story. 
 “It’s a pretty legendary place. The people that are here, they’re almost as famous as Dewey Cox,” Reilly joked to the Akron Beacon Journal about the Rock Hall.  
 “Because the talk shows were done, the studio [Columbia Pictures] supported this big music tour,” Reilly said. “I don’t know if we would have had as much time for the tour if we had to make the rounds” of talk shows.   
 The tour kicked off Monday at the Roxy Theatre in Hollywood, MTV reports. There, he delivered a boozed-filled, innuendo-laced set of songs, including a Johnny Cash tribute (“Guilty as Charged”), a feminist song (“Ladies First”) and a pro-midget anthem (“Let Me Hold You (Little Man)”).   
 The “Cox Across America” tour includes six more dates and wraps in New York on Dec. 19. The movie comes out Dec. 21.
