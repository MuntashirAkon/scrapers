This season Will & Grace will return to NBC with its original stars Debra Messing, Eric McCormack, Megan Mullally and Sean Hayes reprising their roles. ABC is bringing back Roseanne with the original cast, including Roseanne Barr, John Goodman, Laurie Metcalf, Sara Gilbert, Michael Fishman and Lecy Goranson—even Becky No. 2, Sarah Chalke, will return, but in a new role. And over on Fox, the network is bringing back Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny for an extended second event series too.Yes, networks are still dusting off beloved properties for another go.
