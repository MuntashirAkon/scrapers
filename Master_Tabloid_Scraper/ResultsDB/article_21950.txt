'DuckTales' Reboot Hustlin' Like Scrooge McDuck/nThe makers of the  "DuckTales " reboot are planning to solve mysteries and rewrite history once again ... and make fat stacks of cash while they're at it.  "DuckTales " filed trademark paperwork ... setting Disney up to produce themed kids' juices, soft drinks, toys, games, books and all other playthings. Translation -- expect to see the modern versions of Huey, Dewey and Louie on a crapload of merchandise very soon. The reboot of the beloved '80s cartoon was announced last year and will debut in 2017. Woo-oo!/n
