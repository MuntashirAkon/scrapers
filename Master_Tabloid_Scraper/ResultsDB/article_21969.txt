Thomas, 47, was later arrested for domestic battery by the Los Angeles County Sheriff and held on $20,000.00 bail. She was released the same day.
Following the incident and noting that Thomas had been violent in the past — stating she “even came at him with a knife” — the producer was granted a domestic violence emergency protective order to ensure that his wife would not be allowed within 100 yards of him, the couple’s Agoura Hills home or their nine-year-old daughter.

Two days later on March 8, Schwake began divorce proceedings against Thomas, citing irreconcilable differences and asked the court to terminate its jurisdiction to award his wife spousal support.
In addition, the producer is seeking joint legal custody of the couple’s daughter and is requesting the court grant him primary physical custody with visitation to Thomas.
