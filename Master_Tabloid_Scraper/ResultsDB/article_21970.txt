EXCLUSIVE DOCUMENTS: Milton Bradley Accused Of Spousal Abuse In Divorce Filing
According to court documents, exclusively obtained by RadarOnline.com, Monique and Milton were married for five years, and have two sons, Jeremiah, and Noah.
Monique requested a restraining order against Milton on January 24th and states that while they were in New York City for New Year’s Eve: “Milton cursed and yelled at me for approximately five minutes and then he grabbed a glass from off the coffee table and threw it directly at my head from across the room.
“The glass shattered on my head and I started to bleed. As soon as Milton saw me bleeding, he started crying and begging me to forgive him. He stated that he lost it and that he would kill himself if I left him. I did not know what to do.”

Monique says hotel security knocked on the hotel room door as she was in the bathroom trying to stop the bleeding, but Milton said there was no problem, and Monique didn’t go to the hospital.
Monique is requesting that she be given legal and physical custody of the boys, and that Milton be given visitation.  She is seeking child support and cites irreconcilable differences as the reason for the split.
