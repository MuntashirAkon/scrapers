Emma Stone sure had one memorable Golden Globes ceremony this year!

Not only did the La La Land star nab the award for Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy Motion Picture on Sunday night, but she also shared what was perhaps the most awkward hug ever with director Damien Chazelle.
When Chazelle was announced as the winner of Best Director, Stone went in to congratulate her collaborator. However, she was rebuffed as the filmmaker went in to hug his girlfriend, Olivia Hamilton, resulting in a cringe-worthy three-way embrace.
“That was weird,” Stone appeared to say as she slinked away.

The 28-year-old was equally awkward when she was informed that her ex-boyfriend, Andrew Garfield, shared a passionate kiss with Ryan Reynolds when La La Land co-star Ryan Gosling was talking up to the stage to receive his award for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy Motion Picture.
“What?” she asked in disbelief when Entertainment Tonight showed her a clip of the epic lip-lock . “They did not kiss each other!”
“They did?!” she said, turning away to laugh. “That’s hilarious.”
Gosling, who poked fun at being confused with Reynolds during acceptance speech that night, made light of the incident. He quipped, “I mean, I’m happy for them, honestly, you know? Good for them.”
“I’m happy for them, too,” Stone agreed.
La La Land took home a staggering seven Golden Globe awards, including Best Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.
