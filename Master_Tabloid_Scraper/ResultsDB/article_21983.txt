Billboard reports that Epic Records and Syco exercised their option on Fifth Harmony’s foursome three days after Cabello announced that she would be pursuing a solo career and that the group is expected to release their third album in 2017. Cabello is said to be dropping her first single in April or May.
Cabello and Fifth Harmony released conflicting statements following the group’s splintering. The group said that Cabello’s representatives informed them of her departure, but Cabello said that this was “simply not true.”
