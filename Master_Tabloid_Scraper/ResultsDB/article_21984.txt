Sundance Head, a 37-year-old country singer from Houston, TX, was named the winner of The Voice on Tuesday (Dec. 13, 2016).

Billy Gilman from Richmond, RI was Season 11’s runner-up, while 17-year-old Wé McDonald from Harlem finished in third. Head performed his original song, “Darlin’ Don’t Go,” after he was congratulated by his family members and his coach, Blake Shelton. Head’s win marks the fifth time that one of Shelton’s team members has taken the top prize on the show.

“I just want to thank you for being such a great guy and being so sweet to me, man, when I know you don’t have to do that,” Head said to Shelton. “You do this for a job, you know, but you really are such a genuine person, man, and I thank the Lord that he put you in my life.”

Head made it into the finals on Season Six of American Idol in 2007. He is the son of musician Roy Head, whose song “Treat Her Right” was popular in 1965. His win came as a surprise given that Gilman, the runner-up, seemed to be the frontrunner all along. On the morning of the finale, Justin Bieber voiced his support for Gilman in a tweet that read, “Hey Blake…sorry. #teamadam. Good luck Billy.”
Stevie Wonder and Ariana Grande opened the show with their new single “Faith” from the movie Sing and Head collaborated with KISS to perform “Detroit Rock City and “Rock & Roll All Night.” Bruno Mars, The Weeknd and Kelly Clarkson also lent their voices to the 2-hour broadcast.
