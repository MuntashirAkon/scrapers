Real Housewives of New Jersey star Teresa Giudice got her Christmas present early this year, all thanks to John Legend.

The singer stopped by Watch What Happens Live last night where host Andy Cohen told the singer, Joe Giudice, who’s currently serving a 41-month prison sentence, wrote his wife Teresa a song dreamed of having Legend sing to her. So in the hopes that Legend would make Joe’s dream come true, he provided the singer with a keyboard and the lyrics and asked him to serenade Teresa through the camera.
Legend, who was visibly embarrassed, obliged, freestyling a melody on the keyboard singing Joe’s lyrics. “Cause I’ll love you forever. I’ll never lie no, never. Cause you are my baby, my empress, my lady,” he crooned, before ending with the grand finale, “Teresaaaaaa you are my,i,i,i,i,i,i,i,i,i,i,i,i heaven.”
“I swear on the lyrics it says ‘my’ and then ‘i,i,i,i,i,i heaven'” he explained.
