It features guest collaborations from Chance the Rapper and Miguel — and is meant to help people heal following this year’s election. “When we were thinking about when my album was going to come out, we had no expectation that we’d be reacting to a Donald Trump presidency,” the singer told Entertainment Weekly. “Now that it’s the case, I feel like this album could help people heal a little bit after some tough times.”
John Legend’s Darkness and Light is out now. Stream it below.

Donald Glover also released new music, his third full-length album as Childish Gambino. Unlike  previously released tracks, this album features soul/funk/R&B grooves over his usual hip-hop. Childish Gambino’s Awaken, My Love! is out now. Stream it below.

Last but not least, The Hamilton Mixtape is finally here. Not only does it feature covers from at least a dozen artists you know by name — including Queen Latifah, Kelly Clarkson, Ashanti, Wiz Khalifa, and Alicia Keys — but the album also includes never-before-heard tracks that were cut from the Broadway musical, Hamilton.
