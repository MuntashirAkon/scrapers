Today (Dec. 1, 2016) is World AIDS Day, and to do his part, Neil Patrick Harris is launching a new fundraiser that will send a lucky winner and a friend to the Big Apple for a night in the city with the actor! To give this new venture some razzle dazzle, the How I Met Your Mother veteran attempts to pull off a magic trick or two in a new video.

“To support RED’s fight against AIDS, I’m teaming up with Omaze and Coca-Cola to offer you the chance to join me,” Harris says in the video as a wave of his arm sends flowers crashing to the floor, “for a magical night.”

Throughout the clip, Harris lights a playbook on fire, not-so-mysteriously makes a paper airplane fly and does, in fact, make food appear in a dish while explaining how the winner’s night will play out.
By donating ten dollars, you will be entered to win a flight to New York and a night out with Harris and his husband David Burtka. The evening will include some fine dining and a Broadway show. However, as he explains in the video, don’t expect it to be Hamilton, this is a fundraiser after all and those tickets are steep! Proceeds will provide medicine for the babies throughout the world born with HIV.
Hopefully winners will also get some actual sleight-of-hand from the real-life magician during this special night.
Head over to Omaze to make a donation, and check out the clip above!
