The cast and crew of The Beguiled — including Nicole Kidman, Colin Farrell, Sofia Coppola, Kirsten Dunst, and Elle Fanning — are looking for a mind at work.
Earlier this week, Hamilton mastermind Lin-Manuel Miranda issued a call to arms on social media, encouraging fans to record themselves singing along to the musical, post the video online with the hashtag #Ham4All, and donate to the Immigrants: We Get the Job Done Coalition. So far, stars like Gina Rodriguez, Ben Stiller, Shonda Rhimes, and Kelly Clarkson have all taken the challenge, and now, The Beguiled is getting in on the fun.

Coppola’s retelling of the 1971 Clint Eastwood classic stars Farrell as a wounded Union soldier who’s taken in by a Southern women’s boarding school, and Emma Howard, who plays one of the school’s young students, shared a video she and her young costars shot last year on the Beguiled set. The clip follows Howard, Oona Laurence, Angourie Rice, and Addison Riecke as they do their best lip-sync rendition of “The Schuyler Sisters” — in full 1860s costume.
The four girls steal the show, but their older costars Farrell, Kidman, Dunst, and Fanning all make cameos, as does Coppola herself. (Who knew Farrell did such an excellent “work, work”?)
As for Miranda, he offered his stamp of approval on Twitter.
