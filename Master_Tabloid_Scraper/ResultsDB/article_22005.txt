Denise in Milton, Wisc.: There has been a lot of panic among Supernatural fans over the upcoming episode four, the episode in which Dean goes into the future. The panic is over there not being very much of Sam in this episode. Have you heard how much of a role Sam will play in this episode? Will Sam have adequate screentime, or does he just do a cameo? Any info would be greatly appreciated by the panicking fandom. Thank you.

Sources tell us that Sam does have fairly limited screentime in episode four, "The End," airing Oct. 1, but he's not just being excluded because Dean's cooler or something. It's to a purpose. Specifically, sources say that Sam makes an appearance about 10 minutes before the end of the episode, and that his absence from the rest of the hour will "make sense when you see it." So don't call it a cameo, and more importantly, don't panic! Trust the writersâ€”they have a plan.Here's the official episode description: "Sam (Jared Padalecki) tells Dean (Jensen Ackles) he wants to rejoin Dean in the battle of the Apocalypse, but Dean tells Sam that they are better off apart. Later, Dean awakens five years in the future in an abandoned city and is attacked by humans who have been infected with a demonic virus that turns humans into zombies. Zachariah (guest star Kurt Fuller) appears to Dean and explains that this is the world that exists as a result of Dean saying no to helping the angels fight Lucifer. Dean meets up with Future Dean, who tells him that the virus is the Devil's endgame for destroying mankind. Misha Collins also stars. Steve Boyum directed the episode written by Ben Edlund."A new episode of Supernatural, "Good God, Ya'll," airs tonight on the CW at 9 p.m.
