Ne-Yo -- Come Closer ... To My $500k Mansion/nR&B superstar Ne-Yo spends a lot of time writing hits for other people ... and now that's paying off, 'cause dude just dropped over $500k on a siiiiiick house in GA. The singer  / songwriter bought a sweet new 5,900 square foot pad in Milton, Georgia ... it boasts 6 bedrooms, 5 baths, a finished terrace and overlooks a golf course ... which is awesome if you like golf. Ne-Yo bought the house for a cool $550,000 ... but from the pics we're hoping he'll spend a few more song-writing bucks re-decorating. Just sayin'. Ne-Yo's mansion just got a little more awesome -- 'cause his peeps tell us he actually bought it as a gift for his mother! A $550k trinket ... well played, son./n
