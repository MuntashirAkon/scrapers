The Mean Girls star picked up a Muubaa Freya jacket in blush leather, a Style Stalker destroyed knit top in black, a Thayer work shirt in cheetah for $198, a Senso Diffusion Wilma black pony shoes for $200 and a $495 Cleobella Nevaeh handbag.
Lindsay is due back in court on April 22 for the preliminary hearing on the felony grand theft case against her.  She turned down a plea deal that would have negated a trial but would have involved jail time on the allegation that she stole a $2500 necklace from Kamofie & Co.

Just this week she was let off the hook when Riverside County, CA officials dropped a pending battery case against her involving Dawn Holland, a Betty Ford Center worker, stating there was insufficient evidence to press charges.
Lindsay flew to New York on Tuesday and chose to check in to a New York hotel rather than stay at her family home in Long Island.
