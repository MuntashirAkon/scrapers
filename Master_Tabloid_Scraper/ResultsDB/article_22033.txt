Vampire Weekend: They Don’t Suck/n
Los Angelenos came out in throngs to the Henry Fonda Theater to celebrate the release of Vampire Weekend’s second album, Contra, this week. Stars like Kate Bosworth, Joe Jonas, and Danny Masterson were just a few in attendance at the sold-out show.
The long-awaited new album follows up the Columbia University graduates’ critically acclaimed self-titled debut and finds the four-piece building on its ever-innovative musical wizardry.
Bedecked in their signature preppy oxford shirts, the guys delivered one crowd-pleaser after another, getting the audience going with their unique brand of feel-good cerebral pop-rock. The crowd was filled with all walks of life, from guys in Nantucket Reds to bespectacled indie rockers, who all came together, dancing and singing along with lines like, “dress yourself in bleeding madras” without a trace of irony.

The set featured all but two songs from VW’s lauded debut and every song was met with wild cheers. The new songs merged seamlessly in the set, especially the catchy new single “Cousins,” which could have easily been an outtake from the first album.
Frontman Ezra Koenig may seem an unlikely rock star, playing his guitar up high and wearing preppy duds, but his talent overshadows the superficial stuff. With his literary leanings and varied musical influences, Koenig has helped usher in a new brand of substance-over-style frontmen.
“This is the traditional Vampire Weekend song for farewell,” said Koenig, before delving into the set-closer “Walcott,” where he had a room full of Californians happily singing along about East Coast summertime boredom.

The guys play three New York dates next week, before heading abroad, and then return for a full U.S. tour in March.
