Jodie Sweetin Child Custody Case: New Details/n
     
Full House actress  Jodie Sweetin was in an Orange County courthouse Monday for her ongoing custody dispute involving her 10 month old daughter, Zoie.  The judge had ordered that both Jodie and her estranged husband submit to drug tests, and both tested negative.
Wilma Presley, Sweetin’s attorney, exclusively tells RadarOnline.com that Jodie is doing very well, considering the circumstances.  Other media outlets have reported that Jodie had to have supervised visitation when she is with her daughter, and Wilma tells us this is false. 
“The parties (Jodie and Cody Herpin), share 50/50 custody. When Jodie has her daughter,  the custodial visitation must take place in her parent’s house, where Jodie lives, and where Jodie’s daughter has her own bedroom.  The court has not  appointed a visitation monitor.”   
TRANSLATION: Jodie can be alone with her child, as long as its in her parents’ home. 
Presley also tells RadarOnline.com  that Jodie’s husband has requested that Jodie take care of all the transportation from her parents home in Los Alamitos, to Corona where he lives. “There is no court order that she have anybody with her,” Wilma says. “Its eighty miles roundtrip,  three times a week when Jodie isn’t supervised with Zoie.”
“Why would the father and his attorney ask her to do all that transportation if there was any kind of threat?” Presley states. 
The next court date is February 25th.  /n
