Meet The Flintstones On Broadway/n
Marco Pennette — who writes for TV’s Ugly Betty and Samantha Who? — is currently adapting the cartoon series The Flintstones for Broadway.
The plot will revolve around issues like Wilma objecting to Fred’s outdated caveman ways, and Barney and Betty deciding to adopt after failing to conceive. Set before the Ice Age, the characters will confront “global cooling.”
The show will be directed by Gary Griffin (The Color Purple) with a score by Jeff Marx (Avenue Q) and Jake Anthony. Look for it in 2010. /n
