How adorable!
However, being the rebel that she is, the 27-year-old had to put her own twist on things!
Instead of dressing up as Pebbles Flintstone, the Bitch Better Have My Money singer created her own persona…
Introducing Thotty Pebbles!
Not to be outdone, her assistant Jennifer Rosales attended the soirée as Ratchet Wilma!
LOLZ! These girls love to get themselves into trouble!
Luckily, the Barbados-native's friend Melissa Forde was able to capture the festivities on Instagram! 
At the event, everyone sang Majesty Happy Birthday right before they cut her very cool Bedrock-inspired cake!
And of course, Riri twerked all throughout the event as hip hop blasted through the speakers!
No word if Rihanna arrived at the party in Fred Flintstone's footmobile!
