Do You Have $2 Million Lying Around?! You Could Buy Real-Life Bedrock City From The Flintstones, Now On Sale In Arizona!/n

Classic cartoon characters create a crazy and cool community!
The Flintstones has come to life, and Bedrock City — just south of the Grand Canyon in rural Arizona — is now up for purchase!
If you've got a cool $2 million, you can buy the real-life version of Fred and Wilma's hometown from Linda Speckels, who has owned it for more than 40 years!
Speckels and her late husband built the community — which became a theme park and campground — in 1972, and she's now at a point where she's ready to retire. 
Her daughter, Holly Hulen, said of the sale:

"My mother is 73 and she and my father built that business. My father passed away over 20 years ago. She's been running it herself, and she's ready to retire. She's ready to enjoy her grandkids and not worry about managing a business."
The 30-acre property includes a fake volcano — named Mt. St. Wilma — a train ride that takes visitors all over the Bedrock City community, and a massive green brontosaurus with a tail that doubles as a slide!
