Man Writes Letter Defending Fred Flintstone's Lack of Spousal Abuse & It Is PRCELESS! Read It HERE!/n

This is absolutely BRILLIANT! 
Martin Kramer is VERY passionate about Fred Flintstone.
Sally Jenkins, a writer at the Washington Post, compared Ray Rice's domestic abuse to Fred Flintstone and his wife Wilma, and that is where Martin had a preeettttyyyyy big problem! 
In fact, he wrote an INSANE and awesome letter to the editor defending Fred's honor insisting that he 'he loved and respected his wife Wilma, often referring to her as his queen.' 
The full letter says:

LOLOLOLOL! That is AH-MAZING! 
We can't believe someone feels so passionately about Fred Flintstone! 
But we're SO glad someone does or else we wouldn't have had that AH-MAZE letter!
