Jennifer Lopez Inches Away From American Idol Return!? Get The Latest Deets HERE!/n

Pinch our pecs and call us Wilma, because we must be dreaming!!
J.Lo left American Idol pretty coldly a couple seasons back, but Fox executives kept her judge's seat warm just in case she decided to return!
According to sources close to the situation, Jennifer Lopez is "very close to signing a deal with Fox to return to American Idol next season."
Holy shiitake mushrooms, that would be AH-Mazing!!!
The source continued:
"Both Fox and Jennifer are very happy about this and want it to happen very much." 
And those nasty reports about Jenny from the Block being c**k-blocked by The Voice?! Total malarky, apparently!
The source revealed:
"Jennifer never had discussions with NBC about being a judge. She was approached by NBC about performing but had to turn it down because of scheduling conflicts." 
So then why did Jennifer leave in the first place?
The source explained:
"She couldn't return last year because she had committed to a world tour. But now that the tour is over, she has more time to raise her family, do movies and pursue television projects."
Ah, now we understand!
Hooray! The Queen lives!! Probably!!!
