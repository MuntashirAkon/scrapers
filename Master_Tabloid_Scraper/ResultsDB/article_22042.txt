If oil is black goldâ€¦then what is whale puke? Booger green gold?
LOLz!
Months after a young boy stumbled across $60,000 nugget of whale upchuck, Ken Wilman is the latest prospector of whale vomit.
Well known for its use in top shelf perfumes, ambergris is long discarded by sperm whales and the large clumps of barf wash ashore.
So, when Wilman's pooch, Madge, stumbled across the smell of ambergris, the UK native picked up the piece of ambergris and wants to cash that baby in!
Wilman is currently double checking his loot to make sure it's ambergris. If it is, he could be $60,000 to $150,000 richer!
Crazy!!!!!!
