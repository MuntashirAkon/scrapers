Love the Look: Rihanna’s Beehive/n
Not too many ladies dare to wear a beehive in the 21st century and even fewer opt for the signature 1950’s style when their hair happens to be bright red. Rihanna, however, isn’t your average lady.
Like an elegant Wilma Flintstone, Rihanna rocked the crimson coiffure like she was the ‘only girl in the world’ during an appearance at the MTV Europe Music Awards in Madrid. We Love the Look of RiRi’s red-hot hair all swept up in a beehive and accented with soft makeup and diamond studs.
