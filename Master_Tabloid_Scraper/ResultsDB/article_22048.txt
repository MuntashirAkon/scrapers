Wilma Washes Out Weekend/n
      MTV's Latin American Music Video Awards have already been washed out by Wilma. So have the Beach Boys and ZZ Top.            As the latest major hurricane of the season bears down on the Gulf Coast, officials are scrambling to figure out whether or not to postpone dozens of weekend entertainment events.            Hurricane Wilma, a powerful category 4 that formed in the lower Caribbean this week, barreled into Mexico's Yucatan on Friday and is on course to slam into Florida come Monday.             Two days ago, MTV scrapped its Latin America Music Video Awards ceremony, which was originally supposed to be held Thursday night in a seaside park south of Cancun. Anxious network executives initially tried to move up the show to Wednesday, but had second thoughts and postponed it until further notice.            ZZ Top has called off two weekend concerts in Florida--Friday's show at Centennial Park in Fort Myers and their appearance at Saturday's Biketoberfest at the new Destination Daytona complex in nearby Ormond Beach. The band is attempting to reschedule the dates.            Trisha Yearwood's Friday show at the Kravis Center in West Palm Beach was also shelved due to the potentially wild weather. Promoters have yet to announce a make-up date. Saturday's concert at the venue, featuring renowned bassist and composer Stanley Clarke, banjo virtuoso BÃ©la Fleck and jazz and rock violinist Jean-Luc Ponty, has also been scuttled.            However, Neil Diamond's Friday show at BankAtlantic Center in Fort Lauderdale will go ahead as planned, a venue representative told E! Online, while Monday's teaming of Nine Inch Nails and Queens of the Stone Age is "still up in there air." But a Beach Boys show Sunday at the nearby BankAtlantic Sinatra Theatre has been pushed back to sometime in December.             D.L. Hughley, who hosts Weekends at the D.L. on Comedy Central, is slated to perform at the Palm Beach Improv Friday through Sunday. A spokeswoman for the comedy club said that cancellation is a "possibility" but it's a "judgment call made by his management." Hughley's rep was unavailable for comment late Friday. Also on the bill--comic Josh Sneed of the cable channel's Premium Blend and Blue Collar comedy tour.            "MMMbop" purveyors Hanson are monitoring Wilma, but as of now the siblings plan to keep their date at Pompano Beach's Club Cinema on Sunday night. The band's rep said that could change depending on weather conditions.            The Chicago Blues on Harrison Street Festival set for Saturday in Hollywood, Florida, and featuring Queen of the blues Koko Taylor, Ronnie Baker Brooks, Big James & the Chicago Playboys and Kenny's All-Star Jam Band, among others, has been rescheduled for Nov. 12.            Famed Broadway composer Marvin Hamlisch had been set to play Festival Miami Saturday at Gusman Concert Hall at the University of Miami, but that has been scratched for at least a week.            Jazz guitar maestro Al Dimeola's show Saturday night at the Carefree Theatre in West Palm Beach is still "a go," according to a venue spokesman. However, Wednesday's concert with singer-songwriter Aimee Mann is still a question mark.            Broadway star Betty Buckley's Saturday concert at the Maltz Jupiter Theater in Jupiter, Florida, has been nixed. It will be rescheduled for December.             On the sports side, the NFL moved up the Miami Dolphins's Sunday home game against the Kansas City Chiefs to Friday at 7 p.m. to get a jump on the storm. Saturday's games between Georgia Tech and the sixth-ranked Miami Hurricanes was reset to Nov. 19, and South Florida's Saturday rumble with 20th-ranked West Virginia in Tampa has been rescheduled for Dec. 3.            On the ice, the National Hockey League has pushed back Saturday's face-off between the Ottawa Senators and the Florida Panthers to Dec. 5.             Meanwhile, as the entertainment industry continues to hold numerous benefits for survivors of Hurricane Katrina and Rita, one of Hollywood's biggest stars is doing his part for the forgotten victims of Hurricane Stan, which pummeled Central America and Mexico leaving more than 1,500 people dead or missing.            Mel Gibson met with Mexican president Vincente Fox earlier this week and donated $1 million to help relief efforts. Gibson has been in the ravaged state of Veracruz filming his latest epic, Apocalypto.
