Elegy for Mrs. Flintstone: Wilmaaaa!/n
The slightly nasal, somewhat-cutting and forever-"Fre-ed!"-flaying voice of The Flintstones' leading lady has been silenced.                  Wilma, we heardly knew ye.                  Jean Vander Pyl--the original, and longtime actress, behind the popular toon--died last Saturday of lung cancer, her family has announced. She was 79.                  Vander Pyl was the last surviving original cast member of The Flintstones, the landmark 1960-66 prime-time series that proved animation wasn't just for Saturday morning anymore. Vander Pyl was preceded in death by: Alan Reed (Fred--deceased 1977), Mel Blanc (Barbey Rubble--1989) and Bea Benaderet (Betty Rubble--1968). (Betty was also voiced in the series by Gerry Johnson.)                   Together, the quartet formed the foundation for a prehistoric Honeymooners. Wilma, of course, was Fred's red-haired spouse. With baby Pebbles (her coos also courtesy Vander Pyl), they completed the picture of the "modern stone-age family."                  Vander Pyl continued to voice the character in the various Flintstones incarnations through the years--even doing an on-screen bit in the 1994 live-action movie.                  Her voice-over repertoire also included space-age denizens. That was Vander Pyl doing Rosie the Robot and Mrs. Spacely on The Jetsons.                  "She was an anonymous celebrity," son Michael O'Meara told the Associated Press. "You could go out with her and nobody would recognize her."                  "All she'd had to do was go 'Fre-ed!' and people would say, 'Wilma Flintstone!'"
