As Radar reported in June, Soules requested the court hearings be postponed.
“Mr. Soules respectfully requests that this Court enter an Order continuing the pretrial conference and trial by at least 90 days and extending the deadlines for discovery, notice of defenses, and pretrial motions by at least 60 days,” the papers read.
Soules’ team claimed at the time that the parties are “still actively engaged in exchanging discovery materials.” While the State has provided materials requested by Soules on May 16, several items are still forthcoming.
The former ABC star was arrested on April 24 when he rear-ended the tractor of Kenneth Mosher, 66. Mosher was thrown into a ditch and died at a nearby hospital.
