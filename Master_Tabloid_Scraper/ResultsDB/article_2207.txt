Fashion Battle: Angelica Cota Suing L'Wren Scott Over Handbag Line/n
By Radar Staff
There’s a fashion battle brewing in the courts between designers Angelica Cota and L’Wren Scott, and we’ve got the docs right here on RadarOnline.com. 
Cota, who designs the label LuLA, is filing suit against fashion designer Scott, who’s just released her Lula handbag line.  
In her suit, Cota says Scott — the Oscar dress designer who once dated Mick Jagger — is using her patented name; Scott says Lula is named after her mother. 
EXCLUSIVE DOCS: Read The Lawsuit
According to the suit, the likelihood of confusion resulting from Scott’s use of the name “will irreparably harm [her] and will undo all of Cota’s hard work in establishing her own identity under the LuLA trademark.” 
Cota sells her handbags at Nordstrom and assorted boutiques; while Scott’s line sells at Barney’s.
