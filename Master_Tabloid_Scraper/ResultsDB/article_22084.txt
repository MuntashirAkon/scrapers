Oh Hi, Chrissy Teigen's Nipple!/n

Hilarious!
On Tuesday night, John Legend brought his wife Chrissy Teigen up onstage for a Slow Dance during his concert in New York City when things got a little nipply!
The momma-of-one was grooving with her husband to the sexy tune when all of a sudden her boob popped out of her dress!

Obviously, the foodie chef took it all in stride as she grabbed her husband's mic and apologized to the crowd for the unexpected wardrobe malfunction! LOLz!
Watch it all go down (below)!!
