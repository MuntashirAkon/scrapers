Chris Soules Doesn't Want You To Call Deceased Car Crash Victim A 'Victim'!/n

Then what else do you call him??
Back in April, Chris Soules was arrested after he allegedly left the scene of a deadly car crash after his Chevy pickup rammed into a John Deere tractor trailer, sending it into a ditch. Kenneth Moser — the driver of the tractor — died as a result of his injuries.
Fast forward to now, the former Bachelor star is currently a defendant in the hit-and-run trial, and wants to control how Moser is portrayed during the proceedings.

According to legal docs, the reality TV personality and his lawyers want to remove any mention of Kenneth as a "victim," as Soules has not been charged for causing the accident. Remember, he was arraigned for fleeing the scene of a deadly car crash.
Additionally, Soules and his counsel want to eliminate any mention that he bought or drank alcohol on the day of the incident. When he was later tested, there was no trace of drugs or booze in his system.
As we reported last month, the 35-year-old plead not guilty.
We just hope justice is brought down on anyone who breaks the law!
