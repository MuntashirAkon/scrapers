On Tuesday, Johnny Depp's ex-wife took to Instagram to share a series of snaps featuring herself, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, and the Musk boys at the Sydney Opera House in Australia. In one pic (above), one of Elon's sons is seen giving the 31-year-old actress a piggyback ride.
The It-girl captioned the image: 

"Kidding around"
LOVES it! But that wasn't the only cute moment Amber shared as she also posted:


Awwww. Elon clearly enjoyed the family outing too as he shared footage (below) from their day on IG as well.

The lovebirds are obviously enjoying their time in Australia as they were also seen walking arm-in-arm and smiling on Saturday evening while out for a date night. So sweet!
We honestly love seeing Amber so happy after such a contentious divorce. The split, finalized back in January, made headlines after Heard accused the Pirates Of The Caribbean star of physically abusing her.
As for Elon, he hasn't had an easy time in the love department either; Musk's second wife, Talulah Riley, married and divorced him TWICE! Oof.
We're keeping our fingers crossed for these two. HOPEFULLY, they can last longer than most couples in Tinseltown!
