Chris Soules was formally charged with a class D felony by Buchanan County prosecutors in Iowa on Monday (May 8, 2017) following his car accident that killed a 66-year-old tractor driver.

Soules received the official charges despite his lawyers’ claim last week that stated Soules offered “reasonable assistance” to Kenneth Mosher before he died. According to Entertainment Tonight, the court ultimately decided that Soules “did drive a vehicle involved in an accident resulting in the death of any person and did not immediately stop the vehicle at the scene of the accident or as close as possible, and/or failed to return to and remain at the scene of the accident.”
Soules will return to court for his arraignment on May 23.

On April 24, the former Bachelor star rear-ended Mosher’s tractor with his pickup truck, which sent Mosher and his tractor into the east ditch of the road. Soules’ truck fell into the west ditch. Soules called 911 moments after the accident occurred and told the operator, “It’s bloody. There’s blood coming out of his mouth.”
An Iowa State Patrol official told Entertainment Tonight that Soules was picked up from the scene of the crime after the ambulance personnel showed up. He allegedly refused to come out of his home to speak with police the rest of the evening.
