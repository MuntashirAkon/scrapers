The wait is over.

While he wasn’t in the teaser, Harry Styles gets some screen time in the official trailer for Christopher Nolan’s upcoming World War II movie, Dunkirk. Released on Friday (May 5, 2017), the full preview shows the “Sign of the Times” singer in military garb as he sits by his fellow soldiers on the beach.
In another scene, things don’t look too good for the boy bander as he struggles to avoid being crushed by a ship. (Sorry, Directioners. Your dream boyfriend might — gasp! — actually die in his acting debut.)
