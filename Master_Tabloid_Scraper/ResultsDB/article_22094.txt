Chris Soules is requesting for the court to dismiss the felony charge he is facing as a result of the fatal car crash he was involved in last week in Aurora, Iowa.

In court documents obtained by Entertainment Tonight, Soules’ legal team asks the court to recognize that Soules did everything he was required to do after the car crash.
“Because probable cause does not exist to support the charge against Mr. Soules, it must be dismissed,” reads the motion that was filed on Monday (May 1, 2017). “The information provided by Mr. Soules’ during his 911 call fulfilled the requirements of the reporting statutes. Not only did Mr. Soules satisfy the letter of the law, he satisfied the spirit. He gave law enforcement on-the-spot identification and location information and reasonably provided treatment to Mr. Mosher.”

Soules rear-ended a 66-year-old man named Kenneth Mosher with his 2008 Chevrolet Silverado truck. He called 911 to report the accident and then allegedly left the scene. He was arrested and charged with Leaving the Scene of a Fatality Motor Vehicle Accident, which is a Class D Felony.
Sources close to the former Bachelor star says that he was not drunk at the time of the accident and that the truck he was driving was “one of the old work trucks they had on the land there, not his everyday truck.”
Soules and his family were absent from the funeral that was held for Mosher on Monday (May 1, 2017) at the Geilenfeld Funeral Home in Iowa. E! News reports that a dozen Patriot Guards were lined outside of the building to honor the late farmer, who was a veteran.
