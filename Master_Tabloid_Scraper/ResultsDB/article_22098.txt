The nominees for the 2017 Academy Awards were announced on Tuesday, Jan. 24, and La La Land was the unmistakable favorite among voters.

Damien Chazelle’s musical picture led the list with 14 nominations — a tie with Titanic and All About Eve — while Moonlight scored eight nominations, including one for Best Picture. Meryl Streep broke her own record for the most Academy Award nominations, earning her 20th career nomination for Florence Foster Jenkins, and while Arrival was one of the most lauded films, Amy Adams did not receive a nod for Best Actress.
The nominations were announced in a series of videos wherein actors described their experiences with Oscars, from nomination stories to advice for first-time nominees, rather than announcing them live in front of the press.
