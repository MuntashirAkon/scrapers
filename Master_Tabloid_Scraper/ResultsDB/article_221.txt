According to Fameolous, the future husband of Rev Run's daughter has been cheating on her… even though his lady love is PREGNANT!
The site says that on Tuesday they were contacted by someone who swears she is the other woman, revealing that she sent them a video she took from inside the house of the 28-year-old's main man.
Ch-ch-check out their alleged evidence (below)!

To be fair, just because this woman is in Angela's home, it doesn't necessarily mean she's doing anything more than visiting.
But hey, you've got our interest, especially since the page also claims Miz Simmons and her guy secretly tied the knot recently!
And besides, the site even shared screenshots of supposed exchanges between the same girl and the New York native's love, who is reportedly a non-celeb named Sutton Tennyson:




In March of this year (a month before he gave her the ring) he was talking about fixing his side chick who was having "Sutton withdrawals." Sutton is his name💅🐸☕ I got more but I might cause a breakup💅A photo posted by fameolous Fanpage (@fameolousent) on Jun 7, 2016 at 11:09pm PDT

But that's not all! Apparently, there's ANOTHER girl who claims she slept with the famous female's squeeze just days before he proposed:




This girl posted Angela Simmons husband's full telephone number on one of the post so I sent her a DM to let her know NOT to do that & I got this in response🐸☕😱A photo posted by fameolous Fanpage (@fameolousent) on Jun 8, 2016 at 9:45am PDT


If this is true, this is definitely SUPER sh*tty. But we aren't the only ones who think so! Twitter had a f*cking field day with the supposed scandal:

Poor Angela Simmons. Not a fan, but heartbreak is bad enough. Public heartbreak is way worse.

Angela Simmons lost her virginity, married a felon, got pregnant & then got cheated on. She's unlocking achievements like it's Call of Duty.
