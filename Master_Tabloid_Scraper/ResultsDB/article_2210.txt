Amber Heard Is Reportedly 'Making Plans' To Wed Billionaire BF Elon Musk!/n

Is Amber Heard already thinking about getting remarried??
Her father seems to think so. As we previously reported, The Danish Girl star's contentious divorce with Johnny Depp was finalized back in January. But after everything the Pirates Of The Caribbean actor allegedly put her through, Miz Heard isn't afraid of falling in love again.

In fact, as the 30-year-old's father told Grazia magazine, the industry vet is supposedly "making plans" to wed boyfriend, Elon Musk. Amber's poppa David dished to the mag: 
"Amber and Elon are both very serious about each other. She would love to get married. One of the things they want to do is settle down and have a family. They are making plans for that."
Well, well! In case you forgot, the Justice League actress was first romantically linked to the billionaire last summer as they were spotted together on NUMEROUS occasions.
We're honestly shocked to hear about these wedding rumors, especially since Elon has been married three times prior. As you may recall, the businessman was married to Justine Musk between 2000 and 2008. Two years later, Musk married actress Talulah Riley. The twosome divorced in 2012, only to get remarried in 2013. The pair eventually divorced for good in 2016.
Huh. It sounds like Mr. Musk likes saying "I do."
So, who knows, maybe we'll be seeing Amber walk down the aisle again sometime soon!
