The Wall Street Journal says this will be done through "neural lace" technology AKA the implanting of tiny electrodes into the brain that allow people to have direct computing capabilities.
Crazzzy!
Not too much information is out there about the process, but Musk tweeted on Tuesday: 

Long Neuralink piece coming out on @waitbutwhy in about a week. Difficult to dedicate the time, but existential risk is too high not to.
