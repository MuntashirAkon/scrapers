The songwriter explained:

My timeline is full of the most disgusting, sexist, misogynistic, racist shit. Really, new levels. I'm no masochist so I'll be back x

So why exactly has Lily become a target for Internet trolls? Well, after opening up about the traumatizing experience of giving birth to her stillborn son, many Twitter users decided to lash out at the industry vet. How awful.
Take a look at a small sampling of the horrific abuse Miz Allen faced over the last few days (below). 

So the NHS are to blame? Or maybe the elderly? Stop talking shit @lilyallen you attention seeking mess. https://t.co/7BK1YH1PxC

Oh man. Thankfully, a mysterious man named Dennis has since taken over the 31-year-old's Twitter account and is determined to face off against ALL of the trolls.
Now Dennis pretty much only responds to followers in GIF form, but it's still pretty epic. Don't believe us?? See the evidence for yourself (below)!

You're killing it, bud! Honestly, we feel like everyone should have a Dennis in their lives.
Still, we'll miss Lily while she's on her Twitter sabbatical. Be sure to let us know when you return, m'kay??
