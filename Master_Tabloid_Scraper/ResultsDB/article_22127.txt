Clubber: "Bad Girl" Popped Off, Broke My Face/nThe craziest, most violent and baddest  "Bad Girl's Club " member of them all is under serious fire for doing what she does best -- poppin' off and puttin' some fool on his ass! Tanisha Thomas is being sued by a guy who claims she bashed him in the face with a beer mug during an eye-bangin' smackdown at a Hollywood nightclub back in November. According to the lawsuit, filed today in L.A. County Superior Court, Kenneth Corrales claims he was just hangin' out when Thomas acted  "in a manner not conducive to normal society " and caused a  "deep laceration " to his forehead with a beer mug.The entire brawl was caught on tape by the  "Bad Girls Cub " camera crew, promoted, and featured in an episode -- in which a medic can be seen pressing a bandage against the guy's forehead. After the fight, Thomas was arrested, booked and locked up for a few days. Corrales is suing Thomas and Bunim-Murray, the company that produces the show, for an unspecified amount of cash. Calls to their reps have not yet been returned./n
