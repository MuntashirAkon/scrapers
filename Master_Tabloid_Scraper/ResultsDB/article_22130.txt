O No He Din't: Foxx Makes Oprah-Gayle Crack/nOprah Winfrey will not be amused at Jamie Foxx's recent riff on those Oprah - BFF Gayle King gay-love rumors (which the friends have studiously and repeatedly denied).At a tribute to Will Smith on Sunday, as Rush and Molloy report, Foxx told Will,  "I was talking about you the other day. I was laying in bed with Oprah, and I turn over to Gayle and I say, 'You know what?' " The  "howls " of laughter muffled the kicker line, but the damage was done.

In fact, today, she goes all Lee Greenwood and tells People that she's so  "proud to be an American " and she was  "so upset to be completely misconstrued and I never, ever would have said that. "  "That, " of course, was a comment published in a Portuguese newspaper in which she allegedly said that British people are more intelligent and civilized than Americans. But Gwynnie, who says the out-of-context remarks were taken from a press conference she gave in Spanish, says that what she was trying to point out is that Americans live to work and Europeans work to live.  "Obviously I need to go back to seventh-grade Spanish! " says Paltrow, though PerezHilton.com points out that she's given other interviews denigrating the American way by comparison to the Brit way.
