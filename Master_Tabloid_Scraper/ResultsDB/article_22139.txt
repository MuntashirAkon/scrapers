Clintons Under Fire! Protester SLAMS Bill: 'You're A Rapist!/n
Bill Clinton clashed with protesters at an Iowa rally this week, when one demonstrator called him a “rapist” to his face!
The former president has been facing increasingly tense crowds as decades-old allegations accusing him of sexual assault continue to resurface.
While Bill gave a speech in Waterloo, Iowa this week, a man holding a picture of Bill’s face shouted, “Bill is a rapist! He’s a rapist!” several times as the crowd began to boo him.

The man was soon kicked out of the rally by the Secret Service and Bill continued his speech.
“Give him a hand, give him a hand,” Bill said. “The problem is, if you only listen to one television station, and nobody ever tells you the truth, you get like that.”
Bill clearly tried to move on after the dig, saying, “That’s what’s wrong with American politics. And I don’t want you to treat them the way that they treat you.”

This is not the first time he has been interrupted while stumping for Hillary. As The Daily Mail reported, “Clinton was in Milwaukee discussing climate change when those protesters shouted: ‘Bill Clinton is a rapist!”
Clinton told the audience not to “worry about it.”
But as Juanita Broderick, Kathy Shelton, Paula Jones, and Kathleen Willey — all alleged assault victims of Clinton — join Donald Trump’s campaign, denial might not be a useful strategy for much longer.
