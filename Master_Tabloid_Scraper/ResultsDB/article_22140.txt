Bill Clinton's Rape Accuser Lives In Constant Fear/n
The alleged rape victim of Bill Clinton says she fears for her life after going public with her allegations against Slick Willy.
“I don’t feel safe anymore,” Juanita Broaddrick told World Alternative Media. The retired nursing home operator, now 73, claims that the former president met with her in a Little Rock hotel room almost 40 years and raped her, something she says left a “horrible stain” on her life.
“I have my home up for sale now because I live alone in a huge home on 23 acres. It’s just an absolutely gorgeous place,” Broaddrick said. “I’ve loved it all these years but I just don’t feel safe anymore.”

Rather than live alone, Broaddrick will be building a home on her son’s property.
“Especially if [Hillary] does become president, I’ll fear even more the retribution I might suffer,” Broaddrick said.
Broaddrick previously claimed that Hillary attempted to strong-arm her into silence. She said, if given the opportunity, she would gladly confront the former first lady at one of the debates. “Sure I would like to be at such an epic event just to look Hillary in the face,” Broaddrick said. “Remember me? I’m the one your husband raped and you threatened. I’m still here telling the truth and you are a liar,” she said.
