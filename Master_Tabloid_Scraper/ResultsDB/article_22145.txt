Donald On The Attack! Trump Blasts Bill Clinton For 'Rape' Allegations/n
Donald Trump is in full Clinton attack mode, using a new interview to rip Bill Clinton for “rape!”
The presumptive GOP nominee spoke with Sean Hannity on Wednesday to defend himself against a recent “hit” piece by the New York Times that was filled with fibs about his conduct with women.
After tearing apart the Times’s allegedly biased reporting yet again, Trump shifted the conversation to Bill, who he said has much bigger secrets to hide — and who isn’t being called out by The New York Times.

“How do you compare that against Clinton, OK, what Clinton’s done?” Trump asked Hannity.
And Hannity wondered aloud why The New York Times had not questioned Juanita Broaddrick, Paula Jones, and Kathleen Willey, just three of the women who have accused Clinton of sexual harassment.
“In one case, it’s about exposure. In another case, it’s about groping and fondling and touching against a woman’s will,” Hannity said.
“And rape!” Trump interjected.

Trump then said that the media should focus on Bill’s “big settlements” and “impeachment for lying.” He added that Bill had lost his law license amid the scandal, referring to when Bill agreed to the suspension of his Arkansas law license in 2001.
How did Hillary’s campaign respond to Trump? Nick Merrill, a campaign spokesperson, said Trump was “doing what he does best, attacking when he feels wounded and dragging the American people through the mud for his own gain. If that’s the kind of campaign he wants to run, that’s his choice.”
Merrill did not address the recent cover story from The National ENQUIRER, which exposed 36 women unlucky enough to cross paths with “Slick Willie.” /n
