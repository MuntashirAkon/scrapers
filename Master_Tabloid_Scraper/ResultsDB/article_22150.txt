After failing to find a buyer for his massive Illinois estate — listed 18 months ago for $29 million — Michael Jordan has put the place up for auction.
The 56,000 sq. ft. monster of a mansion and separate guest house sit on several acres in suburban Highland Park, right on Lake Michigan.

All the rooms are super-sized to accommodate the former NBA superstar, who lived there during his marriage to first wife, Juanita. The place is being sold fully furnished.
There’s also an indoor full-size regulation basketball court, tennis court and swimming pool.
Potential buyers for the November 22 auction have to register with a $250,000 deposit and there’s no minimum reserve on the selling price.
