Michael, 50, married his 35-year-old bride at Bethesda-by-the-Sea Episcopal Church, where Donald Trump married his third wife Melania Trump in 2005.
Like the real estate mogul, the father-of-three spared no expense. After watching him tie the knot Michael’s guests are continuing the celebrations 30 minutes away at his 37,000 square foot home in the exclusive Bears Club community.

“Three tents are being put up in his backyard, over the surface of two football fields,” a source who works for a local vendor told GossipExtra.  “I calculated a total under-roof space of about 600 feet long by 150 feet wide. I’ve never seen anything like it.”
Yvette is Michael’s second wife. He was married to Juanita Jordan for 17 years. They divorced in 2006 and have three grown children.
