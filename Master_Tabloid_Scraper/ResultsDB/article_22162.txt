Bill Clinton's Rape Accuser Is Now Officially Supporting Donald Trump — See What She Said HERE/n

A woman who publicly accused Bill Clinton of rape has resurfaced on social media to support Donald Trump.
In 1999, Juanita Broaddrick accused the former president of raping her while she worked on his bid for governor of Arkansas in 1978.
While she doesn't consider herself a member of either political party, Broaddrick admits the GOP frontrunner "says the things I like to hear."

Speaking to The Hill, the 73-year-old said how she came back into the spotlight because Hillary Clinton might become president, explaining: 

"I've been quiet for too long, and now with the possibility of [Hillary Clinton] being the Democratic nominee and possibly president, I feel the need to get involved."
And her first step of getting involved was calling out both Clintons on Twitter, posting:

I was 35 years old when Bill Clinton, Ark. Attorney General raped me and Hillary tried to silence me. I am now 73….it never goes away.

Trump has also brought up past allegations of sexual assault and marriage infidelities against Bill, and shining light on the issue is what won him Broaddrick's support.

She added:

"I'm glad someone did. Everyone has been hanging back and most of the mainstream media won't approach it but it's something that should be talked about."
The Clintons' personal attorney strongly denied Broaddrick's claims when they first surfaced during Bill's presidency.
The Clinton camp has yet to respond to Broaddrick's reemergence, but we have a feeling Trump will reach out to her in no time.
