Authorities claim Garcia had been posting on social media seeking to raise funds for her daughter's "care," despite the girl being in perfect health.
The Hidalgo County Sheriff's Office released a statement about the case, which they investigate alongside Child Protective Services, after they arrested Garcia: 

"The Hidalgo County Sheriff's Office is urging the community to verify and confirm information from fundraisers that they choose to participate in. In many cases, asking questions and utilizing good common-sense approaches can prevent someone from being the target of a fraudulent scheme. Legitimate organizations, groups, or persons who are fundraising will have ways to verify and confirm information about their events."
Garcia has been booked into the Hidalgo County Adult Detention Center on exploitation of a child, which is a felony charge.
