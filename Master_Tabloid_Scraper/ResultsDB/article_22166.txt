Congratulations are in order for Basketball Legend Michael Jordan and his wife Yvette Preito. The pair is expecting their first child!

Jordan and Preito were married last spring in Palm Beach, Florida. They announced the good news to Us Weekly earlier today, but it doesn’t appear that they’ve announced either the sex or due date for the baby.
And although the child will be the first for the couple, Jordan, who turned 50 in February, has three adult children with his ex-wife Juanita Venoy.
