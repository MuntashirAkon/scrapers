 When there’s an armageddon event erupting on screen, movie directors seem to have Rosie Huntington-Whiteley in mind.
Following her role in Michael Bay’s $195 million action flick Transformers: Dark of the Moon, the model-turned-actress, 24, is being considered for the upcoming Mad Max sequel.
Mad Max: Fury Road has yet to begin filming but, according to Australia’s The Daily Telegraph, Rosie was spotted entering Juanita Nielsen Community Centre in Woolloomooloo, Sydney, where the film is secretly holding casting calls.
Not too long after the sighting, director Goerge Miller was seen in the same building.
Did she get the part?

No word yet, but it has been confirmed that Inception star Tom Hardy will replace Mel Gibson, 56, who portrayed Mad Max Rockatansky in the 1979 classic.
 
Charlize Theron is also set to star in the sequel as well.
The original Mad Max movie was about dystopic future Australia where a vicious biker gang murder a cop’s family and make his fight with them personal.
“We keep moving that around, you know?” Hardy said coyly when asked about production of the film during the Cannes Film Festival.
“Who knows when it’ll come out? I’ve been on standby for two years, but it’s all part of it.”
Will Rosie be a good addition to this star-studded movie, or does she need a bit more experience? Perhaps her action star boyfriend Jason Statham could give her a few pointers! Let us know what you think, below.
