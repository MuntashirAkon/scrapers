‘Survivor’ Producer’s Children Deceived About Mother’s Death/n
Sometimes reality even trumps the craziness of reality television.
According to TMZ, suspected murderer and ex ‘Survivor’ producer Bruce Beresford-Redman’s mother lied to her grandchildren about their mother’s death, falsely stating that Monica Burgos Beresford-Redman died in a car accident.
 

I do not understand why Juanita [Bruce Beresford-Redman’s mother] provided so many horrible, not to mention untrue, details about their mother’s death.
   — According to Carla Burgos, Monica Burgos’ sister

 
An enraged Carla Burgos filed legal documents detailing the lie.  The children were told their mother had a car wreck, then fell on her head.  Furthermore, the grandmother went on to explain how no one knew Monica in Mexico, and that their father had only found her in a hospital after her death.
