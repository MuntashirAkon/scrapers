Serena Williams' Dad Is Dangerous & Gun-Obsessed, Wife Claims/nThe estranged wife ofÂ Serena Williams' father says she had to remove an  "arsenal of firearms including an AK-47 " from their home in fear he could harm her or their 5-year-old kid. Lakeisha Juanita Williams has filed explosive new court docs in her divorce from Richard Williams -- her husband of 7 years -- claiming he's been acting  "erratic and hostile " and she's afraid. Richard initially filed for divorce last month accusing Lakeisha of being an alcoholic and stealing money -- allegations she adamantly denies in her response, obtained by TMZ Sports. In fact, 38-year-old Lakeisha claims she's been essentially raising their child on her own because 75-year-old Richard refuses to get involved. She says school officials, teachers and doctors will corroborate her claims. Lakeisha also says he's afraid Richard will go all  "scorched Earth " on her to retaliate for airing their issues in court. She claims Richard will essentially cut her off financially. As for the guns, Lakeisha says they have been  "safeguarded " and are available at the court's request./n
