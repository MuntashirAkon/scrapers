Michael Jordan Applies for Marriage Certificate ... Going for ANOTHER Ring/nMichael Jordan's gettin' serious about settling down ... TMZ has learned the NBA icon applied for a marriage certificate in Florida this morning in preparation for his April wedding. MJ and his longtime GF Yvette Prieto were spotted at the counter at the courthouse in Palm Beach County, FL ... and a court spokesperson confirmed the couple had filled out the paperwork. Jordan and Prieto are reportedly set to get hitched on April 27. The move seems to be proof that Prieto isn't fazed by the paternity lawsuit MJ is facing in Georgia ... filed by a woman who claims the NBA legend fathered her 16-year-old son while he was still married to Juanita Vanoy. So far, Jordan's rep hasn't commented on the lawsuit./n
