Wife-Beatin' Bishop to Preach on Easter/nGeorgia Bishop Thomas W. Weeks, who gave his televangelist wife Juanita Bynum an almighty beating in an Atlanta parking lot last August, will perform Easter Sunday services tomorrow. WWJ think?!Since choking, pushing and kicking his soon-to-be ex, Weeks has apologized to Bynum and his congregation for his fist-filled rage. According the ajc.com, Weeks will be back at the pulpit preaching on Sunday. Weeks was sentenced to three years probation, 200 hours of community service and anger management classes. It's almost guaranteed no one will be caught talking during Weeks' Easter sermon.  See Also      Alleged Wife-Thumping Bishop Surrenders     Holy War! When Televangelists Attack!/n
