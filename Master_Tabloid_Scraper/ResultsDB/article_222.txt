If the voice on Hardwell's smokin' new single, Dare You, sounds familiar it's because the you've probably heard the singer if you're not familiar with his name yet.
Matthew Koma is featured on Zedd's new song, Find You, and he also sung Spectrum for him.
In addition to having a great voice,  Koma is so in-demand with the EDM world because he writes or co-writes the songs for the DJ/producers.
He's getting his Bruno Mars on!
Dare You, however, is the strongest song he's released thus far!
We LOVE it!!!
