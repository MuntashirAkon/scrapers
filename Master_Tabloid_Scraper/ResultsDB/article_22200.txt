Jennifer, who was dressed to thrill in a Prada frock and Gucci heels, was also joined by her close friend Chelsea Handler as well as her Horrible Bosses costar Jason Bateman, as she pressed her paws into the cement.
Theroux, who recently split-up with his live-in girlfriend of several years for the A-list actress, proudly sat in the front row of the ceremony, wearing a white oxford shirt, black tie and black slacks.
