The celeb — can you guys guess who it is?! — took two of her siblings (below) along with her for the ride, made up and gussied up in such a way that they didn't even warrant notice from other bus riders: 

Stumped as to who it is?!
Or did you get it right away??
Yep, thats Kylie Jenner up top, along side sisters Khloé Kardashian and Kendall Jenner!
