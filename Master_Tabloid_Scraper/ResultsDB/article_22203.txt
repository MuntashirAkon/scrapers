Britney Spears Heads To A Meeting In A Super Short & Sexy Dress! Hot Legs!/n

Business sexy!
Britney Spears headed off to a meeting in Los Angeles on Saturday in a collared and floral embroidered Topshop dress that was all prim up top but super hot on the bottom!
That's one short skirt, Brit! 
With her flipped bob and this dress, Britney looked like a proper 1950s housewife, albeit with a much shorter hemline than any real 50s woman would allow herself to wear.

Fab!
