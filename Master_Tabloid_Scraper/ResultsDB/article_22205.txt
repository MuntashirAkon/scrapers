Sandra Bullock Spotted With A Hot Mystery Man On Wednesday! Was She On A Hump Day Date?/n

Is Sandra Bullock dating?
The Miss Congeniality star was spotted leaving a restaurant in West Hollywood on Wednesday night, walking alongside a mystery man. 
Was Sandy on a date? She was looking casual but sexy in a leather jacket and slacks. Gussied up but not too glam - definitely date wear. 
But what about this guy? What do we know about him? Well, it looks like we have a gentleman; he definitely got the door for her. And he too was dressed casually, but scruffy in a strategic way. 
Maybe he was just a pal or a co-worker, but if you ask us, these two were both trying to look fantastic without looking like they put in too much effort.
We also saw him lightly touch her arm and back while walking. Could this be Gravity (an attraction between two bodies)? We'll just have to wait to find out!
