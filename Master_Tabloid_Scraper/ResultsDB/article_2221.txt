Things between Patrick Dempsey and his wife of 17 years, Jillian, never looked better as they walked the red carpet together at the world premiere of Bridget Jones’s Baby in London on Monday (Sept. 5, 2016). Accompanied by daughter Tallula, 14, and twin sons Darby and Sullivan, 9, the couple were all smiles as the posed for photos.

As previously reported, Dempsey’s wife filed for divorce in January 2015 after 15 years of marriage. However, by the end of the year, the parents-of-three seemingly reconciled and began appearing at public places together.
In 2016, Dempsey confirmed that the divorce was called off.
“You have to work at everything,” the 50-year-old, who makes his debut in the Bridget Jones franchise at the titular heroine’s new love interest, told ES Magazine in that month. “And you cannot do everything. Something has to be sacrificed.”
Aside from his family, Dempsey was also joined by co-stars Renée Zellweger, Colin Firth and Emma Thompson at the premiere. Click through the gallery below to see all the photos from the star-studded event!
