Last night, all of Hollywood got gussied up to celebrate this summer’s wildest release, The Legend of Tarzan. It Girl Margot Robbie walked the red carpet in an ornate black and pink dress in the style of a Japanese kimono. The movie’s leading man Alexander Skarsgård looked dashing in a smart blue suit.
Two-time Oscar-winner Christoph Waltz, who plays the film’s villainous Leon Rom, decided to ham it up for the cameras at the glitzy event. Attends also included Samuel L. Jackson, Jon Voight, Djimon Hounsou, and more.
