Celebs Get Gussied Up for the 2013 Britannia Awards/n
Last night, the 2013 BAFTA LA Jaguar Britannia Awards present by BBC America took place at the Beverly Hilton.  Inside the ceremony, an event preceding awards season, both Brits and Americans picked up gongs for their contribution to film.
George Clooney was honored with the Stanley Kubrick Britannia Award for Excellence in Film, and Idris Elba picked up the Humanitarian award, previously given to Don Cheadle and Colin Firth.

According to The Hollywood Reporter, British Artist of the Year recipient Benedict Cumberbatch thought the award should have gone to his colleague, Chiwetel Ejiofor.
“Chiwetel, it feels bizarre that I’m standing here getting the British Artist of the Year Award after watching your performance in 12 Years a Slave,” Cumberbatch told him from the stage.
Sacha Baron Cohen, whose received the Charlie Chaplin Britannia Award for Excellence in Comedy, pranked the audience by rolling an elderly woman off the stage.
The Britannia Awards will air tonight on BBC America at 9pm EST.
