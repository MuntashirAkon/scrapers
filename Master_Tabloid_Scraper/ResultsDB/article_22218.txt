 When Channing Tatum gets all gussied up, EMTs are on hand to catch those who pass out from the full force of his hotness. He’s bringing the heat!
Luckily Chan uses his powers for the greater good, namely, making movies! He and The Eagle crew are in the UK to debut their movie across the pond. Stepping out in London, England, the actor was looking blue — wearing a  sharp suit in the popular hue.
Dude looks hot without the suit as well, which helped his career as a stripper! In February, he told GQ he had no regrets baring (almost) all on stage:
“I’m not ashamed of it. I don’t regret one thing. I’m not a person who hides s—.”
