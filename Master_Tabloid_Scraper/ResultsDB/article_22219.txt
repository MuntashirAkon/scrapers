Alexander Skarsgard Gets A Case Of Robert Pattinson Bedhead For ‘VMan’ (PHOTOS)/n
Handsome Swede (and Coachella handful) Alexander Skarsgard appeared on the cover of VMan with a serious case of Robert Pattinson hair. Is rumpled and dirty hair now a requirement for hunky actors who suck blood on screen? We hope so.
The actor got gussied up for the magazine’s “Scandinavian Issue,” also known as the “hot blonde dudes issue,” at least in our mind.
What is it with the Scandinavians that they are genetically capable of such beauty? They’re like the Brazilians of Europe.
