The band took to Instagram to congratulate the family on their new addition, as well.
“Little Big Town just got a little bit bigger. Introducing baby Dolly. We love you angel,” read the caption next to the same photo posted by Schlapman on the band’s Instagram post.
“Dolly Grace, you don’t even know how much you are already loved,” Schlapman’s bandmate Karen Fairchild captioned her own post.

The Schlapmans recently celebrated their 10th wedding anniversary — and her Little Big Town support is no surprise, considering how close the band has grown in the 18 years since their inception.
“We’ve lived so much together that we really are family and always will be,” Schlapman told PEOPLE in 2015.
Aside from her musical talents, Schlapman is known for her kitchen skills and hosts Kimberly’s Simply Southern on the Cooking Channel. Her Oh Gussie! kitchenware line is available at Cracker Barrel.
