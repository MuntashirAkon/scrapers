Below Deck Sneak Peek: Find Out Why Kyle Is Wigging Out
/n

 
The waves aren’t all that are glittering on Wednesday’s Below Deck!
PEOPLE has an exclusive sneak peek at the Bravo show (which is airing on a special night this week due to this 2016 election) that shows deckhand Kyle Dixon getting gussied up for a glam performance for the Valor‘s latest charter guests.
After joining the yacht’s crew mid-charter, Dixon has continued to open up to his coworkers, including revealing last week that he is bisexual. And he’ll put his former go-go dancing skills to work on this new installment, with aesthetic help from chief stewardess Kate Chastain, who gave him a look he describes as “look[ing] like I’ve been bombed by a f—ing Care Bear.”

And a colorful lip sync performance is just one of the adventures on the high seas still to come: Captain Lee Rosbach and Chastain tell PEOPLE Now that viewers can expect someone to get down on one knee, as well as public nudity in weeks to come.
Teases Rosbach: “Things are always as they appear to be.”
Below Deck airs at a special time this Wednesday at 9 p.m. before returning to its regular timeslot (Tuesdays at 9 p.m. ET) on Bravo next week.
