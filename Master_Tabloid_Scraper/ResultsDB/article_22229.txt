On Friday, Perry released the emotional video on his Facebook, writing:

"The Houston estate asked if I would share this tribute that I put together for Bobbi Kristina's private funeral. On behalf of the Brown and Houston families, we would all like to thank you for your prayers and support. God bless."
The tribute starts with a quote from Bobbi Kristina and takes us through the years of her growing up, including pictures with her parents Bobby Brown and the late Whitney Houston — who's powerful song You Were Loved accompanied the photos.
