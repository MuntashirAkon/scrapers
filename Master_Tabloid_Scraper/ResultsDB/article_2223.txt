Johnny Depp’s soon-to-be ex-wife has reportedly been spending lots of time with the billionaire inventor lately.

Last week, Amber Heard and her sister kicked back with PayPal founder Elon Musk at his Miami hotel bungalow, according to a source with TMZ.
Sounds innocent enough, right? How about this: Heard and Musk also got dinner together in LA a few weeks ago and Musk has been making frequent visits to her home.
For now, the actress’s reps refuse to call they’re newfound connection “dating.” But they will admit that, although Heard has known Musk for years, they are seeing each other more than ever now.
Musk is also going through a divorce from his wife of three years, actress Talulah Riley.
