The private ceremony's procession began at Whigham Funeral Home and arrived at the cemetery around 1 p.m. EST. The funeral home was the same one the family used during Whitney's burial, as well.
Nearby roads were blocked off so the Houstons and the Browns could grieve privately.
We can't imagine what Bobby Brown must be feeling right now. No one ever wants to outlive their child. Our hearts go out to all of Bobbi Kristina's friends, family, and loved ones, as well as everyone affected during this terrible tragedy.
