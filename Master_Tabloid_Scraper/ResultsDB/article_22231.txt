Someone Sold A Photo Of Bobbi Kristina Brown's Body In A Casket/n

This is disgusting.
Bobbi Kristina was laid to rest on Saturday, and we wish we could say the ceremony was drama-free, but it wasn't. BK's aunt — and Bobby Brown's sister — Leolah Brown was kicked out of the funeral after shouting at Pat Houston.
We were hoping that was going to be the only drama surrounding the sad services, but now we're learning that someone snapped a shot of the 22-year-old's body in a casket during her wake on Friday.

The photo has also been sold to a media outlet for an outrageous price. Sources say that after an intense bidding war, the victor shelled out over $100 thousand for the sick snap.
This is just so terrible.
The aspiring singer had been comatose for six months, after being found unresponsive in her bathtub at the end of January. She was eventually taken off life support, and passed away last week.
We don't understand who would want to do this, since Bobbi Kristina was surrounded by friends, family, and loved ones during the viewing. Taking a picture of her body — let alone selling it to the highest bidder — is so wildly disrespectful that we can't believe someone close to her would ever do such a thing.
Sadly, the Brown family was concerned that something like this would happen, since someone did the same thing to BK's mom, Whitney Houston, after she died three years ago.
We're not sure who is responsible for this horrible act, but insiders are saying that the Brown and Houston families are pointing fingers at each other.
We're devastated that someone would do something so awful to Bobbi Kristina and her memory, and our hearts are with her loved ones during this tough time.
