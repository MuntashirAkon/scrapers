The Touching Details of Bobbi Kristina's Funeral Service Will Break Your Heart/n

Well… it's over.
Bobbi Kristina's funeral is now finished and despite some drama, mourners have paid their last respects to the young woman taken far too soon — including Whitney Houston, who was able to give her daughter one final, special goodbye.

According to sources, during the ceremony, members of both the Brown and Houston families spoke, as well as family friend Tyler Perry. And, Whitney's Jesus Loves Me was the final song played as the funeral came to a close.
Apparently, Bobby Brown — though not listed as a speaker for the event — also delivered a special message to Bobbi Kristina, writing in the program: 

"I also will always love you."
So sad. Obviously, despite some unfortunate antics earlier — and really, all week — by members of the families, Bobbi Kristina deserves to be thought of fondly and it sounds like her funeral was a very meaningful tribute.
Here's Whitney's Jesus Loves Me, the final song played at the funeral:
