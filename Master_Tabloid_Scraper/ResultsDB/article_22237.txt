Bobby Brown’s wife Alicia Etheredge reportedly suffered a seizure and was rushed to the hospital on Saturday evening (Aug. 1, 2015) in Atlanta, GA.
According to TMZ, Etheridge suffered the seizure at a hotel the family was staying at following Bobbi Kristina’s funeral.
She was taken to the hospital in an ambulance where Bobby stayed by her side the whole time. Etheredge’s collapse happened just hours after Bobby broke down in tears at his daughter’s reception.

After Bobbi Kristina was laid to rest, the Brown and Houston family held their own separate gatherings due to a feud between her aunts Leolah Brown and Pat Houston.
Leolah was asked to leave after an outburst while Whitney Houston’s sister was making a tribute. Outside, she ranted: “Whitney is going to haunt Pat Houston from the grave.”
