WATCH: Nick Gordon Cries, Storms Out of Interview in ‘Dr. Phil’ Promo/n
Here’s your first look at Nick Gordon on the Dr. Phil show, set to air on Wednesday.
In the 30-second promo, Bobbi Kristina Brown’s boyfriend can be seen crying in the arms of his mother, Michelle, as the famous TV doctor asks if the 25-year-old has been “drinking a lot.”
At one point, Dr. Phil tells Gordon “to go straight to rehab,” causing the latter to walk out of the interview altogether.
Gordon reportedly did just that — check into rehab — following the show, which taped earlier this month. According to TMZ, Gordon, who was under the influence of drugs and alcohol during the interview, punched two members of Dr. Phil’s staff on his way to rehab.

Over the weekend, Bobbi Kristina’s aunt, Leolah Brown, wrote an open letter to Dr. Phil and made claims that Gordon is actually being investigated for “attempted murder” of her niece.
“We have strong evidence of foul play. Until this investigation is completed by law enforcement, I would ask that you or anyone else not provide this individual a platform to spin this situation to his benefit.”
Bobbi Kristina, who just turned 22 last week, has been in a medically induced coma at an Atlanta hospital since Jan. 31, when she was found facedown and unresponsive in a bathtub.
