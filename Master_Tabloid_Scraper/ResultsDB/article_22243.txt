Bobbi Kristina Brown’s relatives are currently filming a reality show, while she’s in the hospital fighting for her life.
It’s being reported that the sisters of Bobby Brown, Bobbi Kristina’s father, are filming a reality show right now. The show will include them grieving for Bobbi Kristina. 
According to TMZ, Bobby’s lawyer says he won’t appear on the show.
But, it sounds like a lot of the show will be about Bobbi Kristina, though they haven’t filmed at the hospital. They have, however, had several conversations at home about Bobbi Kristina.
You might remember, Bobby’s sister Leolah blamed Ray J for the death of Bobbi Kristina’s mother, Whitney Houston. She claimed that he had fueled her cocaine habit. While Bobby’s other sister, Tina, claimed during an interview that she did drugs with Whitney.
Last month, Tina got into a fight with her son Shayne, and she hit him with a bottle. We’ll have to wait and see if the fight will be shown on the reality show.
