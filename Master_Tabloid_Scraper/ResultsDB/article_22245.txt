 Almost two weeks after Bobbi Kristina Brown was found facedown and unresponsive in a bathtub, her aunt Leolah Brown claims she’s doing “just fine” and even opening her eyes.
Bobby Brown’s sister sat down with Atlanta Fox 5 news and gave an interview regarding her niece’s current state and how the family has been holding up during this trying time.

“There are so many signs showing us that she will be OK,” Leolah said about Bobbi Kristina. “In spite of what people are saying over the Internet, Krissi is fine, as I sit here before you today.”
When asked if the doctors have told the family that her niece is improving, Leolah responded immediately, “Yes, ma’am.”
Though Bobbi Kristina remains on life support, the aunt says that she continues to show physical indications of improvement.

“We know that she’s opening her eyes. That’s true. She’s opening her eyes and there’s a few more things that she’s doing but Krissi is doing well right now. She is.”
However, despite the hopefulness, the incident remains a dark cloud over the whole family. “It’s been very, very painful for everybody,” Leolah explains. “Mainly Bobby, because that’s his baby.”
Bobby Brown and Whitney Houston’s daughter has remained in a medically-induced coma since Jan. 31, the day her friend Max Lomas found her facedown in the bathtub in her home in Roswell, Ga. Meanwhile, Bobbi Kristina’s boyfriend Nick Gordon is currently under investigation.
Friends and family joined the public in a candlelight vigil for Bobbi Kristina on Monday. Afterward, the Brown family released a statement asking for the false reporting surrounding her current state to stop.
