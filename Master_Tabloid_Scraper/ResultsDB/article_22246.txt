Leolah Brown Speaks Out About the Death of Her Niece: 'Nick Murdered Bobbi Kristina'/n
Bobbi Kristina Brown‘s aunt, Leolah Brown, is claiming that both her niece and Whitney Houston were murdered.  
“I believe somebody killed my niece, just like they killed her mother,” Brown tells Inside Edition in an interview airing Wednesday. “Nick murdered Bobbi Kristina. When Nick gets arrested, everything will fall like dominoes.”   
Bobbi Kristina’s boyfriend, Nick Gordon, has not been charged with her death and has denied any wrongdoing.   
Brown is also speaking out about her outburst at Bobbi Kristina’s funeral.  
“I got up when I saw Pat making her way to the podium to speak,” Brown says, referencing her tumultuous relationship with Pat Houston, the wife of Whitney’s brother Gary. “I turned and looked at Pat and I said, ‘This is wrong. You know you’re wrong for this.’ I said, ‘Whitney will haunt you from the grave.'”  
According to Brown,  Krissy was surrounded by people that cared nothing, nothing for her. They didn’t care about her, just like they didn’t care about Whitney.    
Brown is also insisting she chose to leave the service early and was not kicked out, as had been reported when she was seen leaving prematurely and escorted by security.  
“The whole set up of the funeral was wrong,” says Brown. “Krissy has a lot of nephews who were not allowed to be pallbearers. The way the program was set up, Pat was being biased. I walked out a little early because I couldn’t take it anymore.    
Tension between the Brown and Houston families has been a repeated sore spot since Bobbi Kristina’s hospitalization after she was found unresponsive in her Roswell, Georgia, home on Jan. 31. She died July 26.
