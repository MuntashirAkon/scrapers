Bobbi Kristina Brown's Aunt Leolah Brown Reacts to Being Banned from Hospice Facility/n
Leolah Brown, Bobbi Kristina Brown‘s aunt, has spoken out about being banned from the hospice facility her niece was moved to last month.   
In a lengthy Facebook post shared early Thursday morning, Leolah shot back at the ban of Brown family members – besides Bobbi Kristina’s father, Bobby Brown – from the facility following news that photos of Bobbi Kristina at the hospice were reportedly being shopped around to media outlets.  
“Please know that, that picture that was taken of my niece, Bobbi Kristina was taken when NO other Brown was around her. My brothers KNOW this and we have already determined who we are sure it WAS NOT! And believe me-IT WAS NOT A BROWN!” she wrote in her impassioned post.   
She also insinuated that people who continue to be allowed to see Bobbi Kristina may not be a good influence.   
“I knew in my heart this would happen and did MY best to try to keep certain people away and at the same time keep the peace for my niece’s and brothers sake,” she added. “But there is only so much I can do (right now)!  
She also shared her surprise that her niece was in the facility to begin with: “I am just as shocked as you are when it comes to the status of my niece, Bobbi Kristina, even being in hospice. To the best of my knowledge, she was getting better!” However, in a local radio interview, she admitted that the situation continued to be quite serious: “I am not going to bite my tongue. My niece is laying in hospice right now, dying.”
