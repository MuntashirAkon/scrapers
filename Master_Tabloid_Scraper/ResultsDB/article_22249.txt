Brown threatened to have every person who’s visited Bobbi Kristina at the hospice undergo a lie detector test, and insisted that she will figure out who’s behind the photos. However, it is unclear which family member Brown is accusing of selling the photo.  
“YOU will not do to my niece what YOU did to Whitney,” Brown wrote, referencing Bobbi Kristina’s mother, the late Whitney Houston, adding, “WHITNEY HOUSTON IS WORKING FROM THE GRAVE THRU ME! TRUST! I’m on a mission to make sure my niece gets justice by ANY means necessary!”  

Bobbi Kristina, who’s father is singer Bobby Brown, has been unconscious and unresponsive since an incident in January. Most of the Brown and Houston families have been gathered at her bedside since she was moved to hospice care two weeks ago.  
Meanwhile, Bobby is slated to appear at a special Fourth of July concert in Atlanta on Saturday.
