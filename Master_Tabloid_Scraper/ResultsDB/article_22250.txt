Bobbi Kristina Brown Was Not Brought Home to Die, Says Aunt Leolah/n
Bobby Brown‘s sister, Leolah Brown, took to Facebook on Tuesday to counter claims that her niece Bobbi Kristina Brown had been taken off life support and brought home to die.   
“Know for certain,” Leolah wrote, “Bobbi Kristina Brown is not on life support anymore   and is continuing today to improve. And we will never give up on her. Hell no! Not one Brown!”  
Leolah wrote the post in response to a radio report that she claims erroneously stated her family’s plans for Bobbi Kristina, whom she insists is recovering after being found unconscious in her bathtub on Jan. 31.

She explained that Bobby Brown had “gotten Bobbi Kristina the best care possible” and that her niece, who was moved to a rehabilitation center after being hospitalized, “is indeed continuing to improve in spite of the lies being told.”   
“We the Browns are continuing to pray to God for her recovery,” Leolah wrote.
