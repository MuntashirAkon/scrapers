Bobbi Kristina Brown's Aunt Leolah: 'We Are Allowing Her to Continue Healing'  /n
Bobbi Kristina Brown is “healing,” according to a recent Facebook post from her aunt Leolah Brown.   
“We are allowing her to just continue healing in God’s Grace and Mercy,” the sister of Bobby Brown wrote in the post reported Wednesday by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. “Please continue to be patient with us.”  
Her post continued: “We are all grateful to Almighty God for allowing us to still have Krissi with us! So with that said, let us keep our hearts and minds on Bobbi Kristina s complete healing! While continuing in our patience. We love and appreciate you all! May God bless you all for your continued prayers.”  
In May, Cissy Houston stated in an update that granddaughter was not progressing at all.    
It’s now been four months since Bobbi Kristina was hospitalized after being found unresponsive in a bathtub in her Roswell, Georgia, home on Jan. 31.  
Although Bobbi Kristina’s condition has remained unchanged since she was transported to a rehab facility in March, a Brown family source told PEOPLE in May that they’re unwilling to give up on the 22-year-old.   
“Let me tell you this now,” said the source. “Don’t believe any reports that Bobby is going to take her off life support. He’s never going to do that. I don’t think he’ll ever go there; if there’s a 2 percent chance, a 1 percent chance, a 0.1 percent chance, he will keep hope alive.”
