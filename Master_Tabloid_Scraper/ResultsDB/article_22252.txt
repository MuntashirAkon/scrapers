Bobbi Kristina Brown's Aunt Claims People 'Lust' Over Her Niece's Fortune and Want to Do Her Harm/n
Bobbi Kristina Brown‘s aunt, Leolah Brown, claimed in a Facebook post on Monday that unnamed people are out to steal the 22-year-old’s money while she remains unresponsive in a  long-term care facility in Georgia.  
Leolah wrote the post after her brother, R&B singer Bobby Brown, made headlines when he told a crowd during a concert in Texas that his daughter is “awake” and “watching” him.  
Bobbi Kristina’s aunt claimed that people may “hear from those who wish to see my niece go away forever” and said those people “lust after Bobbi Kristina’s money and seek to benefit from her tragedy.”  
She continued, “You heard her father~my brother~Bobby Brown! He stood & told the world~BOBBI KRISS IS WAKING UP! It is evidently clear that she is still with us! Correct?  
“Regardless to what these Dam liars want to say! They been throwing rocks & hiding their dam evil faces for far to long! And I am about sick & tired of them! They want to put this out into the universe hoping & wishing their dam evil ass wishes will come true! But may GOD ALMIGHTY DESTROY ALL OF THEM WHO HAVE FIRST DONE WHAT THEY DID TO MY NIECE BOBBI KRISTINA! MAY GOD ALMIGHTY DESTROY YOU WHO WISH, DESIRE AND SEEK TO SEE HER IN SUCH A CONDITION!!! MAY YOUR DAYS BE SHORT ALONG WITH ALL YOUR EVIL!”  
This isn’t the first time that Leolah has made claims about the people surrounding Bobbi Kristina.  
In March, she said in an interview with TMZ, that Pat Houston, the late Whitney Houston’s sister-in-law, had “a lot to do” with Bobbi Kristina’s condition.  
“Whether it be her actual hand, I can’t say that right now,” Leolah said at the time. “But I hold her accountable for what happened to my niece, Bobbi Kristina, because of what knowledge I have of her.”  
She also called Pat a “money-hungry beast.”  
On Monday, Bobby’s lawyer said in a statement obtained by PEOPLE that doctors have “indicated that [Bobbi Kristina] will have a long life.”  
On Monday, Cissy Houston, Bobbi Kristina’s grandmother, also issued a statement on her condition, saying that while her granddaughter is no longer in a coma she has “irreversible brain damage and remains unresponsive.”  
“Meeting with the doctors and understanding that she can live in this condition for a lifetime truly saddens me,” Cissy said.   
Bobbi Kristina was hospitalized on Jan. 31 after being discovered unconscious in the bathtub in her Roswell, Georgia, home. In February, doctors attempted to remove Bobbi Kristina from her medically induced coma, but put her back into the comatose state after she experienced violent seizures.
