As mourners paid their respects to Bobbi Kristina Brown at a private funeral, one of her aunts left mid-service in anger.Bobbi Kristina, the only child of Whitney Houston, died last Sunday after being in a coma for months. She was found unconscious in a filled bathtub in her home. Her family members, including dad Bobby Brown, his sister Leolah Brown, and Pat Houston, Whitney's sister-in-law and the co-guardian of Bobbi Kristina's estate, mourned her at a funeral on Saturday at the St. James United Methodist Church in Alpharetta, Georgia.Leolah left mid-service and walked over to a swarm of reporters gathered outside. She had left the funeral after confronting Pat and causing a disruption, E! News has learned. Pat has not commented. Leolah had in recent days begun to rant on Facebook about her."It was wonderful until Pat started speaking and I didn't like that, so I left," Leolah told reporters, as seen in a video posted by NBC affiliate 11 Alive. "I just told her that Whitney was going to haunt her from the grave.""Pat, it's not over," Leolah told reporters. "It has just begun."

Leolah returned to church after about three minutes, E! News has learned."Krissi, she'll be remembered in our hearts forever," she said before she left. "Just like Whitney will. I really loved my niece and I am so saddened that this has happened to her right after her mother."
