Amber Portwood's Deadbeat Dad Fiancé Has Two Child Support Cases Dropped/n
Controversial Teen Mom OG star Matt Baier‘s life may have just gotten a little easier.
According to Indiana court records, Amber Portwood‘s 45-year-old fiancé is off the hook in two of his five child support cases in Madison County, RadarOnline.com can exclusively reveal.
On June 23, the state of Indiana filed a motion to dismiss two ongoing support claims against Baier, who as Radar exclusively revealed, has at least nine secret children with seven different women.

A judge tossed the cases four days later.
It is possible that the unemployed Boston native settled out of court with the two plaintiffs, both mothers with a combined three children in Baier’s brood. Or the women could be planning to refile in another court. (Both are from his Massachusetts.)
The reality groom-to-be, who originally confessed to having two children on TV before suspiciously changing his answer to five, still has plenty of baby mama drama to handle.

Three of the other mothers’ cases in Madison County Circuit Court are still active, while two more women, Jeanette Reedy and Kelli Maguire Nunn, claim he owes them thousands in unpaid child support.
“I’m repulsed by him,” Reedy told Radar in an exclusive interview.
She claims Baier hasn’t seen their 7-year-old daughter since she was an infant.
