'Teen Mom' Amber Portwood Expands Family Amid Fiance's 9 Secret Children Scandal/n
Apparently for Amber Portwood‘s fiancé Matt Baier, nine children just aren’t enough!
Just two days after RadarOnline.com exclusively revealed that the mysterious Teen Mom OG star, 44, has a whopping nine kids with seven different women despite his frequent denials, Portwood announced that the couple had adopted a new kitten.
Ignoring the shocking new report, the 25-year-old mother of Leah, 6, gushed over her “little fur baby Bootsie.”

In addition to Leah and Bootsie, Portwood and Baier live with his two dogs and another kitten, Apollo, that they adopted last fall.
“We have a new addition to the family,” she announced on September 20, 2015.

While the couple loves to show off their animals on social media and their MTV reality show, they have been much less forthcoming about Baier’s human children.
Baier initially admitted to having two kids, but changed his tune after Portwood’s ex Gary Shirley claimed on camera that he had seven secret children. He then said he had five kids.

But that still leaves four unaccounted for. As Radar previously reported, five women are suing Baier in Indiana court for unpaid child support regarding seven collective kids.
Two other women, Kelli Maguire Nunn and Jeanette Reedy, also came forward to Radar claiming to have children with the shady star.
Despite the ever-increasing amount of drama, Portwood still plans to marry her man in October 2016. /n
