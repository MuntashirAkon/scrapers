“I literally knocked off work and walked around the corner and came across her,” Barr said.
“There were a few security guards standing around who asked, ‘Can you hold back with the photo?’ as they didn’t want to let the cat out of the bag after last week.”

“When the man knocked on my door to ask if they could use my house to do the photos I thought he said they were with his fiancé, not Beyoncé,” homeowner Jeanette Meadows, 80, told the Herald Sun at the time.
“I didn’t even know who she was.” /n
