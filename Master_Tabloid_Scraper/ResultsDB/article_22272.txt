VIDEO: L.A.'s Freaks & Geeks Hit A Sour Note On American Idol/n
For every Jennifer Hudson, there’s a William Hung, and on Thursday’s edition of American Idol documenting the show’s Los Angeles auditions, many of the oddballs featured vied for the title of this season’s “What were they thinking?” contestant.
Tynisha Roches, a 25-year-old Hoboken, New Jersey native, belted out a cringe-worthy rendition of Frank Sinatra’s My Way, then began singing a second song (Whitney Houston’s And I’m Telling You I’m Not Going) when judge Randy Jackson picked up and left the room. Of course, a singing Roches followed him, prompting Jackson to call for security, who hauled her out.

There was also Jeanette Manning, a 23-year-old Trenton, New Jersey native who stunk the house up with her high-pitched squeals, to which a sympathetic Jennifer Lopez told her, “You were way off on the notes.”

Also of note was Cooper Robinson, an older gentleman from Arkansas (he said he thinks he’s 59) whose nickname is “The Human Tornado.” Robinson said he didn’t want to be the American Idol, but rather “that man — the next movie star.”
