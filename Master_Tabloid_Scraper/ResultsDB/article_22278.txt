Here's How Pink Lost 50 Pounds After Giving Birth To Daughter Willow!/n

Get it, Pink!
The 36-year-old singer managed to lose 50 pounds after the birth of her daughter Willow four years ago. In order to get ready for her very aerial acrobatics-heavy tour, she enlisted the help of celebrity trainer Jeanette Jenkins.
Carey Hart's wife — who was just named UNICEF's newest ambassador — attended the organization's Snowflake Ball on Tuesday night alongside her trainer. Of Pink's transformation, Jenkins shared with People:
"We trained five times a week. We mixed it up. It was a combination of strength training, flexibility work. We did yoga and Pilates."
Whatever they're doing is definitely working!

The fitness guru has also trained the likes of Kelly Rowland and says she customized the Try singer's workout specifically for her tour choreography: 
"She has to be strong in order to do the acrobatics and the work that she does, but she also needs to be feminine," said Jenkins.
Jenkins attributes much of Pink's success to her client's open-mindedness:
"She has a thirst to want to continue to grow and be the best that she can be; that's in mind, body and spirit. Any time you have information for her that's going to improve her, she's very open-minded to receive that information, and see how she can apply it to herself, her family, her friends, everyone."
JJ is also equally impressed with the songstress as a mother and as an athlete:
"She's amazing. I love seeing strong women have female children because immediately you see their strength in their daughters. Their daughters are so much of a reflection of them."
Aww.
Lookin' fab, Pink!!!
