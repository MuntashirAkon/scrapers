Here's what Kelly had to say in a recent interview about the real secret to her staying fit after popping that baby bump: 

"Jeanette Jenkins is the secret, SoulCycle is the secret, Angela Davis… when I go in there and it's the wee hours of the morning she is a great secret, so motivational. Jeanette comes in with so much energy and this huge smile on her face and you can't help but to get excited about working out… The 80/20 rule is all the way real, eighty percent of the time you eat those foods giving you nourishment, you're eating clean, and twenty percent of the time, have guacamole, a ton of it like I do, and a margarita and maybe queso too!"

Wow, those are some phenomenal suggestions!
We're glad you're getting some guac and queso in your diet, too! Those two are a must!
