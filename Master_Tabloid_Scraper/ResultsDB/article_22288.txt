Kelly Rowland is known for her hot body (among other things), and in the workout video clip she just put out, we get to see her in full exercise mode! The Destiny’s Child singer joined with her trainer Jeanette Jenkins to show fans how she got her sexy abs, in a black and white preview that sort of reminds us of Beyonce’s “Single Ladies” music video!
“Having sexy abs isn’t just about looking good, it’s about training your core so that you have the strength and flexibility to do all the things in life that you enjoy doing – without the lower back pain,” Kelly states before the workout.

If getting to see Kelly’s abs isn’t enough to make you start exercising, she shouts out motivation throughout the workout, exclaiming, “I want you to give me one hundred percent. I know you can do it!” and “It’s time to tone, lets go!”
The five minute preview ends with Kelly congratulating those who tried following along with the workout on a job well done:
“Congratulations you guys, you made it to the end of our sexy abs workout and we are so very proud of you.”
We’re proud of you, Kelly! Getting abs like those couldn’t have been easy, and we love that you’re helping your fans stay fit too! Will you buy Kelly’s workout DVD? Be sure to watch the video and sound off in the comments below!
