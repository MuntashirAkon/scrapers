Queen Latifah Bathes Her Beauty/n
Professional spokeswoman Queen Latifah said to hell with it and exposed her full-figured, bathing-suited beauty to photographers on a Miami beach. The CoverGirl and Jenny Craig shill could have flipped out like babelies of half her size would, but instead she flashed a big smile and waded down to the surf resplendent in a pair of gold sunglasses. Guess those endorsement deals are so bright she’s gotta wear shades.
The Chicago Oscar nom took to the ocean on an inflatable raft she blew up herself and joined BFF and “personal trainer” Jeanette Jenkins (oh, just come out already, no one cares) in the waves before returning to their towels.
This is but a minor rest in the Queen’s busy career. The babe does everything—acts, raps, sings, looks really butch on a motorcyle, sells you things.
And now, come 2009, you’ll be able to nab the scent of this woman. “For me, beauty really does start on the inside. It’s like a state of mind—a state of love, if you will. So, I see fragrance as just a natural expression of this: Scent expresses a woman’s confidence and sensuality. It’s how she embraces her body, her mind and her strength.”
Quite persuasive, eh? No wonder everyone’s hiring her to push their products. You go, girl!
