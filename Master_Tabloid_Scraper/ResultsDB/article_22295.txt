Miss Tennessee Contestant Opens Up About Being a Sexual Assault Survivor Onstage at Pageant/n
When reigning Miss Nashville Jeanette Morelan was asked about the sentencing of Brock Turner – the former Stanford University swimmer found guilty of sexual assault – during last month’s Miss Tennessee pageant, Morelan decided to speak candidly about her own experience as a sexual assault survivor.  
“It was a split-second decision,” Morelan, 21, tells PEOPLE of sharing her story during the Q&A portion of the pageant. “You hear the question and you just have a moment to think. I had known how I felt about the case, and was horrified to hear about it. As a survivor I had to follow at a distance because it is so painful to read about.”  
But Morelan pushed that pain aside to go public at the pageant: “As a survivor of sexual assault, I definitely do not agree with the sentence,” she said onstage. “Perpetrators, no matter how privileged, should be punished for their crimes.”  
Looking back, she explains her decision to speak out. “I was fearful because most people know me as Miss Nashville, the student body president, the national winner of the Miss America Organization teen pageant in 2010 or other things,” she says. “But I’m a believer that your character is determined by how you handle challenges, not how you handle success.”

Morelan was assaulted two years ago by a former student at her university, and for weeks she didn’t tell anyone or take action against her attacker.  
“One of the things that really hindered me was that I had never known anyone who had gone through sexual assault,” she says. “I was in denial for months that it had even happened. You think, ‘This can’t happen to me.’ ”  
“I suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder,” she continues. “It took a huge mental toll. As much as I tried to push it away, it culminated. After a few weeks, I decided to report it to my university and go through the Title IX process.”  
Title IX is a federal civil right for students to be protected from sexual discrimination, sexual harassment or sexual violence. As a result, Morelan’s university issued a no contact order. She decided not to press charges because the assault was not violent, but she still had to learn to face the emotional fallout.

“I realized that trying to repress it wasn’t going to help, so I had to walk through it and face the fire,” she says. “I started seeing a therapist, and that has been an ongoing process.”  
As she got more comfortable sharing her story, Morelan joined the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network as a public speaker.  
“It’s an opportunity to talk about something that most people don’t ever want to mention,” she says. “I wanted anyone who had gone through that experience to know that they were not alone.”  
Still, she says, telling her story on the pageant stage was a very different – and difficult – experience.  
“It was terrifying,” says Morelan. “I stepped off the stage and immediately started crying. I was just rushed with emotion. It was hard to [talk about it] because that was a hard experience, and it’s always going to be a hard experience.”

But Morelan has no regrets about speaking out.  
“People associate pageants with perfection,” she says. “And they see a sexual assault survivor and think of that as a weak, shameful or guilt-ridden thing. I wanted to share so that people understand that it’s not something that only happens to certain people – it really can happen to anyone.”   
“Secondly, I wanted to share it because it doesn’t define me,” continues Morelan. “It’s part of my story, and it was obviously a struggle that I went through, but in the two years since it’s happened, I really found myself and understood myself like I never have before.”  
Since going public with her story, Morelan has received an outpouring of support.  
“Every day I’ve had countless people message me on Facebook, or come up to me,” she says. “I’ve had a lot of survivors come talk to me, people that I went school with in middle and elementary school, people I knew at my university, and complete strangers, all saying that that had happened to them. That part is painful, but the fact that we were able to find that connection and that shared strength is really important.”
