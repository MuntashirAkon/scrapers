Baby Sifaka Has All EYES On Her Cuteness At Duke Lemur Center!/n

Another small bodied, wide eyed cutie joins the party!
We're sure you're still stuffing your brains with lemur and tarsier cuteness, but a baby sifaka wants to join the party in your brain!
The Duke Lemur Center is taking extra care of its newest sifaka, Beatrice of Swabia, who joins mama Rodelinda, papa Marcus and sissy Bertha of Sulzbach.
And guess what?!?! They're ALL named after Roman emperors!
Sifakas are named after their distinct si-FAUK call and only 56 Coquerel's sifakas remain in captivity.
The crazy part? Duke has all of them at their facility!
Check out the cutie (above) as she says hey to the Duke staff!
