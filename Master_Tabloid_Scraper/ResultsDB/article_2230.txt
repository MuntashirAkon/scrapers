This is the winter of nursery time for Bryan Adams.The 53-year-old rocker and Alicia Grimaldi welcomed a baby girl this week, their second daughter together, Adams confirmed on his Facebook page today.Lula Rosylea was born in London and joins 22-month-old sister Mirabella Bunny in the family fold.

"My second daughter Lula Rosylea arrived at tea time this week," Adams wrote. "The name Lula comes from Gene Vincent‘s 1958 song ‘Be-Bop-A-Lula' and Rosylea is a play on the expression 'a rosie lee' which is cockney rhyming slang in London for ‘a cup of tea' and pronounced the same."She was born in London and...she's my cup of tea."If only all celebs could be this forthcoming—and that darn cute!
