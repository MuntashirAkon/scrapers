Wow!As you can see from his before-and-after pics, Terrence Jenkins' hard work with celebrity trainer Jeanette Jenkins has certainly paid off. 

The duo trained together for a little over a month, letting us in on their six-week shape-up series as the E! News host headed on his "Road to Shirtless," getting in the best shape possible for his shirtless scene on the upcoming Think Like a Man Too.In the clip above, Terrence talks about how he went from having "zero" definition in his abs when they started the process to now sporting a full blown six-pack.In addition to working out hard, Terrence said the key to his success was eating healthy, adding, "I'm a huge pasta expert, but because I haven't eaten any pasta, I've lowered my carb intake, I lowered my sugar intake and because of all that I got myself ready for the summer!"

The duo's workout regimen was no easy feat, consisting of daily total body workouts and lean meals that pushed Terrence to the limit.But, as the saying goes, "no pain, no gain."Looking good Terrence!
