Amber Rose is on a mission to lose her pregnancy weight.Three months after giving birth to her and beau Wiz Khalifa's baby boy, Sebastian, the 29-year-old model says she's working out "an hour and a half a day" to get her prebaby body back."I have a really good personal trainer," Rose told us exclusively at the 2013 Billboard Music Awards. "Her name is Jeanette Jenkins. Yeah, I work out every day."

Rose continued, "It's hard to get off baby weight. It's a different kind of weight because for nine months you stretch your stomach out and then it's hard to get that back. I'm working on it. I lost like thirty-some pounds already."As for how much baby weight she gained, she confessed, "I was 202 pounds when I had my son. But I'm tall, so it didn't look like it."Speaking of weight, Rose says three-month old Sebastian is "Fat! He's a little fat boy. He's a little munchie."Daddy Wiz says their little one "dances a lot." "I played him his voice back the other day and he heard it and he started smiling," Wiz added. "He's full of himself."So are more kids in the couple's future? Wiz dished, "I think in time, you know what I'm saying? I want to enjoy him. And then I want her to have fun not being pregnant for a little bit because that stuff is rough. And then we're definitely going to have another baby."
