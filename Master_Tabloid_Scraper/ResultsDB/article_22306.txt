Well, here's the type of weird thing you don't hear every day.Morgan Freeman and his step-granddaughter E'Dena Hines spoke up today in response to reports that they're engaged to be married.You read that correctly. So...what do the 74-year-old Oscar winner and the 29-year-old granddaughter of Freeman's first wife, Jeanette Adair Bradshaw, have to say?

"The recent reports of any pending marriage or romantic relationship of me to anyone are defamatory fabrications from the tabloid media design to sell papers," Freeman said in a statement obtained by E! News. "What is even more alarming is that these fabrications are now being [picked up] by the legitimate press as well."Added Hines:Â  "These stories about me and my grandfather are not only untrue, they are also very hurtful to me and my family."The National Enquirer latched on to the idea of a romance between them back in 2009, but at this time it's unclear which "legitimate press" outlet Freeman is referring to.The Million Dollar Baby star and Bradshaw divorced in 1979 after 12 years of marriage. He and second wife Myrna Colley-Lee split up in 2007 and finalized their divorce in September 2010.
