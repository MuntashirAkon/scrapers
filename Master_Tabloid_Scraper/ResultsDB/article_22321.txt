Chihuahua Gets $100,000 In Will Money! Woman Gives New Meaning To Pampered Pooch!/n

Muriel Siebert was an ahmayzing person who was the first woman to hold a seat on the New York Stock Exchange!
She died of cancer at age 80, and never had children or even got married. That's so sad!
But don't worry, she wasn't alone! Her beloved chihuahua Monster Girl kept her company.
What an awesome name for a little dog!
Monster is now one heck of a wealthy pup cause her mama left her $100,000 in her will!
The cutie pooch is under the care of one of Siebert's friends, and requested only that "that my dog not be left alone for long periods of time during the day."
Siebert also left $10,000 per year to the Animal Medical Center in NYC that will be paid out continually until Monster Girl passes too.
What a great woman and what a wonderful dog owner! That is one seriously pampered pooch!
Rest in peace, Muriel Siebert.
