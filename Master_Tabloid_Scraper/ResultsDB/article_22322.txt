Macy's Expects HUGE Sales From Bieber's Debut Fragrance/n

Justin Bieber is on the fast track to having the biggest celebrity fragrance launch.
The title currently belongs to Beyonce's Heat, which saw $3 million in sales in the month following its debut.  BUT Macy's thinks Bieber's Someday will knock that figure out of the park.
Executive VP of Merch, Muriel Gonzalez, predicts "This is going to be the biggest launch weâ€™ve ever had."
Only time will tell, but we have a feeling she's probably right.
