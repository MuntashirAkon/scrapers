More Toni Collette!/n

Yes! More is good!
Years ago, Toni Collette starred in a little flick called Muriel’s Wedding. She was HIGHlarious in it, so we weren't surprised to hear she decided it was time to have a second Aussie runaround with the film's director, P.J. Hogan.
Toni has just signed on for Hogan's newest flick called Mental, which is about… well, we don't know it is about, but judging by Toni's terrific work on United States of Tara, we are hoping it has something to do with multiple personalities. 
Are U looking forward for this one?
