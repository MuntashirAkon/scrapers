Muriel's Wedding Baby/n

Australian actress (and fabulous person) Toni Collette is pregnant, she confirmed on Monday.
The Academy Award-nominee and her husband, Dave Galafassi, are expecting their first child together.
Says Toni, "We're very happy. We are completely over the moon. It is strange the last three films I've done I have been pregnant. I'm just like, what is the universe trying to tell me? But I think everything happens when it's meant to."
Amen to that!
And congrats!!!!
