NEW PICS: Beyonce Hosts New Orleans-Style Masquerade Ball for Mom Tina’s 60th Birthday/n
We’ve all seen how Beyonce and Jay-Z like to party.
So when it came to her mom’s 60th birthday bash over Globes Globes weekend, she had to do it in style… Southern style, that is.
And CB! has all the inside pics.

Fresh off their Miami karaoke party crashing fun, the superstar couple invited an A-list-only crowd to celebrate Tina Knowles milestone year with an over-the-top Masquerade Ball bash in New Orleans last Saturday.
The crème de la crème of music made the guest list, including Monica, Jennifer Hudson, The Dream, Kelly Rowland, Kris Jenner and Tina’s boyfriend, actor Richard Lawson toasted the birthday girl at Creole restaurant in NOLA’s Muriel’s Jackson Square.
From Queen Bey’s sparkling pink mask, Jay’s dapper tux and cool disguise, designer duds, carriage rides, girls in champagne dresses, and a towering eight-layer gold cake, this looks like a night to remember.
