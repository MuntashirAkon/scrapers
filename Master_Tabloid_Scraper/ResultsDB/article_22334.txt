Actress Muriel Evans Dies/n
Actress Muriel Evans, who appeared in more than 40 films during the 1930s and 1940s, has died at the age of 90, a Motion Picture and Television Hospital official said yesterday. She reportedly succumbed to colon cancer on Thursday at the suburban Los Angeles hospital. She starred in the 1932 Laurel and Hardy film, “Pack Up Your Troubles,” and several Charlie Chase farces. But Evans, a Minneapolis, Minn. native, was best known for more than a dozen westerns she made, including 1935’s “The New Frontier” with John Wayne, and several Hopalong Cassidy movies. She retired from acting in the 1940s.
