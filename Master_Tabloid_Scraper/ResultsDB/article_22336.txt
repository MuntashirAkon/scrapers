While it's no secret that these actors had a blast on-screen, they also took the party off-screen—and even got into some trouble."There are some rumors online about our extracurricular activities, but I maintain that I always showed up to work on time. Without having to be yelled at by a producer," Dushku said, which led Bradford to (loosely) explain what happened in Mexico that got them in trouble with the law."I would love to set the record straight about that, if you want the truth—or maybe the truth with some omissions," he began.

"First of all, it was Rosarito, not Tijuana. It was me, Eliza, Rini Bell, and this dude Lance, one of the male cheerleaders on the Toros. I'm gonna blur the details of how and why, but needless to say, we got arrested. We had to go in front of a judge—I use that term loosely here—and explain what happened, and he let us go… They said that one of the producers, Max Wong, had to bail us out, but I don't think any of them knew what happened until well after the fact."As for off-screen hookups, all Bradford would say about that was, "Well, there was certainly a degree to which, walking around that set, I felt like a very lucky guy and got to meet a lot of very pretty girls who were interested in talking to me."
