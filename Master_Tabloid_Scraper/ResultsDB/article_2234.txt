Jennifer Lopez & Michelle Obama Take a Selfie at 2014 LULAC Convention!/n
Immediately after the luncheon, Jennifer hosted a private screening of her upcoming Nuvo TV series Los Jets. This documentary follows a high school soccer team made up of mainly Latin immigrants both on and off the field. It's set in a small southern down where the players, while facing adversity, train their way towards victory.The first lady might not have been able to stick around for this, because later in the afternoon she visited the headquarters of Global Kids, Inc, a nonprofit organization for global learning and youth development.Clearly, FLOTUS has a busy schedule, but we're glad she managed to sneak in a quick selfie with JLo!
