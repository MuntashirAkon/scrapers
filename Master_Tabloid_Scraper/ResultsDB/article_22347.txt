Tresa revealed the small gesture that gave her comfort with her father.
“I break down, laying my head on his chest, and the first sign of recognition, as he places his hand behind my head, to comfort me. He wanted to ease my pain,” she explained. “I pray that whatever happens, in the next days or weeks, that it is for the best. And if Nama, Daddoo and Uncle Terry want him home, then that is where he should be.”
She ended her sweet note with a simple: “I love you daddy.” /n
