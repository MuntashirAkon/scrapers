As Radar reported, Disick’s mom, Bonnie, died on October 28, 2013, and his dad Jeffrey died a few months later on January 3, 2014.
“When his parents died, Kris offered no support for him as a family,” notes the friend. “It was business as usual, so he didn’t get to grieve at all.”
And Disick, 32, wasn’t able to rely on loved ones who knew him well. “Kris and the family also kept him away from his friends, so they weren’t ever able to be there for him like they wanted,” says the friend.
