“The administrator for the Estate of Bonnie Bakley….[has] been paid $450,000,” Blake’s recent bankruptcy documents state.

The In Cold Blood star, 80, filed for bankruptcy in 2006, listing his biggest liabilities as the $30 million judgment and a $1,274,783 million federal tax bill.
Bakley, 44, was killed by a gunshot to the head after the couple dined at Vitello’s Restaurant in Studio City, Calif. on May 4, 2001. The next year, he was arrested and charged in connection with the murder, but was acquitted in a 2005 criminal trial.
Bakley was survived by four young children.
