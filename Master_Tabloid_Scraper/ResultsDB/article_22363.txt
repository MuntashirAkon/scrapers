The tune (which samples Madonna's Lucky Star) has QUITE the history. The awesome track was originally a contender for her 2015 album E·MO·TION as well as 2016's E·MO·TION: Side B, but it didn't make the cut.
The song was then featured for an animated film called Ballerina which was released last fall in Europe. The movie — where Jepsen voices one of the characters — was later renamed Leap! and it's scheduled to be released in the States on August 30, 2017.
Despite its crazy backstory, the song totally kicks ass and we think it's going to be a HUGE success!
