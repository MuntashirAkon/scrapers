The visuals for DJ Snake and Justin Bieber’s smash hit, “Let Me Love You,” have been released.

Directed by James Lees, the three-and-a-half minute clip features a young couple robbing various stores à la Bonnie and Clyde before retreating back to their motel room to check out their wads of stolen cash. When their attempt to double cross a mob boss is thwarted, it’s revealed that the whole scenario is a virtual reality video game played by two random strangers — a young boy and an adult man — in co-op mode.
So basically, it’s kinda like Beyoncé and Jay Z’s “’03 Bonnie and Clyde” for millennials.
