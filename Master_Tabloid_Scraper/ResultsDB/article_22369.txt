Tattoo aficionado turned beauty tycoon Kat Von D recently purchased a $6.5 million historic Victorian home in L.A., which coincidentally was the same house seen in the 2003 comedy Cheaper by the Dozen, starring Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt.
According to Trulia.com, the mansion, built in 1890, measures 12,565 square feet, with 11 bedrooms, 10 bath, a library, hidden bar room and a cozy den overlooking the pool.
The formal living room is called the “French ballroom,” and it has a large eat-in kitchen with butler’s pantry that provides enough space for the whole family. Then there’s the third floor, with more bedrooms, a stage with original footlights, and even a kitchenette.
