Warren Beatty, best known for his roles in classic films like Bonnie and Clyde, sat down for an interview with Vanity Fair, during which he stated how inspiring his transgender son Stephen has been for him.

“He’s a revolutionary, a genius, and my hero, as are all my children,” Beatty said of his eldest child.
Kathlyn Elizabeth changed his name to Stephen Ira at the age of 14 and now works as an activist for the transgender community.
During the in-depth interview, Beatty’s first in 25 years, the 79-year-old also reluctantly discussed his chance encounter with Marilyn Monroe the day before she died.
Actor Peter Lawford had invited Beatty to his Malibu home one night in 1962. There he met the iconic actress, and the two went for a stroll along the beach. “It was more soulful than romantic,” Beatty said of his time with Monroe.
The next morning, he received a phone call with the news that Monroe had passed away, making him one of the last people to see her alive.
