“I feel pretty good, wasn’t what I was expecting.”

It’s been five years since Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 hit theaters, but true fans will always think of the actors as their Potter characters. Because the stars will never get away from their Potter personas, they decided to see just how similar they are to their characters and take the Pottermore Sorting Hat Test.

Ruper Grint (Ron Weasley), Bonnie Wright (Ginny Weasley), Matthew Lewis (Neville Longbottom), and Evanna Lynch (Luna Lovegood, sat down with Vulture to take get sorted, and their results were a bit unexpected.
Unlike their Potter characters, Grint and Lewis were actually sorted into Hufflepuff, not Gryffindor. Meanwhile, Lynch was sorted into the famed Gryffindor house, unlike her character Lovegood who was a Ravenclaw. Wright proved to be the most like her character as she was sorted into her rightful place as a Gryffindor just like every Weasley before her.
