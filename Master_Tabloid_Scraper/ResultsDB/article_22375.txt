Call it Lemonade 2.0.

Jay Z and Beyoncé reportedly recorded a secret album together.
As we all know, Bey’s recent album Lemonade fueled rumors that Jay Z had cheated, and that the couple’s marriage was in trouble, for example due to the lyrical allusion “better call Becky with the good hair,” as well as the badass, angry imagery in her visual album (see below):

The pair are seemingly putting those rumors to rest with this album collaboration. According to Page Six sources, their surprise album is complete and will be dropping on Tidal very soon.
“Jay and Beyoncé were never going to do an interview to address all the questions that came up after ‘Lemonade,’ ” the source said. “It’s more their style to respond through music.”
According to the tabloid, “It is not known how long the famous couple has been working on the new album, because Beyoncé is in the midst of her Formation World Tour.”
Meanwhile, Jay Z made an appearance at the opening night of Sean “Puffy” Combs’ Bad Boy Family Reunion concert at Brooklyn’s Barclays Center on Friday (May 20).
The couple previously have collaborated on several occasions: 2002’s “ ’03 Bonnie & Clyde,” 2003’s “Crazy in Love,” Jay Z’s “Hollywood,” “Lift Off,” “Drunk in Love” and “Part II (On the Run).”
