In fact, just last week, Matthew Lewis and Tom Felton (a.k.a. Neville Longbottom and Draco Malfoy) attended the premiere of Beauty and the Beast in support of Emma Watson, who played Hermione Granger, and this reunion between Lucius Malfoy (played by Jason Isaacs), Neville and Draco even drew a response from Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling.Grint's new show, Snatch, is loosely based on the Guy Ritchie film of the same name, inspired by the true story of a heist that took place in London.

The show follows a group of young hustlers who, through a bizarre twist of fate, find themselves in the world of organized crime, faced with local villains, rogue cops and international mob bosses.Grint also serves as executive producer on the show, as well as stars as the "utterly posh" con-man Charlie Cavendish in his first starring TV role.

Ron Weasley isn't the only familiar face you can expect to see on Snatch either! Stars like Skins' Luke Pasqualino, Scream Queens' Lucien Laviscount and Gossip Girl's Ed Westwick all star in the show too. We solemnly swear they are up to no good.Snatch premieres on Crackle later this month.
