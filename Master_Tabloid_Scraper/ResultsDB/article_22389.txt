The polls are closed once again, fashionistas!Last week, adorable Harry Potter star Bonnie Wright got it so wrong when she showed up to Rimmel's anniversary party in London wearing this Roksanda Ilincic colorblock dress that's just hanging on her like a sack. Nice try going edgy, sweetie, but this is about a foot too long on you.Best dressed winner Sarah Jessica Parker also went long, but she nailed it in this body-hugging crocheted Antonio Berardi maxidress and shiny, wavy hair at the NYC premiere of I Don't Know How She Does It. Seriously, we really don't know how she manages to have such a slammin' figure, but we want it!Congrats, SJP!
