We know Harry Potter characters Ron Weasley, sister Ginny Weasley and friends Neville Longbottom and Luna Lovegood were sorted into the Hogwarts school's house of Gryffindor, but what about the actors who played them?Rupert Grint, 27, Bonnie Wright, 25, a mustache-clad and pretty hot Matthew Lewis, 26, and Evanna Lynch, 24, who is as cheerful and delightful as her onscreen counterpart, were "quizzed" by the online Sorting Hat on the Pottermore website, almost five years after the final Harry Potter movie, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows—Part 2, was released.A Youtube video shows the four answering the magical being's questions, which consist of queries such as  "White or Black?" and "Which of the following do you find more difficult to deal with—hunger, loneliness, boredom or being ignored?"And the results? Only two of the actors are indeed true Gryffindors, known for their bravery, while the other two were both sorted into the house of Hufflepuff, whose members are known for their dedication, hard work, patience and kindness.

"Ah yeah, I feel pretty good," Grint says in another YouTube video. "Wasn't what I was expecting."
