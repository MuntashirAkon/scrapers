EXCLUSIVE: When Is The Right Time To Share Your Baby Name?/n
 
It's Q&A with Perezitos' mommy extraordinaire Amy Malin!!
Perezcious mommy-to-be,Ruthie in New Jersey, wants to know when is the right time tell everyone what she plans to name her baby. Ruthie asks our mommy etiquette expert:
"Hey Amy!  I'm 6 months pregnant and can't wait for my daughter to arrive.  My husband and I picked out our daughters name and love it.  Do you think it is a good idea to tell our family and friends the name before our daughter is born?"

That's a GREAT question! 
"Hi Ruthie.  I'm so happy for you and your husband on your new addition!  
While you both are so excited to share the name you picked out for your little cutie, my advice is keep it a surprise until she makes her world premiere.  Sometimes family members and friends react in a way you wouldn't expect when you tell them the name you've picked out.  Nothing like a disapproving look, or worse yet being told that they don't like your baby's name, to stab you in the heart.  
The great part about keeping your name a secret is that when family and friends meet your little angel and they are introduced to her by the awesome name that you picked out, they will be so in love with her that if you called her small fry and dressed her in a potato sack, they would think it is the cutest thing!  It is also fun to keep everyone guessing and to enjoy the top secret name that you and your hubby picked out.
Congrats!"
TRUTH! 
Another plus of keeping the name on the DL is not disappointing your narcissistic relatives that want you to name your baby after them. (Sorry Aunt Bertha!)
