Aaryn was evicted from the  "Big Brother " house Thursday night ... and told Julie Chen she's NOT a bigot, despite mocking Asians, putting down black people and calling a gay housemate  "queer " during her stint inside the BB house. Aaryn explained,  "In Texas, we say things. Sometimes we joke and we don't mean it. "But according to Bon, Aaryn is talking out of her nicely-toned racist ass -- telling TMZ,  "This is NOT how we were raised in Texas. " "I watched 'Big Brother' this season, and was embarrassed that [Aaryn] brought such negative attention to one of the most friendly, welcoming states in the United States. "She added ...  "Aaryn's comments were an outrage, " and ...  "This type of behavior is not tolerated by anybody that I know ... and I was born and raised in Texas. "  Bon thinks what Aaryn really needs is some tough love, saying ...  "We can't ignore behavior like that or she won't learn. "Since Aaryn made it to the  "Big Brother " jury house, she's still sequestered from the outside world and doesn't know how big of a villain she's become. But it seems she's in for a rude awakening. /n
