Bono to Donate Guitar for Hunger Campaign/nBy THE ASSOCIATED PRESS    Bono will donate one of his guitars to benefit Brazil's Zero Hunger campaign, the government's official news agency said Monday.   The guitar will be auctioned off after U2's concerts this week in Sao Paulo's Morumbi soccer stadium, according to Agencia Brasil.   The Zero Hunger campaign's goal is to ensure all Brazilians have three meals a day by the end of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's presidential term Dec. 31.   The rock star-activist met with Silva at the Granja do Torto presidential resort to talk about the government's efforts to reduce hunger and develop renewable energy sources.   Lenny Kravitz donated one of his guitars to the Zero Hunger program last year, bringing in about $132,000 at auction./n
