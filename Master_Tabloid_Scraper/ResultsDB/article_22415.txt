He was 49.Brando had been in the ICU since January 11 for pneumonia. Seeley said the family had no funeral plans yet, adding,  "This is a sad and difficult time for the family. "Christian had a minor roles in a few movies, but his real life was far more compelling; he went to prison for voluntary manslaughter in the death of his half-sister's boyfriend, Dag Drollet. He also was accused by Robert Blake's defense attorneys of having a role in Bonnie Lee Bakley's murder. Bonnie had originally named Brando as the father of her child with Blake.
