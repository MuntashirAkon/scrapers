The site reports that Pepe’s attorney César Cerisola told the television program Ventaneando that Pepe was picked up on Sept. 5 and placed in a Mexico City prison.
Pepe was held on bail for several days, but was freed by Sept. 14, according to one of Pepe and Eiza’s fans on Twitter.

While Pepe’s attorney says that it could take up to 18 months to argue Pepe’s case, the fact is that Eiza won’t be by his side along the way.
After two years of dating, Eiza confirmed on Twitter in August that she had split from her businessman boyfriend.
