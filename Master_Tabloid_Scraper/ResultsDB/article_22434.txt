RadarOnline.com‘s special correspondent, Playboy Playmate Miriam Gonzalez, was on the blue carpet at VH1’s Do Something Awards Sunday, where she caught up with a slew of rising stars to get their takes on giving back to the community.
“I think raising awareness, when you have any kind of elevated platform…whether it be a host or a Twitter account, it’s good to shed light on organizations that need the assistance,” said Queer Eye for the Straight Guy star Jai Rodriguez. “Definitely helping HIV and AIDS has been an issue to me the past 15 years.”
