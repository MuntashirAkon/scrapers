“She’s so concerned about being a wife and a mom,” she said of Kendra. “She needs to let go sometimes and just have fun. Life is short, and she’s gorgeous, she has a great relationship at home.
“There’s no reason why she can’t go out and be that old Kendra.”
We also caught up with actor Richard Grieco, and asked him what advice he’d have for up-and-coming show biz heartthrobs such as Justin Bieber or One Direction.
