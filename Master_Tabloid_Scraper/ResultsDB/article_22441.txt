The Internet Is Pretty Sure Donald Trump Doesn't Know Who Frederick Douglass Is…/n

SO MANY QUESTIONS.
As we reported, Donald Trump's listening session to "honor" Black History Month on Wednesday was totally embarrassing — and we can't really think about it without cringing.
But, following the newly-elected POTUS' "little breakfast," people started wondering if Donny:
a) knows who Frederick Douglass is, and
b) if he thinks the famed abolitionist is still alive.

ICYMI, during the meeting, Drumpf referenced Douglass — who died in 1895 — as "an example of somebody who has done an amazing job and is being recognized more and more, I notice."

It didn't take long before people started to seriously question whether or not Trump genuinely knows anything about Douglass and the work he accomplished.
Ch-ch-check out the HIGHlarious, but also sad, reactions to the speech (below)!!

Ten bucks says Trump thinks Frederick Douglass and Morgan Freeman are the same person.

Gotta agree with POTUS, Frederick Douglass did an "amazing job". Here are some lessons from him the Trump regime may learn the hard way… pic.twitter.com/yz3u8Z5SLW

It appears as though Donald Trump has no idea who Frederick Douglass is. https://t.co/3dLNWvJE2q

I'm guessing Trump thinks Frederick Douglass is still alive and doesn't actually know who he was.

So, uh, either Trump thinks Frederick Douglass is alive today or he just thinks we're in the 1800s. . . . https://t.co/qvqD4tG3fT

But seriously, Trump thinks Frederick Douglass was like the first black mailman or something https://t.co/hzPeJUDKL3

Trump thinks Frederick Douglass is the new copywriter at Breitbart.

I need someone to ask Trump if Frederick Douglass is alive or dead.

FYI Donald, I believe Frederick Douglass would have been opposed to Bannon, Sessions, Miller, etc… Do NOT normalize this administration!

Frederick Douglass, cool guy. Met up with him on the road with Ben Carson. Big league. #TrumpBlackHistory

Laughing tears, but also, crying tears.
Our president has no idea what he's talking about. Wonderful./n
