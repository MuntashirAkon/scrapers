In case you didn't know, the pop songstress and the Goop creator are longtime pals, having reportedly met through the actress' ex-husband Chris Martin back in 2010!
And according to Us Weekly, the two couldn't stop partying together, saying:
"Gwyneth Paltrow was dancing with Taylor Swift and hanging out with her a lot. They seemed like good friends. Taylor was in an amazing mood and very social."
How fun!
Also in attendance were Mick Jagger, James Corden, Mary J. Blige, Haim, Dr. Dre, Chris Rock, and Cindy Crawford‚Ä¶ just to name a few: 
"Taylor was also busting moves with Mary J. [Blige] on the dance floor for awhile."
Sounds like everyone was in a great mood, especially Tay as she even dominated the photo booth ‚Äî She just had to show off her shaggier new 'do!
Ch-ch-check out some of those pics AND also see her rubbing shoulders with Mick (below)!!!
