Brother-In-Law Of Orlando Shooter REFUSES To Say If He Knew About The Attack Plot Beforehand!/n

Throughout this week, more details have surfaced about Omar Mateen's plan to open fire in Orlando's Pulse nightclub, where he killed 49 people and injured dozens on Sunday.
Initially, Omar's wife Noor Salman said she was just an innocent victim in the mass shooting plot — but new evidence is suggesting she might be more guilty than we thought.

With that in mind, people are starting to wonder just how many family members were privy to Mateen's attack plan.
According to DailyMail, Mustafa Abasin — the husband of Omar's sister Sabrina Abasin — has refused to comment about whether or not he was aware of his brother-in-law's horrific intentions.
When DM posed the question to the 43-year-old, Mustafa declined to discuss the controversial case.
The publication also says the gunman's relative denied answering any questions about the $165K home he bought from Omar for only $100.
The property deal went down only two months before the 29-year-old tragically targeted the LGBT hotspot.
On April 5, the killer signed a Quit Claim Deed to transfer ownership of his Port St. Lucie home to his sister and her husband.
Documents show that Mustafa and Sabrina only paid $100 for the property transfer, and Omar's wife and his other sister Miriam "Mary" Seddique signed as witnesses.
However, the gunman wasn't the only name on the initial deed.
Mary and his father, Seddique Mateen, were also named on the deed, and both sold their shares of the home to Sabrina and Mustafa for $100 each.
