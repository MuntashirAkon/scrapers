Nervo Brings The Drama With These See-Through Gowns At The MTV EMAs!/n


Talk about hard to miss!
Australian EDM duo Nervo proved they know how to make an entrance at the MTV EMAs in Milan on Sunday!
The beautiful sisters, Miriam and Olivia, chose to show off their unique style in see-through gowns on the red carpet.
Considering all the black outfits on the red carpet, we've got to give them credit for taking a risk!
But with that said, we're just not sure we're feeling these! The mesh skirt doesn't feel like an easy transition.
What do U think???
