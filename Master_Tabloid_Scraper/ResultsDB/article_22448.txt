Taylor Swift attended a star-studded party where she danced with Gwyneth Paltrow and took a bunch of photos.
Following her recent breakup with Tom Hiddleston, the singer resurfaced to hit up Liberty Ross’ birthday party in Malibu, Calif. on Saturday (Sept. 24, 2016). There she took posed for photos with James Corden, Mary J. Blige, and other famous stars. She even debuted a shorter ‘do.

It’s very clear that she’s not letting her split bring her down whatsoever. “Gwyneth Paltrow was dancing with Taylor Swift and hanging out with her a lot,” a source told Us Weekly. “They seemed like good friends. Taylor was in an amazing mood and very social.”

Meanwhile, singer John Newman revealed he’s no longer friends with Swift because of her “brutal” treatment towards Calvin Harris following their split.
“From her side? Yeah, it did get brutal. I’m like Calvin, happy to take a back seat. I like my music to do the talking,” he told The Sun, before adding, “I don’t agree with what’s gone on, but I shouldn’t comment further. I wouldn’t know her well enough, weirdly.”
