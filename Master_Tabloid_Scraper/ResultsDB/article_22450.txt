Let’s All Warm Up Together With a Warm Mug of Coco/n
There are snowmen, there are snowwomen, and then there are snowCocos. Of the three, the last one is my personal favorite. And speaking of my favorites, today’s winning captions are cooler than ice, and you can read them after the jump.

“cold coco and hot coco” – Hillary
“Coco loves Ice” – Miriam
“I’m so hot, I melt myself! ” – Samantha
“…And this is what I looked like when I was five years old.” – Logan
“SnowCo” – Shirlee
“Chilling with coco(a)” – Natalie
Congrats to our winners! Visit our Facebook page for a new Caption Contest each and every weekday. It’s never too late to add a caption, so do so in the comments!
