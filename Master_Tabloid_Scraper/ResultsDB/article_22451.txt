 Ah, Sochi.  Billed as a quiet little resort town in a sub-tropical climate, the Russian city is just under 1,000 miles south of Moscow, but uncomfortably close to unstable regions.

Back in October, Buzzfeed reported on the cinderblocks that comprised Olympic Village, nowhere near completion.  Journalists who arrived in Sochi before today’s Opening Ceremonies have tweeted about the conditions of their hotel rooms (complete with an image describing the water quality), and Russia’s deputy prime minister stresses that while the country will relax their “gay propaganda” rules in the name of sports, they do ask that gay people “do not touch the kids.”
