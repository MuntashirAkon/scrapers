Thinking Great Thoughts About Zac Efron/n
This photo of Zac Efron thinking got me thinking about how great I think Zac Efron is. He was great on High School Musical, and his most recent role in Surprise Drug Addict was a real star turn, don’t you think? Also, there was that movie where Nicole Kidman peed on him, which was pretty great. Anyway, that’s just what I think about Zac Efron. Speaking of thoughts I think, I think today’s winning captions are pretty great too!
