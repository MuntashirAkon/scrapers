 Hi lovies, just wanted to share a few pics from the time I spent in Dublin. The photo above was taken before I appeared on the Miriam O. Callghan show. I paired bright Maje pants with a sheer Whitney Eve top and metallic Giuseppe shoes.
I also included pics taken while I was in Kildare Village launching the Summertime Festival! The canvas tote I’m carrying is a piece I created in aid of Barretstown. I love the pattern on the front and think it could be a perfect tag along to a summer outfit!

As you can see, I did a lot of paparazzi’ing of my own so I’ll have plenty of pics to post over the next few days. Stay tuned! 
xoxo,
Whit
