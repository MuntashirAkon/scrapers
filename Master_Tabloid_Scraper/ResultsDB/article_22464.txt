Picks and Pans Review: Love, Groucho: Letters from Groucho Marx to His Daughter Miriam/n
Edited by Miriam Marx Allen
Groucho Marx (1890-1977), the man who once said he wouldn’t want to join any club that would have him as a member, turns out to have been a member in excellent standing in the fatherhood fraternity—at least on paper. In this affecting and often poignant collection of nearly 200 letters that Groucho wrote to his daughter Miriam between 1938 and 1967, he appears as a caring and concerned dad. His crisp, funny missives brim with advice, praise, lectures about money, gossip (“[Dorothy Lamour] wears a short abbreviated costume that displays the thickest set of thighs this side of the giant sequoias in upper California”), family and showbiz news (“I am beginning a picture named Copacabana, and I am sure it will be just as dreadful as the name implies”) and frequent reassurances of his love, even when Miriam sinks deep into alcoholism.
Who’d have thunk it? Groucho’s stage persona, as displayed in 14 Marx Brothers films and the You Bet Your Life quiz show, was that of a wisecracking, cigar-smoking, lecherous coot. In arts Veritas, since in real life, he was wisecracking, cigar-smoking and thrice married, each time to a younger wife.
But these letters, written mostly in the mid-’40s and early ’50s, show that Groucho was also the kind of man who, despite a hectic schedule, found time once or twice weekly to type or dictate epistles to a daughter who was away at college and later, sadly, being treated for alcoholism at the Menninger Clinic in Topeka, Kans. How heartbreaking for any parent to have to write a child, “I sincerely believe you are worth rehabilitating.”
It is Miriam’s alcoholism—she recovered in 1977, months before Groucho’s death—and her father’s wavering between support and frustration that make this moving reading and of interest to even non-Groucho fans. (Faber & Faber, $21.95)
