UPDATE! Jimmy Fallon and will.i.am (AKA Sara and mir.i.am) Release "Ew!" Music Video—Watch Now!/n
After the music video went viral, Fallon phoned in to KIIS-FM's On Air with Ryan Seacrest Tuesday and revealed how their duet came to be. "So, we had will.i.am on the show about two months ago. He's performing a song—he's amazing!—and then backstage we're talking and he goes, 'I really like that sketch that you do, Ew!, where you dress up as a 15-year-old girl and everything is like, Ew!' I said, 'You know, we're doing it with Taylor Swift this week, but next time you come back I'll write you in and we'll do one,'" he recalled. "And then he goes, 'Great, or we can do a song. I'd love to do a song about you.'"The stars exchanged e-mails, and the song quickly came to life."In three days, before me and the writers could even write any lyrics, he sent me a full-on produced song," Fallon, 40, revealed. "So then he flies to New York, I go to a recording studio, we're in the studio [and] we tweak it a little and I write some raps for myself. So this me rapping as well, which is sad."(E! and NBC are both part of the NBCUniversal family.)(Originally published on Tuesday, Oct. 7, 2014, at 4:15 a.m. PDT.)
