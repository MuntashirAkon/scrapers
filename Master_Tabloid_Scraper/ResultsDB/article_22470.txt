Ever had a sexy thought about one of the stars of TV Land's Younger? Ever tweeted that sexy thought for all the world to see? You are not alone, based on the above video. The clip, which is exclusive to E! News, shows stars Nico Tortorella (Josh) and Peter Hermann (Charles) reading adoring fan tweets out loud and totally loving it. In case you've forgotten, Josh is Liza's (Sutton Foster) ex/current much younger boyfriend, and Charles is the much more age-appropriate (but doesn't know it) boss she found herself kissing in the season two finale, and we're just as torn as she is as to which one she should choose. If you weren't already jealous of Liza's love life, you certainly will be after watching this video! 

No matter who she's going to pick, it's going to be so much fun watching Liza decide when season three of Younger picks up next week. Based on the trailer, we're in for lots of flirting, plenty of sex, and a few too many opportunities for Liza to spill her little secret. Younger also stars Hilary Duff, Debi Mazar, Miriam Shor, Molly Bernard, Dan Amboyer, and Tessa Albertson. Season 3 premieres next Wednesday, Sept. 28 at 10 p.m. on TV Land.
