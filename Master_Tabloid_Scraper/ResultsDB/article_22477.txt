Be still our Canadian teen drama-loving hearts. Today just so happens to be the one month anniversary of that epic Degrassi reunion photo shoot that we all lost our minds over, and while that was probably one of the best things that has ever happened to us, there was something missing.Or rather, someone. A ton of original cast members all gathered for a photo shoot to promote the retrospective special airing this Friday, and unfortunately, Cassie Steele was not among them.Steele played Manny Santos, who was BFFs with Miriam McDonald's Emma Nelson, and now the BFFs have reunited! Both McDonald and Steele posted pictures of the two of them hanging out on Instagram, and so many feels came rushing back. Just look at the photo above, then take a look at the photos below and be prepared to be overwhelmed by nostalgia. 

Just look at how Emma is looking at Manny here. They've clearly missed each other as much as we've missed them. 

They even got super cool matching flash tattoos! 

It Goes There: Degrassi's Most Talked About Moments airs on Friday at 8 p.m. on Teen Nick, and you can probably bet that a lot of those moments will heavily feature both Manny and Emma's exploits over the years. The two-part Teen Nick finale of Degrassi will air right after the special at 9 p.m. before the series heads to Netflix!
