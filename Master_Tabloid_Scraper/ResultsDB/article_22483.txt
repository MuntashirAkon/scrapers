OPI Nail Polish Mogul Gets $15 Mil for Mansion/nThe lady who helped make OPI king queen of the nail polish game just put a fresh coat of cash on her pockets ... by unloading her Bev Hills palace.  Miriam Schaeffer -- ex-wife to OPI founder, George Schaeffer﻿, and a former exec herself -- sold the 6 bed, 7.5 bath crib in record time. The house hit the market in June, and escrow closed this month.  Jacob Dadon from the John Aaroe Group repped Miriam ... who is walking away from a ton of luxury: private gym, extra outdoor kitchen, 2-story guesthouse and a 300-year-old French Burgundy fireplace.  The $15 mil will ease her pain./n
