Single Spice: Mel B Files For Divorce/n
Mel B is back on the market. Spice Girls star Melanie Brown has filed for divorce from her husband, Stephen Belafonte, but she hid the split for a shocking three months.
Brown, 41 and Belafonte, 41, tied the knot in June 2007 and they have a daughter, Madison Brown Belafonte, 5.
RadarOnline.com published exclusive photos of Belafonte with a mystery woman with whom he packed on the PDA in January in New York City.
While his wife was busy working in her role as Roxie Hart in Chicago on Broadway, Belafonte and the woman were getting cozy in a Meatpacking district restaurant.
According to an eyewitness at STK Restaurant, Belafonte was with a group of three male friends and “spent over an hour talking to the petite brunette beauty. At one point, they were nuzzling cheek to cheek.”
Brown listed their separation date as December 28, 2016, but had been posting photos of them together on her Instagram account in recent weeks.
On February 6, 2017 she wrote “My baby boo @stephenthinks11 we have been through everything that would normally tear couples apart and we have come out on the other side stronger,you loved me before I even new how to really love myself,you are my world honey and let’s not forget you are abit of a d**khead too xxxx.”
In the court documents, the America’s Got Talent judge asked for joint legal and physical custody of their daughter.
