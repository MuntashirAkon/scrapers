 Sean Penn Shut Down After Drunk Dialing Charlize Theron Post-Split — Inside His Desperate.../n
Sean Penn’s relationship with Charlize Theron may be on ice, but the actor doesn’t see why they can’t keep things sizzling in the sack.
A source tells RadarOnline.com that Penn couldn’t resist doing a little drunk dialing after he attended U2’s special May 28 concert at the Roxy Nightclub in Los Angeles.
“During the after-party, Sean was very much acting like a single man on the prowl,” the source tells Radar.
Despite his wandering eye, Penn decided to try to rekindle his connection with his former fiancée.

“Sean had been partying with the band, and he decided to call Charlize very late — it was obvious he was feeling no pain,” says the source. “He wanted to go over to Charlize’s house, but she said no way…she refused to be a booty call!”
As Radar reported, Penn, 54, and 39-year-old Theron eased up on their relationship and went their own ways following their joint film project The Last Face in South Africa.
“Everyone knows how intense Sean is, and there is no exception on movie sets. Charlize felt he was overly critical of her at times. Separating work and personal became hard, and the lines were definitely blurred,” explained an insider, who revealed Penn moved out of Theron’s house several weeks ago. /n
