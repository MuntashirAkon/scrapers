 Bobbi Kristina's Secret Drug Ring: Nick Gordon Paid Friends To Doctor Shop For Xanax &.../n
Bobbi Kristina Brown and Nick Gordon turned to many different sources to feed their drug habits, the couple’s friend told RadarOnline.com in the wake of Brown’s hospitalization.
Now, after Stephen Stepho confessed he sometimes supplied the pair with heroin, another friend has spoken out to reveal how the couple may have obtained prescription drugs.
As Radar previously reported, the couple allegedly consumed opiates beyond heroin.
“I do know the pills,” a friend of the couple told Radar. “Roxycodone—I know [Krissy and Nick] did those. I did them too. Roxies and Xanax and heroin.”

And not all of them were prescribed, the friend claims.
“A lot of things they didn’t want their name on because of a paper trail,” continued the source. “[Nick] was paying people to go to the doctors for pills.”
“He was paying his friends,” the source claimed. “I know he was getting medicine and so was she.”

As Radar reported, Gordon quit heroin cold turkey in the weeks after Brown’s hospitalization on January 31, but sources close to him say that he was consuming large quantities of alcohol and Xanax before he entered rehab earlier this month.
Meanwhile, cops are continuing their investigation into how Brown ended up in a coma at Emory University Hospital, as her family prepares to pull the plug. /n
