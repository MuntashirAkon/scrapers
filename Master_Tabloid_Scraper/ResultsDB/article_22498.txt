Cory Monteith Dead At 31: Possible Last Photo Before Death/n
Cory Monteith dined at a Vancouver restaurant and was photographed during his meal, apparently relaxed and enjoying the company of others, just over 24 hours before he died.
Monteith had dinner at Vancouver’s East of Main Café with Maureen Webb, a British Columbia-based casting agent, and Elena Kirschner, his manager, during which a photo was posted on Twitter showing him in the shadows of the venue.
“Great meal with good friends,” Kirschner wrote as the caption for the photo. The Glee star later re-tweeted the missive and used the image as his post picture on his own Twitter page.

“We are deeply saddened by the unexpected death of our good friend, Cory Monteith,” Webb, the co-founder of Project Limelight Society, a Vancouver charity close to the actor’s heart, told RadarOnline.com.
“Cory was an amazing young man with a generous heart. Our heart goes out to his family, fans and close friends. Cory was a friend and will be dearly missed.”
During the dinner, Monteith “looked so good, so healthy,” Webb added. “I hadn’t seen him look that good in a long time.”
She said no one drank alcohol at the catch-up.

There were unconfirmed reports Monteith, 31, had partied at the Roxy Nightclub and The Queen’s Republic Nightclub in the hours before his death, however, both venues would not confirm to RadarOnline.com if was there.
Cops are investigating whether drugs were at the center of the tragic and sudden death and an autopsy will take place on Monday to determine the official cause and manner of death.
He died alone in the 21st floor room of the Vancouver Fairmont Pacific Rim Hotel sometime in the early hours of Saturday morning.
