Bradley Cooper And Zoe Saldana Steam Up Sundance Film Festival/n
By Radar Staff
They’re on-screen lovers in their new pic, The Words, and have been rumored to be an off-screen couple as well, but not until Friday night at the Sundance Film Festival did Bradley Cooper and Zoe Saldana let their guard down in a public place.
After doing the red carpet — separately — in support of the film, the two rendezvoused in the Vista Room at the Montage Deer Valley, reports Red Carpet Roxy.  Sitting on the couch in front of the fireplace, a source says, “They couldn’t keep their hands off each other!”

Zoe sipped on champagne — of course — while the pair engaged in some discreet canoodling.
Saldana broke up with her boyfriend of 11 years last November. Cooper has had a series of gorgeous Hollywood women on his arm, including Renée Zellweger, Cameron Diaz and Jennifer Lopez.
