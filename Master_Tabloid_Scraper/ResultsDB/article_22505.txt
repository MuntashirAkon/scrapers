Looks like Rumer Willis will be dancing again — and also singing!
It's been reported that the Dancing With The Stars champion will make her Broadway debut this fall in the smash hit Chicago!
The 26-year-old will begin a limited eight-week performance at the Ambassador Theatre from August 18 through October 11.
The starlet will rotate playing the role of fatal housewife Roxie Hart in the murderously themed musical set in the 1920s!

Rumer isn't the only member of the Willis family to head to broadway this year — Bruce Willis is also set to make his broadway debut in the stage adaptation of Stephen King's Misery!
Willis will play the role of novelist Paul Sheldon who becomes a prisoner of super fan Annie Wilkes, who will be played by Laurie Metcalf!
Misery will begin previews on October 22. We're so excited to see both Willis's take broadway by storm!
