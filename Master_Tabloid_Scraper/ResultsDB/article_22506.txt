Slender Man Creator Releases Heartfelt Statement After Child's Brutal Stabbing In Wisconsin/n

So sad. 
The creator of Slender Man, Eric Knudsen, has released a statement on his thoughts about the case where two 12-year-old girls stabbed another girl 19 times. 
The two 12-year-old girls claimed they were acting as "proxies" for Slender Man, and had hoped to join the fictional character in a mansion after their premeditated murder attempt. 
Thankfully the victim survived the ordeal, but the case and the Slender Man character have gripped the nation as people try to wrap their heads around what really happened.  
Well, Eric Knudsen, who created the character in 2009 on the website SomethingAwful.com., has since shared his thoughts on what happened in Waukesha, Wisconsin. Here's what he said this past Wednesday: 
â€œI am deeply saddened by the tragedy in Wisconsin and my heart goes out to the families of those affected by this terrible act."
His publicist has since stated that there will no further interviews given by Eric Knudsen after this statement. 
Even though we unequivocally believe that Eric Knudsen had no part in this tragic case, we can imagine it must be difficult for him to see a beloved character of his associated with such a REAL awful crime. 
Our best wishes to the victim in this case, and we hope she has a speedy, complete recovery.
