Two 12-Year-Old Girls Stab Their Friend Multiple Times In Attempt To Kill Her! You Won’t Believe The Excuse They Gave Police For Why They Wanted To!/n

What started as a slumber party turned into a bloody crime scene in the small Wisconsin town of Waukesha this weekend!
Authorities claim two preteen friends invited a third girl over for a sleepover on Friday night, with the intention of stabbing her to death — but their plan didn't happen quickly. They delayed their attack until the next day, however, during a game of hide-and-seek in a nearby park.  
That’s when the victim was reportedly stabbed 19 times by the two 12-year-olds, who then left her to die in the woods. 
The victim managed to crawl her way to the side of a road where a bicyclist found her and called the cops!  She was rushed to the hospital and is now in stable condition!
WTF?? Why would these girls do such a gruesome thing?!
According to police, they wanted to please a mythological creature they learned about online. We aren't kidding. Seriously.
One of the suspects confessed to detectives that they were trying to become "proxies" of Slender Man, a demon-like character they had read about on creepypasta.wikia.com, a website devoted to horror stories and legends.  They both planned on running away to the demon’s forest mansion after the slaying.
Instead, they’re both facing being tried as adults and looking at 60 years in prison if convicted!
Such young girls committing such an awful crime!
It’s truly tragic. We just hope the victim makes a full recovery.
