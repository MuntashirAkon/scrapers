DWTS Is Recruiting Renee Zellweger For Oscar Winners Season Next Spring!/n

The latest season of Dancing With The Stars JUST ended last week when Amber Riley and Derek Hough hoisted the coveted Mirror Ball trophy! So y'all know what that means:
It's already time to start looking ahead to next season!!
The producers of DWTS are already starting to recruit possible contestants for next Spring, and it looks like the name on everyone's lips is gonna be Roxie Renee Zellweger!
That's right! According to sources, the 44-year-old actress is on the top their wish list for next season, saying: 
"The producers are fixated on Renee, in part because she hasn’t done much dancing at all since Chicago more than ten years ago and there’s this real mystery about her and what she’s up to."
Sounds like a great idea to us! But that's not the only reason they want to bring Renee on for next season. 
Apparently producers are talking about going all out and doing a theme in which all of the contestants are Oscar winners, and they're hoping if they nab Renee, more actors will follow:
"They keep raising the amount of money they are willing to give her in the hopes that she’ll say yes, and the theory is that if they can get her to sign on, then it would attract some other really prominent Oscar winning stars — who wouldn’t normally do reality TV — to fall in step."
OMG! Can you even imagine who might show up?!?!
Jennifer Hudson doing a Dreamgirls inspired dance?? Jamie Foxx getting down to a little Ray Charles?? Reese Witherspoon shaking her thang to some Johnny Cash and June Carter??
The possibilities are ENDLESS!!
