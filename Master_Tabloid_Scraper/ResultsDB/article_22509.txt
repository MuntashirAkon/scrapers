Ashlee Simpson Gives Us The Ole Razzle Dazzle As She Leaves A Dance Studio!/n

It looks like the name on everybody's lips is gonna be Roxie Ashlee Simpson!
The multi-talented performer is just days away from getting back on stage and reprising her role as Roxie Hart in the hit musical Chicago, and she's definitely been using her time wisely!
The show is set to hit the Hollywood Bowl this weekend on the 27th and 28th, and Ashlee has been spending plenty of time prepping for the singing, dancing, and All That Jazz!
She was recently spotted leaving a dance studio in Los Angeles after getting in some last minute rehearsals, and somehow she still managed to look awesome after a long day of work with a scarf and a fedora!
It definitely looks like she's ready to hit the stage to us! Break a leg, Ashlee!!
