Talk about a tough crowd.

On a recent afternoon, Brandy went to the gym in New York City and opted for the subway for her trip home. She decided to sing on her train. Unfortunately for the new Broadway star (you can catch her playing Roxie Hart in Chicago until August), most of her fellow passengers ignored the impromptu performance of Whitney Houston’s “Home.”

Brandy, 36, took to her blog on Monday (July 13, 2015) to digest her little subway ride. According to the Grammy Award winning singer, she’s “thoroughly enjoyed” her stay in New York ever since moving to the city in the spring for Chicago.
“I’ve hung out in Central Park, Times Square, ridden the bus, and I’ve gotten accustomed to taking the subway too. I feel like a real New Yorker. I’m learning the streets and everything, y’all!”
But it looks like her recent subway ride was a harsh dose of reality.
“Can a Sistah get ONE fan?!” she asks in her post.
