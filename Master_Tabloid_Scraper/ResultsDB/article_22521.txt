Watch Jessica Simpson Perform in Her High School’s Production of ‘A Chorus Line’/n
Singular sensation?
Jessica Simpson is arguably one of music’s most bombastic singers, so it made sense that her local high school once cast her as Cassie in its production of A Chorus Line.
Well, Simpson was apparently very proud of said production — at least enough to share a clip of her singing one of the song’s most bombastic numbers, “The Music and the Mirror,” on Twitter.
For all intensive purposes, Simpson proves she’s a pretty convincing singer and dancer in the clip, especially when you compare it to some of the other productions that have come out of high schools lately, or that time her kid sister Ashlee tried to play Roxie in Chicago.
But you can judge for yourself by watching the full, bombastic number in the video, above.
