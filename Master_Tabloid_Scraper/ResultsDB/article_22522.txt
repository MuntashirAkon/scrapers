Wendy Williams Is Coming To Broadway/n
On her daytime talk show Monday, Wendy Williams announced she’ll be playing Matron “Mama” Morton for a seven-week (not seven-month, as Roxie first said) run this summer in Broadway’s Chicago.
But before you ask the question, “Can she sing?” remember that this is the same show that once cast Ashlee Simpson in London.
Besides, the more interesting part about the video announcement is seeing that people are still doing the same dance that Bebe Neuwirth and Ann Reinking did in 1996 and Catherine Zeta-Jones and Renee Zellweger tried to do in 2002.
Williams’ stint runs from June 25 through August 11.
