See Rumer Willis Dazzle on Broadway – with Bruce and Demi Watching!/n
Rumer Willis painted the town (and all that jazz!) as Roxie Hart on Monday night.   
 The Dancing with the Stars champ showcased her triple-threat talents in Chicago at the Ambassador Theatre in New York City. Rumer, 27, is making her Broadway debut in the Prohibition-era musical.

Her stepmom Emma Heming Willis also watched Rumer in action and shared a selfie with the leading lady and Bruce on Tuesday morning.   
“Beaming with pride! Still buzzing from her performance last night. You never fail to amaze us,” she captioned the Instagram.

In April, Rumer opened up to PEOPLE regarding the misconceptions about her childhood in the spotlight.   
 “Just because I was their kid, I started getting attention before my own work got recognition,” she said. “For the first time in my life I’ve gotten to a place where I’m really stoked about just taking care of myself and figuring out what I want.”
