Adopt Me! Roxie Can't See You But She Already Loves You  /n
Home. Some pets never have one to call their own. We’d like to help change that by introducing you to an extraordinary adoptable pet every week. Today, meet Roxie, a blind pup currently being cared for by Animal Friends Rescue Project of Pacific Grove, California.  
She may have a disability, but that doesn’t hold Roxie back one bit.  The 8-month-old beagle/pit bull mix came to the rescue with a damaged eye that was later removed – and she’s completely blind in the other eye. In her short life, she’s learned to “see” with her nose, ears and sense of touch. 


“Dogs can adapt extremely well to loss of vision, and are very good at mapping out their living space,” says adoption manager Linda Wilsey. “Guardians of blind dogs can help by keeping their environment constant, since objects that are out of place can be confusing. There are many resources available to support people with blind dogs, including special training classes.”  
Despite facing challenges that most dogs don’t, Roxie has a super-happy disposition – she’ll wag and wiggle when you call her name. “She’ll jump onto the nearest lap for snuggles and belly rubs, and she delights in the smells and sounds around her when going for walks,” says Wilsey. “She loves life and is ready for whatever each new day brings.”  

This sweet girl just wants to be a normal dog with a loving owner, but she needs someone who is up to the challenge of helping her navigate the ups and downs of life. “She yearns for someone special that will guide her through life and will love her unconditionally,” Wilsey adds.

Adopting a pet is an amazing experience – and a big decision! Before bringing a pet into your home, it’s important to consider your family circumstances and do your research.
