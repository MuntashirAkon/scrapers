#RichKids of Beverly Hills star Roxy Sowlaty is adorable, funny and has a great sense of style.Can you imagine spending a day shopping on Rodeo Drive with her? Or laying on the beach working on your tans and taking selfies for Instagram?There are literally a thousand reasons why we wish we could be friends with Roxy, but we'll narrow it down for you.

She wants to sparkle all the time! And makes sure she has the life-altering outfit she needs to ring in each New Year.

She buys her own shoes.  Well ok, her parents started cutting her off and shoes were the first things to go. But hey, shoes are expensive!

She calls it like it is. There's no messing around with Roxy!

She can be really deep at times.

She has the cutest puppy on earth, Lychee Lou, who lives just as fancy as Roxy.

She's gorgeous whether its in Beverly Hills, China or Hawaii. She's a total beach babe!

But, she still totally indulges on amazing sushi, and of course the once in awhile ice cream binge.

And finally, she has amazing friends!  (There's totally room for us in this picture)

Tune-in to the season premiere of #RichKids of Beverly Hills on Sunday, August 3 at 10/9c on E!
