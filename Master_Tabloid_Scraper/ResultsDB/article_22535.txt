EXCLUSIVE! #RichKids' Roxy Sowlaty Opens Up About Her Fallout With Morgan Stewart, Opportunist 'Friends' and What It's Like to Watch It Back/n
This season of #RichKids of Beverly Hills has prompted us with an endless amount of questions.Â Roxy Sowlaty talked to E! News exclusively to answer a few of them...What was it like watching the drama between you and Morgan Stewart play out on TV?"I think watching it back has made everything feel a lot more complicated and convoluted. I feel like it was really hard going through it but then hearing the way Morgan and Brendan have misconstrued the events that happen, and that they had the audacity to talk badly about somebody I love when Brendan was compensated and paid is kind of mind boggling to me. Watching it back and watching how cold Morgan was to me after all of our conversations also makes me sad. It's been really sad watching it back and dealing with it to be honest." (Roxy is of course talking about the business deal gone bad between her boyfriend and Brendan Fitzpatrick.)
