Eddie Kaye Thomas -- Alleged Knife-Wielding Tryst Chick Has Trespass History/n "American Pie " star Eddie Kaye Thomas sure knows how to pick 'em ... the woman who allegedly barricaded herself inside his home with a knife after a one-night stand has a history of SERIOUSLY wearing out her welcome.TMZ has learned ... 31-year-old Roxanna Bear was arrested twice in February ... once for public intoxication and once for trespassing.Police say Roxanna was loitering around the Regent Beverly Wilshire hotel -- where she was NOT a guest -- on Feb. 24. She refused to leave when hotel security confronted her ... so they called the cops.The other arrest came just a few days before, when police say Roxanna was stumbling drunk in the middle of Wilshire Blvd. She was allegedly combative during both arrests -- though no knives were involved.Also, we've learned the L.A. County DA just hit Roxie with 5 charges for the incident at Eddie's house ... including vandalism, exhibiting a deadly weapon and resisting arrest.As TMZ first reported, EKT picked her up the night before at Mel's Diner ... cops had to use tear gas to get her out.Aside from that, how'd you like the date, Mr. Thomas?/n
