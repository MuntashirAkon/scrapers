Sean Penn Incest Horror Exposed!/n
Bad-boy actor Sean Penn is caught up in a shocking incest scandal, RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned. The aging Oscar winner, 56, made headlines recently when he was caught canoodling with 24-year-old actress Leila George — whose mother carried on an illicit affair with her first cousin!
George’s mom is Emmy-winning Italian-Australian actress Greta Scacchi — who gave birth to her cousin Carlo Mantegazza‘s son in 1998.
Mantegazza is also George’s godfather, and Scacchi has confessed their relationship scandalized her devout Catholic family.

George’s father, Law & Order: Criminal Intent star Vincent D’Onofrio, was also furious when the cousins hooked up, while 5-year-old George was “annoyed to have a man come into our lives without her consent,” Scacchi admitted.
Scacchi and Mantegazza never married, and their incestuous relationship could create conflict for George and hot-tempered Penn, according to renowned relationship expert Dr. Gilda Carle.
“Who your parents are, who your stepparents are, who your cousins are, are usually well delineated to most children,” explained Dr. Carle.

“But all these blurred and confusing connections as she was growing up had to make her confused as to who an appropriate partner would be for herself.”
Adding to the drama, George’s 56-year-old mother is the same age as Penn!
