This 65-Year-Old Woman Is Pregnant! Oh, Did We Mention With Quadruplets!?/n

At 65, Annegret Raunigk is considered a senior citizen.
But the German is defying convention — and many medical professionals' advice — by becoming pregnant.
And get this — she's having quadruplets!
Annegret got artificially inseminated after her 9-year-old daughter Lelia — who you can see in the above file photo — requested a little brother or sister. Annegret was 55 when when she gave birth to Lelia.

If all four babies come to term, they'll join Annegret's 13 (!) other children.
Here's what she says to all the haterz: 

"I don't interfere in anyone else's life and I don't expect them to interfere in mine."
When asked if she was worried about being too old to take care of babies, she replied:

"I'm pretty fit now, so why should it be any different in five years' time?"
More power to you, momma!
Annegret is already five months along, but will likely be admitted to a hospital well before her August due date as a precaution.
She wouldn't be the oldest woman to give birth — that distinction reportedly belongs to Omkari Panwar of India, who was 70 when she had twins.
