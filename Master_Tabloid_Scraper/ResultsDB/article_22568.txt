Olivia Wilde Brings Her Itty Bitty Baby Bump To The Courage In Journalism Awards!/n

ZOMG is she showing?!?
A tiny bit!
Olivia Wilde showed up to the Courage In Journalism Awards in Beverly Hills on Tuesday wearing a floral print Cushnie Et Ochs dress that was just tight enough to display her developing fetus.
Along with her dress, the future Mrs. Jason Sudeikis sported a glistening Clelia clutch, a Stephen Webster cuff and ombre Jimmy Choo shoes â€” but her most noticeable accessory was that gorgeous pregnancy glow!
We think it's safe to say pregnancy suits her!
