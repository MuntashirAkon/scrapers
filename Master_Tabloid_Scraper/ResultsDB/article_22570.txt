Lucy Hale accidentally pulled a Janet Jackson when she suffered a bit of a wardrobe malfunction on Tuesday (Aug. 30, 2016).

While out an about in Los Angeles, the Pretty Little Liars star’s low-plunging top swung open, exposing a $63 lacy black bra from Gooseberry Intimates. While the style slip-up may have left most red-faced, the actress shrugged it off and closed up her top before going about her day. Total pro move, right?

Recently, it was confirmed that Hale’s show was ending after seven seasons. After months of speculation, the cast announced that are are only 10 episodes left until the series finale.
“It’s been such an amazing chapter of our lives and we’re so glad that you guys could share it with us,” Hale said in a Facebook video. “But you know all good things must come to an end. These last 10 episodes are pretty crazy. We’re going out with a bang.”





 
“In about two months, an era comes to an end for us. With filming coming to a close I can’t help but reflect on the last 7 years with everyone,” she later wrote on Instagram. “April 2017 will be worth the wait and very gratifying. Bittersweet emotions over here.”
The Pretty Little Liars mid-season finale airs tonight on Freeform. The show will return next year for its last few episodes.
