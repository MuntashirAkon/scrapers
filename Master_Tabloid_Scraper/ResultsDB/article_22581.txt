 The unveiling of #thebetrAyal is just one day away on ABC Family’s Pretty Little Liars midseason finale and the anticipation is killing us. Just who could be responsible for killing Maya (Bianca Lawson) and stealing Ali’s (Sasha Pieterse) body? Is it Paige (Lindsay Shaw)? Ezra (Ian Harding)? Lucas (Brendan Robinson)?
We’ll have to wait until Tuesday to find out but to tide us over until then, Shay Mitchell, who plays Emily on the hit show and Harding will be taking your questions Monday with a special one hour Ustream event that you can watch at 3 PM PT/6 PM ET on Celebuzz.
How can you get your questions asked?

Fans are asked to submit questions during the event to the official Pretty Little Liars Facebook page and on Twitter using the hashtag, #PLLChat. In addition to the chat, hosted by On the Red Carpet’s Rachel Smith, fans will also see an exclusive clip from Tuesday’s finale, “The Lady Killer.”
