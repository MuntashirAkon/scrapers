Stevie Nicks' Gypsy-Woman Style Hits High-End Ready To Wear In Fall 09!/n
Fleetwood Mac frontwoman Stevie Nicks is just as famous for her ethereal style as her iconic voice and her look is hitting stores this fall. Margi Kent, the fashion visionary behind Nicks’ look, is launching her own high-end ready to wear collection. Nicks’ one-of-a-kind look– with lots of lace, chiffon, granny boots, velvet jackets and ruffles—kicked off the bohemian chic trend when Fleetwood Mac hit the scene in the mid 1970s. That is before boho fashioned starlets like Mary-Kate Olsen and Nicole Richie were even born.
Since 1977 when Stevie first joined the musical forces of Fleetwood Mac, Margi cultivated the songstress’ unique style. Nicks’ must-have accessory remains, to this day, the oversized shawl, which she says is a “great prop.”
The stylist and designer tells RadarOnline.com that Stevie’s look is, “powerful and ethereal.” Kent’s line is very reminiscent of the looks Stevie pulls off on the red carpet and on stage! In addition to styling Stevie, Kent has worked with Meryl Streep, Demi Moore, Mariah Carey, and Kim Cattrall.
If you want star style, without hiring the stylist, Kent’s high-end ready to wear line will hit the retail market with the Fall 09 collection.
