Amazing New Team On The Amazing Race/n
     
Globe-trotting reality show The Amazing Race may have its most intriguing season yet, as it features its first deaf contestant in 14 seasons.
22 year-old recent college grad Luke Adams and his mother Margie will be one of the 11 2-person teams rushing around the world for the $1 million prize.
“I thought it would be easy because my mother and I have always communicated really well,” explained the hard-core Amazing Race fan through an interpreter. “In the airports, my mom had to do all of the work because she had to do all of the talking. It was kind of hard for me to depend on her to do all of that.”
“In the beginning, I think Luke didn’t have a whole lot of trust that I was going to communicate all of the information that I was receiving to him properly,” said his mother. “I would ask a question or for directions, and it would take five minutes to get the answer, then I’d give him a 30-second reply. He’d say, ‘No, you didn’t tell me everything.'”
This season certainly will be an amazing race. /n
