Bella Hadid Flashes Nips On Alexandre Vauthier’s Runway Before Looking Unrecognizable For Maison Margiela!/n

It's back to work for Bella Hadid!
After showing off her street style in Paris this week, the supermodel finally hit the runway on Tuesday and Wednesday for Haute Couture Fashion Week!
Of course, there was also an appearance at Vogue's Foundation Dinner Tuesday night as well, where the 20-year-old dressed in a one-shoulder Giambattista Valli frock with a dramatic train.
It's pretty perfect for making an entrance!

Plus, it flawlessly followed up the two fierce ensems she donned on Alexandre Vauthier's Fall 2017/2018 runway earlier in the day. Between opening the show in a completely sheer top and ending by narrowly avoiding a wardrobe malfunction in a metallic silver gown, Bella confidently bared her glowing skin — and more!
The very next day, the starlet was hardly recognizable walking in the Maison Margiela show!
A blonde wig paired with her deconstructed dress, gold cowboy boots, and silver facial jewelry did her in.
We can only imagine what's next for this Hadid!
While we wait, ch-ch-check out the uncensored shot of her racy Alexandre Vauthier outfit (below):
