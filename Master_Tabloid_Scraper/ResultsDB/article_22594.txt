May 2, 2017. All the news that's fit to print ‚òùüèº‚ù§Ô∏è@nytimesA post shared by KATY PERRY (@katyperry) on May 2, 2017 at 12:45pm PDT


The only problem?? The musician glossed over the fact that there were more salient stories on the cover, including America's nuclear conflict with North Korea, and how a police officer was engulfed in flames at a May Day rally in France.
Fast forward to Wednesday, people are still pissed about Katy's "insensitive" post. Commenters on Insta and Twitter wrote:

"Delusional and disgusting."

"You're absolutely losing it, @katyperry better check in with a psychiatrist üòûüò¢"

"hi um do you not notice the police officer that's on fire"

"Oh yeah, showcasing your hideous 'haute couture' gown from a renowned anti-Semite while a police officer is on fire is so woke of you isn't it? How fucking removed can you be from reality?"'

"Wow self absorbed much‚Ä¶"

"Someone is on fire? And you choose to glorify your dress? How insensitive can you be?"
This isn't a Teenage Dream, girl. This is reality!
