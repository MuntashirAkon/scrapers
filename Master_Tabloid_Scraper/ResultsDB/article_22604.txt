Happy first wedding anniversary Kim Kardashian and Kanye West!
One year ago today (May 24, 2015), Kimye said “I do” at Fort Belvedere in Florence, Italy. Ahh, memories.

Kim and mom Kris Jenner are both in celebration mode today, between sharing glamorous photos from their rehearsal dinner at Versailles (still can’t believe that one), and Kimye’s first dance as husband and wife – to a live John Legend performance, no less!

Kris revealed the video footage of their wedding dance to Legend’s live piano performance of “All of You,” and it’s simply beautiful:

It really was the wedding of the century, or a “fairytale” as Kim called it, and the bride and groom look so in love.
Yesterday, we shared some snaps Kim posted from Valentino’s castle in Paris and today, we’ve got pics of Kim and Kanye looking stunning in Margiela for their rehearsal dinner at the amazing royal chateau as they chatted with guests and danced the night away, as well as some photo booth pics they took as a couple during their wedding party (see gallery above!).
