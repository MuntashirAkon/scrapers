George Clooney and Amal Alamuddin defied the laws of natural beauty, epitomizing elegance to the infinite power at the Met Gala 2015.

Mr. and Mrs. Clooney moseyed down the red carpet hand-in-hand at the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute in New York City, causing a deficit in carbon dioxide as the crowd held their breath in wonder and amazement.
Alamuddin was an incarnate version of the Flamenco girl Emoji in a structured Maison Margiela Couture gown by John Galliano with a fire engine lip to match. Clooney flaunted his studly looks in a black Armani tuxedo with a crimson pocket square to compliment his better half.
Much like a fine wine or Bill Murray, this couple’s red carpet wow-factor will only get better with age as evidenced by their last appearance at the Golden Globes.
