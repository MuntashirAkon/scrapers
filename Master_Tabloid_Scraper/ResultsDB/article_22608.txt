 All grown up, indeed.
Miley Cyrus brought attention once again to her ample assets on Wednesday, this time parading around the streets of New York in a fiery red jumpsuit, which featured a plunging neckline.
The singer-actress nearly avoided a wardrobe malfunction, although her left breast was almost exposed — a daring risk considering the chilly temps.
Cyrus was out and about in the Big Apple for New York Fashion Week, where she attended Marchesa’s, Maison Martin Margiela’s and Rachel Zoe’s runway shows.
“Love to the fabulushhhh @RachelZoe thank you for having me today! Can’t wait to rock everything,” she tweeted.

The 20-year-old topped off her ensemble with a cropped black leather jacket.
As of late, Cyrus has been causing a storm with her revealing and racy wardrobe choices. On Sunday, the engaged star suffered a nip slip during a pre-Grammy soiree, where she donned a sheer Emilio Pucci gown.
For the latest cover of Cosmo, Cyrus showed off her busty figure in nothing but a white blazer (sans shirt and bra), complete with gold chain necklaces and matching pants.

But when it comes to rumors that she’s had her breasts enhanced, Miley’s claims it’s all natural.
“Thank you for the compliment but these babies are all mine. I wish they’d realize you don’t have to be fake to be beautiful!” she revealed in 2011.
