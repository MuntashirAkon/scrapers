 The first day of New York Fashion Week came to a stylish end at amfAR’s annual gala last night. Fashion heavyweights glammed it up for the AIDS benefit in an array of eye-catching dresses.
Continuing the red carpet’s black and white trend, the star-studded charity event was filled with monochromatic looks. Heidi Klum stood out from the pack of LBDs (long black dresses), doing a double dip in a daring backless black dress with a plunging neckline.
Also taking the plunge, Ashley Greene countered her white Giambattista Valli gown’s sexy key-hole neckline with a long, floor-length hemline, while Karlie Kloss (in Michael Kors) and Katharine McPhee opted to show some leg in short white frocks.

Brightening up the night’s neutrals were bold prints. While Chloe Sevigny and Alexa Chung jazzed up their black and white looks with patterns that popped, red carpet risk-taker, Sarah Jessica Parker dressed up her black-and-white scarf with a magenta strapless Maison Martin Margiela gown.
