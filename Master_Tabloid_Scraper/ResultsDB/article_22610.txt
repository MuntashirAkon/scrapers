You’ll Never Guess the Latest Celebrity Shoe Trend/n
The hottest shoes in Hollywood right now aren’t sky high stilletos or chunky-heeled boots. In fact, they don’t have a heel at all. The latest footwear trend celebs are getting behind are better suited for the gym than the red carpet.
We’re talking about high top sneakers, and the ’80s sneaker is making a comeback in a big way. But this time around, stars are stepping up their ankle sneakers with platform wedges, luxe details and colorblocking.
Celeb favorite, Isabel Marant kicked off the trend with her wedge high tops, which have been seen on everyone from Miranda Kerr and Naomi Watts and Beyonce to Kate Bosworth, but she’s not the only one churning out haute high tops. Michael Kors is offering a gilded version, while Marc Jacobs, Chloe, Giuseppe Zanotti and MM6 Maison Martin Margiela have each put their own spin on these retro kicks.
Even if you don’t have a Hollywood-sized budget, you can score a pair of haute high tops. More budget-friendly versions from Ash, ASOS, Sam Edelman and Adidas and Nike are making it easy to find a pair to fit your style.
