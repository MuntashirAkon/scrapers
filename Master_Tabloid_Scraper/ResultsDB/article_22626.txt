Melanie Griffith is 58 and proud of it!As many celebrities know, social media can be a cruel place filled with critics, haters and negative nancys.Unfortunately, it appears the comments finally took a toll on one actress who decided to speak out this weekend in a candid Instagram selfie."Here ya go. Unfiltered. I'm 58. And I'm in Hawaii Five O playing Scott Caan's mom," Melanie wrote online. "Go ahead…Say some more mean things. Merry Christmas." Oh, snap!The post quickly inspired fans to show their support for the actress. "Haters are going to hate. Do you!" one follower wrote. Another added, "So beautiful. I hope I look as good as you when I'm 58."

Luckily, the few critics didn't prevent the Hollywood star from enjoying herself at a holiday party with a few familiar faces.Earlier in the weekend, Melanie caught up with close friends Anjelica Huston, Bette Midler, Alana Stewart and Margie Perenchio where there was plenty of girl talk."Girls night at Margies…#IfWallsCouldTalk," she captioned on Instagram. Alana added, "#GoodFriends #GoodFood."With her divorce from Antonio Banderas recently finalized and plenty of projects in the works for 2016, Dakota Johnson's mom may have summed up her thoughts best with a recent Instagram post."love my kids, love my ex's," she wrote after quoting words from Jennifer Weiner's Fly Away Home.
