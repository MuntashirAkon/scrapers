American Girl Presents Dolls With Disabilities!/n

Every child is different, so why are all toys the same?!?
Luckily, doll retailer, American Girl took notice of that dilemma and created dolls that share common characteristics with their owner!!
The brand's holiday Special Sparkle collection, which caters to children with disabilities, introduced a range of dollies that feature a wheelchair, a hearing aid, an allergy-free lunch set and a tiny service dog in a harness.
With the new line of dolls flying off the shelves, the company's spokeswoman Julie Parks said:
"We have a long history of speaking to diversity and making girls feel good about themselves, and this is just another way we are expanding on the idea."
And not only are the dolls amazingly gawrgeous and have chic accessories, but  they also come in an array of skin tones, eye and hair colors.
Plus, the label's Doll of the Year, McKenna is a gymnast that battles with a learning disability and injuries.
The cutie-pies are priced at $105, but are worth every penny!  Especially because they help build self-esteem and show that being "different" is completely ok!
Do U think a Special Sparkle doll is worth the price?!?
