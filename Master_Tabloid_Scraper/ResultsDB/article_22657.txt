Date Night!/n

Keith Urban took his marble statue wife Nicole Kidman out for some quality time last night.
Leaving the broad at home, the couple had a nice dinner after heading over to see Angelina Jolie's newest, Salt.
We think it's been a long time since the pair have been on a date. Judging by her dress, the last time must have been 1978! 
No, really, it's good that she had a lot of dollies around the house to stick together. 
(Seriously, where did you find that hideous thing??? Aren't you an A - list movie star or something??? Look, your hubby is so embarrassed, he is covering his face and walking 10ft behind you!)
