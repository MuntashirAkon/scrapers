CMT Awards Makeover: Today's Stars with Throwback Hair/n
Like peanut butter and jelly or, say, the Internet and cat videos, country music and major hair just go together.

Ahead of Wednesday’s CMT Music Awards, we’re playing stylist for the female video of the year nominees to imagine what they’d look like rocking the styles and, more importantly, hair of yesteryear.
