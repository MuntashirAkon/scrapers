LeAnn Rimes’ Ex Dean Sheremet
OUR SPLIT WAS ‘LIBERATING’
He may have tweeted that “the price of love is loss” on Oct. 2, but these days Dean Sheremet is handling his break-up with wife of seven years LeAnn Rimes remarkably well. At a Nov. 17 screening in New York City of the indie film Across the Hall, the backup dancer turned songwriter, 28, told Scoop of starting over again, “It’s liberating.” Sheremet—who moved from Nashville to New York City in August—is also taking classes at the prestigious French Culinary Institute. “When [LeAnn] and I were on the road, I cooked all our meals,” he said. Says his friend, Across the Hall director Alex Merkin: “Dean is obviously devastated by the things that were going on, but he’s pulled through in the strongest, most positive way possible.”

REBOUNDING… WITH WILMER!
There’s a new man in Avril Lavigne‘s life: Wilmer Valderrama, whose exes include Mandy Moore and Lindsay Lohan. A source tells Scoop that the pair, who costarred in 2006’s Fast Food Nation, “have been friends for a long time. But they’ve been getting closer over the past few weeks.” Lavigne, 25, who is divorcing Sum 41 singer Deryck Whibley, joined Valderrama, 29, at L.A. hot spot Wonderland on Nov. 14. “She had her hand on his knee,” says a clubgoer. “They looked supercozy together.”

Aerosmith Bandmates Make Plea
STEVEN TYLER ‘NEEDS HELP’
Since Steven Tyler’s reported decision to take a two-year hiatus from Aerosmith, his bandmates are chalking up his behavior—including canceling gigs—to old demons. “He needs help, and attention needs to be put to his health,” drummer Joey Kramer says of Tyler, 61, who struggled with drugs in the ’70s and ’80s. Tyler’s rep insists the singer is “concentrating on his book” while he recoups from a shoulder injury sustained in August. But guitarist Brad Whitford maintains, “His behavior is spinning out of control.”

RUMOR PATROL
HAS JENNIFER BANNED WHITE FOOD FROM HER DIET?
A tabloid report claims that Jennifer Aniston, 40, “has a bizarre new diet secret—she won’t eat white food . . . foods with white flour or white sugar.” And she did once tell In Style that she loves salmon and steak. So has she really banned white food? Nope! The report “is not true,” says her rep.
NOT DATING HIM!
Rihanna
I’M SINGLE . . .
BUT WHO HAS THE TIME TO DATE?
Sure, she admitted on Atlanta’s Q100 radio station that she’s a “very flirty girl,” but when it comes to dating someone again, Rihanna, 21, says, “I don’t think I have the time for a commitment right now—or the energy.” Calling rumors about a romance with 90210‘s Tristan Wilds “funny,” she adds, “I had a house party. He came by…but I don’t even have his number.”
