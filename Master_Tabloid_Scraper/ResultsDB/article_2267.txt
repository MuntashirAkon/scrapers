However, followers got really riled up when it sounded like the MTV star was commanding Jax to fetch the firework!
The 23-year-old has taken the controversial video down, even though she has zero regrets about letting her puppy play with something so dangerous!
She said she thought the whole thing was totally innocent, since it's been done before on America's Funniest Home Videos â€” because that definitely makes it okay to try out.
But if you're concerned about Jax's well-being, never fear, Perezcious readers! Jenelle has assured everyone that her dog is completely fine!
