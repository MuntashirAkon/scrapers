You’d think someone would have thought about launching a line of Dolly Parton makeup a long time ago. But apparently not.Until now.“I want my own cosmetics line,” Parton says in the new issue of Billboard. 

And there's more, much more. In addition to penning the score for the upcoming Broadway musical version of 9 to 5, the legendary country crooner says she’s working on an autobiographical musical, a weekly kids' TV show as well as children’s music and books.She just released her new album, Backwoods Barbie, on her own Dolly Records. “When I first came [to Nashville] I really was the backwoods Barbie,” Parton says. “Too much makeup, too much hair, the big boobs, country girl straight out of the mountains. It’s hard to take somebody looking like that serious, I guess, so I had to work double hard to prove myself.”And as we all know, her hard work throughout her 40-year career has definitely paid off.The self-financed Dolly Records may be a gamble, but don’t tell that to Parton.“I just wanted a fresh, clean start—just go ahead and hire independent record people, hire somebody to run the label and really sink some money into it, invest in myself,” she says. “The majors are all going down the tubes. They’re all has-beens like they all thought I was. So why not just do it? If it does well, than I make all the money, and if it don’t, nothing ventured, nothing gained.”
