Birdie Joe Danielson is here!/n
Brie and Bryan are filled with joy as they welcome their little girl to the world, and have a message for the Bella Army from the hospital.
“There is no better feeling in the world than meeting your daughter,” a jubilant Brie said. “I can’t even express the overwhelming joy and love that Bryan and I are feeling. Now we know what parents mean about the love you feel when you first meet your child. Thank you all for your thoughts and prayers on the safety of Birdie coming into this world.”
