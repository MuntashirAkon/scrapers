John Stamos is the latest celebrity to be the target of an extortion plot by two Michigan residents who threatened to release compromising photos of the actor unless they were given almost $700,000, according to a report by TheSmokingGun.com.  
The alleged extortionists, Allison Coss and Scott Sippola,  were arrested Wednesday, December 2 at a Marquette, Michigan airport, and after a search of their home FBI agents recovered three photos of “Mr. X,” a piece of paper which contained Stamos’ cell phone number and a piece of paper with tabloid magazine phone numbers.  The Smoking Gun identified Mr. X as John Stamos.

Stamos, known fondly as Uncle Jesse to Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen on Full House is currently appearing in Bye Bye Birdie on Broadway.  The FBI affidavit said that Stamos, referred to as Mr. X, attended a party with Coss and her friend in 2004 and “photographs of him were taken,” which were the basis for the extortion plot. John and Allison continued to communicate via email, but last month he received an email from Brian L who claimed to have found the pictures and demanded $680,000 to keep the pictures from being released to the media since they were “cause harm to Mr. X’s reputation.” Stamos’ lawyer contacted the FBI and they hatch the undercover sting operation.
