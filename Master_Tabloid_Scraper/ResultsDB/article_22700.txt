WTF Is Nicole Kidman Wearing At The SAG Awards??/n

We actually don't hate this dress, we just don't think Nicole Kidman can pull it off!
The 49-year-old actress legit showed up to the SAG Awards looking like a straight up parrot in this emerald green Gucci dress featuring sequins and two little birdies on both shoulders. Very '80s Dynasty era, right?!
You know who would totally rock a risk like this?? Joan Collins!
Miz Kidman posed alongside her husband and No. 1 fan Keith Urban on the carpet, who was also wearing Gucci for the night's festivities.
Is this look on your worst-dressed list too?? Let us know in the comments!
