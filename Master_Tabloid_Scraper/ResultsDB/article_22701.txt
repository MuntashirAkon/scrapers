Per the report, the rapper gave the $100K gift to Ms. Lopez on New Year's Eve, the same night they were spotted having a blast at a nightclub in Las Vegas.
While the mag didn't go into details about the singer's thoughts on the lavish present, we imagine she's really into it considering she flaunted the jewels on Instagram just a week ago. You can even spot the glittery gems peaking out of J.Lo's fur coat (above).
