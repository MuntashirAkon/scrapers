James Marsden dropped by The Late Show to chat about his role on the hit HBO show Westworld, including the random questions fans shout at him on airplanes about the fate of his character Teddy.

On the show Stephen Colbert, mentioned that his guest had been named GQ’s “World’s Handsomest Man” this year. It’s difficult to follow the logic, but for whatever reason this prompted the talk-show host to give viewers a peep at the leading man’s high school yearbook photo.
The photo features the then-teenaged actor smiling casually, boasting a mullet.

Marsden made it clear that although it’s a good photo, he was not exactly a ladies man when he was walking the halls of high school.
“I was goofy, I was in theater,” Marsden explained when asked how met girls back when. “I was the guy who was probably a little too enthusiastic to be playing Hugo Peabody in Bye Bye Birdie… I would come to school and do Richard Pryor and Eddie Murphy bits.”
Here’s the photo:
