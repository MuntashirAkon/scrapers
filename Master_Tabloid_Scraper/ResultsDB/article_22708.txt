If you haven’t already taken notice, Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton are doing pretty well as a couple. Now, an insider says that they’re inching towards the aisle.

A source close to Shelton tells Us Weekly that he and Stefani “want to get married before the end of the year” and that their plans are so secret that they haven’t even informed their family as to when the wedding will happen.
“They are both very, very happy,” continues the Shelton source. “Blake is having the time of his life with Gwen and feels so comfortable around her.”

This report comes only days after Stefani became flustered when radio dad Ryan Seacrest asked her whether she saw herself marrying Shelton on On Air With Ryan Seacrest on Sept. 9. “Everything is going so quickly,” said Stefani. “I’m in the moment and, um, look at me, you’ve got me tongue-tied.”
For now, Stefani and Shelton recently duetted on the kickoff date of Shelton’s tour when they sang “Go Ahead and Break My Heart” together in Oklahoma City.
