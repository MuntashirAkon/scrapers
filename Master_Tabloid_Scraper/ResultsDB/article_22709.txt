Criminal Minds’ Shemar Moore released a video on Instagram following Thomas Gibson’s dismissal from the show due to his alleged outbursts of violence.

According to Deadline, Gibson’s ex-manager Craig Dorfman filed a complaint that stated that he and Moore had “verbal altercations” and that Dorfman “talked Gibson out of physically attacking Moore.” Moore’s now-deleted Instagram video, which was saved by a Twitter user and re-posted online, addressed the set rumors without mentioning Gibson’s name.
“Lot of birdies chirping out there; the gossip is real,” said Moore. “I’ll just say this: I believe in karma. Good things happen to good people. Honest people. Hard-working people. Humble people. People who believe in basic goodness. … Treat people how you expect them to treat you. Celebrate yourself and celebrate your blessings — as you should — but just know that you’re not better than anybody.”
