Have mercy…

John Stamos definitely won our hearts as Uncle Jesse on Full House with his slicked back hair, tight jeans, Harley, and serious skills on the guitar. It’s a no brainer why he’s our choice Man Crush Monday this week!
In 2009, he received his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame right next to Dick Van Dyke’s. (Fun fact: Stamos played the legendary star’s character in Bye Bye Birdie when a revival came to Broadway). If you haven’t heard Stamos belt out a tune or seen his spectacular stage presence in productions like Cabaret, How to Succeed In Business Without Really Trying, and Nine, you should definitely treat yourself.

While it’s hard to believe that he just turned 52 this past August, Uncle Jesse is already taking on more mature projects. In his new show Grandfathered, which premieres on FOX tomorrow (Sept. 29), Stamos is a high rolling, city living restaurant owner who finds out he has a son and yes — a granddaughter. Josh Peck, and Christina Milian also star in the new comedy.
Of course, what we’re all really patiently waiting for is Fuller House. Can you imagine having the whole gang back together after 20 years? The series is projected to be released on Netflix in 2016, and is already drawing a huge fan base.
“It’s magical. We have a tremendous amount of love for each other that never really ended,” Stamos tells Parade Magazine. “It’s not a reunion for us because we’ve never left each other’s sides.”
We certainly can’t wait to have the Tanner family and the rest of the crew back under the same roof!
