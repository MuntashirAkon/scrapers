BREAKING HAIR NEWS: Shailene Woodley Goes Back to Brunette/n
Bye, bye Birdie Blondie!
Shailene Woodley appears to be falling in line with the seasons and changing up her summer locks for a deeper fall hue, going back to brunette.

Woodley only spent a few months with her blonde ‘do, which she debuted at the 2014 Met Gala in May.

The platinum pixie was a gorgeous, edgy style for the actress, but that’s a given!  She’s already proven she can pull off any look, going from long, luscious locks to a short bob in Aug. 2013 for her role in The Fault in Our Stars.  She ended up donating the 8-inches she chopped off to the nonprofit organization Children With Hair Loss, encouraging others to do the same.
So I can’t help but wonder what’s next for the 22-year-old starlet!
