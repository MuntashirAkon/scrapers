Jimmy Kimmel is right: “This is what Heaven must be like.”

To our disappointment (unlike at the Gay Pride Parade), the cast of Magic Mike XXL appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on Sunday full-clothed. However, they did tell us what it’s like to see each other naked all the time.
The five stars of the film — Channing Tatum, Matt Bomer, Joe Manganiello, Kevin Nash, and Adam Rodriguez — were all there to give us the scoop.

Rodriguez admits it was “definitely easier” to see his cast mates nude the second time around,  explaining, “I think we got that out of the way early on in the first one. I think this one we were actually looking forward to seeing each other naked.”
Bomer agreed and added, “We have no boundaries left, and I can’t even smell the smell of self-tanner anymore.”
Tatum even admits that the film’s name wasn’t their first choice. He joked, “There was one, and it was Magic Mike: The Road to Myrtle Beach.” 
Last, but not least. The men revealed what their porn names are when they combine their childhood pet name with their childhood street name.
The answers will surprise you. Watch below.
