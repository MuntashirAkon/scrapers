Bruce Jenner Taunted on the Golf Course/nBruce Jenner has been taunted where he golfs everyday ... by a few jerks who think Bruce's new look doesn't belong on the links or in the locker room.Sources connected with Bruce tell TMZ ... almost everyone who golfs with Bruce at his country club in Thousand Oaks has been gracious ... but several people are acting like 14-year-old boys.In one case ... a golfer passed Bruce on the green and screamed out,  "How's your d**k " ... suggesting it might not be there much longer. Bruce was cool -- he laughed and responded by pointing to his crotch and saying,  "It's right here. It hasn't worked in 20 years. "Another guy heckled Bruce in the locker room, mocking his ombre hairstyle and threatening to cut it off.Bruce still goes to the club religiously, and most people treat him warmly and with respect.As for the 2 idiots ... it's 2014, and people have a right to live their lives the way they want as long as they don't hurt anyone. And Bruce can probably kick their asses in golf./n
