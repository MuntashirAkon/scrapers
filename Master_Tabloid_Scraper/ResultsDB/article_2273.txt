Yesterday, Channing Tatum was front and center in the newly released poster for the sexy strip club film, letting us all know Magic Mike XXL is “coming” July 1, 2015.
Now, Tatum, his twelve-pack, and his hunky co-stars Matt Bomer, Joe Manganiello, Adam Rodriguez and more give us an up close and personal look at what to expect in the next reboot. Our eyes are not disappointed.
Directed by Gregory Jacobs, not too much is known about the film yet. He did reveal to PEOPLE, “It’s a road-trip picture. Mike and the guys get back together, and adventure ensues. They look incredible … Their shirts are off an appropriate amount, let’s put it that way! I don’t think anyone’s going to be disappointed.”

Although Matthew McConaughey won’t be in this one, joining the original cast are plenty of other sexy stars like Amber Heard, Michael Strahan, Jada Pinkett Smith, and Elizabeth Banks.
If he hasn’t already, Tatum will dance, strip and grind his way into your heart.
Tatum made a surprise appearance on The Ellen Degeneres Show (airing today on NBC), in which he revealed the new trailer to Ellen Degeneres, and opened up about thongs and body waxing.

Watch his surprise appearance below!
