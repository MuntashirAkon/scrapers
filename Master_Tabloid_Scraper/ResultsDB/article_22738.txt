Justin Bieber -- Pulls a Tiger Woods ... Chokes On Golf Course/nHere's proof Justin Bieber is no different than ANYONE ELSE on the golf course -- slamming his club to the ground after a crappy shot ... and then taking about 5 mulligans in a row.  Bieber -- who's been golfing for years -- hit the links in L.A. when he came upon a shot that he just couldn't hit right.  You can feel Bieber's frustration level growing ... as he goes back to his cart, grabs more balls, and whacks away with similar results.  Don't act like you can't relate ... /n
