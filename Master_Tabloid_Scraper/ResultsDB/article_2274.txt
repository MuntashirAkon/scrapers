 Filming has wrapped on Magic Mike XXL!
That means, the movie is getting closer to premiering in theaters! Channing Tatum, Joe Manganiello, Matt Bomer, Amber Heard, Adam Rodriguez were all on set for the final night of shooting in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina last night. Check out the last pictures from the set in our gallery!
Magic Mike XXL hits theaters on July 1, 2015. So, we only have these pictures to get us through the next eight months!
In the final pictures from set the guys can be seen hanging out together. Plus, Tatum and Heard are pictured getting close in one of the scenes. We guess this means she’s Tatum’s love interest in the movie! We can’t wait to see this film!
Yesterday, Rodriguez posted a photo to Instagram from the set on the final day of shooting.



Sadly, this is the last day of the last ride. Gonna miss my road dogs and this crazy trip we’ve been on. Until the next time…
