Caitlyn Jenner: Take Me On If Ya Got the Balls And the Money/nCaitlyn Jenner's offering anyone -- man or woman -- a chance to play golf with her, but your money's gotta be right. Caitlyn's putting her golf skills up for bid through the celebrity auction site Charitybuzz. The highest bidder will get a private round of golf with her in L.A. -- a great opportunity if golf's your thing. Remember, Caitlyn's a longtime member at the exclusive Sherwood Country Club, and even golfs with pros from time to time. Plus, Bruce frequently donated time for charity auctions, which always went for top dollar. Charitybuzz predicts the winning bidder this time will have to drop around $10k. We're told Caitlyn will also cover the winner's food and drink tab for the day, and she's tossing in an autographed copy of her recent SI cover. Ante up, the auction goes live Saturday./n
