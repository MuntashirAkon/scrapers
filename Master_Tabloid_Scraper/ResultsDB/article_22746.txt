By Radar Staff
A jaw-dropping story comes out of Italy Friday, where a 99-year-old identified in court docs as “Antonio C.” has filed for divorce from his wife of 77 years, 96-year-old “Rosa C.,” after finding evidence of an affair she had more than 60 years ago. 
The man found the letter, written in the 1950s, while searching through a drawer just before Christmas. The wife confessed to the fling, urging her husband to remain in the marriage.

The couple, The Telegraph reported, has five children, a dozen grandchildren and one great-grand child. 
The record for the oldest divorced couple was previously set in 2009, after England natives Bertie and Jessie Wood, both 98, filed for divorce after 36 years of marriage.
