Jada Pinkett Smith's Disapproval Of All Eyez On Me Isn't The First Time A Biopic Got It Totally Wrong!/n

Biopics are a great way to learn about the life and career of a public figure — but Hollywood has a tendency to put more emphasis on the "pic" and less on the "bio."
That can lead to the awkward situation of the film being criticized by the people who were there for the real thing!
Take, for example, the upcoming Tupac biopic All Eyez On Me, which was ripped apart by Jada Pinkett Smith on Friday for severely "reimagining" her relationship with the late rapper!
Of course, this isn't the first time Hollywood took certain creative liberties to craft a more entertaining (but less accurate) story — see what other films have been blasted by real life family members, friends, colleagues, and even the central characters themselves!
