Jada Pinkett Smith Calls B.S. On Tupac Biopic All Eyez On Me — Here's Everything She Says Was 'Reimagined'!/n

All eyez are on the Tupac Shakur biopic — and not everyone likes what they see!
Namely, Jada Pinkett Smith, who made it clear she is not a fan of the new film about her late friend.

In a series of tweets on Friday, the Girls Trip actress went off on the upcoming drama All Eyez on Me, calling the portrayal of her relationship with the late rap legend (played by newcomer Demetrius Shipp Jr.) "deeply hurtful."
On Twitter, Jada politely explained several scenes in the movie featuring her and Pac never actually happened. She wrote (spoilers, kinda?): 

Forgive me… my relationship to Pac is too precious to me for the scenes in All Eyez On Me to stand as truth.

Pac never read me that poem. I didn't know that poem existed until it was printed in his book.

Pac never said goodbye to me before leaving for LA. He had to leave abruptly and it wasn't to pursue his career.

I've never been to any of Pac's shows by his request. We never had an argument backstage.

The reimagining of my relationship to Pac has been deeply hurtful.

Awkward… especially for director Benny Boom!
Sure, it's common for biopics to alter real events to make for better storytelling — but based on what Jada is saying, it sounds like a LOT of creative liberties were taken here.
The 45-year-old made sure not to catch Shipp Jr. in her line of fire, telling the actor — along with Kat Graham, who portrayed Jada in the film — they did an amazing job with the roles they were given:

To @KatGraham and @Dshippjr this is no fault of yours. Thank you for bringing so much heart and spirit to your roles.
— Jada Pinkett Smith (@jadapsmith) June 16, 2017


You both did a beautiful job with what you were given. Thank you both.

Respect!
To cap it all off, Jada gave the real Pac a sweet birthday message:

Happy birthday Pac, you are cradled in my heart for eternity.
I love you.

Awwww!
Sadly, Life Goes On… but biopics last forever.
