 Myrtle Beach, SC just got a whole lot more hunky!
Channing Tatum, Joe Manganiello, Matt Bomer, Kevin Nash and Adam Rodriguez were spotted filming scenes in which they were cruise around Myrtle Beach in a Rolls Royce convertible for their movie, Magic Mike XXL earlier today (November 04, 2014).
Joe revealed that the sequel is going to be well worth the wait.

“The first movie was like the appetizer, this is the main course,” he promised of the male stripper/road trip tale he described as “Animal House on wheels.”
“This is probably the most daring studio film that’s been made since the ’70s. It’s out there!”
Really what all fans are hoping for is more skin, so this is good news.
