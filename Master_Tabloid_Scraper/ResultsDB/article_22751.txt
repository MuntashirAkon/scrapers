HIGHlarious! Colt Prattes, who is playing the late Patrick Swayze's character Johnny Castle, followed Miz Breslin's lead as he shared a snap from the film's iconic dance number (below).

*Swoon* The new footage fun didn't stop there as Sarah Hyland shared snaps of her dressed as Baby's sis, Lisa Houseman. The Modern Family actress uploaded:

We're so hyped! As you surely know, the Will & Grace alum is playing Breslin's character's mother in the reboot. And while Messing is stoked to be remaking a classic, she promises fans there is new material to enjoy as she dished to People:
"This isn't a replica of the original. This takes some liberties. It has the DNA of the original, but you are going to find out what happened to Baby and Johnny after that summer ended. So there's some additional surprises in there that are new. My hope is that people who loved the movie are going to be happy with all the things that are iconic with the movie, that they'll appreciate the things that are new and modernized with this version."
Squee!
Be sure to block out some time on May 24, because the Dirty Dancing remake is slated to be three hours long (starting at 8 p.m. E.T. on ABC). Geez.
