Camila Cabello Will Give You The Feels With Her Cover Of Michael Jackson's Man In The Mirror!/n

Camila Cabello was just one of the amazing artists to perform during Zedd's ACLU benefit concert in Los Angeles on Monday night!
While the solo star unsurprisingly sang Bad Things on stage with MGK, the former Fifth Harmony songstress also beautifully covered Michael Jackson's hit Man In The Mirror!

What a perfect song for a great cause! And if her song choice wasn't enough of a statement, Camila even rocked a "RESIST" t-shirt!
Of course, the 20-year-old wasn't the only one to hit the stage to raise money for the American Civil Liberties Union, as Halsey, Tinashe, Macklemore, Miguel, Bebe Rexha, Imagine Dragons, Skrillex, Daya, and Incubus also had appearances.
Cabello was the lucky singer to close out the show with her amazing performances though, which you can watch (above and below)!
