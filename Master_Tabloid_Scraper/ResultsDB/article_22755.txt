After months of horrifying videos and troubling revelations, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard’s divorce is almost a done deal. In fact, the documents could be signed and filed in the next few days.

The actress’s lawyer told Entertainment Tonight “the parties are in the process of finalizing settlement agreements and submitting to the court next week.”
Per the estranged couple’s settlement, Heard will receive $6.8 million from Depp over the course of next twelve months, which she has already said she would donate to charity.

This sum is $200,000 less than the couple initially agreed upon. The Alice Through the Looking Glass actor donated the difference directly to two of Heard’s favorite charities, the American Civil Liberties Union and Children’s Hospital Los Angeles.
In the months since news of their divorce surfaced, Heard has become an advocate for victims of domestic violence, even appearing in a PSA for Girlgaze.
