Kim Kardashian wanted to give the world a look at her slimmed-down figure, nine months after giving birth to son Saint West, in a series of Snapchats and Instagram posts on Friday, while on vacation in Mexico.
More importantly, Kim also recently learned how to twerk. Yeah, watch out, because that booty is dangerous (see below).
First, the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star looked pretty incredible in a tan bandeau and matching bikini bottoms, with her body oiled-up for good measure.

Then moments later, the reality star held her iPhone a mere inches away from her glistening backside and slowly twerked for the camera. Wowza.

Kardashian also recently spoke about not wanting to be labeled a feminist. “For me, a feminist is someone who advocates for the civil and social rights and liberties of all people, regardless of their gender; anyone who believes that women should have the same choices and opportunities as men when it comes to education and employment, their bodies and their lifestyles,” she wrote on Monday, August 15. “Of course I want those things! But at the end of the day, no one should feel pressured to be labeled as anything just because they believe in certain things and support certain values or ideals.”
