World's Fastest Tortoise Named Bertie, Is Inspiring/n

Never let anyone tell you you can’t do something.
If you need a reminder of that, please meet Bertie, the world’s fastest tortoise.
Bertie is the fastest tortoise in the world, and truly an inspiration to us all. Hailing from the appropriately-named Adventure Valley, in Durham, U.K., Bertie recently smashed the previous record for tortoise speed, held by another British tortoise named Charlie. 
Bertie’s record-breaking 5.48-meter sprint saw him achieve speeds of .28 meters per second (or .92 feet per second), which shattered Charlie’s record of .125 m/s, held since 1977. 
Bertie’s owners Marco Calzini and his wife Janine discovered Charlie’s record and set about testing their tortoise against it. They declined to tell Guinness whether or not they suspected Bertie’s gift beforehand, or if they simply speed-test all their animals against their kin.
Regardless, fame has been good to Bertie: He now lives in a special enclosure with his girlfriend Shelly, his Guinness certification in plain view for all the world to see.
