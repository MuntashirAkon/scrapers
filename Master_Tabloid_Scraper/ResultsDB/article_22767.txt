Picks and Pans Review: The World According to Bertie/n
by Alexander McCall Smith 
NOVEL
In this fourth installment of his 44 Scotland Street series, Smith focuses on Bertie Pollock, 6, whose comically overbearing mom cramps his Edinburgh childhood with lessons and sessions with a Freudian analyst (who, hmm, looks a lot like Bertie’s baby brother). A few low-octane mysteries are proffered as plot, but the real appeal lies in enjoying Smith’s characters—and the wit with which he renders all manner of human foibles.
