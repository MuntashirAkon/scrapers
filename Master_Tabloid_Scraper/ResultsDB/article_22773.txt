Andrea Bocelli and Veronica Berti's wedding was definitely worth the wait!The couple of twelve years exchanged vows at the Sanctuary of Madonna di Montenero in Tuscany, Italy. The wedding took place in Livorno Friday, on the second birthday of their daughter, Virginia.The groom, 55, looked dapper in a three-piece silk suit. Berti, 30, walked down the aisle in an ivory, silk satin Ermanno Scervino gown, which was embellished with Valenciennes lace and featured a silk georgette layer. The bride covered her shoulders with a quilted crepe de chine padded jacket. She pulled her hair back and added a sprig of flowers, which complemented her bouquet of white roses.

Bocelli was previously married to Enrica Cenzatti. The exes' sons—Amos, 19, and Matteo, 16­—attended the Italian tenor's wedding to Berti. The reception was held at his villa in Forte dei Marmi.When the seven-time World Music Award winner spoke to The Daily Mail about his wedding plans last year, he was eager to marry his manager. Of course, there were also practical reasons for tying the knot. "Naturally, when two people feel like we do, they want to make it a permanent arrangement," Bocelli said. "It will happen from the religious and spiritual point of view, but it is a legal matter."
