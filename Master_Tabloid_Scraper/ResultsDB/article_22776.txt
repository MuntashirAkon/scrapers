Ferguson's got some competition for Winston's (Lamorne Morris) affection!New Girl is set to welcome Jessica Chaffin, one-half of the comedy duo Ronna & Beverly, as an admirer of Winston's in an upcoming episode, E! News has learned.In the hit sitcom's ninth episode "Werewolf," which is slated to air in mid-November and completed shooting last week, Chaffin will play Bertie, a straight-talking, no-nonsense bus driver who cannot hide her attraction to Winston, who has been woefully single and not hiding it so far in season three. (Seriously, he tried to bring his cat on a group date.)

In addition to Ronna & Beverly, of which she also serves as executive producer, Chaffin has made appearances on 90210, The United States of Tara, Childrens Hospital and 2 Broke Girls. Also set to guest star in a November episode of the sitcom is Taye Diggs, who will play a "smooth ladies' man" that may just cause some drama between Nick and Jess.As we recently reported, one of the roommates is set to move out of the loft in an upcoming episode, making the way for Damon Wayans Jr.'s triumphant return as Coach, the character he played in the pilot. New Girl airs tonight at 9 p.m. on Fox.
