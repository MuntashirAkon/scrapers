Pregnant ‘Teen Mom 2′ Star Jenelle Evans Arrested For Breaching The Peace/n
Just two days after she announced to the world that she had changed her ways for good, Jenelle Evans, the rough around the edges star of Teen Mom 2, has been arrested again. You’re shocked, I can tell.

Celebuzz has confirmed that the reality star was arrested yesterday for violating a peace ordinance in North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. It’s the third time that she’s been arrested this year.
In Touch first reported that the arrest came after a fight between Evans and her boyfriend, Nathan Griffith. Police arrived on the scene yesterday after a neighbor grew concerned and alerted them. That account seems to be confirmed by Jenelle, albeit a bit differently, via Twitter:
Oh man that was funny.

Went as far as my mom yelling at my neighbors if they don’t stop she will sue them. She did it to sell a story.

I’ve been in my house all day long… She even said Nathan was outside yelling at my mom on the phone… Lmfao no he wasn’t

All said and done, she was only in police custody for about an hour. The report of the arrest clocked her in at 5:11 PM and had her released at 6:14 after posting her bail.
All of this comes just days after Jenelle revealed that she and Nathan are expecting their first child together. It will be the second for Jenelle, who still is without custody of her 4-year-old son, Jace.
