Caitlyn Jenner is on good terms with Kendall and Kylie Jenner… for now.

Weeks after sparking a feud within her family with her harmful accusations about ex-wife Kris Jenner, the Olympian was spotted spending Father’s Day with her daughters. The trio spent their Sunday (June 18, 2017) attending the Beverly Hills Car Show on Rodeo Drive.
Despite previous rumors she “rarely speaks” to her dad, Kendall happily posed for photos with Caitlyn as she held the 67-year-old’s new Golden Retriever puppy, Bertha, in her arms.
Good day at the Father’s Day car show on Rodeo Drive with my girls,” Caitlyn captioned a photo of them on Instagram. “Happy Father’s Day to all the dads out there.”

According to sources, tensions have been running high in the Kardashian clan since the release of Caitlyn’s memoir, The Secrets of My Life.
“Kendall is loyal to Kris and has very little to do with her dad. The more time that has passed, the more she feels Caitlyn has let her down with the things she has said and with her actions,” a source told E! News. “Kylie has really made an effort not to take sides and to be supportive of Caitlyn. She really wants to have a relationship with her dad, but Caitlyn has hurt Kris tremendously and it’s made it very difficult.”
Previously, Caitlyn confirmed she was no longer on speaking terms with former stepdaughter Kim Kardashian.
