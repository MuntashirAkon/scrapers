‘Teen Mom’ Jenelle Evans’ Boyfriend Gets Tasered (And Throws Up) During His DUI Arrest/n
After Teen Mom Jenelle Evans candidly admitted to police officers that she and her boyfriend were only trying to have sex when they were pulled over for driving erratically, that wasn’t the only thing that went a bit haywire.
Before Nathan Griffith was cited for a DUI on Sept. 7, Evans’ boyfriend was tasered and thrown to the ground for resisting arrest. (Shocking, I know.)
It all started when police followed Griffith to his home (after they saw him driving on the wrong side of the road) in North Myrtle Beach, SC and he ran towards his front door.

According to the police report obtained by Celebuzz, the officer asked for Griffith’s driver’s license which he refused and when police grabbed his wrist to be placed under arrest he resisted by pushing off the cop car and was wrestled to the ground.
Oh, but Griffith wasn’t done toying with police in his drunken stupor.
As he was lying on his stomach he decided to place his hands underneath his body “with locked arms” (because that’s the smart thing to do.) It got so dramatic that another officer arrived to help subdue him — and little did Griffith know that the police had another idea up their sleeve.
Griffith continued to resist arrest… so they tasered him (and the handcuffs went on much easier.)
And just when you thought the eventful night ended there… well, it didn’t.
The arresting officer said Griffith “had a strong smell of alcohol on his breath” (which probably explains why he vomited in the back seat of the police car), he had slurred speech, and they discovered his driver’s license was suspended twice and he has two prior DUI convictions.
