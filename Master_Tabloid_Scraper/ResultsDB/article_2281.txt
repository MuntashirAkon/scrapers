Isla Fisher strutted her stuff while on the set of her latest film, the Baz Luhrmann directed adaptation of The Great Gatsby.
The actress, who plays seductive mistress Myrtle Wilson, was spotted in Sydney, Australia getting very intimate with her co-star Joel Edgerton during filming. Isla looked all dolled up wearing a red dress and knee-high stockings to meet him outside  an old power station. Photogs caught the on-set action, as she ran to greet him and give him a big hug.
We don’t know about you guys, but we can’t for this movie to hit the big screen!

Earlier this month, filming of The Great Gatsby got underway. Real life BFF’s Leonardo DiCaprio and Tobey Maguire were pictured strolling around in a red and white vintage car on set. The film is set to open Christmas Day 2012 and also stars Carey Mulligan, Jason Clarke and Elizabeth Debicki.
Off set, Leo has been making headlines because of his romantic life. The sexy actor has been spotted at his Aussie apartment with a mystery woman, who has since been  identified as Madalina Ghenea. While we don’t know much about her, we do know they make a gorgeous duo! What do you think of the pair? Sound off in the comments!
