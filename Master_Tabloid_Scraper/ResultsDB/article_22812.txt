Girls Trip Stars Regina Hall, Tiffany Haddish, Jada Pinkett Smith, & Queen Latifah Prove They're Red Carpet QUEENS At The BET Awards!/n

These women are QUEENS!
On Sunday, Jada Pinkett Smith, Regina Hall, Tiffany Haddish, and Queen Latifah graced the BET Awards with their presence as they stopped by the bash to promote their new movie, Girls Trip. And boy, did they KILL this appearance.
While the women in no way matched their ensembles, they all served up some serious A-list realness. No really. For starters, Will Smith's wife looked practically ageless as she displayed some seXXXy side thigh in a gold Alexandre Vauthier gown. Miz Hall also got in on the slit action as she flaunted her gams in a turquoise blue number!
As for Tiffany, she was the embodiment of summer, donning white shorts, a blazer, and a bedazzled bralette. Looking good!
Although we wish Queen Latifah took a bigger risk on the red carpet, she still looked stunning in her black gown. Pretty much, these women are just red carpet pros through and through!
