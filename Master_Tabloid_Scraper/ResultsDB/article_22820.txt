It’s pretty clear who is in the running for best Thanksgiving Day plate this year…

Celebrities like Chrissy Teigen and Taylor Swift are known for snapping pics of their meals throughout the year, but now is when it really matters. Thanksgiving is a time when your entire Instagram feed is covered with family photos and lots of food, and we’re sure it’ll be the same for our favorite celebrity cooks including Matthew McConaughey and Blake Lively. We’re counting on stars with their own cookbooks like Kris Jenner and Gwyneth Paltrow to show the Instagram world what they’ve mastered in the kitchen this year!
