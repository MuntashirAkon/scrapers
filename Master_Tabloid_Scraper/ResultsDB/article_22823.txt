The lineup of this year’s Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade has been revealed, according to The L.A. Times. This will be the parade’s 90th anniversary, so expect them to go the extra mile on Nov. 24, 2016.

Tony Bennett leads the cast of human performers that will be marching through Herald Square. The crooner will be joined by Regina Spektor, Sarah McLachlan, and Aloe Blacc. All that musical talent should make your Thanksgiving morning much more pleasant while you stuff the turkey and wait for football to start.
The biggest stars of the parade this year won’t be human at all. Two sets of Muppets will appear in the parade. Big Bird and the Sesame Street gang will be in the parade, as they have been many times in the past, while Kermit the Frog and the cast of The Muppet Show (presumably Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear, Gonzo among others) will kick off the day’s festivities with a musical number.

The rest of the parade will feature marching bands, cheerleaders, and some tap-dancing Christmas trees. Those planning to watch the parade in person should get to Herald Square in New York City early to secure a good spot. Everyone else can watch it from the comfort of their own homes at 9 a.m. PST on NBC.
