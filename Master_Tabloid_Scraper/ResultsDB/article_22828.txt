“What black women can do with their hair is truly phenomenal,” she says in the video. “From the natural hair styles, to adding hair in, to color, to straight, to 18-inch weaves, it is so fascinating what we can do. And I promise you every other nationality of women are looking at us and they’re going, ‘Oh my gosh I wish I could do that.'”

The actress adds that black women aren’t only trying new hair trends, they’re starting them. 
“To think that a visual can represent so much about a culture is astounding,” she says. “The braids represented that regular beautiful black girl, they represent girls around the country who are just happy to be. We set the bar, it starts with us. We’re the tastemakers when it comes to hair.”
