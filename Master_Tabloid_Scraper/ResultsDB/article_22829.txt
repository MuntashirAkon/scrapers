Regina King Now Has Bangs! (PHOTO)/n
Regina King is bangin’!
The actress, 45, debuted some fresh fringe on the red carpet this past weekend for her “A Toast To Regina King” event in L.A. And on Wednesday, King showed off her blunt, eye-grazing bangs again on Jimmy Kimmel Live! (we’re guessing their real, not clip-ins!), pulling the rest of her hair back into a sky-high ponytail. Warning: The photo below will give you an instant case of #hairenvy.

King paired the new do with a sexy graphic, long-sleeve Brandon Sun minidress and pointy-toe pumps.

The edgy chop is a total 180 from the star’s previous hairstyle, a collarbone-grazing, slightly angled cut. We can’t wait to see how she continues to style the new do on and off the red carpet.
