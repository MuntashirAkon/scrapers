Lindsay Lohan: I Wanted to Play Regina George in Mean Girls/n
Lindsay Lohan as Regina George?  
The idea seems almost unfathomable, but the star of 2004’s smash hit Mean Girls actually wanted that part, rather than the lead role of Cady, the iconic comedy‘s heroine.  
Ten years after the movie debuted, Lohan says she argued with director Mark Waters over playing “Queen Bee” Regina.  
After portraying a geeky teen in previous roles, she was desperate for one that would let her rule the roost, Lohan, 28, told Entertainment Weekly in its annual reunions double issue. The actress is paired with costars Tina Fey and Rachel McAdams, who had originally auditioned for the Cady part, for the piece.  
“I had finished Freaky Friday not long before with Mark Waters. I had gone to Toronto and I was doing Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen,” Lohan told EW. “Mark came out to scout locations for Mean Girls and came to see me at my hotel and said, ‘Do you wanna do this movie?’ ”  
Indeed she did, but her heart was set on one character only.  
“I wanted to play Regina. I had just played – in Confessions and Freaky – not the cool girl in school. I was still 17 years old and I wanted to be the cool girl on set. So I had a war with him, and he goes, ‘No, Cady is the heroine, and that’s who you are.’ ”  
Soon, Fey, who had written the screenplay and assumed Lohan would play Regina, came to understand Waters’s thinking as well.  
“At some point, I was like ‘Oh, should Lindsay be Regina?’ And then Mark and Lorne (Michaels) had the good sense to say, ‘No, she gets to turn into Regina.’ You work backward from that and you cast her as Cady, knowing she could get to that point of being Regina, but you let her be the innocent side, too.”
