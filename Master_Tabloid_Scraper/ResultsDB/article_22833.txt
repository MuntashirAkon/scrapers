Picks and Pans Review: Southland's Regina King/n
>A 227 REUNION
YOUR 227 MOM, MARLA GIBBS, GUEST-STARS ON SOUTHLAND. HAVE YOU TWO STAYED IN CONTACT SINCE YOUR ’80s SITCOM?
She’s one of my closest friends. She witnessed me becoming a mother, our families know each other, and I see her during the holidays.
YOU’VE KNOWN MARLA SINCE YOU WERE 14. WHAT DO YOU TALK ABOUT THESE DAYS?
Marla is up on all the latest health trends more than anyone I know. She’s asked me, “Are you doing a cleanse again this year?” If you want to know the latest macrobiotic, organic whatever, call Marla. She’d tell you what’s legit!
IS SHE STILL THE SASSY LADY WE REMEMBER?
She’s very witty and has not lost any of that sharpness. Her comedic timing is in a class of its own.
