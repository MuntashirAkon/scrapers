6 Revelations from Regina King/n
FAVORITE ROOM
The kitchen. The last thing I made for friends was … homemade vanilla ice cream with ginger chocolate-chunk cookies. When I cook, people want to come over!
PET PEEVE
When people are rude to kids. My son [Ian, 14] is the nicest person. He asked a clerk where the mayo was, and someone ignored him because he was a kid.
GREAT GETAWAY
The Four Seasons Resort Bali is really beautiful. The rooms are like little bungalows. And you know how you go on vacation and you come back bigger? We didn’t. We ate fruit and fish.
RECENT PURCHASE
Dolce & Gabbana came out with new fragrances, and I mixed [two of them]. The smell is awesome—I don’t want to smell like everyone else.
WILL MAKE HER CRY
The Notebook and The Bridges of Madison County. We all need a good cry sometimes. I always try to hold back tears, but with those movies I can’t.
BEST RED CARPET MOMENT
I really liked the way I looked for the Ray premiere in L.A. [in 2004, below]. It was a burgundy Richard Tyler dress, and I felt like I looked like a glass of Cabernet.
