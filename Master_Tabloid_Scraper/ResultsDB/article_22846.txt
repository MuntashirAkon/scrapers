Who's got the real one? You guessed it.

Meanwhile, Zelena (Rebecca Mader) agrees to help Belle (Emilie De Ravin), and the pair enlist Aladdin (Deniz Akdeniz) to steal a magical object from Mr. Gold (Robert Carlyle) that just might protect Belle and her unborn child from him forever.Once Upon a Time airs Sundays at 8 p.m. on ABC.
