Regina King Making Cinderella Hip Hopera With Rap Legend/n "American Crime " actress Regina King and legendary Brooklyn rapper, Dana Dane are turning Cinderella into a dude with a whole lotta swag for a movie adaptation of Dane's 1987 hit  "Cinderfella. " We're told the script is complete and the two are shopping around for actors. There's talk Ice Cube might hop onto the project.  "Cinderfella " was one of Dana's biggest hits ...  the lyrics puts the Cinderella story in the hood. Instead of a fairy godmother, Dana rapped about his fairy godfather, Hurb, and instead of glass slippers, Cinderfella shows up to the party in a pair of brand spanking new Ballys ... one of which gets left behind. King already has a good track record with Cinderella flicks. She starred in the remake  "A Cinderella Story " which was a hit at the box office. /n
