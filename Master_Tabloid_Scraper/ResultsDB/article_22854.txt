Carmen's Night Out/nCarmen Electra, with rocker hubby Dave Navarro in tow, was out and about in the Big Apple Monday night.   First, Carmen - along with co-stars Regina Hall and Anna Faris - hit the red carpet for the premiere of 'Scary Movie 4.' The girls spilled the beans about which cast member is baring all in the film. Sorry, fellas - it ain't Carmen.   Afterwards, Carmen headed over to a Saab event and chatted it up with our cameraman./n
