'Real Housewives of Atlanta' Star Phaedra Park's Mother -- I'm NOT a Baby Killing, Witch Doctor/nWitch doctors and the law -- leave it to the mother of Phaedra Parks ... from  "Real Housewives of Atlanta " ... to bring the 2 together in a $6 MILLION defamation filed in Georgia. Regina Bell (above right) filed the suit against a company called Vibe Holdings for its online book,  "Lies of a Real Housewife: Tell the Truth and Shame the Devil " ... in which the author accuses Bell of  "witch-doctory " and concocting potions to abort children. In the docs, Bell says all of the accusations are BS ... claiming she has been a respected preacher in her community for 33 years, and there's no way in hell she ever created any potions, or offered to help abort unborn children.Now Bell is demanding a retraction and $6 million in damages from Vibe -- saying she is publicly hated and ridiculed because of the book. The filing comes on the heels of her daughter's $30 million suit against Vibe ... also claiming defamation due to the book. A judge has yet to rule./n
