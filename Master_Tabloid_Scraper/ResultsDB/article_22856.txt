Prince Adopted Me and Left Me $7 Million!/nTwo new potential Prince heirs are stepping forward to get a piece of the pie -- and at least one of them isn't even a blood relation ... TMZ has learned. According to docs filed in probate court, and obtained by TMZ, Norman Yates Carthens says Prince adopted him -- he's not specific about when -- and claims there IS a will that could make him rich. Carthens says Prince left him $7 million. He makes no mention of where this mysterious will is right now. Prince's sister Tyka, and his estate have already said there is no will. Also, an alleged half-sibling named Regina Sorenson filed docs saying she and Prince had the same father. In the docs she says there is a trust, and she should be included in any DNA testing of potential heirs.Â /n
