Dancing Chicks -- Lets Get Ready to Rumba!/nEver wonder what the hot-bodied women of  "Dancing With the Stars " do during the off season? Well, here ya go...Season one champ Kelly Monaco cha-cha-chowed down on championship dancer Regina Poryes while  "DTWS " regulars Kym Johnson and Cheryl Burke soaked up some rays at the Bare Pool and Lounge at the Mirage this weekend. The gals were all in Sin City for  "DWTS " pro Edyta Sliwinska's bachelorette party. Sliwinska's fiance -- a fellow dance-equin -- was Kelly's partner when she won the whole thing in 2005./n
