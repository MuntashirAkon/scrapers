Did RNC Speaker Laura Ingraham End Her Speech With A Nazi Salute?!/n

We thought the RNC couldn't get any more controversial than Melania Trump plagiarizing a 2008 speech by Michelle Obama, and then a Donald Trump employee who may or may not exist taking the blame.
Enter right wing radio host Laura Ingraham.
The conservative commentator took the stage to sing The Donald's praises and bash the media for their unfair treatment of him.

Then she made a gesture that looked VERY much like a Nazi salute to a giant video display of Trump — which quickly became simply a wave to the crowd.
Was it an accident of the posture? A secret message? See the best Twitter reactions to the shocking moment and judge for yourself…
