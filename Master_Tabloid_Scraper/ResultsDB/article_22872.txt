How very sad.
As we previously reported, it was confirmed earlier this week that Tony Lara from Discovery's Deadliest Catch died this past weekend in South Dakota.
On Tuesday, a preliminary autopsy report revealed that the Captain died from a heart attack at 50-years-old. Tragic.

Specifically, scar tissue found on the Cornelia Marie's leader's heart lead to the conclusion that he suffered from a heart attack.
It's said that the crab catcher passed away in his sleep while in his Sturgis residence and did not suffer.
Meade County Sheriff Ron Merwin shared that though authorities are still awaiting a toxicology report there is no reason to believe that drugs were involved in this untimely passing. Phew.
The show has since posted a touching tribute (below) on Twitter for the fallen Captain. 

Tony Lara will always be part of the #DeadliestCatch family. Our deepest thoughts and prayers go out to his family. https://t.co/0kp83E9aIO
