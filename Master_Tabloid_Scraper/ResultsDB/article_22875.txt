Kate Middleton Is Mad For Plaid On Christmas Day!/n

What classic Christmas Day outfits! 
Prince William and Kate Middleton attended a Christmas Day service at St. Mary’s church in Sandringham yesterday, and both incorporated Xmas colors into their ensems. 
The Duchess of Cambridge wore a plaid McQ coat dress in a quintessential shade of green, which she styled with a matching hat and Marvin K boots. She accessorized with Kiki McDonough earrings and Cornelia James gloves to complete the winter-savvy look! 
Hubby Will made a dapper appearance by his lady’s side in a gray double-breasted coat, then added a pop of Christmas-y red through his tie. 
Lovely! 
Wonder if Kate had any say in what she was wearing or if she just left it to the maid!?
