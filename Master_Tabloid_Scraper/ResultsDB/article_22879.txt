 It’s Christmastime with the royals!
Kate Middleton and the rest of the Royal Family were out in full force Thursday morning for Christmas service at St. Mary Magdalene Church at the queen’s country estate in Sandringham, Norfolk, England.
Clad in a Moloh tweed coat and recycling her pillbox hat by Lock and Company, the Duchess of Cambridge was all-smiles as she greeted fans gathered outside with gifts for her family. Kate capped off her look with brown heels by Emmy shoes, Cornelia James gloves and Catherine Zoraida earrings./n
