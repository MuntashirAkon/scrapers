A Texas man captured the dramatic rescue of a father and his two young children who were stuck in their overturned truck and surrounded by fast-moving water.
Eager to help people after at least four tornadoes ripped through the state on Saturday, Tom Mitchell came across a flipped truck near Myrtle Springs, Texas, and realized that a father, toddler and infant were trapped inside, according to WFAA.
While he was unable to physically help, Mitchell took out his cell phone and captured the moment when a few other good samaritans went into the water and tried to free the family.
“The infant is white, going blue-ish grey,” Tom told the news outlet about the frightening moment. “No color at all and the eyes were not focused when I looked down at her. This baby is gonna die if we don’t start CPR fast. Having a negative feeling coming over me. This baby may not make it, this baby may not make it. No reaction, nothing is happening.”
He quickly put his phone in his pocket, sprung into action and performed CPR as a woman could be heard on the video saying, “Dear Jesus, please let this baby breathe.”
Over nine million people have watched the heroic moment which Mitchell said he felt compelled to share.
“I think it shows how the community and strangers all come together,” he told WFAA.
According to the news outlet, the father of the children posted an update on social media Sunday from a local hospital saying that he and his infant son are doing much better.
As for his baby, she is stable and continuing to improve.
“Still under sedation but pulling the breathing tube in the morning to see if she can do it on her own,” he wrote.
According to CNN, at least 14 people were killed and dozens more injured as storms tore through Texas, Missouri, Arkansas and Mississippi.
