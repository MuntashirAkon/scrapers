 No job? No problem.
For Jill Abramson, staying fit is all one needs during a time of unemployment.
On Thursday, one day after the 60-year-old was let go from her post as the New York Times’ executive editor, her daughter posted the following photo on Instagram:


“Mom’s badass new hobby . . . #girls #pushy,” Abramson’s daughter Cornelia wrote as the caption.
This week, Times publisher Arthur Sulzberger, Jr. made a sudden announcement that Abramson had been let go from her position, a job she’s had since 2011. She joined the paper in 1997.
While much has been said about the possible reasons for the HR shakeup, including a detail on Abramson being underpaid, one thing’s for sure: this woman can pack a punch.
