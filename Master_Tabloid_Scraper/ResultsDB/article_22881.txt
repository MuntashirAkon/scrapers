Kate Middleton Learns About Sexting at Charity Forum/n
The Duchess of Cambridge stepped out today for another engagement, this time visiting Place2Be’s schools forum at Canary Wharf in London.
Catherine is patron of the charity, which offers emotional and therapeutic services for children who are suffering through social situations, including bullying, neglect, bereavement and domestic violence.

Catherine herself was the victim of bullying as a teenager, having transferred to Marlborough College from Downe House after certain girls turned her into an “emotional wreck.”  For her wedding, Catherine selected an anti-bullying organization as one of the many charities in lieu of gifts.
For today’s engagement, Catherine wore a pleated Orla Kiely skirt with a MaxMara jacket, Cornelia James gloves, a Russell & Bromley purse, Annoushka earrings and Alexander McQueen shoes [credit: Daily Mail, @AnnieElizabethN].
Her Royal Highness stayed an hour longer than scheduled so that she could attend more forums, after meeting students and being greeted outside by nine-year-old Tierney Potter.
At one of the forums, a professor spoke about sexting and the graphic content teenagers are exposed to in the digital age.
“The Duchess was asking questions, and mentioned she was at a meeting yesterday when the issue of sexting came up as well,” the professor told the Daily Mail.
“She is a really bright, thoughtful woman and it was so nice to meet her.”
