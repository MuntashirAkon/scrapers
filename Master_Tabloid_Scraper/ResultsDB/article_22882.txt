Yes, That’s Tilda Swinton In A Box/n
Lower your voices, art lovers — Tilda Swinton is sleeping.
On Saturday, the Oscar winning actress was spotted at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City performing her piece The Maybe, which involves sleeping in a glass box.
Swinton, 52, first performed the piece in 1995 in London with artist Cornelia Parker, and again in Rome.

According to MoMA’s statement, “An integral part of The Maybe’s incarnation at MoMA in 2013 is that there is no published schedule for its appearance, no artist’s statement released, no museum statement beyond this brief context, no public profile or image issued.” [via The Hollywood Reporter]
“Those who find it chance upon it for themselves, live and in real — shared — time: now we see it, now we don’t,” the museum continued.
Swinton, who most recently appeared as David Bowie’s wife in his music video for “The Stars (Are Out Tonight),” will be performing the piece about “a half-dozen” more times between now and the end of the year, the museum told The Gothamist over the weekend.
But there’s a twist: each performance will be unannounced and be in a different location inside the MoMA.
