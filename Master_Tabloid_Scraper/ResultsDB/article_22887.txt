Is Lady Gaga ready to tie the knot with Taylor Kinney?!That was seemingly the question on everyone's mind after the "Born This Way" beauty was spotted shopping for wedding dresses while in Toronto with her mom on Sunday.During her day off after a gig in Ottawa, the 28-year-old pop star brought her mother and her adorable puppy Asia to the couture wedding store Divine Decadence Originals, where she was snapped checking out the vintage bridal gowns (while being followed by 150 fans), instantly sparking rumors that she and her beau of two years are ready to take the plunge.So is it time for these two "weirdos" to say I-do? Not so fast...

"Lady Gaga came into our store...A friend recommended her to come in. She was with her mum, two assistants and two bodyguards," a rep for Divine Decadence tells E! News. "She bought two rolling racks full of vintage clothes and accessories. She bought robes, gowns, hats, jewelry. Some of the designer brands she bought were Dior and Balenciaga. She also bought 1920s and 1930s vintage."While the rep reveals that Gaga did scope out the bridal section, it seems that the Mother Monster's shopping trip was more of a vintage shopping excursion rather than wedding dress specific."Lady Gaga is very artistic and yes she bought some white dresses in the bridal section," the owner says. "However, she never mentioned it was for a wedding or anything."Additionally, the singer was not wearing a ring on her outing, during which she visiting two boutiques.
