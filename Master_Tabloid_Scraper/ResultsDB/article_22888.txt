Jake Harris went trawling for trouble, but lucky for him, his net came up mostly empty.The Deadliest Catch crab fisherman was charged Tuesday with reckless driving and driving with a suspended license in connection with his Feb. 18 arrest, which occurred while he was driving his late father's BMW.Cornelia Marie skipper Phil Harris worked the waters off Alaska with his sons, Jake and Josh, until his death on Feb. 9, 11 days after suffering a stroke while unloading his final haul.

Harris, 24, was initially also booked on suspicion of DUI and  hit-and-run, but Seattle prosecutors concluded that there was  insufficient evidence to press the charges.If convicted of the two misdemeanors he is facing, however, Harris  could spend up to 15 months in jail. His next court hearing is March 26.
