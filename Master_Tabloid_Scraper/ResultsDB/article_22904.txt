'Deadliest Catch' Captain -- No More Tubes/nCaptain Phil Harris, the badass star of  "Deadliest Catch, " is making serious progress in his recovery from last week's stroke -- dude is finally breathing on his own. According to a source close to the family, doctors are  "extremely impressed " with Harris' progress. Harris had been using breathing tubes to help circulate oxygen through his body since he went down while unloading crabs from the F /V Cornelia Marie -- but we're told as of Friday, the tubes have all been removed. We're told Harris is also regaining feeling in the left side of his body -- which had gone numb after the stroke. His motor skills are also returning to normal. Perhaps the best sign -- Harris has been talking a lot lately ... even dropping a few of his trademark cuss bombs here and there. We're told Harris and his family have been continuously charting a recovery course with doctors and he hopes to get home ASAP.
