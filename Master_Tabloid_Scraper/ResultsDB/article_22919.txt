As Radar can report, Sheen played Stone’s troubled alter ego PFC Chris Taylor, when he was just 20 years old. While he did not win any awards for his role, co-stars Willem Dafoe and Tom Berenger were nominated for Best Supporting Actor and director Stone took home the Best Director award.
Dillon was also 20 when he starred in the notorious film.

Depp was 22 and very shy. Stone once recalled the moment he first knew he would become a star:
As for then-rising star Depp, who was 22 at the time, Stone knew he was going to be a star: “He was a great looking kid. We got to know each other pretty well in the jungle and I really thought he was going places. He was shy. I think it was before Jump Street.”
