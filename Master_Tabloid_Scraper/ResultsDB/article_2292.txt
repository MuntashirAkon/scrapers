American Horror Story: Cult's opening credits are here! This is not a drill. And there are bees, Donald Trump masks, clowns, Hillary Clinton masks, political figures and lots of blood involved. Even the music invokes politics. Seriously, watch at your own risk. There's a dead dog involved too.Sarah Paulson gets first billing in the AHS: Cult opening. In the series, she plays Ally Mayfair-Richards, wife to Alison Pill's Ivy Mayfair-Richards. The two are married, but there may be another love story in the works.

At TCA, executive producer Alexis Martin Woodall said the 2016 election, which opens the show, is a way for the series to comment "more about what's going on in the world around us...[a] streak of paranoia."The plot, aside from the whole cult with bees and clowns involved, has been guarded. "We've got bloody tension, a well-cooked meal, an exciting trip to a grocery store. I just think it is true to our brand, which is you're going to be in a whole new world all over again and fall in love with these really special characters and hate yourself for watching it right before you go to bed and love yourself in the morning for making it through the night," Martin Woodall said.Find out what else we know below.

American Horror Story: Cult premieres Tuesday, Sept. 5 at 10 p.m. on FX.
