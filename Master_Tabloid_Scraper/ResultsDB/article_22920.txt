Courteney Cox, 53, Ready For Marriage — AND A Baby!/n
Courtney Cox is set to seal her romance with longtime love Johnny McDaid with a wedding — and a BABY! The pair are making ‘I do’ plans, AND consulting a fertility specialist, insiders spilled. “She believes there’s no reason she can’t carry a child to term herself!” a pal dished to Radaronline.com The actress has a 13-year-old daughter, Coco, with ex-hubby David Arquette, and yearns to give her a sibling. Courteney hooked up with Johnny in late 2013, and except for a brief split in 2015, they’ve been together ever since. ‘Courteney is throwing herself into wedding preparations!’ tattled the pal. ‘ The guest list is already over 200!’
