‘Little Women’ Star Christy Defends Raunchy ‘M' Word Tape: Terra Did It, Too!/n
WARNING: EXPLICIT VIDEO CONTENT BELOW
A week after Terra Jole exposed her for starring in a shocking video that featured the “M” word, Christy Gibel revealed she has no apologies for her raunchy old gig.
In a clip from last night’s episode of Little Women: LA, Gibel, 39, defended herself to friend Tonya Banks, who admitted she first showed Jole the tape.
“That was years ago!” the married mom of two said, later adding that many of their mutual little people friends have taken similar jobs. “We’ve all dressed in Oompa Loompa…What you do to feed your family, it’s my business!”
Gibel forgave Banks for resurfacing the video, which featured her dirty dancing and lip-syncing the “M” word. (Many little people deem the term offensive and degrading.)
But she didn’t overlook nemesis Jole’s decision to play the tape with judgment in front of the entire cast at her daughter Penelope’s 2nd birthday party.

“I love how Terra thinks she’s the patron saint of all little people,” Gibel vented to the cameras. “Come on, b***h. You’ve been in m****t bar fights on Jackass, you’ve been in a movie with a m****t on it, you dressed up as an elf, but you think my video was worse than all over that. Come on, Terra, get over yourself!”
RadarOnline.com has uncovered the clip of mother-of-two Jole, 37, starring in a scripted scene called “M****t Bar Fight” from Johnny Knoxville’s 2010 film Jackass 3D.

In the video, Jole tried to separate a group of little people battling over her in a bar brawl.
Catch all the drama on the next episode of Little Women: LA, airing Wednesday, June 7 at 9 pm on Lifetime.
