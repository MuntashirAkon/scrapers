For those who missed it, Vance did an AMAZING job of portraying the late Johnnie Cochran, the spirited lawyer who served on O.J.'s "dream team" and delivered the infamous line "if the glove doesn't fit, you must acquit"!
In the actor's acceptance speech, he gave a short and sweet shoutout to the cast members of the show while also praising his wifeâ€¦ AKA the woman who "rocks" his "chain"! Let's just say Courtney REALLY loves his wifey Angela Bassett!
Obviously, this is a major win for Court considering he beat his costar Cuba Gooding Jr. and fellow nominees Bryan Cranston, Benedict Cumberbatch, Idris Elba, and Tom Hiddleston. Talk about an accomplishment!
P.S. We loved when the star shouted "Obama out! Hillary in!" before walking off stage.
