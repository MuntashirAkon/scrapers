For instance, Tom Hiddleston is apparently celebrating his Emmy nod by being ever so humble and gracious â€” before filming a Thor fight scene with Chris Hemsworth in Australiaâ€¦ but not everyone is that crazy!
In fact, most of the nominees are simply thanking the Academy and fans alike on social media, just like they do every year.
Ch-ch-check out the very best celebrity reactions to the 2016 Emmy nominations (below)!!!

When we finished the incredible journey of creating this groundbreaking project, The People v. OJ Simpson, we all knew weâ€™d created something incredibly wonderful and special together! It was an opportunity of a lifetime to work with such a dream cast and to portray a man like Johnnie Cochran. To receive an Emmy nomination today is the continuation of this phenomenal journey and is indeed a true blessing and honor. I am overjoyed that my wife, my mother, and children are here to enjoy this moment with me. Although the disease ALS has taken my motherâ€™s ability to speak, I see joy and pride written all over her face right now. Being surrounded by my family - at this very moment - means everything to me!A photo posted by Courtney B Vance (@courtneybvance) on Jul 14, 2016 at 9:11am PDT
