Jude Law and Johnnie Walker Team Up to Race Cars and Ooze Class/n
Jude Law. Classic Cars. Free-flowing Drinks. Is this a dream?  
No, it was the scene surrounding the premiere of the second installment of the Gentleman s Wager film series by Johnnie Walker Blue Label, and it’s very real.   
On Saturday, Jude Law, who stars in the short film, joined costar Giancarlo Giannini at a breathtaking villa outside Rome to introduce Gentleman s Wager II.   
The film tells the story of two men (Law and Giannini) who make a wager over a priceless vintage car. Hungry to win, Law’s character races through the beautiful landscapes of Italy and Monaco, suavely handling all the challenges in his path.    
Law, 42, isn’t ignorant to how many would hop into the driver’s seat in his place.   
“I’m thrilled to be in the driving seat for the second Gentleman s Wager film.  Being back on set with Giancarlo and also having the opportunity to work with the talented Zhao [Wei], was an absolute joy,” the Oscar-nominated actor said. “That coupled with being behind the wheel of the Delahaye 135S racing car, driving through the rolling hills of Italy and out to Monaco, well   I consider myself a lucky man!”  
While we can’t give you rolling hills and race cars, we can give you a chance to vicariously live through Law’s character. Check out the film below and see which gentleman wins.
