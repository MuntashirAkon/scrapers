Johnnie B. Litigating: Pianist Sues Chuck Berry/n
Johnnie B. Goode just went bad on Chuck Berry.                     Legendary pianist Johnnie Johnson--the artist immortalized on Berry's classic "Johnny B. Goode"--has filed a federal lawsuit against the rock 'n' roll legend, claiming he cowrote and is entitled to royalties on many of Berry's early hits, including "Roll Over Beethoven," "No Particular Place to Go" and "Rock and Roll Music."                   The suit, filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri, seeks unspecified damages and "all of the profits realized" by Berry and his publishing company, Isalee Music. All told, Johnson claims to have written the music on 52 songs, while Berry wrote the lyrics.                        Johnson also claims Berry "took advantage" of the sideman during his struggle with alcoholism and led him to believe Berry was entitled to sole ownership of the songs. Berry, now 74, copyrighted all the songs for himself.                          Johnson's suit comes just four days before Berry was slated to receive a Kennedy Center Honor from President Clinton.                                     Johnson and Berry's relationship traces all the way back to 1952, when Berry joined with Johnson's Sir John Trio in St. Louis. The group became the house band at the Cosmopolitan Club in East St. Louis, and Johnson's piano style helped shape Berry's guitar-playing. Soon, Johnson realized people were coming to see Berry, and the band was soon renamed the Chuck Berry Trio.                  Johnson's subsequent slight led Rolling Stone Keith Richards to spearhead a hitherto fruitless petition drive to get Johnson into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. A musician isn't eligible for the Rock Hall until 25 years after his/her first credited album.                 "[Johnson] ain't copying Chuck's riffs on piano," Richards once said. "Chuck adapted them to guitar and put those great lyrics behind them. But without somebody to give him those riffs--voila!--no song, just a lot of words on paper."                 With Richards' encouragement, Johnson released a Grammy-nominated solo album titled Blue Hand Johnnie in 1987. Although he won't be eligible for Rock Hall induction as a solo artist until 2012, he may be inducted sooner into the newly created "sideman" category.                        Meanwhile, Berry's camp is questioning the timing of Johnson's legal action.                  "I'm so surprised that a lawsuit could come down 45 years later. I just find it mind-blowing," Berry's booking agent, Dick Alen, tells Billboard. "When I spoke to Chuck, he said, 'I'm just disappointed that Johnnie would do something like this.' "
