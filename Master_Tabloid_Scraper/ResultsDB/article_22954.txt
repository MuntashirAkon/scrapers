Johnny Depp has issued an apology regarding his controversial comments about President Donald Trump.In case you missed it, the actor made an appearance at Glastonbury 2017 during which he asked a sold-out crowd, "Can we bring Trump here? I think he needs help."He continued, "It is just a question—I'm not insinuating anything. By the way, this is going to be in the press. It will be horrible. I like that you're all part of it. But when was the last time an actor assassinated a president?"Now, he's released a statement to E! News, apologizing for the remarks.

"I apologize for the bad joke I attempted last night in poor taste about President Trump," he said. "It did not come out as intended, and I intended no malice. I was only trying to amuse, not to harm anyone."The White House also released a statement regarding Depp's comments, telling CNN, "President [Donald] Trump has condemned violence in all forms and its sad that others like Johnny Depp have not followed his lead. I hope that some of Mr. Depp's colleagues will speak out against this type of rhetoric as strongly as they would if his comments were directed to a democrat elected official."

As we've learned before, threatening the president is a crime under United States law, and therefore the Secret Service also released a statement."For security reasons, we cannot discuss specifically nor in general terms the means and methods of how we perform our protective responsibilities," officials said.
