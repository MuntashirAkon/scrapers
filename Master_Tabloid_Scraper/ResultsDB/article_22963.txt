Shannon Sharpe Warns Joe McKnight Investigators to Avoid Rushing to Judgment/nNFL great Shannon Sharpe is calling for patience and diligence in the Joe McKnight killing -- patience on the part of outraged citizens, and diligence from the cops.Â  The Hall of Famer talked to us about the protests in the wake of Ronald Gasser's release, without charges, after he admittedly shot McKnight 3 times. FS1's 'Undisputed' co-host isn't ready to say this is an open and shut case. In fact, he channeled Johnnie Cochran. Btw, we got Shannon outside a benefit Friday night for Iraq And Afghanistan Veterans of America, held in Pacific Palisades. Good guy, good cause./n
