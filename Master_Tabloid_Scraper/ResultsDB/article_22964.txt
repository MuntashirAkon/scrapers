'Cajun Pawn Stars' -- We Got Illegally Raided ... Cops Jacked Our Sewer Snake/nThe stars of   "Cajun Pawn Stars " are being drummed out of business by cops who are out to get them ... stooping so low as to illegally seize a chain saw and sewer snake ... and now they are gunning for justice in court.Jimmie DeRamus and his wife Peggy claim the Alexandria PD in Louisiana barged into their shop in June, claiming the shop -- which was featured on the History Channel -- was fencing stolen goods. Police tried seizing the saw and the snake but the owners refused to oblige because there was no search warrant.Cops left but came back the very next day -- armed with a warrant -- and took the goods and more. DeRamus claims in a new lawsuit cops ran roughshod in the store, shutting it down and shoeing away customers.  DeRamus says police also roughed up his brother, Johnnie.DeRamus says the raid severely damaged their business and created a false impression the shop was a front for illegal activity, so he and his wife are suing the City and the PD for defamation./n
