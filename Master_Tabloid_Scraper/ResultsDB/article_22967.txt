"Darden recently made the comments while speaking at Pace Law School ... saying,  "I think Johnnie tore the lining. There were some additional tears in the lining so that O.J.'s fingers couldn't go all the way up into the glove. "Holley tells TMZ ... if Darden really did believe his insane theory he FAILED in his legal obligation to raise the issue in court ... adding,  "to bring it up 17 years later when Johnnie Cochran is dead ... it's just, it's unbelievable.
