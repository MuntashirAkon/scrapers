Marcia Clark Calls BS on Robert Shapiro ... He Didn't Try On Glove /nMarcia Clark thinks Robert Shapiro is taking credit for Johnnie Cochran's trial-turning O.J. Simpson glove demo. We got Marcia leaving Fox Studios in NYC Wednesday and asked about Shapiro's claim on Megyn Kelly's special that he's the one who concocted the scheme for O.J. to try on the glove, after putting it on his own hand. Marcia says it was Johnnie's idea. She also takes issue with the notion a key piece of evidence was lying around the courtroom for anyone to try on./n
