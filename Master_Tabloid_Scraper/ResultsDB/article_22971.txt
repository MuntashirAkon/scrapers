Murdoch Assailant Warned Thousands Before Attack/nThe man who attempted to pie Rupert Murdoch in Parliament warned thousands of people before his attack -- posting a cryptic message to his Twitter account just minutes before it went down.While sitting inside Parliament, Jonathan May-Bowles -- aka Jonnie Marbles -- wrote,  "It is a far better thing that I do now than I have ever done before #splat. " (So, in addition to pie terrorism, he's a Dickens fan)And that was just the latest message ... before the final send-off, May-Bowles -- whose Twitter account has nearly 10,000 followers -- repeatedly mocked Murdoch from inside Parliament, writing,  "Rupert Murdoch appears to be going senile #hackgate. "He continued,  "I'm actually in this committee and can confirm: Murdoch is Mr. Burns. "May-Bowles -- who posted the following politically-charged video to his YouTube account last year -- is currently being detained by British police./n
