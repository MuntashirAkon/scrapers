Cochran's Protege is Livid at Kimmel's Devil Joke /nJimmy Kimmel's Emmys joke about Johnnie Cochran has enraged a famous lawyer Johnny mentored. Carl Douglas lashed out at Kimmel, who talked smack on O.J.'s real lawyer after Courtney B. Vance won Best Actor in a Limited Series. Kimmel said,  "I have to believe Johnnie Cochran is smiling up at us tonight. " The idea that Cochran went to hell for repping O.J. was too much for Douglas to bear, saying,  "That was a terribly offensive joke that Jimmy Kimmel made about my mentor and hero Johnnie L. Cochran, Jr. " It's interesting ... in a ceremony that's all about trashing views that are counter to Hollywood, Kimmel went after Cochran, who actually was a major leader in the black community and made a career fighting police brutality./n
