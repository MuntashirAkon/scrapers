O.J. Simpson's Lawyer Blasts Stephen A. Smith ... You're Insane If You Think You Could've Convicted O.J./nStephen A. Smith is DELUSIONAL for claiming he could've done a better job than Marcia Clark at prosecuting O.J. Simpson ... so says O.J.'s former lawyer Carl Douglas.  Douglas -- who was a key member of Johnnie Cochran's legal team -- says he heard Stephen A.'s statements on  "First Take " ... and says,  "It's one of the least intelligent things I've ever heard uttered from his mouth. " Of course, Smith confidently claimed,  "If it was me [prosecuting O.J.], there's no way in hell Johnnie Cochran would have beaten me with the evidence that they had ... I'm not even a lawyer. " Now, Douglas says he loves and respects Smith -- but was adamant,  "I don't think there's any chance in hell that he could ever do anything near as talented as Marcia Clark. " There's a LOT more in the full interview -- airing TONIGHT on the  "TMZ Sports " TV show on FS1 (9:30 PM PT, 12:30 ET). /n
