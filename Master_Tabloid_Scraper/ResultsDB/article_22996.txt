Morgan almost lost his life when a Wal-Mart tractor-trailer crashed into his limousine on the New Jersey turnpike in June 2014. Since then, the actor has undergone extensive physical therapy to regain his ability to stand and walk again.
As Radar previously reported, Morgan admitted that he’s been “up and down” in the year since the crash, even tearing up on the TODAY show as he paid homage to his pal James “Jimmy Mack” McNair, his friend who was killed in the incident.
