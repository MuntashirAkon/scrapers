Also Fucked Up: Donald Trump Is Tweeting About Plowing Over CNN Amid America's White Supremacy Uproar/n

Donald Trump is bulldozing over the dark, evil forces that threaten the safety and freedom of America.
No, not the white supremacist uprising — CNN, obviously!

On Tuesday, the president retweeted, then deleted, a supporter's meme of a "Trump train" plowing into the enemy — a human representation of his archnemesis cable news network.
NBC News reporter Monica Alba shared the image to Twitter, writing: 

WH official tells @kwelkernbc this image RT'd by @realDonaldTrump was "inadvertently posted" and when "noticed it was immediately deleted" pic.twitter.com/rnzEqNR7RP

A White House official told NBC News that the image was "inadvertently posted," unlike the wrestling CNN-smackdown GIF he retweeted last July. That was just too hilarious to pass up!
This latest depiction of violence against the media was shared the day after Trump the Tank Asshole called out the neo-Nazis, KKK, and other white supremacists who took part in the violence that erupted during the deadly Charlottesville rally over the weekend.
But like a look into his subconscious, POTUS's unfiltered Twitter feed once again reveals his true thoughts on the subject!
