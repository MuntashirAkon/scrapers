NBC dropped the first trailer for its Will & Grace revival on Monday (May 15, 2017). Starring Eric McCormack, Debra Messing, Megan Mullally and Sean Hayes, the five-minute teaser features the cast singing about their big return as they revisit the iconic set.
“We’ve come home at last! And this time we will be bigger. And brighter then we knew it. So, watch us fly, we all know we can do it,” they crooner. “Everything is as if we’ve never said goodbye!”
Rumors of a revival started swirling last year when the four actors reunited to star in a 10-minute special election-themed short. When the clip went viral, network execs entered negotiations to bring back the beloved sit-com, which ran for nine season from from 1998 to 2006.
In January, NBC greenlit a limited 12-episode season with the original foursome repairing their respective roles. Series creators Max Mutchnick and David Kohan were named as showrunners, while James Burrows — who directed the show during its initial run — was announced as director for all upcoming episodes.
The Will & Grace revival will premiere on Thursday this fall on NBC.
