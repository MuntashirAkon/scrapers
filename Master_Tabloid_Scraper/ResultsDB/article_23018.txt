Kanye West is bringing his new album to new heights.

The artist is reportedly holed up in a Wyoming retreat at the top of a mountain to find inspiration for his new sounds.
TMZ reports:
We know exactly where he is but hey, we don’t want to ruin his mojo … we like his music, too. But we can tell you he’s been there a week and also went 2 weeks earlier, so he’s smack in the middle of the creative process.
This explains Kanye’s absence from some high-profile Kardashian events, including the Met Gala last week, where Kim went solo.
