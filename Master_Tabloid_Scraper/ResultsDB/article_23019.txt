NBC confirmed the return of the beloved sitcom back in January after mini-episodes about the election were released in the fall.
We’re thrilled that one of the smartest, funniest, and most defining comedies in NBC history is coming back,” NBC Entertainment Chairman Robert Greenblatt said in a statement “This groundbreaking series for everything from gay rights to social and political commentary — all disguised as a high-speed train of witty pop culture — is coming back where it belongs.”
The new “ninth season” of the series is expected to pick up the characters’ storylines a decade after the 2006 finale.
