Rachel Bilson. Stacy Keibler. Carrie Underwood. How many hot girls can one show handle?! At least one more if you ask How I Met Your Mother's resident ladies man, Neil Patrick Harris. "I still want Betty White. How awesome would it be if Barney Stinson was totally macking on Betty White? Come on," teased NPH (who, spoiler alert, I shamelessly flirt with throughout our interviewâ€”can you blame me?)I caught up with the fabulous folks of HIMYM Wednesday night when the show was honored by the Paley Center for Media, and Josh Radnor, Alyson Hannigan, Jason Segel, and Cobie Smulders all answered your burning fan Qs. Are we about to meet the elusive mom? Are Lily and Marshall baby-bound? Will Robin and Barney ever reunite? I'll let these guys give you the answers to these muy-importante questions, and more!
