John Daly -- What Collapsed Lung?! ... Sings Heart Out Days After Medical Scare/nJohn Daly was singing at the top of his lungs last night ... which is miraculous considering one of them had COLLAPSED just a few days ago.  The golf legend grabbed his guitar and hit the stage with Mark Bryan from Hootie & the Blowfish to sing  "Knockin' On Heaven's Door " in Myrtle Beach last night.  Dude sounded GREAT in front of an audience that included former Golf Channel host Win McMurry.  But what makes this video so impressive -- Daly reportedly collapsed and was rushed to a hospital on Saturday during a golf tournament. In fact, one report says the situation was so dire, Daly wasn't breathing for 3 minutes and needed CPR to revive him.  Brings new meaning to the song he was singing last night, doesn't it? /n
