Mack Wilds Drops $35k to Upgrade '95 Chain/nMack Wilds' treasured '95 pendant is looking so shiny and new, 'cause that's what $35k worth of diamonds tend to do. Mack's had the chain for a while -- The Ninety Five Percent is his company -- but he just added the major coat of quality rocks. Nothing but VS-1 and F colored diamonds (that's primo) covering the 14-carat yellow gold emblem. Jewelers David Bling and Will Da Boss did the flashy enhancements. We're told Mack threw down the dough for the new piece because he's had a good year -- 2 TV shows,  "Shots Fired " and  "The Breaks, " and his 2nd album,  "After Hours, " just dropped.Â  His company motto is  "No such thing as 100% in life because if you ain't growing, you dying. " Mack's jewelry collection agrees./n
