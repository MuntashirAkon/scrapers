But Judge Jessica P. Silvers at the Van Nuys Superior Court today found sufficient evidence to proceed to trial.
Sparks, whose full name is Melvin Shane Sparks, is charged with six counts of a lewd act on a child and two counts of oral copulation of a person under 16.
The criminal complaint alleges that the crimes occurred between July 1994 and April 1997.

Last December, Spark’s attorney Steve Meister said his client had been unfairly accused and made reference to the fact that the allegations did not surface until after he became famous.
He is due back in Van Nuys Superior Court for arraignment November 15th.
