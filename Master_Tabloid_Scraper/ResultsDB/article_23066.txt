Bohemian Depp – who was in the Windy City for the premiere of Michael Mann’s gangster flick Public Enemies – visited Gibsons after the red carpet event last Thursday and stayed until 2:30am a restauraunt spokesperson confirmed.
Depp and his entourage spent around $4,400 on food and drink and were served by veteran waiter Mohammed A Sekhani at the famous hot-spot.
Sekhani has been blessed before with huge tips from the likes of 24 star Keifer Sutherland and the legendary Frank Sinatra – but he rates The Pirates Of The Caribbean star as the best of all.
Sekhani told the Chicago Sun Times columnist Stella Foster: “Depp hosted a party for 15 people including Michael Mann and co-star Marion Cotillard and the tip was split 12 ways.
“Depp is the finest of all the stars that I have ever waited on and he is a true icon, and his ability to respect others is phenomenal. He loves Chicago and Chicago loves him – Johnny Depp is one cool dude.”
In Public Enemies, Johnny Depp plays the part of Depression-era bank robber John Dillinger who is tracked by FBI agent Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale) – Oscar winner Cotillard plays the gangster’s girlfriend Billie Frechette. The film was partially shot in Chicago last summer.
Dillinger’s charm and daring jailbreaks made him a favorite with the public despite being on the FBI’s ‘most wanted list’.
Public Enemies premieres Tuesday at Los Angeles Film Festival. It opens July 1.
