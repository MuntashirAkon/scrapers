Toxic Avenger: The Musical/n
It started with Little Shop of Horrors, a camp flick that was turned into an Off-Broadway musical in 1982. Reefer Madness and others followed.
The lastest is The Toxic Avenger, which had a trial run this fall at New Jersey’s George Street Playhouse, and arrives Off-Broadway on March 18 at New World Stages (340 West 50th Street).
The quirky, bloody rock musical is based on the 1985 flick and — according to the producers —  “is set in the mythical town of Tromaville, Exit 13B off the New Jersey Turnpike. An aspiring earth scientist, Melvin Ferd the Third, is determined to clean up the town’s burgeoning toxic waste, until he is tossed into a vat of radioactive goo and emerges as a seven-foot mutant freak and New Jersey’s first superhero. Armed with superhuman strength and a heart as big as Newark, he’s out to save New Jersey, end global warming and woo Sarah, the prettiest, blindest librarian in town.”
Songs are by Joe DiPietro and Bon Jovi’s David Bryan. /n
