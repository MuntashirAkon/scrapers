Destiny's Child Just Created A VERIFIED Instagram Account â€” Is The Group Planning A Reunion?!/n

Our minds can't even comprehend this AMAZING development!
Ten years after Destiny's Child ended its iconic run, fans noticed a VERIFIED Instagram account was recently created in the group's name.
Obviously, the IG account created a firestorm of speculation as to whether or not BeyoncÃ©, Kelly Rowland, and Michelle Williams have any plans to get the trio back together. Let's just say we'd LOVE to see these fierce gals reunite a decade later!

As of now, the account has about 15K followers which is pretty insane when you consider its only been up for about a week and has only posted three pics (all above). The high amount of interest is definitely a good sign for a reunion tour â€” we could totally see the group outselling the Spice Girls if they decide to come back!
Check out some fan reactions to the exciting turn of events (below)!
