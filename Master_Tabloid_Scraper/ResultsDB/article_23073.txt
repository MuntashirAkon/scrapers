American Idol Is Down To Two Finalists â€” See Who Was Sent Packing & Watch The Highlights HERE!/n

We can't believe that American Idol has almost come to an end.
The good news is, before the singing competition show says farewell on Thursday night, there's still one more Idol to be named!
Going into last night's episode, we were left with three incredible performers, Trent Harmon, La'Porsha Renae, and Dalton Rapattoni, but sadly one had to be sent home last night before the finale.

Last night's episode saw the remaining three contestants debut their singles, which they all did a FANTASTIC job with! Trent sang Falling, a soulful power balled, Dalton belted out Strike a Match, a catchy pop-punk song, and LaPorsha belted out her beautiful tune, Battles.
After their performances, it was time to eliminate one of the singers and unfortunately it ended up being  Rapattoni!
Before the young stud left though, he shared his thoughts about his time on the show keeping it short and sweet saying, "it's been amazing."
As for the remaining contestants, they still had some more singing to do as Trent sang both If You Don't Know Me By Now by Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes as well as Chandelier by Sia. La'Porsha ended up performing A House Is Not a Home by Luther Vandross as well as a hauntingly beautiful rendition of Rihanna's Diamonds.
While we'll have to wait for tonight to see who will be named the final American Idol winner, you can check out some of the best performances from last night (below)!
