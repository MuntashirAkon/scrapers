This Week In Celebrity Twitpics/n
It looks like summer vacation is starting early for the stars this year. This week brought the beginning of May, and with that, lots of new Twitpics and Instagram posts to celebrate the sweet smell of a new season.
While it’s technically still business as usual, the stars are starting to spend more and more time out and about, enjoying themselves.
Lea Michele spent her weekend out with her main squeeze on and off-screen, Cory Monteith in his hometown of Vancouver, Canada to cheer on the Vancouver Canucks in the 2013 NHL Playoffs. The Glee actress posted a selfie onto her Twitter to commemorate the occasion. The hockey game was one of the first post-rehab sightings of Montieth (he checked himself in last month on the behest of Michele).

Over in the Big Apple, Joe Jonas posted a picture of himself beaming at Miss Lily’s & Melvin’s Juice Box, a juice bar in Lower Manhattan.  With a three month long world tour coming up in June, it looks like this Jonas Brother is making the most of the little down time he has before his fully-packed summer.
Another singer enjoying their downtime is Katy Perry, who went sightseeing in Washington D.C. after attending the White House Correspondents Dinner a day prior. Perry took a picture in front of the Lincoln Memorial and titled it simply with “Sup.”
