Bubbles The Elephant -- Picks Super Bowl Winner ... Piece-a-Cake!/n / /  This is Bubbles the Elephant. Besides being a massive star (she was in Janet Jackson's  "Together Again " video back in '97), she also has a talent for predicting Super Bowl winners. So, the people at the T.I.G.E.R.S. Preserve in Myrtle Beach, SC decided to put her talents to the test ... on video. Here's how Bubbles works -- she's got two cakes to choose from ... a Pats cake and a Seahawks cake. Whichever she eats -- they will win. The folks in Myrtle Beach also have a SB-predicting tiger -- seems he strongly agrees with Bubbles. /n
