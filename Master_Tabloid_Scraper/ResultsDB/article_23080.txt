‘Dance Crew’ Judge Shane Sparks Steps Into Child Molestation Charges/n
Sounds like Shane Sparks may have made a serious misstep. Or eight. TMZ reports that Sparks—a judge on MTV’s America’s Best Dance Crew and former choreographer So You Think You Can Dance—was arrested this morning and charged with eight felony counts of child molestation.
According to the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s office, the alleged incidents began in 1994 and continued for several years, and all involved a single female victim, identified as “Monique F.” in court documents, who was under 14 years of age at the time of the first alleged offense.
Sparks—full name Melvin Shane Sparks—is accused of oral copulation with the alleged victim, as well as acts “with the intent of arousing, appealing to, and gratifying the lust, passions, and sexual desires of the defendant, who was at least 10 years older than [the victim].” (For those not fluent in legalese, that means he did a bunch of bad, dirty stuff.)
Sparks, who was arrested at his North Hollywood home, is currently being held on $590,000 bail.
Sparks isn’t the only person associated with SYTYCD to be charges with unseemly sex crimes recently; earlier this year, choreographer Alex Da Silva was arrested on eight felony counts, including forcible rape, involving four of his dance students.
A disturbing trend. However, it does open up the possibility for an exciting new reality show, So You Think You Can Catch a Predator, with a judging panel headed up by Chris Hansen.
