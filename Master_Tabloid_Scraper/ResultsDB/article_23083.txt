Johnny Depp is going gangster, y’all! 
The international trailer for Depp’s upcoming flick Public Enemies has been released, depicting the Edward Scissorhands actor in all his bank-robbing, shoot-‘em-up glory.
In the movie, based on the book Public Enemies: America’s Greatest Crime Wave and the birth of the FBI, Depp plays 19030s era gangster John Dillinger. Depp is hounded by Christian Bale, who plays G-man Melvin Pervis.
Joining Depp on his crime spree are Marion Cotillard, who plays his moll Billie Frenchette, Channing Tatum as Pretty Boy Floyd and Giovanni Ribisi as Ma Barker henchman Alvin Karpis.
Billy Crudup fills the role of FBI head J. Edgar Hoover. No word on whether there’ll be any cross-dressing involved.
The Michael Mann-directed movie hits theaters like a gang of thieves on July 1. Check out the trailer below:
