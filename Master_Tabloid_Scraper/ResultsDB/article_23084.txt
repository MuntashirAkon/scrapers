Johnny Depp: Public Enemy #1/n
The poster for the upcoming Michael Mann (Heat, The Insider) film Public Enemies has been revealed, and Johnny Depp is looking formidable while wielding a tommy gun. Stick ‘em up!
Depp portrays 1930s gangster and trail-of-terror bank robber John Dillinger in the film, which is based on the book Public Enemies: America’s Greatest Crime Wave and the Birth of the FBI, 1933–34 by Bryan Burroughs. 
Rageaholic Christian Bale plays Dillinger’s chief nemesis, G-man Melvin Pervis.
The film also stars Oscar-winning French actress Marion Cotillard as Dillinger’s moll ,Billie Frechette, Channing Tatum as Pretty Boy Floyd, Giovanni Ribisi as Ma Barker gang member Alvin Karpis, and Billy Crudup as FBI head J. Edgar Hoover.
Depp’s character looks like he knows his way around a machine gun and how to hop on the running board of a classic Studebaker during a getaway.
But if Bale brings the intensity to his role as he does to chewing crew members out, Depp may have met his match.
