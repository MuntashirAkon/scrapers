Craig Melvin and Lindsay Czarniak Welcome Daughter Sybil ‘Sibby’ Ann/n
Congratulations are in order for Lindsay Czarniak and Craig Melvin — they’re parents for a second time!
The SportsCenter anchor gave birth to daughter Sybil “Sibby” Ann Melvin at 12:20 p.m. on Saturday, Nov. 5, PEOPLE confirms exclusively.
“Sibby is 6 lbs., 6 oz., 20 inches long, and the telegenic couple is already in love with her!” a rep for the duo tells PEOPLE.
Melvin, a MSNBC Live anchor and co-anchor of Today‘s Saturday edition, and the couple’s 2½-year-old brother Delano, aka “Del,” wasted no time in joining the ladies for their first family photo as a foursome.

Delano actually had a hand in naming his sister. The couple came up with “Sibby,” short for sibling, as a nickname for Delano to call the new family member while Czarniak was pregnant. However, the couple ended up “falling in love with the name,” and it stuck.
The couple, who were married in 2011, previously told PEOPLE Del has “warmed up to” the idea of having a younger sibling, but that it didn’t start out quite that way.
“For a while, we would point to Mommy’s belly and he would say, ‘No baby, no baby, no baby,’ ” Melvin shares. “Now it’s, ‘Aw, baby.’ ”
He continues, “I think he’s okay with the concept. It remains to be seen once the child shows up whether he tries to send it back.”
“I don’t think he gets it’s forever, but I think he’ll be pretty good,” says Czarniak.
