Melvin Williams, Former Drug Kingpin and The Wire Actor, Dies at 73/n
Melvin Williams, a former drug kingpin who helped inspire The Wire, died Thursday in Baltimore, the The Baltimore Sun reports. He was 73.  
Nicknamed “Little Melvin,” Williams once was a powerful force in the Baltimore drug trade in the 1970s and 1980s before he served years in a federal prison and turned away from crime. His life inspired The Wire creator David Simon, who penned a five-part Baltimore Sun profile of the former drug trafficker in 1987. He is thought to have inspired the character Avon Barksdale, played by Wood Harris on the show.    
Williams was released from prison in 1996, and had a small role on The Wire as The Deacon from 2004-2008.   
Simon tweeted his remembrance of Williams following the news of his death.    
“RIP to Melvin ‘Little Melvin’ Williams, 73, who made me begin to rethink the drug war. You ended it free, brother,” Simon tweeted alongside a picture of Williams on The Wire.
