Chargers' Melvin Ingram: My Pregame Playlist? Melvin Ingram!/nHow does Chargers star Melvin Ingram get in beast mode before games? By bumpin'  "SupaMel " ... AKA Melvin Ingram﻿!! We got the stud DE (and emcee) heading into a listening party in L.A. for his new mixtape  "Reap What You Sow " with Bizzy Crook ... and asked Melvin if his own tracks make his pregame playlist. His response? HELL YEAH ... cause he spits  "real rap " unlike other pro athletes that get on the mic. Ingram told us all his tracks are fire ... but he did pick a favorite for getting pumped. Dude's repped by Jay-Z's Roc Nation Sports -- so don't sleep on SupaMel./n
