Animal Planet Star -- Attempted Murderer/nThe star of the Animal Planet show  "Pit Boss " knows what it's like to be treated like an animal: Dude spent 10 years behind bars for attempted murder -- and TMZ has obtained his mug shot. Before he started rescuing dogs, Shorty Rossi -- who went by the name Melvin Rossi -- was sentenced to 20 years in California State Prison for participating in a gang-related shooting in Los Angeles back in 1988. Rossi -- who was a member of the Bloods street gang -- began his prison stint in 1989, but was released after 10 years. Rossi has talked openly about his prison experience before -- but prides himself on turning his life around. How's that for street cred?/n
