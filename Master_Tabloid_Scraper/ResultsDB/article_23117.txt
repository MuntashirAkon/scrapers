NFL's Von Miller -- Let's Talk Farts and Chicken /nSome life updates from Denver Broncos stud linebacker Von Miller ... apparently, he's got a new celebrity partner on his chicken farm ... and he's finally addressing his team's fart tax.  It all went down outside Hooray Henry's nightclub in West Hollywood -- where Miller had been partying with his pal (and fellow NFL linebacker) Melvin Ingram.  Seems Ingram has gotten in on Miller's legendary chicken farm in Texas (yes, he really has a chicken farm) ... though, the dudes appear kinda hammered, so they may have just been messin' around.  As for the fart tax ... there have been reports the Broncos fine players for tearing ass during meetings. So, we asked Miller about it. We'll take our Pulitzer now. /n
