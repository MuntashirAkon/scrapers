Cuba Gooding Sr. -- I Owe My Career to Don Cornelius/nDon Cornelius isn't getting the credit he deserves for  "creating " the biggest music stars of the 70s -- at least according to Cuba Gooding Senior ... who got his big break on  "Soul Train.

By the way, Cuba still has serious pipes (check the clip) ... and says,  "What Don Cornelius decided to do was put us all on television. Regional at first, then local. Then the entire planet! "Cornelius was found dead in his home on February 1 of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound./n
