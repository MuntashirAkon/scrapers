Rats! G-Force Trumps Harry Potter, Wins Weekend Box Office/n
It wasn’t Harry Potter who cast a spell on movie goers this weekend, but rather, much to everyone’s surprise, it was an elite group of crime fighting (and talking) guinea pigs!
Disney’s latest 3D offering, G-Force, drew more than $32 million in its debut weekend at the box office this weekend, knocking Harry Potter And The Half Blood Prince ($30 million) out of the top spot.
Also surprising — Harry Potter’s second week take was 60% less than its opening weekend.
Rounding out the top five were: Sony’s The Ugly Truth in third place with $27 million; horror flick Orphan took fourth place with $12 million and Ice Age: Dawn Of The Dinosaurs finished fifth, in its fourth week out, with $8 million.
G-Force’s opening, according to newsinfilm.com, finished third all-time in opening weekend for films in the live-action talking animal genre. Only 101 Dalmatians ($33.5 million) and Alvin and the Chipmunks ($44.3 million) have had bigger openings. /n
