Chris Daughtry Album, Tour Coming Soon/n
Leave This Town, the latest offering from American Idol alum Chris Daughtry, the fourth-place finalist from the show’s 2006 season, will hit stores next month.
The album release will be accompanied by a 115-show North America tour, which begins this summer.
The North Carolina native, known for his gravely wail, said he recently got a reality check regarding his fame — in the form of an Alvin and the Chipmunks cover of his song, Feels Like Tonight — while taking his children to see the film.
“Whoa! Whoa! This chipmunk is over singing my song,” Daughtry told Billboard. “I didn’t even know what it was until the chorus.”
