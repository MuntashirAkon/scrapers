Eric Brevig is taking a trip to Jellystone Park. The special effects pro — who most recently handled the visuals on Journey to the Center of the Earth in 3-D — will direct the big screen adaptation of the old cartoon series Yogi Bear.

Like Alvin and the Chipmunks, the flick will combine computer-animated characters with actors in real settings. No word on who will play their nemesis, Ranger Smith. /n
