Matt Damon's Lil Sis: Nearly Topless!/n
     
Sarah Bradford, Matty boy’s little sister, walked the catwalk in Alvin Valley‘s show on Thursday at New York Fashion Week, but after the show– her tops went missing!
According to a source on the scene, “She couldn’t find the two shirts she had brought to change into after the show…they went missing.”
Later, her tops were recovered. Turns out another model had taken them in her bag, but did return them.  No one saw the model topless, but she did a fantastic job strutting her stuff!  Just chalk it up to model behavior. /n
