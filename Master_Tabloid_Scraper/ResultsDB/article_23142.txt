Earl Out, Chuck In/n
     
Zachary Levi, aka “Chuck” in the NBC dramedy series, will be starring in “Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel.” 
He will be playing the cousin of Dave Seville, the character played in the 2007 film by Jason Lee — aka Earl on NBC’s “My Name is Earl.” 
Betty Thomas is directing the sequel to the original film, which took in nearly a quarter-billion dollars in North America alone.  
Justin Long, Matthew Gray Gubler and Jesse McCartney again will provide the voices for the CGI-animated Alvin, Simon, and Theodore, respectively. As RadarOnline.com reported back in December, the sequel will introduce the chipmunks female rivals, the Chipettes. /n
