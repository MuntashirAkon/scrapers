Tom and Jerry Return!/n
Vintage cartoon cat-and-mouse Tom and Jerry are about to return to the big screen where they began their career in 1940.
Like Alvin and the Chipmunks, the characters will be created with CG effects rather than traditional animation. They will be combined with real settings and actors.
Though the trademark chases will be a part of the film, the emphasis will be on how the characters first met.
A similar effort to bring the characters back as cartoons in live-action settings was attempted in 1980, when they were set to host the big-screen documentary Thatâ€™s Special Effects, which would have featured the pair running through classic movie scenes from 2001: A Space Odyssey, Gone With the Wind, and other films. /n
