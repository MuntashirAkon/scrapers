This Is NOT the Last Photo of Anna Nicole/nTMZ can confirm that this photo of Anna Nicole Smith, sprawled out face-down on the floor next to a spilled pitcher of ice water, with spectators standing around her body, is not the last photo taken of the pop icon before her untimely death on Thursday. The distressing pic circulated over the Internet yesterday, with reports claiming it was snapped at the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel, just prior to her death. In truth, the photo was taken in June, 2005 at a Myrtle Beach nightclub, where Anna was a judge in a wet T-shirt contest. Sad nonetheless./n
