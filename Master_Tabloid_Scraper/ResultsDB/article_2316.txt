'Welcome to Myrtle Manor' -- More Cast Members Arrested /n "Welcome to Myrtle Manor " -- a reality show on TLC about a bunch of Southerners living in a trailer park -- might be setting a brand new record ... not for stellar ratings, but for the amount of cast members getting arrested in one weekend. Arrest #1: 28-year-old Taylor Jonathan Burt was popped by cops Saturday night after a teenage girl (under 16) told the Myrtle Beach PD she and Burt engaged in sexual relations, according to a local report. Arrest #2: Lindsay Brooke Colbert was arrested Sunday AM on suspicion of DUI. Cops say they pulled Lindsay over for speeding, but when they approached her ride, not only did she reek of alcohol ... there was an open bottle of rum near the driver's seat, according to local reports. The 21-year-old was given a field sobriety test -- which she bombed -- and then reportedly accused the cops of picking on her because she's on TV. Police say LBC blew a B.A.C of .15 ... almost twice the legal limit in South Carolina. As TMZ previously reported ... Taylor and Lindsay weren't the only  "Myrtle " members arrested this week ... Amanda Lee Adams was popped on suspicion of DUI Friday ... after she allegedly got drunk as a skunk and crashed into an electric pole. Maybe this show is more interesting than we thought./n
