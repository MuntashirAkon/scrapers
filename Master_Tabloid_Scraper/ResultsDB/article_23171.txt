There’s no question about it: Paris Jackson is having the best year ever. The daughter of Michael Jackson and Debbie Rowe made her red carpet debut this January, signed with IMG Models in March and just landed her very first movie role starring alongside Charlize Theron, David Oyelowo and Amanda Seyfried. And as if all that’s not impressive enough, it’s rumored that she may have just signed a very big contract with Calvin Klein. (Oh, and did we mention she’s 19 years old?)
According to Page Six, the star reportedly signed a seven-figure deal with Calvin Klein. A source told the website, “This deal is to make Paris the new face and body of Calvin Klein. The deal — which is just about to be signed — is huge, worth seven figures, many millions. Expect to see Paris in huge ad campaigns and on many red carpets in Calvin Klein.”

Earlier this week, we did see Paris repping the brand on the red carpet making her Met Gala debut as a guest of Calvin Klein and designer Raf Simons. She wore a black tea-length dress with a midriff cutout by Calvin Klein by Appointment. Her stylist Karla Welch told PeopleStyle it was “a very different and modern look for Paris. This is a Raf look all the way.”

Also suggesting the reports are most likely true, is the fact that we recently saw her hanging out with other high-profile Calvin Klein models, wearing Calvin Klein! Paris was spotted hanging out with Stranger Things star Millie Bobby Brown, who introduced the brand’s new made-to-measure service, By Appointment. During their L.A. hangout Paris was spotted wearing dark jeans, a navy cardigan and a Clavin Klein logo-printed sports bra.
