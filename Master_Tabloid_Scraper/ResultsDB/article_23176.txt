Earl Gets Chipper with Alvin/n
His name was Earl. Now it's Dave.Jason Lee has signed on to star, sans handlebar mustache, in the combination CGI and live-action movie adaptation of Alvin and the Chipmunks.Lee will star as Dave Seville, the human caretaker of the titular trio of singing rodents, studio 20th Century Fox confirmed Thursday.The film, produced jointly by Fox Animation and Fox 2000, will mark mark the first big-screen foray for the harmonizing Alvin, Simon and Theodore, who made their Saturday morning TV debut in the 1950s. While the original series lasted just one season, the concept of cartoon singing rodents proved too much for Hollywood to stop and the Chipmunks were later revived for a much longer run in the 1980s.While Fox reps declined to reveal any plot points for the feature romp, it's unlikely to diverge much from the basic premise of the eight seasons of the animated series, specials like The Chipmunks Meet Frankenstein and A Chipmunk Christmas, and dozens of best-selling novelty albums: Dave serves as surrogate dad and put-upon manager of the precocious helium-voiced singing chipmunk siblings—made all the more difficult by Alvin's propensity for trouble making.The movie is set to be directed by Tim Hill, who has the dubious credit of both cowriting and directing the CGI/live-action opus Garfield: A Tale of Two Kitties.Ross Bagdasarian Jr.'s Bagdasarian Productions will coproduce the flick. Bagdasarian's father not only masterminded the Alvin and the Chipmunks concept, but voiced the character of Dave in the 1950s cartoon and on the early kiddie records. He also coopted "David Seville" as a stage name.Production on the flick kicks off Mar. 28. Alvin and the Chipmunks is due out Dec. 14.Lee has valuable experience in converting TV 'toons into big-screen properties, having recently completed a movie version of Underdog, due out Aug. 3. In the live-action film, Lee voices the titular canine superhero.
