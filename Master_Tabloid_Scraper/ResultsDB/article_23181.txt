It's National Middle Child Day! Let's celebrate together by looking back on all of our favorite middle siblings in pop culture. Whether it's Stephanie Tanner, Cory Matthews or even Simon from Alvin and the Chipmunks, the life of the middle child can be rough. While they're often portrayed as forgotten or unloved, we noticed that the siblings on this list had some pretty great characteristics as well. Most of them are logical, intelligent, and often the leader of their family and friends. That being said, don't forget to call up the middle sibling in your life and tell them how much you appreciate them.Â
