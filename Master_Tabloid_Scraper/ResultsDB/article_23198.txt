'Idol' Contestants -- No Shtupping the Judges/nTMZ obtained a copy of the contract every  "American Idol " contestant must sign before going on the show -- and one thing is perfectly clear .... Ryan, Randy, Ellen, Kara, Simon, Theodore and Alvin are not available for their pleasure.According to the legal doc -- a copy of which was filed in court because a contestant was a minor -- the contestants promise the following:   "Neither I nor any members of my family or my friends will enter into any personal, social, business, and or financial relationships with any of the judges, host(s), guest stars ... "  The prohibition runs for the duration of the show and 6 months thereafter.But the way we see it ... there's no way the contract can bind family or friends.  Nonetheless, it's a good threat, because according to the doc, a contestant will be disqualified for violating the rule and forfeit any prize money.And in the money department ... here's the way it breaks down.The winner gets $175,000 when he /she starts recording ... and another $175,000 when that person   "delivers " the first album. If the winner gets a second album, he /she gets anywhere between $275,000 and $550,000 depending on the success of the album.  As for a third album -- anywhere between $325,000 and 650,000.  As for a forth -- anywhere between $375,000 - $750,000.  As for a fifth -- $450,000 - $900,000.  And a six album gets the winner between $500,000 and a cool $1 mil.The second place finisher gets $150,000 when he /she starts recording their first album ... and another $150,000 upon delivery. The second album gets the runner-up between $225,000 and $450,000 and so on.As for 3rd through 12th place -- if the label signs them -- they each get $100,000 when he /she begins recording album #1 and another $100,000 upon delivery ... though most of them end up playing hot air balloon festivals.And get this ... according to the contract,  "A.I. " isn't required to pay incidental expenses during the show.  Contestants even have to pay for their own transportation when they're not traveling to and from the show./n
