Hillary Clinton Faces 'Criminal Investigation,' White House Admits/n
The White House has officially admitted that the FBI is conducting a “criminal investigation” against Hillary Clinton, RadarOnline.com has learned.
The presumptive democratic nominee has vehemently denied that the Justice Department’s probe into her private email server is anything more than a “security inquiry” and said that indictment was unlikely.
But less than an hour after Barack Obama announced his endorsement for Clinton, the president’s spokesperson, Josh Earnest, said that the FBI probe was a “criminal investigation” and that responsibility lay in the hands of the FBI and the prosecutors — and not Obama.

“That’s what their responsibility is,” Earnest said. “And that’s why the president, when discussing this issue in each stage, has reiterated his commitment to this principle that any criminal investigation should be conducted independent of any sort of political interference.”
Republicans couldn’t be happier about Earnest’s admission, as Republican National Committee spokesman Michael Short said that the new phrasing of the investigation from the White House as a “criminal” matter “shreds her dishonest claim that it is a routine ‘security inquiry.'”

Short went on to say that “this is another reminder of her reckless conduct as Obama’s secretary of state, where her attempt to skirt government transparency laws exposed highly classified information and put our national security at risk.”
On Wednesday, Clinton reiterated that there is “absolutely” no chance of her being indicted for her ongoing email scandal or questionable Clinton Foundation records.
