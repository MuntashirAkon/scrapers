 Team Kelly! 'Live' Staff 'Not Talking To Michael' Following Strahan's Sudden Departure.../n
Ouch! Live! staff members are ignoring Michael Strahan following Kelly Ripa‘s return to the ABC morning show, RadarOnline.com can exclusively report.
“No one is talking to Michael,” a show insider told Radar this morning about the bubbly blonde’s co-host, who abruptly quit the show last Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the crew is celebrating the 45-year-old show vet.
“Everyone cheered when Kelly walked in this morning,” the source revealed. “They are even throwing her a party after the show today.”

As Radar extensively reported, Ripa was furious when Strahan, 44, announced his plans to leave Live after four years without informing her first.
“Kelly sees this as the ultimate betrayal,” sources told Page Six.
She took a week off from work as a boycott.
However, Ripa was back in her seat this morning, and promptly addressed her lengthy, dramatic absence.
“I needed a couple of days off. After 26 years with this company, I earned the right,” the former soap star told the audience.
Strahan declared his love for his co-host, and called her “the queen of morning TV.”

But, there’s still tension between the pair. Ripa and Strahan “didn’t speak” during commercial breaks, sources told Radar.
And the entire warm exchange was far from earnest.
“It was all carefully scripted and choreographed,” the source continued. Everything was rehearsed from what they would say to how they would enter and communicate with each other.” /n
