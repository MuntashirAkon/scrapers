 Reality Bites! Bureau Of Prisons Threatens Teresa Giudice With Filming Ban -- Will She.../n
Teresa Giudice’s plan for a big return to The Real Housewives of New Jersey just hit a snag: RadarOnline.com has learned that the Bureau of Prisons may not allow her to film for several months after her release!
As Radar reported, Bravo had already delayed the show because of Teresa’s prison sentence, with plans to start taping in earnest around her December release.
But now, an insider tells Radar, “It looks like Teresa might not be able to film while she is under house arrest. The Bureau of Prison’s has to sign off on it, and no decision has been made.”
Since Teresa will be on house arrest for two months, that means filming might not happen until February 2016!

“Bravo had hoped to film Teresa and Joe‘s final days  together before he begins serving his four year prison sentence beginning in March,” the insider explained. “The entire show revolves around Teresa, so the network has no other choice but to wait.”
But fans won’t have to wait  to hear from Teresa because her memoir, Turning the Tables: From Housewife to Inmate and Back Again, will be released on February 9.
Meanwhile, her sister-in-law, Melissa Gorga, has done some preliminary filming.
