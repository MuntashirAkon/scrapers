These 'Freelance Journalist' Bros Asking Their City Council To Build A Statue Of Paul Walker Will Give You Hope — Even Though It Was All A Prank!/n

The city of San Clemente needs a hero to look up to in these dark and gnarly times, and two surfer bros have the perfect solution: erect a giant statue of Paul Walker in the middle of the coastal California town.
Last week, two unassuming bros petitioned the San Clemente City Council to construct a 12-foot-tall steel statue of the late actor, making him the official icon of the town.
Speaking to the council, the impassioned dudes said the Walker statue could be "a beacon of headlights that can guide us down the poldusty road" in an otherwise "bummer year."
The speeches from a guy named Chad Kroeger and his pal Bodhi are caked with plenty of references to the Fast & Furious franchise — and even nods to more obscure Walker titles like Meet The Deedles and Eight Below.

Though it all comes crumbling down when the council asks if the actor has any ties to the town of San Clemente. (He does not, but his cousin went to high school there!)
If these two earnest surfer bros fighting to erect a statue of their bro-y icon seems too good to be true — it's because it is.
The fact that the first speaker's name is the lead singer from Nickelback tipped off some viewers that this stunt is actually  the work of comedians Tom Allen and Spencer Kalendar — who we genuinely hope are just as Walker-obsessed as their council alter egos.
Still, the clip is pretty hilarious — and really makes us hope that one day we can visit San Clemente to find a handsome, ripped statue of Paul Walker.
