Donald Trump Will NOT Try To Prosecute Hillary Clinton Over Emails! Watch His First Public Address Since Election Night!/n

President-elect Donald Trump LOVES keeping citizens in suspense for just how he will make America great again.
And after spending the past week having auditions meetings with friends and enemies alike to fill his administration, the politician finally addressed the people and outlined the core principle of his presidency.
In a video message on YouTube (with comments disabled of course) recorded from Trump Tower, the POTUS-to-be laid out executive actions he wants to take starting on his first day in office — and thankfully, his actual plans are a bit different than the crazy proposals he made on the campaign trail.

The biggest switch up was revealed by Trump's aides, who confirmed that contrary to his campaign pledge, he will not authorize a special prosecutor to investigate election rival Hillary Clinton!
Advisor Kellyanne Conway told MSNBC the President-elect even hopes Congress drops further investigations of Clinton, explaining on Morning Joe: 

"I think when the President-elect, who's also the head of your party, tells you before he's even inaugurated that he doesn't wish to pursue these charges, it sends a very strong message, tone, and content to the members."
It also sends a strong message to supporters that he was full of sh*t… but we're certainly not complaining!
Aside from giving Clinton a pass, Trump also plans on scrapping regulations on energy production, withdrawing from trade agreements, and "investigating all abuses of visa programs."
