Here's What Barack Obama Said To Sasha & Malia About Donald Trump Being Elected President!/n

President Obama had the tough task of addressing the nation after Donald Trump's shocking election win.
But after trying to lift the spirit of the American public, POTUS had two other important people he needed to encourage: his daughters, Malia and Sasha.

After a hard season of campaigning for Hillary Clinton's presidency with feminism-inspired efforts proved to be futile, the father-of-two sat down with his teenage girls to explain that progress isn't always in a straight path.
In an interview with The New Yorker, he said: 

"What I say to [my daughters] is that people are complicated. Societies and cultures are complicated… This is not mathematics; this is biology and chemistry. These are living organisms and it's messy. And your job as a citizen and as a decent human being is to constantly affirm and lift up and fight for treating people with kindness and respect and understanding."
Obama reminded his daughters to not treat setbacks like the end of the world, even when they encounter "flare-ups of bigotry." He continued:

"You should anticipate that at any given moment there's going to be flare-ups of bigotry that you may have to confront, or may be inside you and you have to vanquish. And it doesn't stop … You don't get into a fetal position about it. You don't start worrying about the apocalypse. You say, OK, where are the places where I can push to keep it moving forward."
Strong fatherly advice from America's favorite father figure!
Boy, are we gonna miss this man when the apocalypse happens Trump takes office in January.
