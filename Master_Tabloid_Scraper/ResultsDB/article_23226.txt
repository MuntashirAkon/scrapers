Donald Trump Reportedly 'Seemed Surprised' By How Much Work The President Has To Do — Will Barack Obama Have To Help Out?/n

Color us shocked…
President-elect Donald Trump is just about the stupidest sounding honorific in the history of history, but he really proved how out of his depth he truly is on Thursday.
As you're probably already aware, the outcome of the 2016 Presidential Election sunk in for good last week when the racist Republican met with President Barack Obama at the White House for the first time since beating Hillary Clinton.

However, while we're hearing things actually went well between the incumbent and his successor, things don't seem particularly positive moving forward.
That's because according to a report by the The Wall Street Journal out Sunday, Team Trump "seemed surprised" by just how much work the leader of the free world actually does in a day.
Sure, the former Celebrity Apprentice host played President by selecting RNC Chair Reince Priebus as his Chief of Staff and Breitbart News' Steve Bannon as his chief strategist over the weekend… but Donald apparently didn't know his camp also had to hire help for the rest of the West Wing!

That's right. They thought it came completely staffed… Like staying at a hotel…
Of course, this will all be Barack Obama's problem in the long run since he's now the one responsible for teaching Trump the very basics — let alone all the important stuff!
According to the report, Obama will likely be required to give Trump more guidance than any former President in history!
Do U think Donald Trump is in over his head??
