Prince Harry Supports Ex-Girlfriend Cressida Bonas in Her Latest Play/n
Prince Harry showed his support for ex-girlfriend Cressida Bonas on Wednesday night when he attended the opening night of her latest theatre performance in London.  
Sitting in the audience with a friend, Harry, 30, watched Bonas, 26, perform the lead female role of Cecily Cardew in Oscar Wilde s The Importance of Being Earnest.  
“Harry was clearly there to support Cressy and seemed to want to talk to her afterwards,” a source told The Sun newspaper, adding, “He left, then came back inside for a bit, but eventually left alone.”  
The play, which opened on Wednesday night, was held at the London Oratory school in the Fulham neighborhood. The three-night project is raising money for the charity Action on Addiction, which counts Harry s sister-in-law Princess Kate as a patron.  
It’s not the first time that the exes, who dated for two years before splitting last April, have been linked post-break-up. In September, Bonas attended the concert finale of Harry’s brainchild, the Invictus Games, and a few days later they went on a cinema date together.  
Bonas was also spotted walking hand-in-hand with another Harry – her ex Harry Wentworth-Stanley back in February, on Valentine’s Day, no less. The couple dated when they were studying at Leeds University together and have also kept in touch.  
While the friendly exes continue to keep everyone guessing, Bonas will finish her latest acting role on Friday. She is no doubt eagerly awaiting the release of her first film, Tulip Fever, in which she has a small role and stars alongside Cara Delevingne and Unbroken‘s Jack O’Connell.  
Meanwhile, Prince Harry is headed for Australia where he will work with the Australian Defense Force, before officially leaving the army.
