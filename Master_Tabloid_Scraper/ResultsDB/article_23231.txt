Picks and Pans Review: The Importance of Being Earnest/n
Rupert Everett, Reese Witherspoon, Judi Dench
Oscar Wilde’s 1895 comedy unfolds in a world in which the oxygen has been pumped out and a lighter, dizzying element pumped in. The plot—something to do with two Victorian playboys, a terrifying pillar of society named Lady Bracknell and a baby in a handbag—is close to Dada, and the dialogue pings back and forth in a volley of arch, nonsensical epigrams. (“All women become like their mothers. That is their tragedy. No man does. That’s his.”) It’s brittle fluff. Not something Oliver Stone would want to get his mitts on.
Instead Earnest has been adapted and directed by another Oliver, surname Parker, who does plenty of rough damage on his own. Parker jollies things up, doling out the play’s action into a number of randy period settings, including a gambling club—and a tattoo parlor! Even with a cast as sharp as Everett as ne’er-do-well Algernon Moncrieff, Witherspoon as moony young Cecily Cardew and Dench as Lady Bracknell, the performances blur in the hurly-burly. (PG)
Bottom Line: Misguided walk on the Wilde side
