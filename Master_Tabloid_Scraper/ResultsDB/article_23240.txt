A seasoned vet just made her way to the briefing podium in the White House press room, much to the delight of The West Wing fans everywhere.That's right—Allison Janney briefly filled in for White House press secretary Josh Earnest on Friday, April 29 as her former character C.J. Cregg, armed with jokes that ardent fans of the beloved NBC political drama will certainly remember, including talk of root canals and a promise to perform The Jackal in her office at half-past five. (And if you haven't seen the season one episode when Janney performed The Jackal, fix your life right now.)But when Earnest returned in mock-surprise and offered Janney to say one last thing before getting the boot, she made the real reason for her visit clear.

During today's White House Champions for Change event, Janney and Lorre, along with Mom guest star Emily Osment, will participate in a panel discussion with Surgeon General Vivek Murthy about the portrayal of addiction and recovery in the media.And for those whose West Wing love is reignited by seeing Janney's C.J. back behind that podium, select members of the cast, along with creator Aaron Sorkin and executive producer Thomas Schlamme, will be reuniting during the ATX Television Festival in Austin this June. (Sadly, Janney isn't among those set to participate as of press time.)To get your full C.J. Cregg fix, be sure to press play on the video above.Mom airs Thursdays at 9 p.m. on CBS.
