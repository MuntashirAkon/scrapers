Zac Efron's body should have received top billing for Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising.Even though the actor wasn't at the movie's Hollywood premiere earlier this week because he was stuck on set shooting Baywatch, he was certainly there in spirit."He keeps upping his ante," co-star Seth Rogen said. "Right when you think he can't get any sexier he finds a few more abs in there somewhere. I don't know where he's keeping them."While Efron had a banging bod in the first Neighbors flick, he stepped up his game for the sequel."You know, sometimes you just have to step back and appreciate gold," Dave Franco said of seeing Efron's bod again.

Chloe Grace Moretz was way more into his personality. "Honestly, I could care less about the male anatomy because I have four brothers," she said. "He is genuinely one of the nicest guys you'll ever meet and he's so earnest."In one of the movie's most memorable scenes, Rose Byrne gets to help rub grease from a chunk of barbequed meat all over Efron's body. "That was funny but that was also disgusting," Byrne said. "That piece of meat had been injected with baby oil. It's oily and it had really been seasoned with all this stuff...I couldn't get it off my hands. It was in my hair."But, Byrne boasted, "I got to do what a lot of men and women would love to do."Amen to that.Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising is in theaters tomorrow, May 20.(E! Online and Universal Pictures are both part of the NBCUniversal family.)
