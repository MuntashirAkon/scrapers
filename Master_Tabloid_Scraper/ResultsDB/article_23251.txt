Bill Maher Apologizes for N-Word ... 'Comedians are a Special Kind of Monkey!' (VIDEO)/nBill Maher gave an earnest apology for his joke last week -- that he was a  "house n***** " -- but at one point he may have chosen the wrong word to explain himself. Bill was back live on  "Real Time with Bill Maher " Friday night where he had a hard talk with Michael Eric Dyson about the use of the word.  Dyson said Bill's not a racist ... it's just another example of  "white privilege. " Maher repeatedly expressed regret, saying it was an off-the-cuff comment. That's when Bill explained his craft and what may have been behind him using the  n-word ...  "Comedians are a special kind of monkey. "   You gotta see the reactions. Bill also tried to reassure Kathy Griffin ... Self-projections of demise were greatly exaggerated.  But really, @BillMaher has got to go. There are no explanations that make this acceptable. pic.twitter.com /K5XlEjekQ9 — deray mckesson (@deray) June 3, 2017/n
