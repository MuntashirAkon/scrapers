And like any American, he believes that domestic violence is contemptible and unacceptable in a civilized society. " "Hitting a woman is not something a real man does, and that's true whether or not an act of violence happens in the public eye, or, far too often, behind closed doors. " "Stopping domestic violence is something that's bigger than football – and all of us have a responsibility to put a stop to it. "/n
