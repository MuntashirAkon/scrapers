Aaron Schock Resigns From Congress ... Partly Because of Katy Perry /nRep. Aaron Schock -- who gained national notoriety back in 2009 after TMZ posted a shirtless photo of him -- has resigned his seat in Congress after questions about his spending habits surfaced.  Schock was accused of using campaign money on private jets, massages and taking interns to a Katy Perry concert.  In his statement, Schock made no admission of wrongdoing ... only saying the  "great distraction " has made it difficult for him to serve the people of the 18th District of Illinois. The resignation is particularly shocking (no pun intended) because Schock was considered a rising star in the Republican party. His swimsuit modeling career can finally begin in earnest./n
