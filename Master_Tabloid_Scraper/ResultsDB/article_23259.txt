Universal Displeasure with "One" Stunt/nAn extremely earnest manager at Bank of America got what he thought was a great idea: to rewrite U2's heartfelt anthem,  "One, " into a cheesy public relations pitch about BofA's merger with MBNA. At a large corporate gathering, the manager and his sidekick performed their rendition of the song to polite applause. Universal is not applauding and is a little miffed that a video of the performance was posted to YouTube and is now making its way around the Internet.  r A Universal lawyer (who declined to speak to me when I called) apparently posted a public  "cease and desist " letter in the comments section of a popular music blog that linked to the video, claiming the song was an unauthorized use of a copyrighted composition. Universal's point seems to be that the widespread playing of the video is tantamount to Bank of America using the song as a commercial, and it did not have permission to do so. The greater tragedy here, however, is not so much the unauthorized use, but the bastardization of such a great song. Check out the new  "lyrics " this guy came up with: r  "And it's one bankOne cardOne name that's known all over the worldOne spiritWe get to share it... " r Do you like the Cowboys?Or your university?Do you like the Yankees?Or is NASCAR more your speed?Well it's your choiceYour rightTo pick a card that shows Your heart and your pride.. "  r Yikes, that's bad! This might be funny if the marketing guy was doing this as a complete spoof. But, from the look on his face while performing, this dude's taking it way too seriously, and he considers himself a singer, having put out his own CD. There may not be a copyright violation here - since this is arguably a parody -- but there is a good taste violation -- and BofA is guilty as charged!/n
