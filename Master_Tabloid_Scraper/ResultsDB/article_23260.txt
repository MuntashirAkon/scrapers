Vin Scully Blown Away By White House Call/nThis is awesome!!!!!! Vin Scully couldn't believe his ears when he got a phone call from the White House Wednesday informing him that he's receiving an honor from President Obama ... saying,  "Oh my gosh, no. Are you sure? " Cameras were rolling when White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest called the L.A. Dodgers legend to let him know he's a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom ... the highest civilian honor any President can give. The always humble Scully reacted in the very way you'd expect --  "I'm just an old baseball announcer. " Earnest explains why Obama tapped him for the medal -- it's an extremely cool moment./n
