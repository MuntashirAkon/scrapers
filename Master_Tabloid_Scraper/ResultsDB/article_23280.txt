 ‘Best Friends?’ Lydia Exposes The Truth On Tamra & Estranged Daughter's Relationship.../n
Tamra Judge and Sidney Barney are repairing their fractured relationship, RadarOnline.com can exclusively reveal!
“I think that for Tamra and Sidney, it’s not just like now they’re best friends,” Lydia McLaughlin told Radar after filming a bible study session she had with Judge where she opened up about their estrangement.
“Tamra got to go to Sidney’s graduation and that was a great deal and obviously an important day for her, so I think that their relationship is a work in progress,” McLaughlin added.

“I kept in contact with Tamra while I was gone,” she explained. “She became a Christian. She wasn’t a Christian when I was on the show the first time and so when she became a Christian, I reached out to her and we got together and I wanted to hear about her faith and kind of how she came to this decision. I invited her to bible study which is really where this season kicks off.”
Judge, 49, became a Christian at the end of the tenth season of The Real Housewives of Orange County, and was baptized on camera in the midst of her estrangement from Barney.
Barney, 18, cut her mom out of her life after she divorced Simon Barney in 2011. They reconciled briefly after the season 11 reunion, but Barney still refuses to live with Judge.
