Tamra Judge Shares Photo Of Son On Social Media Amid Estrangement From Daughter/n
Tamra Judge doesnâ€™t speak to her daughter Sidney, but she made sure to give her son Spencer a special birthday shout out.
The RHOC mom, 49, wished her son with Simon Barney a happy 17th birthday on Instagram, but kept mum about their other children, Sidney, 18, and Sophia, 10.
She later shared a selfie that the high schooler took.





 It's your birthday! One of my favorite  pics of Spencer. Sums up his personality "Quiet & serious" . (I think it's the only selfie he's ever taken) Everyone tells him he should be a model but he would rather talk politics and world history.  One more year till you're  legal ðŸ˜¬

The family has been at war since Tamra and Simonâ€™s divorce, with Spencer living full time with Judge and Sidney living full time with Simon. Sophia goes back and forthÂ between her parents.
Radar previously reported that the fitness guru did not post about or pose for pictures at Sidneyâ€™s high school graduationÂ and awards ceremony at school â€” leading fans to believe she is still estranged from her daughter.
Sidney and Tamra have been estranged for years, but she revealed that they briefly reconciled after the season 11 reunion.
