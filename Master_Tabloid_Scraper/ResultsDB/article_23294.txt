Judy Garland’s ex-husband Sid Luft claims that Garland was repeatedly molested by some of the actors who portrayed Munchkins on the set of The Wizard of Oz.

Luft, who was married to Garland from 1952-1965 described the abuse in disturbing detail in his new, posthumous memoir, Judy and I: My Life with Judy Garland. [via People].
“They would make Judy’s life miserable on set by putting their hands under her dress. The men were 40 or more years old,” he wrote, adding, “They thought they could get away with anything because they were so small.”
Luft passed away in 2005 while Garland died in 1969. In an interview with Jack Parr just two years before her death, Garland said of the actors, “They were little drunks … They got smashed every night, and they picked them up in butterfly nets.”

Previous reports, including one from Culver City historian Julie Logo Cerra on NPR, described the group of actors as a raucous bunch that “celebrated a bunch” and “were all over the place.” Many of the actors have denied these claims over the years.
According to People, Luft’s memoir also details his relationship with Garland, her drug addictions, and multiple suicide attempts. It is available for purchase on Amazon.
