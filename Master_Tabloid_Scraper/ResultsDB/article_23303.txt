This took a lot of thought.

In collaboration with the house of Dior, Rihanna has designed a line of futuristic sunglasses that will expand upon the fashion element of her brand, in addition to her Fenty x Puma line and her three-year contract with Stance socks. According to WWD, the line will be titled “Rihanna.” Go figure.
