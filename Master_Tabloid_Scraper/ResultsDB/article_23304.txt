Robert Pattinson and his no-nonsense glare were snatched up by Dior Homme for their fall pre-collection ads that will be released on April 1, according to WWD. Sidney Toledano, the chief executive officer of Christian Dior Couture, said that Pattinson was particularly excited when he heard who would be the camera for the campaign.
“When we told him that Karl Lagerfeld was going to shoot the campaign, Robert was even more enthusiastic and indeed, the campaign is perfectly reflecting the spirit of Dior Homme.”

Pattinson’s ads mark the first time that Dior is doing a print campaign for a pre-collection. They will run globally in publications including Esquire and GQ, in addition to window displays and online. The Twilight hunk first became the face of a fragrance back in July 2013.
