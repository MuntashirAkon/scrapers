Nick Jonas is single and ready to mingle.

Despite gushing about rumored girlfriend/hookup companion Kate Hudson, the “Levels” singer is very much unattached to any girl at the moment.
On Monday (Feb. 22, 2016), Jonas let it be known that he’s currently not dating anyone. After being photographed having dinner with a mystery blonde at Craig’s over the weekend, the 23-year-old finally cleared the air about his relationship status on Twitter.

I’ve now been romantically linked to two of my friends wife and girlfriend while third wheeling at dinner with them. #sofunnyiforgottolaugh

These people are very good at cropping people out of pictures that make their story less interesting.

I’ve been very open about the fact that I am not in a relationship with anyone right now. I am pretty sure I am the most reliable source. 😎

Jonas also added that he’s “ready to share the journey I’ve been on this last year” through new music.
Last June, Jonas called it quits with his girlfriend of nearly two years, Olivia Culpo. Since then, the former Disney Channel star has been dodging rumors that he’s been hooking up with Hudson.
“Out of my best effort to respect her and her privacy, I’m not going to say if we had sex or not,” he told Complex magazine earlier this year. “But we did have a beautiful connection. Even now I have so much admiration and respect. She’s amazing.”
Jonas was also linked to actress Lily Collins in early February, but the actress’ father Phil Collins later refuted relationship rumors and clarified that his daughter and Jonas are “just friends.”
