Lindsay Lohan -- I Found My $75k Fur -- Thanks To the Seahawks!/nLindsay Lohan has FOUND her precious fur coat ... and it's all because of a member of the Seattle Seahawks.  We broke the story ... Lindsay claimed her $75,000 fur went missing at 1 OAK early Thursday morning.  Turns out ... it was a 2-piece fur and Lindsay claims she left one piece in the club. 1 OAK reportedly said Lindsay was full of it and did not lose anything inside their club.But now Lindsay says she got the coat back, thanks to Seahawks wide receiver Sidney Rice, who was at Lindsay's table.  We're told after Lindsay left the club, Rice noticed she had left the garment behind and took it home for safe keeping.  He contacted Lindsay the next day and her people picked it up.If you wonder why Rice was clubbing until the wee hours of the morning just days before the Super Bowl ... he won't be playing.  He's on the injured reserve list./n
