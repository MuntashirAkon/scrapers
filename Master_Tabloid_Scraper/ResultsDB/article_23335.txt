'Precious' Star Mo'Nique -- Weed, Illegal Immigrant Accusations in Dog Crap Lawsuit/n "Precious " star Mo'Nique's dog-stink legal battle with her landlords just got downright PERSONAL -- with the Mo's husband accusing the landlords of being alcoholics ... and them accusing him of smoking weed in the house.TMZ broke the story -- Mo's Georgia landlords sued the Academy Award-winning actress and her husband Sidney Hicks last year, claiming they walked out on their rental contract, still owing $370,000 in unpaid rent.Mo and Sid responded shortly after -- claiming there was a reason they reneged on the contract -- the house smelled like dog crap, wet dog, and urine ... the septic tank was an overflowing mess ... the security gate was broken ... the list goes on.Now, new docs have been filed in the case, including a massive collection of emails between Sidney and one of the landlords named Alice -- in which Sidney claims the landlords should be  "embarrassed " by the state of the home. Alice responds, mocking Sidney over Mo'Nique's canceled talk show -- writing,  "We do understand that your business has been greatly affected by the cancellation of your weekly talk show. However we do not want the publicity and heartache /hardship for either of us. "Sidney shoots back, claiming Alice  "has a poor man's mentality ... you talk tough when you are owed but run when you owe. "And here's where it gets vicious -- Alice refers to the stank in the house, saying,  "Maybe the illegal substances you use in our home (i.e. WEED) has weakened your sense of smell. "Sidney responds,  "The only illegal greenery was with the illegal immigrant you brought on our premises to cut down the trees ... Maybe the overuse of alcohol has affected you and your husband's judgment. "It goes back and forth like that for 136 PAGES. Lucky for the rest of us, the case is still pending in court -- which means more awesome documents might still be filed./n
