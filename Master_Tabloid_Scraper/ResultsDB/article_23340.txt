Soccer Star Sydney Leroux -- My Hubby's Wedding Band Is $20k ... And I Designed It/nSoccer star Sydney Leroux made a case for wife of the year before she was even married ... designing a $20k wedding band for her hubby (lucky bastard) ... and TMZ Sports has photos of the bling. Sydney tied the knot with men's footie stud Dom Dwyer earlier this year and started forever off right by spending $20k with L.A. jeweler to the stars Big O to create a platinum and diamond monster. The ring is14mm wide and features 97 baguillion and round brilliant diamonds that are actually cut to mimic the octagons on the side of a soccer ball. Big O tells us that Sydney was very involved in the design -- and made it clear from the start she wanted more than the traditional men's wedding band.Â  No word on what Dom is getting Sydney for her birthday this year but we know this... It better be good./n
