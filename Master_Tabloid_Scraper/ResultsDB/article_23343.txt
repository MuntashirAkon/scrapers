She revealed that they planted a tree in their yard to help keep his memory alive.
“Every day we can see it, watch it grow, and be reminded of him,” she wrote. “He was only here with us for a short time, but he’ll always be in our hearts! We will always love you sweet little Johnathan.”
She then thanked her son for being a “great big brother” to his “little sister.”
In December 2016, Otis opened up about her heartbreak exclusively to Radar.

“I’m obviously still struggling a bit,” the reality star told Radar. “I try so hard to be ‘positive’ and think about the future, but this month has been really difficult.”
Johnathan was expected to be due on December 20, 2016.
“We’ve been trying to get pregnant again and with every negative pregnancy test I either want to curl in a ball and cry, or scream and yell at the top of my lungs, ‘why?’” she shared. “I’m trying so hard not to be a ‘Debbie downer,’ but sometimes my emotions get the best of me.”
Fortunately for Otis, she learned she was expecting on the day of her son’s due date.
