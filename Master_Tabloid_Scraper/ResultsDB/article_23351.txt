'Married At First Sight's Doug Hehner Writes Tragic Message After Wife's Miscarriage/n
Married At First Sight star Doug Hehner penned a heartbreaking message after losing his first child with wife Jamie Otis, who had been four months pregnant.
“Even though you could only leave us with your footprints, you will forever be in our hearts, and Jamie Otis & I love you #BabyHehner! Thank you everyone for the love and support,” the 36-year-old wrote on Facebook.

“Our Baby Hehner was just too beautiful for earth,” Otis said on Instagram. “I love him so much — ALWAYS will — and can’t wait to meet him in heaven one day. Please pray for us.”
The 30-year-old also expressed her sorrow with a quote, writing: “An Angel opened up the book of life and wrote down my baby’s birth. Then she whispered as she closed the book, ‘He’s too beautiful for earth.'”
Just eight hours before the announcement, Otis asked fans to pray for her family on Twitter.
The Married At First Sight: The First Year couple revealed they were expecting their first child just last week.
“We can’t wait to start this new chapter of our lives,” Otis told People magazine at the time. “Being a mom has been my dream.”





 I would like to think I thought of the most genius way to tell Doug we are pregnant! I had three surprises lined up for him. And of course I blogged all about this AMAZING NEWS and shared the video! His reaction was PRICELESS! We are SO excited to be PREGNANT! I love this little one SO much already!!!

“We have finished his pre-baby bucket list,” she said of all the things her husband wanted to do before welcoming a child. “I don’t want to push my husband. I want my husband to be just as equally excited as I am when we find out the news. I was an accident baby and it didn’t feel good knowing that growing up.” /n
