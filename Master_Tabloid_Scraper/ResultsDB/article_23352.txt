“We can’t wait to start this new chapter of our lives,” the Married at First Sight: The First Year star told People at the time. “Being a mom has been my dream.”
Otis revealed to RadarOnline.com in March her anticipation to want to start a family.
“We have finished his pre-baby bucket list,” she said of all the things her husband wanted to do before welcoming a child. “I don’t want to push my husband. I want my husband to be just as equally excited as I am when we find out the news. I was an accident baby and it didn’t feel good knowing that growing up.”
