The Wifey 101: Everything I Got Wrong After Finding Mr. Right author revealed her anticipation over starting a family to Radar in March.
“We have finished his pre-baby bucket list,” she said of all the things her husband wanted to do before welcoming a child. “I don’t want to push my husband. I want my husband to be just as equally excited as I am when we find out the news. I was an accident baby and it didn’t feel good knowing that growing up.”
But expanding their family isn’t their only news, as Otis, 30, revealed on social media that they have taken another major step towards their future.

The happy news comes after Otis admitted to terminating two pregnancies in her tell-all Wifey 101.
“There is nothing I am more ashamed of in my life than this,” she wrote. “I was older this time and I should have learned from the first time.”
