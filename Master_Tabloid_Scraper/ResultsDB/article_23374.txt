Bella Hadid is leaving nothing to the imagination.

The model dared to bare in a see-through gown while attending the Christian Dior Haute Couture Spring Summer 2017 Bal Masque on Monday (Jan. 23, 2017) during Parish Fashion Week. Clad in a baby blue dress with a sheer corset top, the 20-year-old wasn’t shy about showing off her body as she exposed her breasts — nipples and all — for guests to see.

Pal Kendall Jenner and her rumored beau, A$AP Rocky, were also in attendance along with A$AP Ferg and actress Eva Herzigová.
Earlier this week, Hadid showed off her boobs when she wore a translucent catsuit to hang out with Riccardo Tisci. At the time, the Givenchy designer censored out Hadid’s nip with a strategically placed emoji in an Instagram photo.
