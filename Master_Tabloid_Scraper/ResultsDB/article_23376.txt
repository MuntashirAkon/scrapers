This just in: Otis Sudeikis, the son of Olivia Wilde and Jason Sudeikis, is such a big fan of Beyoncé that the theme of his second birthday was planned entirely around her.

Jason shared this delightful tidbit during his appearance on Watch What Happens Live while playing a game of “The Book of Lies.” Though Otis has never met Queen Beyoncé Boobies face-to-face (that is his nickname for her, “Beyoncé Boobies”), she sent him a lovely gift in honor of his second year of life.
“She sent him a signed photo for his second birthday, though, which is pretty adorable,” said Sudeikis.
