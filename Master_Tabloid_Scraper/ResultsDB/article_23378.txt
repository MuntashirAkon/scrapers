The camouflage pattern made a huge comeback in 2016, showing up everywhere from runways to the wardrobes of your favorite celebrities. Now, it’s even bigger thanks to this partnership.

VFILES and Mountain Dew recently joined forces to create the first-ever camouflage wearable technology. Called Camo Out, the collection made its debut at the inaugural ComplexCon in Long Beach, Calif., this weekend in an interactive experience titled The Camo Collective. Featuring army print-inspired tracksuits with built-in headphones, snapback hats with a hand-free camera and solar panel backpacks, the line became available to the delight of attendees and VIP guests.
Hip hop group Migos and professional skater Theotis Beasley were spotted at the installation to check out the new collaborative fashion line, which was put on display alongside works by artists Damien Gilley and graffiti legend Stash.
