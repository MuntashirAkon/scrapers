“My drinking buddy. #neverunderestimatethepowerofawoman,” she captioned makeup-free pic, which not only shows her wearing a “Never Under Estimate the Power of a Woman” shirt, but might also be referencing her 2013 flick, Drinking Buddies.

Back in 2014, Wilde, 32, also breastfed her son Otis during a photo shoot for Glamour magazine, telling the publication, “Breastfeeding is the most natural thing. I don’t know. Now it feels like Otis should always be on my breast.”
Olivia Wilde sure knows how to keep it real.
