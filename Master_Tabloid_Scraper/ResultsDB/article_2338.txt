Teenager Devy's last post to Facebook read (below):

A family member in California told Buzzfeed News:

"I know that Devy had posted on Facebook, like over 24 hours ago now, and it was in the middle of the night and she posted about being scared, anxiety, and she said, 'I wish this would just stop.' She had her Quinceañera, and you know, it just… It's just … It's unfortunate because I don't want to ask too many questions at the moment because my aunt is trying to get out herself. It's a crappy situation because they're trying to process the loss of four of their grandkids and their parents all while trying to save themselves."
Our thoughts and prayers are with everyone in Texas and affected by this terrible disaster.
