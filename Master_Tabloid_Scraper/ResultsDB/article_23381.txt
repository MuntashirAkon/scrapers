After nine years of marriage, Tobey Maguire and jewelry designer Jennifer Meyer are separating, according to a report by Us Weekly.
The couple gave the magazine a joint statement saying, “After much soul searching and consideration, we have made the decision to separate as a couple. As devoted parents, our first priority remains raising our children together with enduring love, respect and friendship.”
A second source told Us that the decision comes after a lot of back-and-forth discussion. The couple realized that they had grown apart, but are committed to staying friends for the sake of their children.”
Maguire and Meyer first met in 2003 and have always kept their relationship private. They married in a low-key, intimate ceremony in 2007 consisting only of friends and family.
The couple has two children together: A 9-year-old daughter named Ruby and a 7-year-old son named Otis. Despite the amount of travel being an actor requires, he didn’t want to subject his kids to life on the road.
