Earlier this month, Otis, 31, announced the name they picked for their baby girl with fans in a Facebook Live session. The couple made the reveal as Hehner, 33, etched the name onto the wall of the baby’s room.
Otis told PEOPLE back in February they were leaning towards “Henley” — and not because of the famous Don.
“When Doug and I first got married — we were married at first sight, so we didn’t obviously know each other very well — and the first morning, we wake up and he goes, ‘You’re Jamie Nicole Otis, and I’m …’ ‘Douglas Edward Henley?’ ” she explained.
Otis and Hehner married in 2014 after meeting for the first time on Married at First Sight, seconds before getting married on TV. Otis, 31, revealed her pregnancy to PEOPLE in January, six months after they lost their first child, a son, while she was 4 months pregnant in 2016.

The proud new mom shared an Instagram post in late July, revealing that she had begun dilating. “I cannot believe our daughter will be in our arms in a matter of days/weeks!” Otis wrote in the caption. “I’ve been holding my breath this whole pregnancy and I feel like I can finally relax & breathe – welllll, kinda!”

In April, Otis told PEOPLE in an exclusive interview that she was excited to be a mother.
“I’ve always wanted to have that mother-daughter relationship that I kind of missed out on with my mom,” said the reality star, who opened up about her difficult relationship with her mother in her memoir Wifey 101. “I secretly hoped to be a mommy to a little girl and to have a little mini me.”

Hehner told PEOPLE he was looking forward to being outnumbered by girls (the couple is also parents to two female dogs).
“Every one of my guy friends say there is this unexplained special bond that happens with a daughter,” he said. “They don’t know what it is, but it’s an amazing feeling, and I cannot wait.”
