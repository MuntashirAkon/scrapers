Married at First Sight's Jamie Otis Memoralizes Son She Lost One Year Ago: 'He'll Always Be in Our Hearts'
/n
Jamie Otis and Doug Hehner are remembering their late son, Johnathan, who they lost a year ago today.
The Married at First Sight alums honored their firstborn by turning a portion of their yard into a memorial. “A year ago today was one of the most difficult, saddest days of my life … today is our angel baby’s heavenly birthday,” Otis, 31, wrote Thursday on Instagram.
“We wanted to remember him & honor him so we planted a beautiful tree front & center in our yard. Every day we can see it, watch it grow, and be reminded of him,” the reality star shared, along with photos of the couple planting their tree together.
Otis and Hehner, 36, lost their son last July, four months into her pregnancy.

 A year ago from today was our last full day pregnant with our first born son. Johnathan was delivered on July 13th, 2016 at just 17 weeks, 1 day. He was way too little to survive outside the womb.😢 I remember feeling so helpless – there was nothing I could do to help my baby.😥 I swore to myself, to my hubby, to God, to my baby boy, and to ANYONE who would listen that I'd never let him just be forgotten.🙏🏼 I blogged a lot to help cope with the loneliness; to numb the pain. I will forever be thankful & I'll never forget the countless Frans – and even strangers – who reached out to me to offer love & support.💗 …I planned ways to honor our angel baby's short, sweet life.👶🏼💙 One of the ways I wanted to remember him was by planting a tree for him & watching it grow. Now that we finally have our own home and our own backyard we can plant that tree. We researched and found a tree that blossoms all summer long.🌲 Tonight at 7 pm EST we are going to remember & love on our angel baby & we'd love for you to join us in keeping Johnny's memory alive.💚 We'll be live on Facebook at 7pm EST. Link to fb is in my bio. 👼🏼💙 #alwaysinourhearts #johnathanedward #angelbaby #bigbrother

A year ago, Otis published a blog post about the profound loss. “He was given to us so graciously by God, and then God took him away way too early. My heart hurts so bad. Losing our baby has been the most terrible experience. I wish no one would ever have to endure this,” she described.

In April, the pair shared exclusively with PEOPLE they’re expecting a baby girl later this summer. In addition, the parents-to-be found out they were expecting their “rainbow baby” in December 2016 on what would have been the due date of her first child.
Last month, the expectant mom was thrown a surprise baby shower in New Jersey by her sister-in-law, Kerri-Ann Hehner.
Otis and Hehner wed on Married at First Sight back in 2014. After a year of marriage, Jamie and Doug made it official once more with a vow renewal.
