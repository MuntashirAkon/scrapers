Jason Sudeikis is excited to have voiced one of the main characters in the Angry Birds Movie, but his 2-year-old son, Otis, might be even more impressed.The actor sat down on the Today Show Monday morning and opened up taking his son to watch the film for the very first time."He sat still!" Sudeikis recalled. "We can't get him to sit down and watch anything other than Beyoncé videos, but he sat on my lap the whole time in a screening room, and the very first time my character spoke he looked up at me like, 'Dada? Dada?'... It was adorable."

"I think so, yeah," he says when asked if the pair feel prepared for baby No.2. "I definitely feel like it will be good. It will be good to get [Otis] to share more of the spotlight, the attention. So I'm excited for him to be a big brother."In fact, the Angry Birds Movie even helped Sudeikis explain the concept of a baby to his young son."The eggs in the movie help," he chuckled. "Metaphorically, we can get there."The Angry Birds Movie will hit theaters May 20.
