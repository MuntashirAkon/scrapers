Cute dad and son alert!Jason Sudeikis not only stars in the new Angry Birds movie (in theaters on May 20), but it turns out the film marks a memorable milestone for him and his and Olivia Wilde's son Otis."I will remember it as the first movie I watched with him in a theater," Sudeikis told E! News while promoting the flick in Hawaii. "He sat through the whole thing. He was almost two and he was captivated."And Otis realized something was up when he heard his dad's voice come out of Red's mouth. "When my character first spoke, he was sitting on my lap and he kind of just looked up at me and was kind of like what?" Sudeikis recalled.The funny man didn't try to explain because, he said, "I don't think he would understand what it is."Too sweet.

Sudeikis and Wilde announced yesterday that the Vinyl actress is pregnant with their second child.Wilde posted a pic of her and Otis cradling their bellies along with a caption reading, "Matching baby bumps."Earlier this month, Wilde told E! News that "everything" makes her want to have more kids. A few days later, Sudeikis told us, "My own kid [makes me want more], because I made it with Olivia and that seems like a good cocktail."And Otis definitely inherited the show business gene. Not only is he a big Beyoncé fan, but Sudeikis revealed to E! News while promoting Mother's Day (in theaters on April 29) that he wants "to get Otis tap shoes because he loves tap dancing."
