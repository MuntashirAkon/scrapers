Olivia Wilde's son, Otis, may only be two years old but he already has some awesome interests!E! News chatted with Wilde at a walk through for her new Conscious Exclusive Collection with H&M where she couldn't help but gush about her little one, who happens to be a member of the BeyHive!"He's really into skateboarding," she explained. "He's really into football and Beyonc√©. So he's a well-rounded individual."He also has some other talents. She continued, "He's a really great dancer. I'm very proud of him! He loves to play the drums. But I support his new passion for skateboarding until he starts breaking every extremity, and then I won't be so excited about it."

Not only is he busy finding new hobbies, but, like his mama, he also has a knack for helping the environment and recycling."He knows that plastic goes in a different bin then paper goes into a different bin," Wilde revealed. "To them, it's fun. And if you start early, I think it really does change the way they see the world."

Speaking of recycling, the actress also talked about her collaboration with H&M."The conscious collection is amazing because all the different pieces are made from everything from plastic bags to hemp to organic cotton to organic silk blends," she explained. "It's really cool. It's very exciting to have a piece that you're wearing have a story. There are shoes made from eucalyptus bark."She continued, explaining how important this is for the fashion world. "It's very interesting what they're doing, and they're doing it in a fashionable way, which I think is changing the way people think about sustainability."
