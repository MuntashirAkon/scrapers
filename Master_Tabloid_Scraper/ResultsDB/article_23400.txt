Olivia Wilde Gushes Over ''Happy'' Baby Otis: ''He's the Best!''—Watch! The Tron: Legacy star, who also posed for pics with Sudeikis at the premiere, has been busy promoting the film as of late. H.../n
Olivia Wilde is one proud mama! E! News caught up with the 31-year-old actress at the premiere of her upcoming film Meadowland in NYC, where the House star gushed over her first child, son Otis Alexander, whom she welcomed with boyfriend Jason Sudeikis in April 2014. "He's thriving, he's really happy," the brunette beauty, who looked absolutely stunning in an elegant red and white dress with sexy cutouts, revealed at the event, sponsored by Forevermark. "Every day there's a new development but we're just really lucky that he's healthy and he's the best!" 

The forthcoming Reed Morano-directed film, which hits theaters on Oct. 16 and is available On Demand on Oct. 23, tells the story of a couple's (Wilde and Luke Wilson) heartbreaking journey after their child is kidnapped. Wilde, who is also a producer on the film, was pregnant when she first began working on the project, and the actress told E! News that becoming a mother made her "performance better." "I think having a baby is probably the best preparation I could've done for this movie," she shared. "It gave me a certain amount of insight into a mother's love and that was key for this role." Watch the clip above to hear more!

The Tron: Legacy star, who also posed for pics with Sudeikis at the premiere, has been busy promoting the film as of late. Her partner, meanwhile, most recently stopped by The Tonight Show last month, where the We're The Millers star shared an adorable video of his son slam-dunking a basketball and revealed that's how his mini-me learned how to walk! "I'm thinking is this my fault? Am I not walking enough in front of him? It's the drinking. It's the Segway," Jason joked after revealing that his friends' children were all walking before Otis. "You get to watch evolution happen in front of your very eyes," Sudeikis added. "Because he was crawling forever."
