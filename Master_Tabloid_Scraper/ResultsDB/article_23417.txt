LAPD Sends Trump Star Vandalism Case to D.A./nThe Los Angeles County District Attorney officially has the case involving the man who vandalized Donald Trump's Hollywood Walk of Fame star, and law enforcement sources tell us ... felony prosecution is highly likely. We're told the LAPD has completed its investigation into James Otis, and it wasn't all that difficult given there's video of him sledgehammering the star, and he confessed to boot. We're told the case file was sent to the D.A. for possible felony vandalism, which is punishable by 3 years in prison. A law enforcement source involved in the case tells TMZ ... this is not a political issue for cops or the D.A. ... it's a straightforward vandalism case that will almost certainly end up in court./n
