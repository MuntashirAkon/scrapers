Spider-Man Steals Donald Trump Star Vandal 's Thunder/nJames Otis, the man who took a pickax to Donald Trump's star, made a new enemy Friday ... the amazing Spider-Man! This vid is hilarious -- one of those Hollywood Blvd street performers fully jacked the spotlight from Otis, who was trying to discuss his lawsuit against Trump. But street Spidey was just the start of Otis' trouble -- a few more characters, not all in costume, grabbed his mic. THIS is how ya do a news conference!   /n
