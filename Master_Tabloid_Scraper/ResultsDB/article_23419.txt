D.A. Charges Trump Star Vandal, Facing 3 Years in Jail/nThe guy who trashed Donald Trump's Hollywood star just got slammed with a felony vandalism charge ... and he could end up behind bars for a while.  The L.A. County District Attorney's Office finally charged James Otis Thursday with one count of felony vandalism for taking a pickax to Trump's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame last month. Otis recorded video of himself doing the deed ... so this is as close to 'open-and-shut' as you're gonna get. We broke the story ... Otis said he defaced Trump's star to stand up for the President-elect's alleged sexual assault victims, and that he was happy to go to jail for the crime. Careful what ya wish for -- he's now facing up to 3 years in jail and a $10,000 max fine if he's found guilty. /n
