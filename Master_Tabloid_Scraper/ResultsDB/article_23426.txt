Donald Trump's Hollywood Star Gets Presidential Protection /nDonald Trump's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame is back to its glory ... and it's now getting Secret Service-like protection. Law enforcement sources tell us the LAPD will have 2 officers on foot patrol in the area 24 /7, in addition to vehicle patrol. We're told a camera will be trained on Trump's star, located near a shopping mall ... and private security has also been alerted to keep an eye out for vandals.   The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce -- which maintains the Walk -- has placed a protective barrier around Trump's star -- it's unclear when it will be removed. The star had been covered by a wooden panel for several weeks after it got obliterated with the help of a sledgehammer. The vandal faces 3 years in prison./n
