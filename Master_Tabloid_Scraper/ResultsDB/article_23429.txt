According to reports, he has been accused of kicking co-executive producer Virgil Williams on the set. And a few years back, Gibson was reportedly ordered to undergo anger management counseling after he hit assistant director Ian Woolf.
After his suspension, Gibson told GLOBE magazine, “”There were creative differences on the set and a disagreement. I regret that it occurred. We all want to work together as a team to make the best show possible. We always have and we always will.”
He has not yet responded to the firing.
