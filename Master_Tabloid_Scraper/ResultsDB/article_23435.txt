Nice Lumberjack Look, Kim! Kardashian Covers Up Pregnancy Curves With Plaid Shirt/n
Kim Kardashian rarely covers up her curves, but when she does, she does it lumberjack style!
The 32-year-old, who is pregnant with her first child with Kanye West, hit the gym early Thursday morning, hiding her baby bump and drenching her maternally curvy figure in an enormous Pyrex brand plaid shirt – and RadarOnline.com has the photos.

The reality star, who was also wearing tight black spandex pants and a black top, also added matching aqua tennis shoes and a black Balenciaga bag to finish off her fitness fashion.
Don’t be fooled by the Pyrex brand! Kim’s plaid shirt is from American designer Virgil Abloh, retails in the hundreds, has nothing to do with the glass baking dishes in your kitchen, and could definitely belong to her baby daddy who is a fan of the hip, urban brand.

Kim recently admitted to Cosmopolitan that she expects to get quite big while carrying her baby girl.
“I feel good. Nothing’s slowed me down,” Kim says about her pregnancy so far, adding happily that when it comes to packing on the pregnancy pounds, that she expects “I’ll definitely be up there.”
