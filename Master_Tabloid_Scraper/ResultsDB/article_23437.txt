Thomas Gibson insists he's innocent regarding the alleged kick that got him the boot from Criminal Minds.

Ouch!
However, the 54-year-old is finally sharing his side of the story — and he swears he never actively kicked the staffer!
The South Carolina native told People the entire argument was sparked by one line in the script, saying: 

"We were shooting a scene late one night when I went to Virgil and told him there was a line that I thought contradicted an earlier line. He said, 'Sorry, it's necessary, and I absolutely have to have it.'"
After returning to the show's set, the TV star explained he was venting to the other actors about the exchange, Virgil showed up and charged at him.
In fact, he maintains the alleged kick was nothing more than an accidental "tap," recalling:

"He came into that room and started coming towards me. As he brushed past me, my foot came up and tapped him on the leg. If I hadn't moved, he would have run into me."
Hmmmmm.

That sounds waaaaay different than the aggressive attack described when the story first broke! And Thomas claims the argument never got more heated than a harshly-worded conversation:

"We had some choice words, for which I apologized the next day, and that was it. It was over. We shot the scene, I went home – and I never got to go back."
What's inneresting to us is why we're just now hearing about Thomas' version of events, considering he was suspended over a month ago.
Which story do U believe, Perezcious readers?!
