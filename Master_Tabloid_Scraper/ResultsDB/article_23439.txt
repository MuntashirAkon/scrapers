Thomas Gibson Getting Kicked Off Criminal Minds Permanently For Writer Assault?! See What Sources Are Saying!/n

Thomas Gibson must be kicking himself over that outburst. Ha!
On Thursday, it was reported that the longtime Criminal Minds star was suspended from the CBS crime drama for 2 weeks after kicking a writer in a heated creative dispute.
But now it looks like the actor's vacation might be a permanent one, because executives are thinking of kicking him off the show completely!
According to TMZ, production sources said writers for the show are putting together a storyline for next season that gets rid of Gibson's character, Aaron Hotchner.

We assume Virgil Williams — the writer/co-executive producer who was kicked in the shin — is conjuring up a pretty gruesome death scene involving Hotch's legs being thrown into a wood chipper. (This is Criminal Minds, after all…)
If Gibson does manage to stay on the long-running series, he will never work as a director again — which was the role he assumed that led to the kicking and screaming fit.
But if he does get the axe, maybe we can finally get that Dharma & Greg reunion we've all been waiting for! Though we're sure she wouldn't approve of all this violence… LOLz!
