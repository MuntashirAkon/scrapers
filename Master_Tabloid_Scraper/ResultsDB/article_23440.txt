Kanye West Calls Kim Kardashian Our 'Modern-Day Everything' In New, Fashion-Focused Twitter Rant!/n

Here he goes again! And as usual, we only vaguely know what he's talking about!
On Wednesday, Kanye West took to Twitter to — you guessed it — rant about whatever the f*ck happened to be on his mind at that very moment.

And this time, his series of statuses is a bit fashion-focused!
The 38-year-old started off by revealing that he's on his way back to the U.S. from Europe — where he had seen a bit of Paris Fashion Week — and began rattling off his various projects:

I’m on a plane coming back from Europe…

excited to see my family and finish the final mixes of the Life of Pablo and keep working on Turbo Grafx 16 and Season 4 ….

And then he randomly began to delve into how he REALLY feels about suit jackets: 

I don’t personally like suit jackets anymore.
— KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) March 9, 2016


I especially hate suit jackets on women… that was a groundbreaking idea 5 million years ago!
— KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) March 9, 2016


I feel we are so stuck in the past and tradition.
— KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) March 9, 2016
And while the rapper doesn't like being stuck in the past, he also doesn't like when stylists desperately try to appeal to a younger audience:

I also hate all the stylists that copy Hedi Slimane and give their clients blatant YSL looks thinking that it will bring a younger client.
— KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) March 9, 2016


Just cause somebody is wearing combat boots doesn’t mean it’s all of a sudden youth.
— KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) March 9, 2016
Oh and here's the REAL reason he was at Fashion Week:

Oh and I only came to Paris fashion to stand by my friends Olivier, Riccardo and Demna.
— KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) March 9, 2016
The famous father especially likes Balmain's creative designer Olivier Rousteing because he also apparently holds Kim Kardashian West in high regard:

I thank Olivier for designing his collection around my wife… this is visionary as I believe that Kim is our modern day everything.
— KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) March 9, 2016
He also opened up about his other fashionista friends, writing:

I thank Demna for using the "I feel like Pablo" sweatshirts in his show,
— KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) March 9, 2016


this is my friend and we've bounced ideas and references for years since the time when he designed for YEEZY Season 1.
— KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) March 9, 2016


Sorry I couldn’t be at Virgil’s show because I had a meeting in another city.
— KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) March 9, 2016
Oh, and then Ye got opinionated about fashion trends — and suit jackets — again:

All these journalists can give their opinions well these are mine…yes I believe in my ripped homeless sweaters!!!
— KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) March 9, 2016


I like T-shirts and women in yoga pants… I live in LA that’s what people wear… not sure why someone would put a suit jacket on with that.
— KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) March 9, 2016
And because Yeezy is so open and honest about literally everything, he decided to call out the fashion industry for being fake:

The fashion world is sooooooo fake and Carine is one of the very few real people in fashion…
— KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) March 9, 2016


So many people turned on her when she was fired and acted like they forgot the innovation and beauty that she brought to the world…
— KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) March 9, 2016


Fake Fake Fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake … just my analysis
— KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) March 9, 2016


If you wouldn’t invite me to your house then don’t invite me to your show.
— KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) March 9, 2016


Don’t try to use me for advertisement or to make your proposed trend relevant.
— KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) March 9, 2016


Be real…
— KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) March 9, 2016


Olivier designed clothes for my show… That was real, that was groundbreaking, that is a Real Friend.
