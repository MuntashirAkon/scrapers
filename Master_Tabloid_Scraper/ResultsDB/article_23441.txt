Kylie Jenner Posts Her Own SeXXXy Snap Amid Kim Kardashian's Nude Pic Controversy — And It Looks A Lot Like Her Big Sis' Pic!/n

Is this déjà vu? Are we seeing double?
We can't be the ONLY ones who think Kylie Jenner's latest Instagram selfie looks an awful lot like Kim Kardashian West's headline-making naked pic!
On Wednesday, the brunette beauty took to IG to share a pretty seXXXy shot herself, featuring her a tad more covered up than her big sis was!

The 18-year-old posed in a black bikini with a bandeau top that's really reminiscent of those black censor bars Kimmy used to cover her ta-tas!
Don't remember? Ch-ch-check out Kimmy's salacious pic (below): 

Between Kylizzle's photo and Kendall Jenner's similar street style Tuesday night, it seems like there's some serious sister solidarity going on here!
Not to mention, other celebs — not related to the momma-of-two — have been copying her steamy snap as well!
Do you think Kylie is showing support in this photo?
Or is this just a koincidence? Let us know in the comments!
