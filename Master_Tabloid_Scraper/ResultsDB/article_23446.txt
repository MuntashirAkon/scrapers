Justin Bieber and Bella Hadid Twin in $1,198 Plaid Boxer-Like Shorts
/n

Justin Bieber seems to have a brand new source of fashion inspiration, and her name is Bella Hadid.
Earlier this week, 20-year-old Hadid made a major statement when she stepped out in N.Y.C. wearing a pair of bright red-and-green plaid boxer-style shorts, which are a collaboration between athletic brand Umbro and one of the model’s favorite designers, Virgil Abloh of Off-White. And like the true sartorial trend-setter that she is, she didn’t just wear them as she would a pair of sweats. Instead, she made an outfit out of the lounge shorts, pairing them with a cropped white sweater, black heeled sandals and two purses.

And the trend obviously stuck, because Bieber decided to get in on it as well. The following day, the singer sported the same exact shorts for a day out in N.Y.C, but went for a more athletic vibe, with a white t-shirt, white Yeezy sneakers and a red backpack.
Hadid recently spoke out about her love for the Off-White designer on the CFDA Awards red carpet, saying, “It’s the coolest clothes I’ve ever seen in my life but it’s just street style elevated. And thankfully Anna [Wintour] loves it and Anna loves him, that’s why were here. And I’m so happy for him. I mean I’ll wear his stuff till I die.”

So did Hadid let Bieber shop her closet, or are they both on that Off-White gifting list? Unclear — but you can get in on the trend, too, with a pair of matching pants, for a mere $1,198.
