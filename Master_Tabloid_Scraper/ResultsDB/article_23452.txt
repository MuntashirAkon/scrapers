America, we have a winner!So You Think You Can Dance's 12th season came to a close on Monday night, crowning the Fox reality hit's latest winner. The last four dancers standing? Virgil Gadson, Hailee Payne, Jaja Vankova and Gaby Diaz. And while all four are super-talented, only one could take home the prize.And America's new favorite dancer is...Gaby Diaz! Gaby was the last remaining member of Team Stage after Hailee Payne was eliminated, and it was down to her and Jaja Vankova after Virgil Gadson was eliminated from Team Street. She's the first survivor of the Street vs. Stage format, and the first tapper to win the title of America's favorite dancer! 

Not only does she get to hold the title until next season, but she also gets $250,000 and the opportunity to dance in Jennifer Lopez' Vegas residency. During the two-hour live finale, Jenna Dewan Tatum performed with former-contestant-choreographer Travis Wall. In case you missed the good news, Travis Wall won an Emmy over the weekend for Best Choreography for his work on SYTYCD!Do you think Gaby deserved to win?
