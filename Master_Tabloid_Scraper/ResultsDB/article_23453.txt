J.Lo joined the tracksuit club—literally.Of course, we've seen Jennifer Lopez rock similar looks previous to this one, but she quite literally joined the ranks of celebs before her who have worn the exact. same. tracksuit.Don't believe us? Jessica Alba flew in the $1,148 cashmere Olivia von Halle ensemble (seen here), Gigi Hadid played with wigs in hers (seen here), Suki Waterhouse prepped for a shoot in hers (seen here) and Jourdan Dunn took mirror selfies in hers (seen here). Crazy, right?

Because you probably don't have close to $1,200 to spend on loungewear, check out the similar selects below!

All you need now are some fresh sneakers.

Stay comfy this season.
