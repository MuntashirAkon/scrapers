WWE Owner Vince McMahon's a Raging Hypocrite … He Hurled the N-Word, Too/nVince McMahon proudly hurled the n-word on national TV, which makes his decision to fire Hulk Hogan for the same offense outrageous ... so claims Hulk. Vince was doing backstage color after a WWE event back in 2005, when he very deliberately used the n-word as he pranced away from John Cena. Even more shocking, he said it right smack in front of black wrestlers Booker T and Sharmell.  Hulk is outraged Vince is acting so self-righteous, condemning him for spontaneously using the epithet in private when the wrestling boss used it in a premeditated way, on TV and for profit. Several pro wrestlers like Virgil and George Foreman have to come to the Hulk's defense, as well as his daughter.  But a WWE rep says everyone recognizes the 2005 segment  "was an outlandish and satirical skit involving fictional characters, similar to that of many scripted television shows and movies.” Translation: If it's okay for  "The Wire " and  "Django Unchained " ... it's okay for the WWE./n
