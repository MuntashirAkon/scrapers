Lil' Wayne Linked to Stupid People/nIf you enjoy the musical stylings of Lil' Wayne, there's a high probability that you're a dumbass -- at least according to one brand new scientific study. One of the smartest computer people on the planet -- Virgil Griffith -- has just released the results of a brand new study which showed a correlation between SAT scores and the musical tastes of college students. Shockingly, people who enjoy listening to Beethoven scored significantly higher than everyone else. The people who enjoy listening to Lil' Wayne, however, were at the bottom of the intelligence chart -- just behind people who like Beyonc√© and T.I.But the most bizarre finding: People who dig the mid '90s soft rock drivel of Counting Crows scored incredibly high, just below Ludwig van. Now that's just stupid.  See Also  Lil' Wayne: You Can Suck It, Rochester!/n
