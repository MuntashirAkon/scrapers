Brooke Hogan Says Her Dad Is Greatest WrestleMania Host EVER/nStone Cold's bloody face? Ultimate Warrior BEATING Hulk Hogan? Virgil finally getting revenge on the Million Dollar Man??  So many great WrestleMania moments ... but Brooke Hogan says NOTHING holds a candle to her father's greatest 'Mania feat -- the slam that shocked the world in 1987.  You know the one ... Hulk Hogan vs. Andre The Giant.  Brooke wanted to send a little reminder to The New Day (the guys hosting WrestleMania 33) -- aim high ... but good luck topping this. /n
