“To my husband… You teach me everyday how to live, how to love, I am so glad you are the foundation of my life,” Davis, 51, said.
The couple share daughter Genesis, who they adopted in October 2011.
Tennon has been by Davis’ side throughout the awards season.
“I was the loneliest woman in the world, and someone said, ‘You should just pray for a husband,'” Davis told Page Six. “I said I wanted a big black man from the South who looked like a football player, who already had children, who maybe had been married before. Three and a half weeks later, I met my husband.”
