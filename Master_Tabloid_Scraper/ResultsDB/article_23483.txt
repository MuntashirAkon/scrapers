The duo issued a statement announcing the pregnancy in October, saying, “Mother and father are both very excited about the upcoming birth and look forward to co-parenting the child together. The pair have been planning this baby for years and have been trying for the last two.”
Singer, who is openly bisexual, had past dated Clunie. The year is already starting out well for the moviemaker, who fought accusations of sexual abuse in a lawsuit that was later withdrawn in 2014. /n
