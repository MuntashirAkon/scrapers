Dear John (PG-13)
It doesn’t take long for Channing Tatum’s shirt to come off in this romantic story of love, distance and roads not taken. Adapted from a novel by Nicholas Sparks — also known as the man who brought us The Notebook and A Walk to Remember — Dear John follows the trials and tribulations of a couple that keeps a long-distance romance alive through letters and imagination. While Channing’s character is off at war, his mellifluous lady of choice has some big choices to make of her own, and her decision impacts them both amid painful loss. (Channing Tatum [John Tyree], Amanda Seyfried [Savannah Curtis])
DVD Review: Invictus
The Road (R)
Death, doom and yes, even cannibalism are in the depressing mix in this film about post-apocalyptic survival as only novelist Cormac McCarthy could imagine. Viggo Mortensen appropriately stars as a father who travels a ravaged America with his wife and young son, doing his best to keep them all alive and savoring each moment that his son’s heart is still beating. Of course, there are only two outcomes possible — and in this landscape drawn in heart-chilling greys and dingy yellows, neither one is very appealing. (Viggo Mortensen [The Father], Charlize Theron [The Mother])
Edge Of Darkness
Visual Acoustics: The Modernism of Julius Shulman (Not Rated)
Who is Julius Shulman? According to this 2008 documentary, the late architectural photographer was one of the godfathers of American modernism, and his influence places him in pantheon of visionaries that includes titans like Frank Gehry, Richard Neutra and Rudolf Schindler. Narrated by Dustin Hoffman, Visual Acoustics introduces Shulman to us laypeople, and shows how his vision for space and design impacts everyday life, whether we realize it or not. (Dustin Hoffman [Himself, Narrator], Tom Ford [Himself], Kelly Lynch [Herself])
