Who better to ask than, Season 8 Dancing with the Stars winner Shawn Johnson. The dancing gymnast says she’d like to see Shawn White and Michael Phelps take the plunge. Olympic Volleyball Gold Medalist Misty May-Treanor, who got injured on Dancing With The Stars, says she’d like to she herself back on the show.
NFL Legend Julius “Dr. J” Erving says he’d love to give dancing a twirl, but added: “If they came to me I would probably pass. Even though I like to dance. I said Marvin Gaye is my favorite artist, so I like crooning and slow dancing and that ain’t gonna work on Dancing with the Stars.”
The last word comes from Dancing Pro Tony Dovolani, who says he’d like to see Tennis superstar Mira Shirpova simply to see  “her in those outfits.” /n
