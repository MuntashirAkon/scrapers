According to published reports, singer Amy Winehouse and British music producer Mark Ronson are among the celebrities marked for death on a ‘terror target’ list.
The list, allegedly made in response to the Israeli invasion of Gaza, is a catalog of Jewish targets. It has been posted on a militant website.
British anti-terror expert Glen Jenvey insists that the threat should be taken seriously.
“Those listed should treat it very seriously,” Jenvey told the UK Sun.
Others included in the list are Sir Alan Sugar of The Apprentice, British Foreign Secretary David Miliband, and Princess Diana’s divorce lawyer Anthony Julius. /n
