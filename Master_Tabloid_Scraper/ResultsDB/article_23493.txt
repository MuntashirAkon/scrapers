Ethel Rosenberg, Innocent/n
   QUEER AND SULTRY The Rosenbergs 
The sons of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg are finally beginning to see some of the evidence that got their parents executed for spying in 1953. And guess what! The ring of spies that testified against the Rosenbergs were lying! Spies, lying, go figure. All but 10 of the 46 witnesses’ testimonies have now been released, and who knows why all of it hasn’t? This was 1953! So we know that Ethel Rosenberg didn’t type up the super-secret spy notes that were the main evidence that got her killed. And now the guy who testified against them, who did 18 years in prison, now says (at the age of 91) that of course he was a Soviet spy and of course Julius was guilty as well. But Ethel, well: “What was she guilty of?” said the spy. “Of being Julius’s wife.” Oh, OOPS. Sorry the government killed your mom, guys.
