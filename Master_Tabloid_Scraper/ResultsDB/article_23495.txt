As seen on Twitter, the clip features SEVERAL celebs including Gaten Matarazzo from Stranger Things, Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson aka The Mountain on Game Of Thrones, retired basketball player Bill Walton, radio host Rich Eisen, and Russell Horning aka Backpack Kid from Miz Perry's Saturday Night Live performance.
Eisen said on his show:

"I am playing an announcer of a basketball game. Celebrities are coaches in the game & there are celebrity participants. I don't want to give that away because I don't know how much I'm allowed to give up."
See the proof (below)!
