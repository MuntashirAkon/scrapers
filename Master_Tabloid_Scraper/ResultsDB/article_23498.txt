Viola Davis & Julius Tennon Are An Adorable Duo On The Oscars Red Carpet!/n

Cuties, always!!
Nominee Viola Davis and Julius Tennon were looking like two teenagers in love on the Oscars red carpet!
Viola chose a red Armani Priv√© drop-shoulder dress, which was pretty but definitely not Academy Awards worthy. She's probably going to win tonight and could have really made a statement.
Juls looked sharp as always in a black tuxedo.
These two, such goals!
