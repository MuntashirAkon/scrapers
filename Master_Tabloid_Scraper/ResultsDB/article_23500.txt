Viola Davis Looks Positively Bridal Alongside Husband Julius Tennon On The SAG Awards Red Carpet/n

Here comes the SAG Awards winner!
Before taking home the award for Supporting Actress, Viola Davis posed alongside her husband Julius Tennon on the red carpet.
We did not like her bridal inspired look paired with a busy Nirav Modi necklace and black Tyler Ellis clutch. Her glam was also a bit harsh.
Julius looked fine in a black suit. Overall, the pairing was underwhelming.
She's known for better, so hopefully Viola STUNS at the Oscars.
