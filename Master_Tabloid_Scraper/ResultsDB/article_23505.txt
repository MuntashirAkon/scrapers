Meet Gotham’s newest parents!

Just two months since welcoming their newborn daughter, Ben McKenzie and Morena Baccarin hit the red carpet at the FOX Upfront in New York City on Monday (May 16, 2016). The couple, who started dating just last year, were all smiles as they posed for photographers at the television event to promote their show.
In March, Baccarin, 36, welcome a baby girl named Frances Laiz Setta Schenkkan. The actress is also a proud parent to a son named Julius from her previous marriage to Austin Chick.
“[Being a father] is something I’ve wanted for a long time,” McKenzie, 37, told People just days before his bundle of joy was born. “I’m excited about all of it, poop, diapers and everything!”
