By Hollywood standards, this could be the most efficient relationship ever.
One week after news broke that Ben McKenzie and Morena Baccarin are more than friends and Gotham co-stars, and days after it was revealed that she’s having his baby, word on the street in court is that the couple will soon be husband and wife.
The 36-year-old actress is currently in divorce proceedings with her ex, film producer Austin Chick. According to legal papers obtained by TMZ, Baccarin states that, “Today, I am in a new committed relationship. I am planning to re-marry. Also, I am 3 1/2 months pregnant.”

Baccarin is also requesting for full custody of her and Chick’s 1-year-old son. In response, Chick claims that Baccarin got pregnant in June before they decided to separate. Nasty texts were also exchanged:
[S]he texted to Chick, “I’d like to be there alone with Julius [their son]. Please Friday all day and night through Sunday morning.”
He responded, “I’d like to run Fox Studios and remake The Sound of Music w an entirely black cast of hip hop artist.”
She tells the judge, “This entire situation is not funny to me.” [via TMZ]
Baccarin was recently promoted to series regular on Gotham, which kicked off its sophomore season last week.
