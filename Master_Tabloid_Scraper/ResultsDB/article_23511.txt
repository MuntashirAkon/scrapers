Executive producer for the daytime drama, Bradley Bell, revealed that Mosley was on board with the storyline from the beginning and is excited to see what doors may open for future storylines that are more inclusive of transgender characters onscreen.
Bell tells EW, “It’s been an honor to tell this positive story of love and acceptance and now we will see the drama peak as we reach Rick and Maya’s wedding day, which will not be an easy walk down the aisle.”
