St. Tropez was the place to be Wednesday night as Leonardo DiCaprio and company helped raise millions for a good cause.
The long time environmentalist played host for the second annual fundraising gala to support his Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation.
Orlando Bloom, Marion Cotillard, Kate Hudson, Heidi Klum, Chrissy Teigen, John Legend, Adrien Brody, Naomi Campbell, Sir Elton John and DiCaprio’s rumored new girlfriend Kelly Rohrbach were just some of the high profile celebrities who got dolled up in their gala best for the auction event.
“We’ve decimated our forests, wildlands, polluted and over fished our rivers and oceans; all the key ecosystems that not only serve as a home to our planet’s biodiversity, but also make life here for us possible,” DiCaprio said in his speech.
“I’m incredibly proud to be part of a night that will allow us to do so much to protect the planet.”

Good work, everyone.
