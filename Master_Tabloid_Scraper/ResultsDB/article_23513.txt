Jenny McCarthy is too in love for Morgan Freeman to handle.
The co-star of A&E’s reality show Donnie Loves Jenny debuted bright pink hair on Today that matches the hues of her passion for husband Donnie Wahlberg.
She posted a photo on Instagram of her new look before sitting down to chat with Hoda Kotb and Kathie Lee Gifford. 



Thank you to my amazing hair & makeup team this morning! 💕 @juliusmichael1 & @mspriscillanyc

“I showed him this morning quickly and he said, ‘You look beautiful.'”

The blush-haired bride told Today’s resident sommeliers that she and Wahlberg are “very very much in love” two years after tying the knot. He co-hosts her Sirius radio show on his days off and, while apart, they FaceTime during sleep and appearances on national television.










Wahlberg shared the secrets of their romance from the woods in Queens while filming on the set of his TV show, Blue Bloods.
“I think in each other we found a perfect match. I don’t think that I would have pink hair tomorrow, but I like to surprise her as well. We’re constantly doing things to keep it romantic, keep it alive and keep it fresh, and to communicate … in a way that is perfect for each other.”
Though their unique lip service is working for the couple, it apparently does not please prolific actor Morgan Freeman who told the couple to “get a room” when they were making out at an Emmys afterparty.

McCarthy told Today that her popping hair color is anything but eternal. “I’m very much about the present moment. This is something I’ve wanted to do forever, but I’ve always been told by networks and bosses, ‘Don’t do it,'” she explained. “I’m still at that age where I can get away with it for like a month.”

Season two of Donnie Loves Jenny premieres Wednesday, July 15 at 10 pm E.S.T. on A&E .
