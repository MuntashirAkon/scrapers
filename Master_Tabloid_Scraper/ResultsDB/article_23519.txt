Understanding the Ides of March Through Twitter/n
“Beware the Ides of March,” a soothsayer tells the eponymous emperor in the first act of William Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar.  
Spoiler alert: It doesn’t end well for him. But 415 years later, we have Twitter jokes to soothe the pain.  
The term “Ides” actually comes from an old Latin verb iduare, which means “to divide.” “The Ides” was just a Roman colloquialism for the day that marked the halfway point of each month.    
Today, it’s a great day for jokes about murdering salads or referencing other favorite Caesars in funny tweets. And isn’t that what Shakespeare really had in mind the whole time?  
Salad jokes!

#IdesOfMarch is a much better name for today than "What if we just rounded off Pi day"
