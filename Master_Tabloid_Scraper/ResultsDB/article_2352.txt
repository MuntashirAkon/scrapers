One room. Three exes.

Blac Chyna, Tyga, and Lamar Odom crossed paths Wednesday night at the launch of the I.Go Live app in Los Angeles. Though all three arrived separately, they managed to run into one another at the exclusive party. Needless to say, it was quite the interesting turn of events.

Clad in a sheer blue gown, Chyna showed up to the bash with a gal pal but found herself exchanging words with Tyga, the man she was engaged to prior to her relationship with Rob Kardashian, once inside. A source told E! News Chyna and her ex — who also share a son, King Cairo — were “friendly” and “cordial” as they hugged each other.
Chyna also later saw Tyga walking by her table and asked him where he was going. “I’m just going to the bathroom,” the rapper told her. “I’ll be right back.”

Later, the mom-of-two was spotted rubbing elbows with Khloé Kardashian’s ex-husband. Chyna and Odom were said to be “all smiles” as they posed for a photo together at the lobby.
See? Not all Kardashian exes are so-called cursed.
