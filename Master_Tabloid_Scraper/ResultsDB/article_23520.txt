Picks and Pans Review: Julius Winsome/n
By Gerard Donovan
REVIEWED BY ALLISON LYNN
CRITIC’S CHOICE
NOVEL
Donovan’s quietly disturbing third novel is the story of a 51-year-old man who has lived in the same secluded cabin for 20 years. At first, Julius Winsome appears to be a kind soul who survives the lonely Maine winters with the help of his loyal dog. But after the animal is shot, something visceral and violent rises in him. Donovan covers less than a week of Winsome’s life, but by laying out each day in painful, sometimes dreamy detail, he opens up the whole dark, serious and unpredictable nature of a wronged human heart.
