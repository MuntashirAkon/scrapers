Mama's back to werk!Claudia Sampedro is getting back in the swing of things and flaunting her post-baby body in a wet and wild swimsuit photo shoot in this sneak peek from Sunday's all-new episode of WAGS Miami. "I have been waiting so long for this moment to come!" the model gushes. "It's my first photo shoot since having Amare."Even though she's killing it in front of the camera, Claudia worries about what boyfriend Julius Peppers will think because he's previously expressed concerns with her racier pictures.

"In the past, I have done a little bit more revealing things, and I'm hoping and praying that Julius will approve," she explains. "He just wants me to be a little bit more conservative because we have this family now, but I feel like he has to give me a little bit more credit."Darnell Nicole stops by the beach to watch Claudia do her thing, but she can't help but comment on the sexy bikinis—or lack thereof.

"All I see is applause. Child, those cheeks are clapping away in those waves!" Darnell says. "I am a little confused. I know she said that Julius felt uncomfortable with her showing too much, but, um, girl. I mean, it's nothing left to see but nipples and tutu!"
