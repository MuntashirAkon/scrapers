Claudia Sampedro is ready to take the next stepâ€”down the aisle.In a sneak peek from tonight's all-new episode of WAGS Miami, the model wants to know if boyfriend Julius Peppers is thinking about marriage after learning about Philip Wheeler's plan to propose to Ashley Nicole Roberts."It makes me wonder, like, are we building toward marriage?" Claudia tells him. "It's definitely something that I want. My parents have been together for 30 years almost; that's always what I've seen. So, marriage is something I do see in my future, and it's something that I want to go through with."

"I know we've talked about if before, and I just want to see where you're at," she adds with a sweet smile.But the Green Bay Packers linebacker isn't in a rush to make any changes to their relationship at the moment."I think that, um, I don't feel the pressure to get married at all or engaged," he replies. "I like the space that we're in right now. I like where we're at. I don't feel like we need to put any extra pressure or any expectations on it when it's good right now."
