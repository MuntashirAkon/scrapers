Several of the couple's friends, including How to Get Away With Murder co-stars Karla Souza and Jack Falahee, shared photos as they traveled to the undisclosed venue. Many of the guests were given large white roses to match their white outfits.

If that wasn't enough proof that something special went down, E! News spotted an Instagram of a guest getting picked up from the post-ceremony dance party. The picture has since been deleted. Hmmm. Davis married Tennon, who starred in movies such as Small Soldiers and Dazed and Confused, in 2003.Davis and Tennon exchanged vows again several years later, InStyle reported in December. The magazine said she planned on wearing a custom Carmen Marc Valvo dress for her recent vow renewal. When the couple first got married, the actress wore a dress from Express.In 2011, the couple adopted Genesis when she was a newborn. She is the pair's first child together. Tennon has two adult children from previous relationships.
