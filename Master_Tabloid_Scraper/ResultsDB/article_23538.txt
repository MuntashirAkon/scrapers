Colts Tight End Mo Alie-Cox Hopes To Be The Next Antonio Gates/nThe Indianapolis Colts just signed a guy who hasn't played football in 9 years ... but the dude has the potential to be the next big NFL superstar. Meet Mo Alie-Cox -- a 6'7 ", 250 pound ex-college basketball player at VCU -- who is now trying to make it as a tight end in the NFL. Earlier this month, Alie-Cox had a private workout and almost every NFL team sent scouts. The Colts liked what they saw and signed him to a free agent contract. We spoke with Mo -- who hasn't played football since his freshman year in high school -- and he's very confident he's got what it takes to make it. After all, Tony Gonzalez, Antonio Gates, Jimmy Graham, Julius Thomas ... all had a similar career path. Good luck!/n
