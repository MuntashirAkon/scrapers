Jenelle Evans opened up about her tumultuous relationship with Courtland Rogers, claiming she lost their child as a result of the alleged abuse she suffered at the hands of her then-boyfriend.

The Teen Mom 2 star detailed how she suffered a miscarriage in her book, Read Between The Lines: Diary of a Teenage Mom, revealing how Rogers became unstable during their relationship due to his heroin use. “He also became very verbally abusive,” she wrote. “His favorite thing to do during arguments was tell me that our child wasn’t his because I was a whore.”

The damage had already been done though.“I packed a bag and went to spend the night with my mother,” she writes in her memoir. “I woke the next morning to a pool of blood between my legs. My mother rushed me to the emergency room, where they explained to me that I had suffered a miscarriage due to my recent altercation with Courtland.”
