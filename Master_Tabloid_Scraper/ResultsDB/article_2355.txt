People are shook over the newest revelation regarding Jay-Z and Solange’s 2014 elevator fight, in which the latter physically attacked the former while Beyoncé watched.

Amid the recent release of Jay’s 4:44 album, fans are finding more and more connections for the Carter-Knowles clan’s love of the number “4” — including in the address where Jay and Solange had their infamous Met Gala brawl. Needless to say, the Beyhive is freaking out.
Via Revolt TV:
Well, it turns out that the address to the rooftop club of the hotel in which JAY-Z and Solange (Bey’s sister) famously had their elevator fight is also, you guessed it, 444. Back in 2014, the brother- and sister-in-law traded verbal and physical blows at New York’s Standard Hotel which boasts the club Le Bain that bears the address: 444 West 13th Street.
