NBA's Julius Randle Credits Luke Walton with Lakers Season Start/nByron Scott gon' cry in the car ... 'cause Julius Randle is giving 100% credit to new coach Luke Walton for the team's surprising start ... saying the young coach is pressing all the right buttons. The Lakers are 7-7 this year -- not exactly World beaters -- but when you consider they only won 21 games ALL OF LAST SEASON ... the start is pretty impressive. So when we got Randle out in L.A. and asked him what was making the Lake show great again ... he gave props to the new sheriff in town. Somewhere Kobe is breathing a sigh of relief his name wasn't brought into this./n
