Dr. J on Jerry West as NBA Logo -- His Agents Dropped the Ball!/nJerry West may be 50 years too late in his fight with the NBA over his image on the official logo ... so says Dr. J who tells TMZ Sports,  "I blame his agent and his manager for dropping the ball. "The Good Doc was leaving LAX this weekend when we talked about West's bitter battle with the league over the fact he gets NO residuals ... and the league refuses to acknowledge the famous silhouette is even Jerry.Â But Doc says it's too late for Jerry to do anything about it now -- saying,  "You gotta strike while [the issue] is hot ... so, when it was a real discussion, like 50 years ago, it probably should have been done.
