 Explosive Claims! Priscilla Presley Let Elvis Listen To Her Making Love To Robert Kardashian.../n
The Kardashian family has a new scandal on their hands.
A new tell-all book The Kardashians: An American Drama claims that Robert Kardashian was allegedly embroiled in a passionate relationship with Priscilla Presley.
Worse still Elvis was reportedly ‘listening in’ on their love-making.
The book also claims that Kris Jenner was having an affair with football star Todd Waterman and when her husband found out he began swing a bat at his car.

The book – which is released on September 17 – claims that Robert Kardashian fell for Priscilla after being initially snubbed by Kris.
Priscilla had just gotten divorced from Elvis after their six years marriage when they embarked on their fling.
The book reveals Elvis would listen into to his ex wife’s bedroom sessions with Robert.

‘While he was making love to Priscilla, she would get incoherent phone calls from Elvis. She would put the receiver on the pillow and let him listen,’ the book by Jerry Oppenheimer reveals.
However Priscilla ended the relationship, explaining: “I’m not going to marry anyone until Elvis dies.”
Robert then reunited with Kris before the couple got married in 1978, and having children Kourtney, Kim, Khloe and Rob Kardashian.
Sensationally, the book also claims they did not have sexual intercourse in the year before Khloe was born – alleging again that OJ Simpson is in fact her biological father.
