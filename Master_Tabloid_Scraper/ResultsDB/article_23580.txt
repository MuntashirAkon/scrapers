The Beyhive Thinks Taylor Swift's New Music Video Is Ripping Off Beyoncé — But Do You?? VOTE Here!/n

The internet is already unhinging its jaw on Taylor Swift's new music video — and the damn thing hasn't even come out yet!
On Friday, the pop star shared a clip for her Look What You Made Me Do video, teasing quick shots that showcase her new good-girl-gone-snake rebranding.
Naturally, Twitter is already picking apart the visuals, and one still in particular has triggered cries of appropriation!

The shot of Tay dressed in a black leotard flanked by dancers sparked instant comparisons to Beyoncé's Formation video — and people are not here for the pop star's discount Lemonade.
Critics called out Swift for ripping off the Southern Gothic visuals Bey used in her visual album — which, for the record has been accused of being lifted from another artist — and soon, the internet was flooded with Beyoncé lyrics altered to fit Taylor's white girl-ness.
Do YOU see the comparison? Look at the best reactions (below) and catch the full music video during Sunday's MTV VMAs!

Ha!
Some users, however, had even more noteworthy takeaway from the visual:

"Ok, what's the theme for this video?"
Taylor Swift: "…segregation."
"Excuse me, what?"
