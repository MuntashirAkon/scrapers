Let Netflix Prepare You For Back-To-School With September's New Class Of Titles!/n

Summer's almost over, and Netflix is dropping some educational titles in September to get us in back-to-school mode!
Next month, the streaming service will take you to class(ics) with films like Dead Poets Society, Pocahontas, and City of God — not to mention, originals including First They Killed My Father and Season 1 of The Magic School Bus Rides Again!
Don't worry, September's haul isn't all scholarly. The month will also bring a wave of mindless entertainment like Disney's live action Beauty and the Beast and the first half of Fuller House's third season!
RANK: What Netflix Shows Are YOU Watching??
Of course, we'll also be saying goodbye to a number of titles — farewell, The Omen, Scream, and Jackass: The Movie — but what we're getting in return is a pretty sweet trade-off!
See which titles are arriving and departing the streaming platform (below)!
