Kesha is “fine” with being shut down by Jerry Seinfeld.

While speaking with SiriusXM’s Hits 1 in Hollywood this week, the “Praying” singer laughed about the Seinfeld star rejecting her request for a hug — an awkward moment that quickly went viral.
“I felt like I was 5 years old,” she confessed. “I instantly was like, ‘Oh f**k me.’ And I like somehow ended up in my very own mini-episode of Seinfeld for like five seconds.”
“I’ve seen every episode [of Seinfeld] a thousand times,” she continued. “I used to carry the whole season package with me everywhere on my carry-on. Like DVDs … That’s why I wanted a hug so hard.”

Last month during the National Night of Laughter and Song event at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., Kesha interrupted Seinfeld’s interview with a red carpet reporter to ask for a hug. The funnyman quickly rejected her request — twice! — and the cringe-worthy moment was captured on camera.
“I should have known better,” Kesha said of the encounter.
According to Seinfeld, he simply turned down the songstress because he didn’t know who she was at the time. “I’m 63, I don’t know every pop star… I don’t know everyone,” he told Extra after the incident. “When you get to be my age and you’ve done a couple things, you have your own reality, in my reality… I don’t hug a total stranger. I have to meet someone, say hello. I gotta start somewhere… hug isn’t first moment of a human, two humans. I never did that.”
