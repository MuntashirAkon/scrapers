Don’t you dare come for Jerry Seinfeld. Not even for a hug.

Kesha recently learned this the hard way when she was brutally denied by the comedian earlier this week. When walking the red carpet, she interrupted the funnyman’s interview to asked for a hug. Jerry quickly rejected her request, and the awkward moment — which was captured on camera by a reporter — quickly became viral.
According to Jerry, he didn’t mean to hurt Kesha’s feelings when he turned down her hug. He simply didn’t want to touch her because he didn’t know who she was at the time.

“I’m 63, I don’t know every pop star… I don’t know everyone,” he explained to Extra. “When you get to be my age and you’ve done a couple things, you have your own reality, in my reality… I don’t hug a total stranger. I have to meet someone, say hello. I gotta start somewhere… hug isn’t first moment of a human, two humans. I never did that.”
He continued, “I’m sure I would’ve liked her, but I need to know who are you.”
The Seinfeld star added the two eventually made up off-camera — though he also refused to give her a hug then, too. “
She was very nice about it,” he said, “we laughed about it.”
