Jamie Foxx and his friends were hanging out on the patio at Catch restaurant in West Hollywood on Saturday (Jan. 7, 2017) until someone at a nearby table grew upset with the group’s volume level.

According to TMZ, a man approached Foxx and his group, complaining that they were being too loud. One witness said that the man told Foxx’s table, “You don’t want to mess with me. I’m from New York.” A comedian friend sitting at Foxx’s table retorted, “F**k you, I’m from Oakland,” and a physical brawl ensued.
Witnesses say that the attacker pulled Foxx down under the table, but Foxx regained control, putting him in a choke hold and took him down.
