Jerry Seinfeld's Kids Are All Grown Up While Posing for Family Holiday Card/n
Happy holidays from the Seinfeld family.As many Americans travel across the country for Christmas and Hanukkah, Jerry Seinfeld and his wife Jessica Seinfeld headed to the snowy mountains for a winter getaway.When not hitting the slopes or relaxing by the fire, the Hollywood couple gathered their kids and dogs together for a family photo.What came next was one pretty special holiday card."And for one half of a second, they stopped fighting. I am about to lose it," Jessica captioned the family memory. "This is our holiday card because I didn't do one. Happy holidays."

And for a little extra throwback, we couldn't help but recall the moment Jerry explained to Oprah Winfrey why he knew Jessica was the one for her. As it turned out, he knew right away."You know what it is? It's not the conversation or the attraction that you feel. It's just this comfort level when someone is in your house," he explained on The Oprah Winfrey Show back in 2004. "This is someone I want to spend my life with."
