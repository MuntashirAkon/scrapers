Ex-Dodger Says Cody Bellinger Could Win MVP as Rookie/nForget Rookie of the Year -- Cody Bellinger already has MVP chops ... so says L.A. Dodgers analyst /former Dodger Jerry Hairston﻿.  "He is a legit MVP candidate, " Hairston told TMZ Sports before Tuesday night's game at Dodger Stadium ... a 12-0 L.A. blowout that saw Bellinger slug home run #22 (his 10th in 10 games!). Hairston knows what he's talking about -- he played in the bigs from '98 to '13 and won a World Series with the Yankees in 2009. As for Bellinger ... he's on the most torrid HR pace for a rookie EVER ... pretty insane considering the kid started the season in the minors. Hairston -- a third-gen MLBer -- told us he's  "never seen a start to a career like this. " Even Cody's dad, a three-time World Series champ, can't believe what he's seeing./n
