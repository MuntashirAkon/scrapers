Jerry Seinfeld Snubs Kesha, Appears to Have No Clue Who She Is/nJerry Seinfeld made it clear he's not down with hugs from random strangers who approach him out of nowhere ... even if they turn out to be Kesha﻿.  LAST NIGHT @KeshaRose found out @JerrySeinfeld is not a #Hugger -- Is it hard to be a non-hugger in 2017? pic.twitter.com /92OoMFCNkd — Tommy McFLY (@TommyMcFLY) June 6, 2017  Jerry was being interviewed Monday during the Night of Laughter & Song at the Kennedy Center, when Kesha strolled up acting like your average  "Seinfeld " superfan. Jerry wasn't having it ... like, at all. It definitely seems like he didn't recognize her as a famous singer. It's a Soup Nazi worthy diss, for sure. And Kramer, for that matter./n
