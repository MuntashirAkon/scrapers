Ex-Penn State Officials Sentenced in Jerry Sandusky Scandal/nEx-Penn State President Graham Spanier and 2 other former high-ranked officials have been sentenced to jail terms for their involvement in the Jerry Sandusky sex scandal Friday. Officials say Spanier, ex-Athletic Director Tim Curley and ex-V.P. Gary Schultz were alerted of a 2001 incident of Sandusky sexually assaulting a young boy in a Penn State shower ... and did NOT report it to police, but simply told Sandusky he couldn't bring boys to campus anymore. Spanier -- who was found guilty of misdemeanor child endangerment -- was sentenced to 4 to 12 months in jail, with the first 2 behind bars and the rest on house arrest. He will also serve 2 years probation, 200 hours of community service and will have to pay $7,500 in fines. Schultz and Curley pled guilty to misdemeanor child endangerment charges in March.

Schultz was sentenced to 6 to 23 months (the first 2 in jail, the rest under house arrest) 200 hours of community service and $5,000 in fines./n
