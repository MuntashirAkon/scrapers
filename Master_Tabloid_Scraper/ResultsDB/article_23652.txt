By Alexis Tereszcuk – Radar Senior Reporter
Move over Kate Middleton, your little sister is about to become a big TV star!
 No, she’s not replacing Oprah, but a new special called Crazy About  Pippa is hitting the airwaves and promises to reveal never-before-known  secrets about the younger Middleton sister, Pippa, affectionately dubbed  “Her Royal Hotness.”

 The special reveals that Prince Harry calls her “Foxy Filly,” and those  closest to Pippa provide insight into the life and work of the  27-year-old.
 The British bachelorette’s love life is much speculated about, from her  romance with Alex Loudon and friendship with her ex George Percy (the  son of one of the wealthiest men in England, the Duke of Northumberland)  to her fashionable outfits – sometimes three in one day and sometimes the same dress in different colors.

 While big sis Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge, conquered the hearts of  Canadians and Americans on her first royal tour in July, the “Pippa  Middleton Ass Appreciation Society” has 238,000 members to date on  Facebook and she is sure to win over even more fans with the new show.
 Crazy About Pippa airs on TLC on August 9 at 9pm.
