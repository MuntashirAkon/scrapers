Pippa Middleton Recycles Her Dress & Her Date/n
By Alexis Tereszcuk – Radar Senior Reporter
Fashionista Pippa Middleton knows what she likes and sticks with it, whether it’s dresses or dates.
Like her stylish sister the Duchess of Cambridge Kate Middleton, Pippa has started recycling outfits, showing off her tanned and toned legs at Wimbledon in a black knit Tania dress, the same dress she wore in white knit to the AEGON tennis tournament on June 10.

The other accessory Pippa is recycling is her date. On Friday Pippa watched the tennis match with her friend George Percy, the same guy she went to the AEGON tennis match with as well.

Pippa and George, the son of one of the wealthiest men in England, the Duke of Northumberland, were roommates in college and dated for a while. She was rumored to have broken up with her boyfriend Alex Loudon recently, but the pair actually went to Wimbledon together on Thursday (which was the second day leggy Pippa wore a pretty short $200 orange Hobbs NW3 dress).
