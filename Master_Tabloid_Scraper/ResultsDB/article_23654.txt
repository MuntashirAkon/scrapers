by Radar Staff
Pippa Middleton brought her on-again, off-again beau Alex Loudon to Wimbledon at London’s All England Club on Wednesday.
Pippa, nicknamed “Her Royal Hotness” since captivating the world at her sister Kate’s royal wedding this spring, has also been recently linked to her former Edinburgh University flame George Percy, whose father is the Duke of Northumberland. And in case you’re wondering about that bright orange dress (although it looks red), yes, she did wear the very same frock a day earlier.
