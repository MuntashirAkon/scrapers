Dressed in a pink blouse with a smart blue blazer, Pippa’s gorgeous gams that she showed off yesterday were covered-up in casual skinny jeans as she picked up a juice from Le Pain Quotidien.

The Middleton sisters have become a fashion force to be reckoned with – the $250 purse that Pippa normally carries, by Modalu, has sold out and the Reiss dress her sister Kate wore on Tuesday to meet Michelle Obama flew off shelves and sold out in one day.
