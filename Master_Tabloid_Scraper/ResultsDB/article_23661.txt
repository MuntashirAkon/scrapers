In a green, white and black striped Zara frock, 27-year-old Pippa’s glamorous gams were demurely revealed with the not too short and not too long but just perfect length hemline and she sported stylish Gucci sunglasses to match.
Pippa’s older sister Kate Middleton, the new Duchess of Cambridge, has become a fashion force to be reckoned with.

Pippa has a new job working with her ex George Percy, the handsome and wealthy guy she vacationed with in Spain recently.
