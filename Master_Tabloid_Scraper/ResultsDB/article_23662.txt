Pippa and George met and dated when they were students at the University of Edinburg, and they were even roommates for a while. The two spent the weekend partying together with a group of friends, as RadarOnline.com previously reported.
Friday night Pippa and George and some friends hit the exclusive Fortuna nightclub, she went sightseeing with friends on Saturday, and that night parties at the swanky bar, The Penthouse, until 4am.
