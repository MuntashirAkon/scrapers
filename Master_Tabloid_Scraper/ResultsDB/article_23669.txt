That's obviously not a huge surprise, considering there weren't a ton of other notable new releases this week — unless you count The Night Before as "notable" — so this week should have been all about Katniss and crew!
But there is one bad thing to note:  of all the movies in the Hunger Games franchise, Mockingjay far and away took in the least amount of money for its opening weekend — and it's not even close. 
The debut film back in 2012 brought in $152.5 million in its first weekend, while Catching Fire took in $158.1 million and even Mockingjay — Part 1 brought in $121.9 million in its first few days in theaters…
But Part 2 just didn't catch fire with theater-goers, apparently!

Ah, well.
A hundred million bucks is still a LOT of money, and Part 2 is still one of the five most popular movie debuts of the year with its strong opening weekend!!
Did U see it?! What did U think??
