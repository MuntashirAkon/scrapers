Take a break and give these new trailers a look. Enjoy romantic comedies? We’ve got you covered! Like a hair-raising thriller? Have no fear! There’s new stuff from Anna Kendrick, Tom Holland and more!

Sing
Matthew McConaughey leads one heck of a cast of voice actors in this heartwarming animated film about an industrious koala determined to save his theater. How? By putting together a singing competition, of course!





Sing arrives on Dec. 21, 2016.

Blood Father
Enjoy a stripped-down thriller? Keep an eye out for this one. Mel Gibson and rising starlet Erin Moriarty play a father and daughter reunited by terrible circumstances involving drugs and some seriously unsavory characters.





Blood Father bows Aug. 26, 2016.

Table 19
In what could be one of the freshest premises in a while, Anna Kendrick plays Eloise, a wedding attendee seated at table 19, the table of outcasts. But that doesn’t mean the festivities can’t lead to some romance or some serious laughs for the group of unlikely friends.





Table 19 will be served Jan. 20, 2017.

Edge of Winter
Tom Holland shined as Spider-Man in Captain America: Civil War and since he’s landed role after role. In this new stark thriller, he plays Bradley, the son of Elliot (Joel Kinnaman) an unpredictable father who leads him and his other son (Percy Hynes White) on a wilderness trip that goes terribly wrong.





Edge of Winter will be available on VOD on July 26, 2016 and in theaters on Aug. 12, 2016.
