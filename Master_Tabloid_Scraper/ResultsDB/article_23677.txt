 Holy meta, Batman.
You know how seven months ago Veronica Mars creator Rob Thomas announced that the show would be getting a new spin-off that would only live online?
Well, there’s more exciting news.

Both BuzzFeed and Entertainment Weekly have confirmed that Kristen Bell, Jason Dohring and the entire Veronica Mars cast are set to appear on the new CWSeed show, titled Play It Again, Dick.

The spinoff will follow Ryan Hansen as himself and his efforts to make a spin-off based on his Veronica Mars character Dick Casablancas. The Kickstarter movie bit will also be included. Bell and Dohring will reprise their respective roles as Veronica and Logan, as well as fictionalized versions of themselves.
As BuzzFeed notes, Enrico Colantoni, Percy Daggs III, Daran Norris, Francis Capra, Kyle Gallner, Christopher B. Duncan, Ryan Devlin will play their characters and fictionalized versions of themselves, while Chris Lowell and Ken Marino will play themselves.
But wait there’s more!
Play It Again, Dick will have two newcomers: the handsome Robert Buckley and New Zealand actress Rose McIver.
The new series is set for a premiere on the week of Sept. 15, averaging at eight to 10 minutes per episode.
