Here Are the Nominees for the 2014 People’s Choice Awards/n
It’s that time of the year when citizens exercise their democratic right — and no, I’m not talking about some sort of presidential election. The nominations for the 2014 People’s Choice Awards have been announced this Tuesday and now it’s up to the masses to cast their votes on heavily-debated topics like “Favorite TV Bromances” and “Who is the bigger fandom: Directioners or KatyCats?”
Yes, Plato must be beaming from the high heavens right now.

Hosted by Beth Behrs and Kat Dennings, the actual awards ceremony will be broadcasted live on Jan. 8, 2014 on CBS.
