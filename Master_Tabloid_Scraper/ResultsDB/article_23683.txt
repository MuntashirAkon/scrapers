‘Elysium’ Wins Weekend Box Office With $30.5M/n
As expected, Matt Damon and Elysium topped the weekend box office, raking in some $30.5 million, according to The Hollywood Reporter.
The sci-fi thriller beat out Jennifer Aniston and Jason Sudeikis’ comedy We’re the Millers and Disney’s latest animated flick Planes, which took in $26.6 million and $22.5 million, respectively.
With its weekend ticket sales, We’re the Millers’ five-day total (it opened on Aug. 7) now stands at $38 million.
Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters and 2 Guns round out the weekend’s top five.
On deck for next week: Lee Daniels’ The Butler, Kick-Ass 2, Jobs and Paranoia. And for the very patient Directioners, there are two more Fridays to get through before This is Us opens.
