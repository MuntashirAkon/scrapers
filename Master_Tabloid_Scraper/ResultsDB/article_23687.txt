Pippa Middleton & George Percy Are Back Together Again: Report/n
It looks like Pippa Middleton may be off the market.   
The royal bridesmaid is reported to be dating her university friend George Percy, heir to the Duke of Northumberland, one of Britain’s richest and grandest titles – whose family owns Alnwick Castle, which was used as the setting for Hogwarts School in the Harry Potter movies. And that’s only part of their $500-million estate.  
A source close to Middleton, 28, and Percy, 27, told the British Sun tabloid, “George is very smitten and completely in love with her.”  
The couple have been close since meeting at Edinburgh University and have been linked before, when Pippa split from her banker beau Alex Loudon. 
Middleton and Percy reportedly started dating again after pairing up at the Middleton family New Year’s Eve party.   
“Pippa sat herself next to George at supper and made sure she was hanging off his arm all night,” according to the Sun. “And then she made her move.”
