Pippa Middleton's Tennis Outing/n
Advantage Pippa.   
Duchess Catherine’s younger sister found time to watch a spot of tennis on Thursday, enjoying a match between Andy Roddick and Kevin Anderson alongside her former college roommate, George Percy.  
The match took place at the AEGON Championships in London, a warm-up for Wimbledon later this month.

Pippa, 27, was all smiles in a denim jacket and sunglasses while chatting with Percy, with whom she vacationed in Spain last month.  
An honorary member of the “Pipparettes,” a.k.a. the buzzworthy bridesmaid’s nearest and dearest friends, Percy, 26, is the son of the Duke of Northumberland.  
Pippa’s rumored beau – and royal wedding date – is businessman Alex Loudon, who hasn’t been spotted lately.
