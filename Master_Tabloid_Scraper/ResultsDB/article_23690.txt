Pippa Middleton Parties in Spain with Ex-Boyfriend/n
Pippa Middleton, who’s been dubbed P-Middy by British tabloids, spent her weekend in Spain with her old boyfriend – and former roommate at University of Edinburgh – George Percy, the papers report.  
Friday night, the two were seen partying with some other friends in Madrid until 4 a.m. Saturday. Middleton, 27, wearing a brief beige skirt, black jacket and stilettos, was photographed at a club called The Penthouse. She was also reportedly seen at the exclusive Fortuny – with a bottle of champagne in her bag.  
Among the weekend group activities was sightseeing, while on Sunday, Middleton and Percy were seen together rowing in the Spanish capital’s sprawling Retiro Park.

Though in a relationship with former cricket player and current financial trader Alex Loudon – who was her date to the Royal Wedding of her sister Catherine to Prince William – Middleton is said to have remained on friendly terms with Percy, whose father is the Duke of Northumberland.  
Loudon, meanwhile, reportedly stayed in London this past weekend.
