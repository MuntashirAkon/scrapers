This year's BAFTA TV nominations are officially out! Among the list of nominees announced Tuesday, The Crown leads this year's pool with five nods, including recognition for Claire Foy, John Lithgow, Jared Harris and Vanessa Kirby. HBO's The Night Of and FX's The People v. O.J. Simpson also received nominations in the "International" category while Netflix saw additional success with Stranger Things, which was also nominated in the same group.While The Night Manager swept this year's Golden Globe Awards with three wins out of four nominations, it was only nominated for a BAFTA in the "Supporting Actor" category for Tom Hollander. The Late Late Show With James Corden landed a nomination for Virgin TV's Must See Moment thanks to his "Carpool Karaoke" segment with former First Lady Michelle Obama. 

Meanwhile, Foy, who also won a Golden Globe Award for her performance as a young Queen Elizabeth II, remains a favorite to win a BAFTA for her second career nomination. "I'm very honored to have been nominated for a BAFTA and so thrilled the show has been recognised in so many categories and to share this with Jared, John and Vanessa and all the amazing cast and crew," she said in a statement. "It's especially meaningful because the show is made in the UK with such a wealth of incredible British talent. Very, very excited."

To find out who will take the crown at this year's ceremony, the winners will be named at London's Royal Festival Hall on May 14.
