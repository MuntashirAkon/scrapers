Happy birthday, Prince William!The soon-to-be father isn't celebrating his 31st birthday quite how one might expect. The young royal was spotted arriving at Alnmouth for his close friend Lady Melissa Percy's wedding, which is set to take place over the weekend.The Duke of Cambridge will serve as the best man at the nuptials, although he missed out on the rehearsal dinner this afternoon, a source told E! News.

Prince Harry is also expected for the wedding, the source added.And while Kate Middleton is not expected to attend the celebration, "Prince William was chatty, smiling and in good form as he arrived for the wedding," the source revealed.Despite being second in line to the throne, the prince did not appear to need help doing any heavy lifting.He was seen carrying some of his own bags and suit (just as he did in the accompanying photo, from an earlier journey) after his train arrived.

Even though he was traveling for at least part of his birthday, St. James's Palace did say yesterday that the Duke of Cambridge will be spending the special occasion "privately."Let's hope the future parents got some quality time to themselves before their bundle of joy arrives!
