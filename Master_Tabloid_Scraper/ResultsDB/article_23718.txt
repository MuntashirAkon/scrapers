Master P -- Child Support Battle Begins/nMaster P was ordered by a court to fork over just $271 /month in child support for his FOUR kids ... but TMZ has learned this is only the beginning ... 'cause he probably won't get off that easy. According to docs filed back in March, Mr. P (real name Percy Miller) was ordered to pay ex-wife Sonya the minuscule amount (by his standards) based on a monthly income of just $1,387. We're told P's ex has been trying to get his real financials, to no avail so far.  So the Dept. of Child Support Services hit him with the minimum until they can assess his true worth.The Millers have six children, four of whom are minors -- Tytyana, Italy, Hercy and Mercy.A rep for Master P had no comment. We wish the rep said  "Uhh!!! Na, na, na! " ... but it was just a no comment./n
