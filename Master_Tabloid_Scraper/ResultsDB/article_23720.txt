Percy Sledge Dies -- 'When a Man Loves a Woman' Singer Dead at 73 /nR&B legend Percy Sledge -- famous for his hit  "When a Man Loves a Woman " -- died at home in Baton Rouge, Louisiana Tuesday morning after a long battle with cancer. Percy took his signature song to #1 in 1966. It was his debut single and went on to become an international hit. It was re-released in the U.K. in 1987 and still made it to #2 on the charts. Michael Bolton's cover version also hit #1 in 1991 -- and it's one of Hollywood's favorite tunes ... appearing on the soundtracks of well over 20 movies. Percy had a few other hits --  "Warm and Tender Love " and  "Take Time to Know Her " -- but nothing that matched his first blockbuster hit. He continued performing until about a year ago -- and this Thursday marks the 49th anniversary of the release of  "When a Man Loves a Woman. " Sledge was 73.  We got Percy out in NYC a couple years ago. The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame inductee was just awesome. /n
