Master P To Stand Trial/nRapper and 'Dancing with the Stars' contestant Master P will stand trial on felony gun possession charges. TMZ was the only media in court as Master P and his brother, co-defendant Vyshonn Miller, watched UCLA officer Ethan Shear testify how he pulled a gun on the pair after noticing two weapons in the car they were driving.

Master P, whose real name is Percy Miller, and his brother, a rapper who goes by Silkk The Shocker, were stopped by campus police in January 2005 for driving without plates. The officer then noticed two guns, one underneath the driver's seat, the other under the passenger seat. Lawyers for Master P, who performed last night in the 'Dancing' finale, and his brother asked the judge to dismiss the case for lack of evidence. The motion was denied. The lawyers also asked the judge to reduce the charge to a misdemeanor because their clients had no prior weapons convictions. That motion was denied as well.  The arraignment for the brothers is set for March 13./n
