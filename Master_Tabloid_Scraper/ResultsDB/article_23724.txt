The hip-hop mogul, whose real name is Percy Robert Miller, is CEO of No Limit Records. In recent years, he has tried out for different NBA teams, including the Sacramento Kings and the Denver Nuggets.  He will be paired with professional dancer Ashly DelGrosso for the competition, the network announced Wednesday.  The second season of  "Dancing With the Stars " premieres Jan. 5 (8 p.m. EST).
