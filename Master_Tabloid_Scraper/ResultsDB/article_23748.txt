Just When We Thought Donald Trump Couldn't Get Any More Embarrassing, This Happens/n

This is why we can't have nice things.
Remember yesterday morning when Donald Trump attacked Hollywood on Twitter? Well, staying true to his inconsistent form, POTUS welcomed D-list celebs Kid Rock and Ted Nugent to the White House just hours later!
And Sarah Palin came along for the train wreck, too!
We really wish we were kidding.

So let's recap: 
Ted (who was escorted by his wife Shemane Deziel) is known for being a sexist and a racist ‚Äî we mean, he's literally called Hillary Clinton a "devilbitch" and a "toxic c*nt," Barack Obama a "subhuman mongrel," and campaigned to have them both hanged for treason. Oh yeah, he also called Trayvon Martin a "17-year-old dope smoking, racist gangsta wannabe."
Kid, on the other hand (who brought along his brand new fianc√©e Audrey Berry), has been blasted as a racist for years and was most recently under fire for selling a shirt with a map of electoral votes, labeling the red states as the United States of America, and the blue states "Dumbfuck-istan."
And then the Former Governor of Alaska was there solo, rocking her off-the-shoulder top from the juniors section at Target.
Cool.
The list of people who do NOT belong in the White House just keeps growing and growing!
