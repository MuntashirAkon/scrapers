spotted out and about in the double denim combo of our dreams (we mean, check out that edgy, lace-up skirt—major heart eyes).   Alo Ceballos/GC Images Eva Marcille We're loving the contrast between Eva's cool band tee and play.../n
It looks like this week's style stars are really into matchy-matchy color schemes and coordinating sets, which just goes to show that you really can't have too much of a good thing. Emma Robertswas living her best life in a Dolores Haze crop top and mini skirt combo, which has us questioning why this set isn't already a part of our pre-fall wardrobe. Meanwhile, Rita Ora once again proved that when it comes to double denim, the possibilities are endless. Between her sparkly, grommet jacket and oh-so edgy, lace-up Death By Dolls skirt, the singer has pretty much given us the ultimate It Girl uniform. 

Needless to say, our picks for this week's Best Dressed are totally killing the street-style game. Don't believe us? Keep scrolling. 

 Could this week's looks be any more on point? 

(The answer is no.)
