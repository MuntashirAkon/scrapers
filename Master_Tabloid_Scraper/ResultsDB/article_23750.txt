the best thing about star wars is they can give us nothing and we'd still make up 400 wildly disparate theories

I've been crying ever since I saw the Star Wars trailer. I'm at Applebee's for lunch and people keep coming up asking what's wrong.

New Kendrick album and Star Wars trailer. If we're all going to die in a nuclear holocaust, this ain't the worst way to go out. I guess.

Me: Boss, I need to go home.
Boss: Why?
Me: I just watched the Star Wars trailer and I won't be able to get any work done until Christmas.

I knew the Star Wars trailer wasn't going to launch into "Personal Jesus" but I still wanted it to.
