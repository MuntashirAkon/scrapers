Mom Rebecca told the Huffington Post that Audrey simply did not want anything but a scatological soiree, and after trying to dissuade her, she and her husband decided to "embrace the weird" and gave in.
She said:
"For months, every time we mentioned her party, Audrey requested ‘poop balloons and a poop cake.' I tried suggesting other themes, but she always insisted on poop."
The heart wants what it wants!
Audrey and her poop troop had a poop emoji-shaped piñata filled with Hershey's Kisses and Tootsie Rolls, played "pin the poop," and received whoopie cushions as party favors. Rebecca took to the theme and dressed up as a poop emoji herself! 


Overall, Audrey's fecal fixation was a hit, as Rebecca said that everyone thought it was all hilarious! She said:
"I expected the grandparents to question it, but they all just laughed when I told them."
Good grandparents!
Rebecca added:
"Audrey is definitely her own person. I hope she always has the confidence she has now. She is so funny and the best big sister."
Adorable! We hope she's never afraid to be her unconventional self!
Now time to scoop up all that poop!
