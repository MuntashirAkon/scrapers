Faith Hill and Tim McGraw may be country music’s biggest power couple, but they’re actually as normal as any of us regular folks. In fact, the husband-and-wife duo, who were inducted into the Nashville Music City Walk of Fame on Wednesday (Oct. 5, 2016), plan on spending their 20th wedding anniversary being total homebodies.

“We are going to be in sweats on the couch watching some TV show we gotta find,” Hill tells People.
“We’re gonna binge-watch something,” McGraw adds. “And I’ve made a request, but I don’t know if I’m gonna get away with it or not — I want cornbread and peas.”
“That would be me cooking cornbread and peas,” Hill quips. “We’ll see.”

Hill married McGraw on Oct. 6, 1996 after becoming pregnant with their first child. Together, the two are proud parents to three daughters: Gracie, Maggie and Audrey.
According to McGraw, he fell in love with Hill when they hit the road together for 1996’s Spontaneous Combustion Tour. At the time, Hill was engaged to music producer Scott Hendricks.
“I fought and I fought and I fought to stay away from her as long as I could,” McGraw recalls while being honored at Nashville Music City Walk of Fame induction ceremony. “I’m not going to go into detail, but it was a great tour, I can tell you that.”
The pair recently announced their first joint tour since 2007. Their Soul2Soul World Tour will kick off on Apr. 7, 2017 in New Orleans.
