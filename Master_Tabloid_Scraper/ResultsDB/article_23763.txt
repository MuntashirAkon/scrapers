Kate Middleton turned heads in a bold red dress when she attended an elegant reception in Canada.
After a rainy day in Bella Bella, the Duchess and her husband Prince William traveled back to Victoria, where they got ready for a glamorous evening at the official Government House. Though Prince George was not there to reject Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Middleton made headlines of her own.

Not only did she stun in a gorgeous gown by British designer Preen, but she also paid homage to the country’s colors, wearing Queen Elizabeth’s diamond maple leaf brooch. It doesn’t get more Canadian than that. OK, maybe if she had worn a Canadian tuxedo…
She completed the glamorous look with red suede heels, a red clutch, and her hair done up like Audrey Hepburn. How very old Hollywood of her.
