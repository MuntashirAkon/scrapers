Ryan Gosling and Eva Mendes Have Disneyland Date Night/nRyan Gosling and Eva Mendes had a rare night out in public ... VERY public ... as in Disneyland! The usually private couple left their kids at home Sunday night, and tooled around the amusement park for a date night -- wearing only ball caps for cover, but going mostly unnoticed. The couple rode Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, hit up the Haunted Mansion and even subjected themselves to It's a Small World. They also got some merch at a souvenir shop -- gotta bring something home for Esmeralda and Amada. We're sure Ryan had the run of the park, being a former Mouseketeer. Also, he's Ryan Gosling./n
