EXCLUSIVE! The 24: Live Another Day Sneak Peek 7 Years in the Making: Watch Jack and Audrey's Tear-Filled Reunion Now!/n
Jack and Audrey's last interaction was in the season-six finale, way back in 2007, when he pledged his eternal love for her while she was sleeping, before choosing to let her go for her own sake after she was tortured by the Chinese government. Now, seven years later, Audrey is married to Mark Boudreau (Tate Donovan), who is her father President Heller's (William Devane) chief of staff. So yeah, you can definitely expect their reunion to be just like their romance: complicated!Before 24: Live Another Day's highly anticipated resurrection, we chatted with Raver about why people like Jack Bauer so darn much. "He was one of the first characters that wasn't like your perfect hero, he was kind of as damaged as the rest of us and yet had that thing of saving you. I feel like deep down inside we all kind of want to be rescued," Raver said. "I think Kiefer Sutherland brings such an extraordinary element to it that is so charismatic and so intelligent and so full of grace and so badass that it's just kind of an irresistible combination."24: Live Another Day airs Monday at 9 p.m. on Fox.
