Congratulations to Jeremy Roloff and Audrey Botti!The Little People, Big World star married his fiancée in a wedding ceremony on the family farm today, E! News confirms. The couple informed their guests of what was needed to fully appreciate their nuptials on the wedding website, writing, "Wear shoes capable to walk on gravel, grass and dirt. This is a farm wedding. Bring a coat for a potential wind chill, and maybe an umbrella because Oregon is an awesome state and does what it wants."The bride and groom, however, made sure to dress perfectly. Jeremy wore a Proper Suit tailored by Maxamillion. Audrey's dress was designed by Lauren Graebner.

The ceremony began at 4 p.m. where the bride and groom each wrote their own vows. Zach Roloff served as best man while Audrey's sister, Margo Botti, was the maid of honor. The bridesmaids wore crowns made of Baby's Breath flowers. The ceremony was decorated with the same blooms, as well as blush and white roses and lavender.After the wedding, guests were able to participate in "these delightful festivities: Feasting, Frolicking, Dancing, Embracing, Toasting, Laughing, Photographing and Rejoicing."One day before the ceremony, the groom's family hosted a fantastic and romantic rehearsal dinner at the wedding venue."They had chicken and pulled pork sliders, corn salad and veggie skewers," a source exclusively told E! News. "White picnic tables and drinks were set up inside the main barn near the church. The catering was set up next to the barn in the gravel area."Roloff proposed to Botti in March of this year and announced the happy news with a super-cute post on Instagram. "January 16th, 2010 I met Audrey. January 17th, 2010, I was in love. August 15th, 2011 asked her out. March 15th, 2014 I asked this beautiful girl to be mine, and she said yes. Drowning in grace. @aujb."

Jeremy isn't the only Roloff with a wedding on the horizon, though. His twin brother Zach Roloff is also engaged! Zach popped the question to girlfriend Tori Patton just weeks after Jeremy shared his own good news.The newlyweds signed up for gifts at REI, where they requested a range of gifts from outdoorsy supplies to dinnerware and baking tools. Specifically, the couple registered for a Coleman stainless steel cooler to take with them on their lengthy hikes around their future home, Los Angeles.No word on if they got that cooler or not, but they have each other, and that's more than enough.Little People Big World airs Tuesday's at 10 p.m. on TLC. Jeremy's wedding will air as the season finale on Sept. 30. Us Weekly for first to report the happy wedding news.
