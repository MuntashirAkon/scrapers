'Breakfast at Tiffany's' Holly Golightly in Line to Become Merchandise Queen/nHolly Golightly, Hollywood's first rom-com queen, is about to make a huge comeback in the marketing and merch world ... or at least, that's the plan. The  "Breakfast at Tiffany's " character, famously played by Audrey Hepburn in 1961, has had a pop culture resurgence lately ... thanks, in part, to a key scene in HBO's  "Big Little Lies " -- and Paramount, the studio behind 'Breakfast,' is ready to cash in.  The studio filed legal docs to secure  "Holly Golightly " for use on purses, parasols, gloves, coats and a bunch of other bougie gear.  Rest easy, cinefiles -- Paramount's rep tells us the trademark filing is purely about making dough off merchandise, and there are NO plans to reboot the classic. See, Hollywood makes good decisions too./n
