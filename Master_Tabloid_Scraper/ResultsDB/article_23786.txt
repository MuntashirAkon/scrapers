Audrey Hepburn’s Sons Battle It Out Over Glittery Clothes and Fancy Hats/nAudrey Hepburn's sons are at legal war over her hats, scarves and jewelry. Audrey left a storage locker full of memorabilia.  Among the items ... posters, costumes, gloves, photos, scripts and awards.   The  "Breakfast at Tiffany's " star gave her 2 sons -- Sean Ferrer from her first marriage and Luca Dotti from her second -- a 50 /50 cut in all the items. But she didn't say who got what ... she expected they would divvy it up. Problem is ... they can't agree.  So the treasure trove is just collecting dust at the Los Angeles Fine Arts & Wine Storage Company, and now a judge has to divide the goodies./n
