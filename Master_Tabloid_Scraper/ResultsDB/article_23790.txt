Funny, That Face Looks Real Familiar/nRemember that kinda awesome Gap ad from a couple years ago with Audrey Hepburn in  "Funny Face " dancing to  "Back in Black "? (Yeah you do.) Well the guy who directed  "Funny Face " -- Stanley Donen -- wants his cut of the cash Gap and Paramount made from the spot.Only, oh, two years after the ad first dropped, the directing legend says in a lawsuit that the companies used his clip without permission, and wants $5 million -- or if he can't get that, $375,000, which is what he claims Paramount made. Donen was also at the helm of  "Singin' in the Rain, "  "On the Town, " and  "Damn Yankees. " Reps for Paramount and Gap didn't immediately have comment./n
