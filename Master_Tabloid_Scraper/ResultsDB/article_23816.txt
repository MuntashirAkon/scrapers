According to the source, many of her friends and family are still skeptical because of the fact that Thompson’s ex-girlfriend recently gave birth to his son, and they miss having her around.
“Khloe is in Cleveland 90 percent of the time with him and she has just completely ditched everyone,” the source told Radar.
“She is so desperate to get re-married and start a family. It seems like that is all that she wants!”
