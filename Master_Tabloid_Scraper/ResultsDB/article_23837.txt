Kylie Jenner is wearing a diamond ring on that finger.
The Keeping Up with the Kardashians star took to Instagram on Friday (July 8, 2016) to flaunt her huge pear shaped cushion-cut diamond ring, prompting many to speculate whether she and Tyga are engaged. In the photo, she is seen leaning into a car and sporting ring on her left hand.

The post also comes just one day after Jenner, 18, posted (and later deleted) a photo of herself and her on-again boyfriend with the caption, “Mr & Mrs.”

Considering Tyga, 26, was spotted leaving the jewellery store Polacheck’s Jewelers in Calabasas, Calif on Thursday (July 7, 2016), anything is possible.

This isn’t the first time the two have sparked engagement rumors. Back in December, Jenner posted photos of her hand sporting a massive diamond ring. However, she later clarified that it was just “an extra special gift from a special someone.”
One thing is for sure: Jenner’s latest Instagram post definitely has fans guessing as to what exactly is going on between the on-again couple.
