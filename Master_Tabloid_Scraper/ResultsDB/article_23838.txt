Kate Middleton just proved that she’s just like one of us when she stepped out to attend a Wimbledon match in London, England on Thursday (July 7, 2016). Not only did the Duchess of Cambridge — gasp! — re-wear one of her dresses to the tennis match, but she basically showed us that she’s down to hang with the cool millennials by making her Snapchat debut.

The Royal mom-of-two appeared on Serena William’s account to celebrate the tennis champ’s recent victory at the semi-final. Recording Middleton on her phone, Williams joked that she was “in the in-crowd now.”
“I’m with royalty!” Williams gushed as Sophie, Countess of Wessex, joined in.





For the sporting event, Middleton wore a custom Roksanda Ilincic dress — which she was first spotted in during a flight to Australia in 2014 — and nude Rupert Sanderson pumps. She accessorized her look with a white Victoria Beckham tote, a Cartier watch, Ray Ban Wayfarer sunglasses, and a pair of Soru Jewellery earrings that she wore the night before to the Art Fund Awards.
Middleton previously joked that “[Prince] William said I look like a banana” whenever she wore the yellow frock. Regardless, we think we looks ***flawless.
