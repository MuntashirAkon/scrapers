The former Destiny’s Child singer has previously only given fans a glimpse at Titan’s feet, hands or back on Instagram before finally revealing his cute little face on the new cover — not to mention, we’re obsessed with the fact that the little baby boy is gazing adorable into his daddy Tim Weatherspoon’s eyes.

Along with Titan’s big debut, Rowland opened up a bit, saying, “My road to my happiness hasn’t been an easy one. It hasn’t been peachy all the time, but I am so, so happy,” she explained. In just the last year, the new mama has not only gotten married and given birth, she also sadly and suddenly lost her mother.
However, she continues, “I’ve been surrounded with so much love,” thanks to friends and family like her mom’s best friends and Beyoncé and Solange’s family.
In fact, Bey shared one of the first photos of her “nephew,” showing him tightly holding onto one of her fingers with a caption congratulating her “sister.”
Rowland has a ton of support from her husband, too, adding, “My priority is my husband first. That’s how the baby got here!”
