As she cradles his tiny little head in her hands, you can hear her voice ring out, “You will always be mommy’s little baby.”  You can hear a full version of the song on her SoundCloud page.
She captioned the sweet post, “A song for Titan.”
Meanwhile, her BFF and “sister” Beyoncé also posted a sweet message for little Titan, sharing the first photo of the little one’s hands holding her own.
