Kelly Rowland gave birth to her baby boy yesterday, welcoming him into the world with her husband Tim Witherspoon.
While the child, Titan Jewell Witherspoon, is very lucky to have two loving parents, we’re all really jealous that he gets to call Beyoncé his aunt.

I’ve always dreamt of our little ones growing up together. I’m so thankful for our bond. Baby Ty, I love you so much. Congrats to my Spoons.”
Meanwhile, the third member of Destiny’s Child Michelle Williams has also opened up about Rowland giving birth.  She told E!
