Leonardo DiCaprio and Jonah Hill Will Team Up Again for a ’96 Olympic Bombing Movie/n
Wolf of Wall Street pals Leonardo DiCaprio and Jonah Hill are teaming up again, but this time there will be far less Quaaludes. DiCaprio and Hill will co-star in a movie about hero-cum-suspect-cum hero Richard Jewell and the 1996 Atlanta Olympic bombing.
For those who don’t remember, Jewell was a security guard who found a backpack full of explosives and alerted police, potentially saving dozens of lives during the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. However, Jewell’s fame quickly soured into infamy, as he became a suspect and was tried by a media who was quick to judge.
Hill will play Jewell, who died in 2007, and DiCaprio will play his unorthodox lawyer and friend who helped exonerate Jewell.
The film is based on a 1997 Vanity Fair article, “The Ballad of Richard Jewell,” written by Marie Brenner.
Another round of Oscar nominations for everybody!
