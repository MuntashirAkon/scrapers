Kate Middleton Recycles Roland Mouret For Royal Performance/n
Tonight, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge attended the Royal film performance of Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom at Odeon Leicester Square.
Her Royal Highness wore Roland Mouret’s cream “Lombarde” gown, worn first in May 2012 at the Thirty Club inside Claridge’s Hotel.  According to @livelaughlovevr, Catherine carried Mulberry’s suede “Bayswater” clutch.  She wore a Zara necklace (thanks to @whatkatewore and @annieelizabethN) and court shoes by Prada.
In January, Mouret told the Sunday Telegraph that he loved seeing Catherine show a little leg in his design.

“I think it was quite fantastic that there was a split up the front,” he said.  “That picture of a woman when you catch a little of the leg, that’s what you want to see. It’s that notion of privacy.
“Its something that should be for her husband and she just show a glimpse of it.”
The film’s stars, Idris Elba and Naomie Harris were looking forward to speaking with the royal couple.
“I have met him several times before and watched him play polo,” an Alexander McQueen-clad Harris told Richard Palmer of the Daily Express. “He is lovely. He is very down to earth and charming.”
