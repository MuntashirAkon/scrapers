Leonardo DiCaprio and Jonah Hill have quite a bromance going on!The Wolf of Wall Street duo is teaming up again for a film based on the experiences of Richard Jewell, the security guard who first discovered and reported a suspicious backpack at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta. DiCaprio's rep confirmed the casting to E! News, and that Fox has acquired the rights to the Marie Brenner's 1997 Vanity Fair piece. (Deadline was first to report this casting news.)

Jewell, who cleared bystanders from the area surrounding Centennial Olympic Park before the bomb in the backpack exploded, was first hailed as a hero. But just three days later, he was falsely vilified in the media and wrongly labeled as a potential suspect. Hill will be portraying Jewell, the Georgia native who was cleared by the FBI three months later thanks to the help of his lawyer (played by DiCaprio).Eric Rudolph, who was responsible for the Atlanta's Olympic Park bombing and a series of anti-abortion and anti-gay bombings throughout the southeast, was captured by police in 2003. In 2005, he gave a statement confessing to the bombing and in turn clearing Jewell's name once again.Jewell, sadly, passed away of natural causes in 2007 at age 44. DiCaprio and Hill, who both scored Oscar nominations for their Wolf of Wall Street roles, seem to be primed to do the story justice.
