Eva Longoria Gets Extremely Active on Hawaii Vacation with Husband Jose Baston/nEva Longoria does the opposite of take it easy on a Hawaiian vacation ... she prefers screaming  "Geronimo " from the highest cliff!!! Eva's on vacation, island hopping with hubby Jose Baston, where she was very clearly in full activity mode ... jumping in waterfalls in Oahu one day, then jumping on a paddleboard in Maui on another. She did sneak in a kiss or 2 along the way, but you can tell paddling was still at the forefront of her mind./n
