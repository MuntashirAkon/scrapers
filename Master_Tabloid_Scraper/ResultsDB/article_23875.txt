Doc: Sickle Cell a Factor in 'Housewives' Death/nSickle Cell Anemia may have played a significant role in the death of a  "Real Housewives of Atlanta " star who died after a strip club brawl two weeks ago -- this according to the doctor who performed the autopsy. Fulton County Associate Medical Examiner, Dr. Kelly Rose tells TMZ preliminary autopsy results lead her to believe Ashley  "A.J. " Jewell suffered from Sickle Cell -- a disease which inhibits oxygen flow to tissues in the body. Rose says it's most likely that Jewell was worked up from the fight -- and because of his condition, it's probable that he couldn't replenish the oxygen he lost during the incident ... which the Dr. says could have fatal consequences.
