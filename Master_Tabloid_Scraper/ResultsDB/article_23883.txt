David Schwimmer & Zoe Buckman Put Six-Year Marriage On Hold/n
David Schwimmer has confirmed that he and his wife, British artist Zoe Buckman, are separating after nearly seven years of marriage.
“It is with great love, respect and friendship that we have decided to take some time apart while we determine the future of our relationship,” the couple told Us Magazine in a statement.
The actor, who once groused that shooting to fame Friends “made me want to hide under a baseball cap and not be seen,” echoed that sentiment in announcing the split.

“Our priority is, of course, our daughter’s happiness and well-being during this challenging time, and so we ask for your support and respect for our privacy as we continue to raise her together and navigate this new chapter for our family,” the statement read.
Schwimmer and Buckman married in June, 2010, and welcomed their daughter, Cleo, in May 2011. The couple first met in London in 2007 while he was directing the Simon Pegg comedy Run Fatboy Run.
