 Smoochy & Scary! Mel B Calls Spice Girls Emma & Victoria 'Soft Kissers,' While.../n
Mel B, speaking with the Australian outlet CLEO, dished about her sex life, rumors of a threesome and what kind of kissers her fellow Spice Girls are.
“I got a tongue piercing and I was like, tell me what it feels like!” she said. “Emma and Victoria were quite soft kissers, and Geri and Mel C were a bit more aggressive, passionate.”
The 38-year-old hardbody said she and her husband of seven years, Stephan Belafonte, thrive because they know “each other well enough.

“What makes each other happy, what makes each other sad, what turns each other on,” she said, before shooting down a 2010 rumor that sprouted in the Aussie tabloids, that she and her hubby had a threesome with a stripper.
“I don’t think we’ll be having threesomes any time soon,” the Dancing with the Stars alum told the outlet. “My husband’s mine, nobody else’s.”
While they might not touch, they certainly look, as the America’s Got Talent judge bragged, “I can appreciate a good stripper.”
“I was just in a strip joint in Vegas,” she said. “I took my husband and a few of my friends on my tour bus and we ended staying in Vegas for two-three days and we had a great time there.”

The “For Once In My Life” singer admitted she’s even taken a stripping course, because “it gets your body in shape … and it really helps you feel a little bit sexy.”
The interview took a slightly uncomfortable turn when Cleo asked Mel B if she’s ever had liposuction.
The singer said that since she was 18, she’s “always kind of tried to maintain a fit-ish body – whether it be trying to work out two to three times a week or running up or down on stage, doing my dance routines with Spice Girls.
“I’ve always tried to maintain a fit body, maybe not when I’m pregnant but before and after.”

In a bizarre twist, Cleo reported that Mel B’s camp was upset with the interview, informing them, “We would like the below questions and the video content removed from the feature altogether and the focus to remain on what had previously been approved (Single / Jenny Craig / Derby Day) by myself and my client.”
