Eva Longoria in Leopard Print Makes 42 Look Dayummm Good!/nEva Longoria can still flaunt what her mama gave her -- 42 years ago, mind you -- as seen from the front, back and side.   Yes, 2 days before her 42nd bday ... Eva blessed us doing a photo shoot in L.A. while sporting a couple of one-piece swimsuits, and some seriously badass stilettos.    Happy birthday, Eva! Thanks for sharing your gifts. /n
