Face
“I started by prepping Katrina’s face with mark For Goodness Face Antioxidant Skin Moisturizing Lotion and mark Kiss Dry Goodbye Lip Smoother onto her lips.  I evened out her complexion with mark Face Xpert Flawless Touch Makeup in Golden then buffed Champagne onto her cheek bones for emphasis.  To give her that natural looking rosy glow, I used mark Just Pinched Instant Blush Tint in Peachy, smoothed onto the apples of her cheeks followed by a dash of mark Bronze Pro Bronzing Powder.  I finished her face with a final brush of mark Matte-nificent Oil-Absorbing Powder to eliminate any excess shine.  I then used mark Jewel Body Cream on any exposed skin to give her body a gorgeous glow.”

Eyes
“For Katrina’s eyes, I started with mark It Kit (available in February) in Latte and blended into her crease.  I then used I-mark Custom Pick Eyeshadow in Corset brushed onto her lid, blending it slightly upwards into the crease and dashed below her bottom lash line.  I then used mark Eyemarker Color On Line in Jet and carefully rimmed the top and bottom of her eyes, then used mark On The Edge Hook Up Liquid Eyeliner in Cleo to create a perfect line on the top lid strictly for definition.  I finished up her eyes with two coats of mark Scanda-Lash Hook Up Mascara in Blacklash focusing on the corner of her lashes to really draw them out.”
Lips
“To keep Katrina’s lips looking subtle and natural, I used mark Dew Drenched Moisturlicious Lip Color in Mist.”
