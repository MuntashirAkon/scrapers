How To Get The Lauren Conrad Look/n
Lauren Conrad, former star of the “Hills”, epitomizes the Californian beach look – with her natural tan, brilliant white teeth, and minimalist make-up. But like most actors, there’s more to it than a dab of powder. For her secrets, we went straight to her make-up artist, Amy Nadine , who uses Lauren’s favorite Products from make-up line mark. (Conrad is a spokesperson for the line.)
On The Edge Liquid Liner: There is no better liquid liner on the market than On The Edge Hook-up by Mark Cosmetics. It doesn’t flake or feather and is the most user-friendly brush I’ve ever used. Anyone can draw a perfect line like a pro with it! Lauren Conrad wears it daily in Cleo (black) but I personally love it in Nefertini because it still adds the drama that only a liquid liner can, but is softer chrome color for a freckled-face strawberry blonde like me! And at $5, it’s a steal!! 
Glow Baby Glow Luxe :
Lauren’s signature look is a dramatic eye, bronzed California glow and a nude lip.  She loves wearing mark Glow Baby Glow Luxe in Sun Luxe because it’s a true nude with the perfect amount of shimmer.    Hook-ups:  ”I am obsessed with hook-ups because they are the perfect way to customize your color and simplify your life. I often leave clients with a connector and whatever mark lip gloss they are wearing hooked up to a mascara/liner/shadow/gel blush so they can easily slip it in their clutches and have it for touch-ups.  The combinations are endless.”
