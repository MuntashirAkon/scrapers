Oh Come The Fuck On, Zara!/n

Gee, Zara! What a great way of showing body diversityâ€¦
On Tuesday, Irish radio personality Muireann O'Connell posted the (above) photo on Twitter of the store's recent advertisement, and noticed something was offâ€¦
While the campaign has the text "Love Your Curves" plastered over their new ads, the company totally used thin, non-curvy models to sell their denim line! We're not exactly sure what message they're trying to send!

Almost immediately, the Twitterverse saw the pic and was completely baffled by the retailer's attempt to promote "curvaceous" body types.

All bodies are beautiful of course, but this is a curvy figure? Really? https://t.co/plg8KlJ0uw

@MuireannO_C to people slating the models, you're missing the point. @ZARA wake up. This is not curvy. #EatingDisorderAwarenessWeek

@michlan @MuireannO_C They must know it's ridiculous. I wondered who signed off on that ad @ZARA

@kellyanne_young @MuireannO_C Exactly. I know we all come in different shapes and sizes. Those girls are lovely but they have ZERO curves. ðŸ˜‚

Even though she is outraged, Muireann makes it clear she is criticizing Zara's marketing department, and NOT the models themselves.

Can i just say, this is nothing to with the models. It's the marketeers that have distorted their image & fucked up.
