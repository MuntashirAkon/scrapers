#BoycottBudwiser Is STILL Trending & Twitter Is Going IN Over The HIGHlarious Typo!/n

Sounds like the joke is on Donald Trump fans who have made #BoycottBudwiser trend on Twitter after seeing the pro-immigration commercial during the Super Bowl on Sunday.
They didn't even spell the name of the company they're boycotting right!
As we previously reported, some Twitter users were annoyed Budweiser highlighted the story of an immigrant AKA brewery founder Adolphus Busch legally making his way to the United States. Sadly for them, only the misspelled version of the hashtag is trending. LOLz!
See some of the tweets (below), as well as those of the users calling it out! 

I basically already do. Miller Lite is where it's at! #boycottbudwiser
