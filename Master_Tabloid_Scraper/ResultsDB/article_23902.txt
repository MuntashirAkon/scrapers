David Schwimmer and his wife, Zoë Buckman, are pulling a Ross and Rachel, taking a break from their relationship after almost seven years of marriage.

The couple released a joint statement to Us Weekly on Wednesday (Apr. 5, 2017), reading: “It is with great love, respect and friendship that we have decided to take some time apart while we determine the future of our relationship.”
Schwimmer, 50, and Beckman, 31, continued, “Our priority is, of course, our daughter’s happiness and well being during this challenging time, and so we ask for your support and respect for our privacy as we continue to raise her together and navigate this new chapter for our family.”
The Friends alum first met the British photographer on the set of his 2007 directorial debut, Run, Fatboy, Run, in London. They tied the knot in 2010 before welcoming their daughter, Cleo, a year later.
This is the first marriage for the pair.
