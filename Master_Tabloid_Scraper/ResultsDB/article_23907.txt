So this is what Khloé Kardashian keeps in her makeup bag!

As someone who constantly has her makeup done by professionals, the reality star has picked up a few tricks and tips through the years — including where to look for some of the most reliable beauty products on the market. In a new post on her app, Kardashian breaks down her favorite hair and skincare essentials.
“I rock heavy with these beauty products—everything from oil blotting sponges to ancient Indian clay,” she says. “They’re just so fucking good!”
Here are her current obsessions!

 





Nunzio Saviano Anti-Frizz Sheets, $18.
Tame flyaways in seconds! Kardashian says she keeps these individually-packed sheets to control her crazy hair.
“Coconut oil-infused sheets tame frizz and keep my curls looking tight and right,” she says, adding that they’re so easy to throw into a purse.
 

 





Aztec Secret Indian Healing Bentonite Clay, $9.92.
“Supposedly Cleopatra used clay to get a deep pore cleansing so if it’s good enough for her, than you know it’s good enough for me,” Kardashian explains why this powdered clay rules.
Many beauty addicts swears by mixing a spoonful of this stuff with apple cider vinegar that a “pulsating” facial.
 

 





Avoplex Cuticle Oil To Go, $7.50.
To keep her nails looking on fleek, Kardashian hydrates her nail beds with cuticle oil.
She notes, “This super thick oil is good for my dry cuticles, but I use it all over my hands!”
You can also give week-old manicures a new life by putting this on your nails for an added shine.
 

 





Real Technique Brushes, $16 to $26.
Created by Samantha and Nicola Chapman of the Pixiwoo YouTube channel, these brushes already have a huge following in the beauty community.
Kardashian says she’s a fan of the brand’s Bold Metals collection “because they are so fucking glam.”
 

 





Beauty Blender Blotterazzi by BeautyBlender, $20.
Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner already swear by the Original BeautyBlender makeup sponge, so it’s not surprise that their sister is a fan of the brand, too!
“I hate being oily so I take these portable oil ‘blotters’ with me everywhere,” she says of the reusable blotting pads. “They suck EVERYTHING up.”
 

 





Dr. Jart+ Water Replenishment Cotton Sheet Mask, $7.50.
Sheet masks are an affordable way to give your skin some extra love without dropping a ton of cash for a facial at the spa. Kardashian recommends this mask for an extra boost of hydration.
“Dolls, I put one of these sheet masks on and lay in bed to relax,” she says. “It cools my skin down and I swear I feel like I’m at a spa even if I’m at home!”
