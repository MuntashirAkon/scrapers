Adele has completed her comeback look with a new haircut.
The British singer showed off her new, much shorter hair during her performance on the X Factor UK finale on Sunday (Dec 13, 2015) in London, England. The cut, several inches shorter than what she’s been sporting lately, received more attention than her actual performance on the show.
The vocal powerhouse brought down the house with the record-breaking hit, “Hello,” and reportedly told the crowd that she’s been waiting half her life to do that.

Expect many women to their hairdressers asking for “the Adele” haircut. After all, the her trademark smokey eye look has prompted many female fans to copy her eyeliner.
In addition to her latest album, 25, breaking tons of records, the singer also announced last month that she’s embarking on her first tour in four years.
