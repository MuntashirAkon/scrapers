Move over, Kim Kardashian. You’re not the only Elizabeth Taylor fangirl in town.

Katy Perry graces the cover of the Harper’s Bazaar’s September 2015 issue and gushes about her love to the silver screen legend to the publication. As one of the magazine’s selected icons, the “Roar” singer even channels the actress — as an Andy Warhol painting — in the accompanying spread.

Perry is joined by the likes of Oprah Winfrey and Dakota Johnson as stylist Carine Roitfeld and photographer Jean-Paul Goude team up turn some of today’s famous faces into history’s greatest figures.
