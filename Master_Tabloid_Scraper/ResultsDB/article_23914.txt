Schulman and Perlongo first announced that they were expecting in May on social media.
“Words [can’t] capture the excitement and joy I feel about becoming a father,” Schulman, 32, announced in an Instagram post at the time. “I am so in love with you Laura and thank you for giving me this incredible gift. You inspire and excite me every day.”

Perlongo made headlines (and turned a fair number of heads) when she walked the red carpet alongside Schulman at the MTV VMAs in a belly-baring ensemble that featured a silver body chain, an opened olive-colored jacket, and little else.
“If you told me I was going to feel this great at eight months pregnant, I would’ve been like, ‘No way,’ ” Perlongo told PEOPLE at the event.
“I’m just so happy to be the guy on the red carpet with the pregnant lady who is killing it, just looking incredible,” Schulman added at the award show. “She was already beautiful and now she’s, like, times-10 beautiful.”

And the couple hasn’t been hiding Perlongo’s bare belly since their big red carpet moment.
In the days leading up to their baby girl’s birth, Schulman and Perlongo both shared tummy-baring photos on Instagram, with the filmmaker showing the mom-to-be lounging in a tub with an island set up on her bump.

The freelance copywriter in turn shared a photo of her belly at a pumpkin patch in Warwick, New York.
Of course, flashing Perlongo’s belly isn’t the only thing the couple has been up to. They also created an ad to draw attention to the need for paid parental leave in the United States.

“Globally, moms get an average of 106 days of paid leave for a new baby, while dads only get an average of seven,” Schulman says in the video.
Perlongo calls these statistics “totally sexist” because “it’s basically saying that taking care of a baby is a woman’s job.”
