Surprise! Joel Kinnaman is a married man.   
The Suicide Squad, 36, actor revealed that he secretly wed his tattoo artist girlfriend Cleo Wattenstrom while appearing on The Talk Friday morning.  
When co-host Aisha Tyler asked what his “girlfriend” thought about his Suicide Squad tattoo, Kinnaman was quick to correct her.   
“My wife, my wife,” he said smiling.   
The actor didn’t reveal exactly when they got married and he was not wearing a wedding ring during the show.  
While Kinnaman didn’t spill any details about their wedding, he did admit that his wife got a chuckle from his Suicide Squad tattoo.  
“She was laughing at it,” he said. “A lot of tattoo artists are not so precious about their tattoos.”

Wattenstrom has a collection of body ink, including on her face, neck and hands.  
“My wife, she’s got this, I call it ‘Mr. Baby.’ It’s like a baby with a mustache on it,” he said. “[Tattoo artists are] all friends, they get drunk and do tattoos on each other. They’re actually the ones that are the least precious about it. She was like, ‘His line work needs some work!'”  
Kinnaman and Wattenstrom began dating in 2014, but have kept their relationship mostly out of the spotlight. The pair stepped out together at the premiere of his film Run All Night.   
The actor previously dated Olivia Munn, who now dates NFL star Aaron Rodgers.
