MacLean drew attention for pole dancing up until a week before her due date.   
“I have really enjoyed putting on my pole heels, getting dressed up and taking pictures,” she told PEOPLE. “Not just for social media but for myself! And also to document my pregnancy journey. Plus, I’m having fun and am not in any way putting my child at risk.”

The dancer, who was crowned the 2012 and 2014 Miss Pole Dance Australia champion, now teaches pole dancing classes and performs across the globe.   
MacLean took a short break from tricks and inversions during her pregnancy, but her split game was still going strong – up until she went into labor.  





 Last day in hospital! They have treated us so well and baby John Rocco is happy and healthy! We couldn't be happier! ❤️
