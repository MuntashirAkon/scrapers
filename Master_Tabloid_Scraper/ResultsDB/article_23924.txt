Congratulations are in order!It turns out Joel Kinnaman and Cleo Wattenstrom are married. The 36-year-old actor was talking about his upcoming movie, Suicide Squad, and the tattoos he and the cast got together, when co-host Aisha Tyler mentioned his girlfriend."Your girlfriend is actually a tattoo artist, so what does she think of it?" she asked."My wife," Kinnaman corrected. "She was laughing at it. A lot of tattoo artists are not so precious about their tattoos. My wife, she's got this, I call it 'Mr. Baby.' It's like a baby with a mustache on it. They're all friends, they get drunk and do tattoos on each other. They're actually the ones that are the least precious about it. She was like, 'His line work needs some work!'"

The House of Cards actor was previously tied to actress Olivia Munn, who now dates NFL star Aaron Rodgers. Munn and Kinnaman began dating in March 2012 but called it quits in 2014. The two began as close friends but brought their relationship to the next level, which helped them get through their breakup."They've been able to stay really good friends even through the breakup," a source told Us Weekly, which broke the news of their split. "It's just made things much easier for both of them."Kinnaman made his relationship with Wattenstrom official at the tail end of 2014, as Munn had publicly moved on with Rodgers, too. A private couple, Kinnaman and his now-wife have stepped out together publicly only a few times, including the premiere of his movie Run All Night.Congratulations again to the happy couple!
