David Schwimmer's little girl is growing up fast—faster than he would like, it turns out.Because the 49-year-old actor plays a widowed sommelier in AMC's upcoming drama series Feed the Beast, when he appeared on NBC's Late Night Wednesday, he had a wine tasting with host Seth Meyers. "My research is tough," he joked. "I have to drink a lot, so that's not easy."Perhaps David should have invited his 5-year-old daughter, Cleo Buckman Schwimmer, to join them. "Listen, I don't know how the other parents are out there, but my thought when I pour myself a glass of wine that my wife and I have over dinner and my daughter says, 'Can I try that?' I thought, 'Well, if you start saying no then they're just going to want it more.' So, I thought 'Yeah, all right. Go ahead, sweetie. Have a sip.' And luckily she was like, 'Blah! No!'"David assumed he was in the clear—but oh, how wrong he was! "It worked until I let her try beer and she loves it. I'll find her in the middle of the night just [guzzling it]. I'm serious!" he said. "If I have a beer out, I have to watch it, because if I turn my back, she'll be chugging it."Seth joked, "You've got a long life ahead of you!"
