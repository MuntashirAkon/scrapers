Miss Cleo Lawsuit -- Psychic Network Tarot Parts French Toast Crunch TV Ad/nA call to ﻿Miss Cleo could cost General Mills a chunk of its cereal fortune -- thanks to a lawsuit you'd think a certain Jamaican lady woulda seen coming.  The Psychic Readers Network -- which owns rights to the famed psychic persona -- is going after the cereal giant for using MC in new French Toast Crunch commercials.  In the suit, PRN says it's dropped more than $100 mil in advertising to make Miss Cleo a pop culture phenom -- and then French Toast Crunch came along and jacked the whole Cleo look. The psychics want all profits attributed to the ad campaign. General Mills had no comment on the lawsuit./n
