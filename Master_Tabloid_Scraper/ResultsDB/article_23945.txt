Miss Cleo Dead at 53/nThere won't be any more calls to Miss Cleo ... the iconic TV psychic is dead after battling cancer ... TMZ has learned.  A rep for Miss Cleo -- whose real name was Youree Harris -- tells us she died Tuesday morning in Palm Beach County, FL. We're told she was recently hospitalized, but was discharged last week to a hospice center. We're told Cleo was originally diagnosed with colon cancer ... but it spread to her liver and lungs. The rep said Cleo remained a  "pillar of strength " during her illness ... and died surrounded by family and friends. Cleo's Jamaican character and her psychic commercials became a cult classic in the late '90s ... thanks to her catchphrase,  "CALL ME NOW! "  Miss Cleo was actually born in L.A. -- she just nailed the accent. After the Psychic Readers Network closed shop, Cleo bounced around to various jobs ... including voicing a character in the video game,  "Grand Theft Auto: Vice City. " R.I.P. NOW!/n
