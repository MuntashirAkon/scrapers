Psychic Readers Network Sues Benefit Cosmetics Over Miss Cleo/nMiss Cleo's famous image and accent got jacked by a makeup company before her death ... according to her old pals at the Psychic Readers Network.  The PRN filed a lawsuit against Benefit Cosmetics for hawking makeup products with the help of Youree Harris, who played Cleo. According to docs, Harris was hired in March 2015, and Benefit created a Cleo doppelganger for its promos.  PRN says Harris not only acted just like Miss Cleo in the spots, but one of them was titled  "Flawless Friends Network " ... an obvious rip-off, they say. Harris died in July, which was right around the same time Psychic Readers says it found out about Benefit's Miss Cleo-esque campaign. Ironically, it took more than a year for a network of psychics to figure this out. Still, they want Benefit Cosmetics to kill all the ads and fork over the money they made off the  "Cleo " campaign./n
