Looney Martin Lawrence Gets The ‘Yes’ From Longtime Girlfriend/n
Here’s proof freaky funnyman Martin Lawrence is stone-cold nuts:
he bought a $500,000 emerald cut diamond engagement ring –
complete with BOTH their initials set in gold –
for his nurse practioner love Roberta Moradfar. Lucky for twice-wed Martin,
who had a berserk gun-waving meltdown on an L.A. street in 1996,
ravishing Roberta said yes! Here’s hoping he won’t wind up a three-time loser! /n
