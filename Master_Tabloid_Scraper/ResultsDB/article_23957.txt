CANNES GLAM: Charitably Chic Stars At Artists For Peace And Justice/n
Elizabeth Banks dazzled at the Artists for Peace and Justice event at the Cannes Film Festival on Thursday, stepping out in an impeccably embellished, cap-sleeved mini. The blonde babe added a little edge to the look, rocking open-toed, lace-up booties on her feet. The highlight of the ensemble was the daringly low, cutout back, which had incredibly sexy effect.PHOTOS: Elizabeth Banks, Gerard Butler, Michelle Rodriguez, Mischa Barton And Roberta Armani At Artists For Peace And Justice
Mischa Barton opted for another look from Marchesa, but we werenâ€™t crazy about the super busy, horse embroidered party dress, which she paired with Christian Louboutin lace booties.
