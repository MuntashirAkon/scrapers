Hacked ABC News Twitter Accounts Send Explicit Pro-Trump Tweets To Millions Of Followers/n

Oy.
Three ABC News Twitter accounts (ABC News, Good Morning America, and GMA's GMA Pop News) were hacked early on Thursday morning by someone ranting about Donald Trump, fake news, Tyler The Creator, and other expletive-laden things.
The network quickly deleted the tweets and regained control of their accounts, but not before the people of the Internet were able to snag some screen shots.
