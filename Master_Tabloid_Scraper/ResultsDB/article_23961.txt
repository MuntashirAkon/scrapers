Laverne Cox Apologizes To Metallica After Getting DRAGGED For Forgetting To Mention Them During Their Own Grammys Introduction!/n

Awkward!
Laverne Cox faced some serious criticism when she forgot to mention Metallica while introducing their Grammys collaboration with Lady GaGa. Talk about a face palm moment!

We're not sure how exactly the Orange is the New Black actress messed this up, but the activist did in fact say:

"Ladies and gentleman, all my gender non-binary people watching tonight, eight-time Grammy award winners and six-time Grammy winner, Lady Gaga."
Oh man. Obviously, fans of the legendary rock band DRAGGED the 32-year-old on Twitter for the on stage hiccup (below).

Metallica thing is pissing me off. Laverne Cox doesn't intro, then mic doesn't work. That's a legendary band. No respect paid by Grammys.

So Laverne cox forgot to introduce Metallica and the sound crew forgets to turn on their mic's… Where's the respect?

Hey @TheCrusher007, have a word with @Lavernecox about @Metallica. She should know who they are by now.

Worst intro EVER @Lavernecox , you forgot to even SAY @Metallica cuz you were too caught up in your own crap.#GRAMMYS

Harsh. Of course, Mix Cox felt TERRIBLY about the blunder as she too took to the social media site and wrote:

I am so sorry to #Metallica and all their fans. I am told I didn't say their names during the intro. Love you Metallica. You Rock. #Grammys

Whomp, whomp. It probably didn't help that the band's fans were already in a bad mood due to technical issues Metallica faced during their performance.
Hopefully this EPIC fail doesn't get Laverne blacklisted from presenting at future award shows. Fingers crossed!
