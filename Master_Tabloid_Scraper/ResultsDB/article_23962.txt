Scottie Pippen's Lawyer Addresses Those Troubling 911 Calls Made By Larsa — See What She Said HERE!/n

Oof.
Once the 911 calls Larsa Pippen made about her (now estranged) husband Scottie Pippen getting "aggressive" with her hit the press, we knew we'd be hearing from the former NBA star's lawyer.
As you surely know, there has been quite a bit of drama surrounding Larsa and Scottie's divorce as rumors of infidelity and domestic disturbances have circulated in the media. However, two separate 911 calls made by the Real Housewives of Miami alum have highlighted how intense the problems actually were that the twosome had home.

In a recent statement, the 51-year-old's attorney Roberta G. Stanley addressed the upsetting voice recordings as she relayed: 

"Mr. Pippen is aware that some members of the press have obtained 911 recordings recently made by Ms. Pippen. While these recordings speak for themselves, Ms. Pippen did not make any allegations of physical violence by Mr. Pippen. Although Mr. and Ms. Pippen both have public personas, their divorce is a private matter. Mr. Pippen requests that the press respect his privacy and that of his family during this time."
While Scottie is seemingly owning up to his part of the drama, it looks like he's downplaying the scary specifics of what caused Kim Kardashian West's bestie to call the police. In case you forgot, after one incident, it's said the police discovered that Pippen had smashed his cell phone screen out of frustration — which obviously scared Larsa.
Of course, these 911 dials were made before Scottie filed for divorce from the 42-year-old. Perhaps this was the basketball icon's way of officially ending all of the dramz. We mean, the couple do have four children together!
Here's hoping Scottie and Larsa can somehow manage to put all this behind them and have an amicable divorce, at least for the sake of their kiddos. Sigh!
