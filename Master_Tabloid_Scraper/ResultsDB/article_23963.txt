One Direction Fans Go CRAZY After Tour Website Hints At Reunionâ€¦ Is 1D Already Planning A Comeback?!/n

Directioners never say die!
Ever since One Direction first went on hiatus back in March, fans have been holding onto hope that a reunion would soon be coming.
But despite all four members diving into solo projects, their loyal fanbase started a social media frenzy on Tuesday when it appeared that the chart-topping boyband might actually be reuniting!

That's because for some reason or other, the band's website added a "future events" tab to its tour page â€” and 1D fans went totally ballistic!
The possibility that Harry Styles, Louis Tomlinson, Liam Payne, and Niall Horan would be performing sometime in the near future was enough to send fans into hyperdrive, generating the hashtag #ThisIsNotTheEndOfOneDirection.
Unfortunately, the excitement was short lived as the mysterious tab was removed from the website shortly after it appeared. Ugh!
Whether it was an honest mistake, a tease from 1D management, or just Simon Cowell being a trollâ€¦ it certainly gave fans something to talk about!
Ch-ch-check out the best Twitter reactions to the fake announcement (below)!
