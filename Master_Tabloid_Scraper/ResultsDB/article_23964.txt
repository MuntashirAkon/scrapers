Celebrate Now And Then's 20th Anniversary By Checking Out Which Current Stars We'd Love To See Cast In The Remake!/n

Has it really been that long?!
The 1995 classic Now and Then came out exactly 20 years ago today, and we're thinking back on all the magic it's brought us.
From an outstanding cast that included Demi Moore, Rosie O'Donnell, Christinia Ricci, and Melanie Griffith, to a wonderful coming of age story that's basically the female equivalent of Stand By Me, we're feeling it's time for a re-watch!
