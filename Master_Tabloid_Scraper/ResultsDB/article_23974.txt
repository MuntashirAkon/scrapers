In celebration of the defeat of the Defense of Marriage Act, celebrities crammed into New York’s Cathedral of Saint John the Divine last night for Logo’s Trailblazers event. Those honored at the event included the cast of Orange Is the New Black, Edie Windsor and Roberta Kaplan whose court case resulted in the Supreme Court’s ruling DOMA unconstitutional and Jason Collins, who became the first out gay man playing a major team sport when he came out last year.
Other attendees included Daniel Radcliffe, Joe Manganiello, Adam Levine and Lance Bass. Sia, Pete Wentz and Macklemore performed at the star-studded event.
