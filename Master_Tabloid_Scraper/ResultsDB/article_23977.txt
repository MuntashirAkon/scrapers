 While Eva Mendes has the real Ryan Gosling, Katy Perry has the next best thing (or even better perhaps), Florence + The Machine guitarist Robert Ackroyd. The musician looks very much like the Drive heartthrob and is smoking hot when he’s on stage and even when he’s just posting cute and candid pics via Instagram. 
The “California Dreaming” pop star, 27, was spotted with her British beau, who is believed to be in his late twenties, at the Coachella Music Festival this past weekend, and the two couldn’t keep their hands off each other. 
For a closer, hotter look at the man that Katy has moved on to after her public divorce from Russell Brand, click the pics. 
Like RyGos, Rob has a fan base on Tumblr. While Ryan has “Hey Girl,” his lookalike has “F**k Yeah Robert Ackroyd.” What do you think of Katy’s new beau: hot or not?
Check out the new couple kissing and cuddling at Coachella in Indio, Calif. below:
