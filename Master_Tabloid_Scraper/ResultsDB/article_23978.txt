Martin Lawrence is tying the knot, and the engagement ring he picked out for his bride-to-be is no joke.
The Bad Boys star’s girlfriend Roberta Moradfar confirmed the news on Instagram Monday, posting an adorable photo collage featuring her stunning new rock.
“And I said ‘YES!’” wrote the aesthetics nurse practitioner, adding that Monday “marks a huge milestone in my life.” She ended the post with hashtags including #LoveofMyLife and #M❤️R. The couple’s initials are also etched into the bottom of her engagement ring.

The ring was custom-made by Iconic Jewels, which donates a portion of each purchase to the buyer’s charity of choice. Moradfar’s engagement ring, which TMZ reports is a 5 carat emerald cut ring worth $500,000, was revealed on the store’s Instagram page.
