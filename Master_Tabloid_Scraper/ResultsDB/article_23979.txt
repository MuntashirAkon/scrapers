5 Things to Know About Roberta Vinci, the Woman Who Beat Serena Williams/n
It was the upset watched ’round the world.  
On Friday, Serena Williams‘ quest for a historic Grand Slam came to a shocking end when she was defeated in the semi-finals of the U.S. Open by Roberta Vinci of Italy.  
And while it might take us a little longer to get over our heartbreak at seeing Williams lose – there are some things that not even a surprise appearance from Drake can’t fix – we’d be lying if we said that Vinci, 32, didn’t capture our attention. After all, she did have to overcome 300 to 1 odds in order to secure her place in the U.S. Open Finals.  
 So, without further ado, allow us to help answer the question that’s on everyone’s minds right now: Who, exactly, is Roberta Vinci?  
1. Until Recently, She Was the No. 1 Doubles Player in the World While the U.S. Open Finals will be Vinci’s first ever singles Grand Slam Championship match, she is familiar with being in the winner’s circle. With her longtime doubles partner, Sara Errani, Vinci has won a total of five Grand Slam Doubles titles, and the pair was ranked No. 1 for three consecutive years from 2012 to 2014. In a move that shocked the tennis world almost as much as Friday’s upset, Vinci and Errani announced the end of their on-court partnership in March 2015, though they remain friends.

2. She’s Known for Her Backhand Vinci’s signature move is a rare one in the tennis world: a one-handed backhand. Though the skill allows Vinci more control over the ball, and is ideal for volleys, it doesn’t always hold up well against the super-fast, super-powerful shots that most modern players prefer. “The one-hander is so hard; they play so strong now,” she told the New York Times in 2014. “But I’m 31 and cannot change anymore.”

 3. She’s Playing Her Childhood Friend in the Final When Vinci takes the court on Saturday for the Championship, she won’t just be facing off against her fellow countrywoman, Flavia Pennetta – she’ll also be taking on a good friend. Vinci and Pennetta, who defeated Simona Halep to advance, have known each other since childhood, and were even roommates for four years at a tennis academy. The two are still so close that they actually warmed up for their respective semi-finals side-by-side.

4. She’s Making History of Her Own Advancing to the finals means that Vinci has guaranteed herself a spot in the annals of tennis history, as Saturday’s Championship will be the first ever all-Italian final of the Open Era.  
5. Even She Was Surprised that She Beat Serena Williams Despite facing off four times before Friday’s upset, Williams had never even lost a single point to Vinci, let alone an entire match. Naturally, that meant that when the Italian woke up on Friday, she wasn’t expecting to go to bed a victor. When interviewers asked Vinci after the match what made her believe winning was a possibility, Vinci responded with a laughing, “No.”  
“It’s true, when I wake up, I say, ‘Okay, semi-final today try to enjoy [it]. Don’t think about Serena, play, enjoy! But I didn’t expect [to win].”  
Still, she was aware that the “best moment of her life” was a disappointment to many tennis fans, and she apologized to the crowd for denying Williams her bid for history: “For the American people, for Serena, for the Grand Slam and everything,” she said. “But today is my day. Sorry, guys.”
