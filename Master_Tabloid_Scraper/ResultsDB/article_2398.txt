'Frozen' Tween Star Eva Bella -- Gets Primo Cash for an Elsa Comeback/nWhatever you're making per hour can't match what  "Frozen " star Eva Bella made to reprise her voice over duties for a new doll. Not even close.   Disney pulled the 11-year-old voice of Young Elsa back into the fold to work on its Winter Glow Toddler Elsa talking doll. According to her contract, the whole recording session only took an hour -- but Eva still hauled in about $1700 for the brief gig. Now, that's an ice block of cash! No wonder the damn doll's always giggling. /n
