Italian Skydiver Roberta Mancino Named World's Hottest Female Athlete/n
Talk about a falling angel.   
Roberta Mancino isn’t just the world’s sexiest skydiver. She’s the sexiest woman in all of sports, according to a new poll by Men’s Fitness magazine.   
What makes the 30-year-old Italian beauty so special? Is it her fearless, adrenaline-fueled approach to life? Her track record of 4,000 death-defying jumps? Or the four leaps she made while entirely naked?  
Whatever it is, she’s flying high these days, after overcoming the natural fear of hurtling toward Earth all alone at shocking speeds. “When I had a fewer number of jumps, I thought maybe I was going to die,” she admits, “but now I can’t live without skydiving because it has become my life.”   
And those four nude jumps – didn’t it get a little breezy out there? “It was chilly,” she says, “but once I jumped it was a nice feeling to have the wind against my body and to not have a jumpsuit or any clothes flapping against me.”
