It's official: Serena Williams lost her U.S. Open semifinal match while Drake was on hand showing his support from the stands.The 33-year-old tennis star was defeated in her match against Italian tennis player Roberta Vinci, thereby losing her bid to become the fourth female player in history to hold all four Grand Slam singles titles in one calendar year. The "Take Care" rapper, who is rumored to be dating the tennis star, was intensely focused on the match and stood up a number of times to clap for his girl, sporting a furrowed brow as the competition drew to a close. And turns out, the tournament itself also seemed to be in on the romance reports, as Drake's hit "Hold On We're Going Home" began playing during Williams' match, causing the crowd to erupt into cheers. 

But now that Serena's lost what was arguably one of the biggest games of her career, the Internet has exploded with grand slams against her rumored beau. Last month, a source told E! News that the tennis star and the rapper, who have been friends for some time, have been talking romantically for the past month. "Things are heating up with the duo and all of Serena's friends approve of the pair," a source said after they were caught kissing at a restaurant in Cincinnati. Hmm. Something tells us their opinions may have changed...
