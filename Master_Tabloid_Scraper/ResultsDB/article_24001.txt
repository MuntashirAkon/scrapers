Michael Jackson's Pianist -- Conrad Murray Screwed Me Out of 'This Is It' Riches/nMichael Jackson's pianist could have been huge -- hauling in nearly half a million bucks -- if Conrad Murray didn't kill MJ ... so now he's threatening to sue Murray for all the money he lost.Morris Pleasure was in the band for the  "This Is It " tour, and last fall -- while Conrad was still in jail -- he fired off a letter accusing the doctor of robbing him out of what would have been his  "highest-paying job. "Pleasure's no stiff -- he's performed with Earth, Wind & Fire, Christina Aguilera, Janet Jackson, and Natalie Cole, Roberta Flack and many more -- but the MJ gig would have been his pinnacle of his career.We're told Mo P stood to make about $400,000 over 2 years of touring with Michael.By law, Murray had 90 days to work out a settlement -- but the piano man's attorney tells us they've heard nothing ... so the next step will likely be a lawsuit for the lost wages./n
