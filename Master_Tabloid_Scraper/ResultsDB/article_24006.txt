Drake -- Serena Williams' Bad Luck Charm! (PHOTOS)/nDrake is the new Jessica Simpson  ... because he showed up Friday to watch girlfriend Serena Williams in the U.S. Open ... and she lost!!! Williams was on the road to making history as only the sixth player ever to win all 4 grand slams in a year ... but that dream got derailed by Roberta Vinci, who beat Williams in 3 sets.  Drake was there to cheer her on to victory ... the first time he's watched her there. To be fair, he was present when Serena won at Wimbledon.  After the loss, Serena was understandably devastated -- but watch for her comment about Vinci's age. Is she throwing praise or shade?/n
