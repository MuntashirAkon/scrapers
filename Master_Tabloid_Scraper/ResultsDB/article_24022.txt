 Favorite Restaurant: Nobu in Malibu. I love the ambiance, and the ocean view is breathtaking. Favorite Recent Movie: I honestly can’t remember the last time I saw a movie intended for adults. It’s all about the kids these days! Frankenweenie was the last movie I saw — it was so cute!
 Favorite Book: I just ordered The Red Tent by Anita Diamant. It’s a look at the traditions and turmoil of ancient womanhood. I can’t wait to dive in!
 Favorite Song On iTunes: “Your body” by Christina Aguilera is dominating my workout mix lately. It’s catchy and really pumps me up, so those squats aren’t so painful.
 Favorite Spot: St. Barts — and my living room!
 Favorite Family Activity: Gardening. This year we planted tons of vegetables like tomatoes and lettuce so my family can always eat healthy. It’s been fun learning our way around the garden as a family.
 Favorite Cause: I’m working with brita and the Alliance for a Healthier Generation to encourage parents and children to swap out sugary beverages and drink more water. /n
