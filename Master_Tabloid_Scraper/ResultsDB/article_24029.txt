The BET Awards are giving back to Chance The Rapper for giving back to Chi-town.
The rapper — sorry, MISTER The Rapper — is the youngest recipient ever of the Humanitarian Award, for his work with SocialWorks, empowering Chicago's youth through "arts, education, and civic engagement."
While a video package including Common and 2016 recipient Jesse Williams was inspiring, we were floored — and we're sure Chance was too — when Michelle Obama popped up with a special video message!
She called the 24-year-old "an inspiration to all of us," which, coming from this former FLOTUS, is about the highest compliment possible.
Ch-ch-check out Michelle's words, and Chance's acceptance speech (above)!
