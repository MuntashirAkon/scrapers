A 33-year-old man was arrested at an apartment building in New York City where Rihanna has a penthouse.

An NYPD spokesperson confirmed to E! News that Salmir Feratovic was booked for criminal trespassing on Tuesday night (May 23, 2017). The spokesman added that Feratovic was told not to return to the residence after he had tried to visit it before.
Among multiple arrests in his past, Feratovic was arrested in May 2016 at the same location for criminal trespassing.

Another man was arrested in New York after he allegedly stalked and harassed Rihanna at her SoHo apartment in 2014. Before that, she was granted a restraining order in 2013 against a man who accidentally broke into her neighbor’s house when he thought it was her home. After another man was arrested for breaking and entering into her home, Rihanna decided to move to this penthouse in New York City.
Be well everyone, and let Rihanna live her life.
