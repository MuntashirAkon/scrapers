Rihanna is serving up all sorts of realness in her latest photo spread with Paper magazine.

Covering the publication with spiked green hair and a Christian Dior bra, the singer dons on a plethora of daring looks — including going braless in a two-piece Chanel suit — as she strikes a pose inside a New York City bodega.
“We thought it would be interesting to put a superstar like Rih in such an everyday surrounding,” explains Shannon Stokes, who styled the shoot alongside Farren Fucci. “And Farren added the ‘future’ angle to give it a twist, so it became a challenge to envision what a girl who worked there might look like.”
