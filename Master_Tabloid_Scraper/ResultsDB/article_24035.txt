Rihanna’s personal chef Debbie Solomon offered a glimpse inside her kitchen, where she serves pasta carbonara to the baddest gal in the game.

Solomon opened up about her experience working for Rihanna to Bon Appétit’s new vertical, Healthyish, revealing that she got the job after fielding catering requests for lamb shank, pasta carbonara, and more from an unknown number. The Jamaican-born chef, who is also a fan of the singer, said that Rihanna’s mom helped her fine-tune the nuances of the Barbadian and Guyanese dishes to which she was accustomed.
“It was just, like, her mom coming up and saying, ‘This is how we make it,’” Solomon said.
The chef explained that Rihanna is a “moody eater,” meaning that she prefers to choose her meals the day she eats them rather than planning them ahead. Still, Solomon keeps every protein, vegetables, rice, and pasta that Rihanna eats in stock wherever they are. She also travels with a case containing spices such as bouillon-like maggi cubes, curry, jeera (cumin seeds), Old Bay seasoning, adobo, five-spice, and garlic and onion granules.

“There shouldn’t be shame in eating food,” Solomon said of her approach to eating a well-balanced diet. “I won’t waste my calories on bulls**t. If I take a bite of something and it’s shitty to me, I’m not just going to eat it because I’m hungry. I’m going to stop eating that sh**ty thing.”
