Last night (Dec. 12, 2016), UNICEF celebrated 70 years of humanitarian work around the globe by hosting a special event in New York City where everyone from David Beckham to Orlando Bloom dropped by to show their support. Stranger Things starlet Millie Bobby Brown was also in attendance, lending the event a healthy dose of adorableness!

While walking the red carpet, Beckham chatted about his son Cruz Beckham’s new single “If Everyday Was Christmas,” which gives its proceeds to Global’s Make Some Noise Charity.
“He came to us five weeks ago, and we realized that he has a cute little voice – a good little voice – and a passion and he said, ‘You know, why don’t I do a Christmas song?’” Beckham told Entertainment Tonight. “‘Why don’t I, you know, do a Christmas song and give the-the funds to a charity of his choice?’ And we said, ‘Great. Great idea.'”

However, Beckham offered a sheepish response when asked if Cruz might ever sing with his former Spice Girl momma, Victoria Beckham.
“Oh, I don’t know about that. You’d have to ask Victoria,” he said. “I doubt, I doubt that. I’d love to see it, but I’m not sure it’s gonna happen.”
Speaking of celebrity children, ET also caught up with Bloom to chat about how life has changed since welcoming his son Flynn Bloom in 2011.
“Being a father, you know, you kind of have a new sense of responsibility,” he stated, adding that becoming a dad ushered in a new “level of compassion” in his life.
