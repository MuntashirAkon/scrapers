Cara Delevingne Accepts Humanitarian Award for Amber Heard After She Had to Leave Event Due to an ‘Emergency’/n
Amber Heard was honored at the fourth annual Unite4:Humanity gala on Friday for her humanitarian work with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) — but had to leave the event before accepting the award.
The 30-year-old actress walked the red carpet at the Beverly Wilshire Four Seasons Hotel earlier in the night, posing for photographers in a pair of black pants and a white blouse with a black bow.
Inside the dining room of the hotel where guests sipped on Billionaires Row Champagne, she sat at a table with friends Cara Delevingne, photographer iO Tillett Wright and sister Whitney Heard – but appeared to be visibly upset about something.
“She walked to her table and looked as if she was about to cry,” an onlooker told PEOPLE. “And then she left her table with her sister and her publicist, walked back to a private room — leaving Cara behind at the table.”
Delevingne and Wright later took the stage to accept the award on her behalf. Wright explained Heard had left because of an emergency.

“Our dear friend Amber unfortunately suffered a bit of an emergency earlier this evening and she had to go,” Wright said, E! News reported.”And I want to also say that I’ve never seen Amber nervous and I’ve known her quite intimately for a long time. And she’s met pretty much everyone that you could be starstruck by. But Ayaan Hirsi Ali is as close to God as you could get for her, so to know that Ayaan was here and for her to have to leave anyway means that it was a very serious emergency,” iO continued. “We both are hoping that she’s okay.”
