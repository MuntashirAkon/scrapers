HBO has released the first image of the Scandal star as Anita Hill in Confirmation, its upcoming biopic about Clarence Thomas' 1991 Senate hearings to become a Supreme Court judge.Hill was a lawyer and one of Thomas' aides at the Department of Education and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, who accused him of sexual harassment and was later called upon to testify against him during the hearings.But seriously, is anyone else getting a bit of season one Olivia Pope vibe from the photo above?!

You can also check out how similar Washington looks to Hill in the side-by-side photo above. Washington also posted the photo on Instagram, with a sweet caption thanking the network for letting her tell Hill's story."Dear @HBO, Thank you for the profound opportunity of getting to inhabit Anita Hill and help tell this story!" she wrote. "Yours truly, k-Dub (aka super excited Exec Producer)."In addition to Washington, Confirmation boasts an impressive cast that includes The Wire's Wendell Pierce as Thomas, Greg Kinnear as current Vice President Joe Biden (who oversaw the hearings), Empire's Jennifer Hudson as Angela Wright, Jeffrey Wright as Charles Ogletree, and The American's Alison Wright as Thomas' wife, Virginia.
