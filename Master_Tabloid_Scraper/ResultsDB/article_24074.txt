Babyface Sues Anita Baker/nApril 13, 2006 8:20PM ET Kenny Edmonds, aka Babyface, has sued singer Anita Baker for allegedly failing to pay him for a song he produced for her.   In the lawsuit, filed Thursday in Los Angeles Superior Court, Babyface claims that Baker refused to pay him producer's fees and royalties for the song, 'Like You Used to Do,' which he produced and Baker recorded. Babyface claims he also co-wrote the song with Baker. 'Like You Used to Do,' was included in Baker's album, 'My Everything,' which achieved gold record status.   Babyface also alleges that Baker entered into an oral agreement for him to perform at her concerts in Los Angeles, Detroit, New York and Chicago -- all in June and July of 2005. The suit claims that Babyface performed in Los Angeles and New York and that Baker cancelled the concerts in Detroit and Chicago.  Babyface claims Baker was supposed to pay him $75,000 for each of the four concerts, but that he was only paid $150,000. He is demanding an additional $150,000 for the concerts that Baker cancelled.   The suit asks for at least $250,000, plus royalties and attorneys fees. Court documents      Breach of contract/n
