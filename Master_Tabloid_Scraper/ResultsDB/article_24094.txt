Khloe Kardashian Sparks Rumors She's Married Tristan Thompson/n
Did Khloe Kardashian elope?
That’s what fans are wondering as MediaTakeOut.com reported the reality show star was flashing a big diamond ring while on a date with boyfriend Tristan Thompson this weekend.
MTO News headlined their story, “Khloe proudly shows off her new wedding ring,” along with pictures of her shielding her eyes from photographers’ glare with a jewel-bedecked finger.

While there is no evidence yet that Khloe, 32, and her Cleveland Cavaliers basketball player hunk, 26, have eloped, she was displaying the major bling on her ring finger. The pair looked close as they held hands after returning to Los Angeles after they spent time together in Cleveland.
Khloe and Thompson enjoyed dinner at the restaurant No Name in L.A. on Friday night to celebrate St. Patrick’s Day.
As Radar has reported, sources have said Khloe has begged Thompson to propose and is desperate to start a family with him ASAP.

The reality star showed her love for Thompson earlier this month by wishing him a gushy happy birthday on social media as he turned 26. She said she wished they could be looking at each other “forever.”
But Khloe, who has a fondness for basketball players, hasn’t had much luck with them. Her marriage to former Laker Lamar Odom crashed and as Radar reported, Houston Rockets player James Harden said in a tell-all that he “didn’t like all the attention” involved with dating the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star. They split last year.
Onlookers are now wondering if Khloe and Thompson could have secretly married.
