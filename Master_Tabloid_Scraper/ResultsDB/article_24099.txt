As Radar readers know, Kardashian was the victim of a burglary when she was gagged, bound and held at gunpoint in her Paris hotel in October.
She was swiped of an estimated $10 million in cash and jewelry.
In January, French police detained 17 people in connection to the robbery. Ten were charged with the crime.
In a leaked police transcript that appeared in Le Monde newspaper, the leader of the heist, Aomar Ait Khedache, told police, “So that the jewels wouldn’t be recognized, we took a joint decision to melt them down.”

Kardashian, 36, resided in her mother’s Calabasas home with her husband Kanye West and two children North and Saint during the renovation of their mansion.
