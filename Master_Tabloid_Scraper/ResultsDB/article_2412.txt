Sonja’s Love Triangle Explodes! ‘RHONY’ Star’s Ex Slams Her Hunky New Guy/n
Sonja Morgan’s love triangle just got a lot more complicated!
Producers of the Real Housewives of New York City are cooking up a new season that would feature newly-minted cougar Morgan, 54, and her 26-year-old Frenchman, Dominik Persy, as well as Bethenny Frankel, 47, and her boy toy, Russ Theriot, RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned.
That would make Rocco Ancarola, Morgan’s most recent love interest, the odd man out!

But the New York City restaurateur and promoter isn’t going down without a fight.
Ancarola told Radar, “They say ‘The Frenchie’ has restaurants in France and he models, but it’s all bulls**t. He told me himself he works at his family’s small winery. He’s known me for a while. He comes to my club [Lavo] and kisses my ass up and down.”
Ancarola, who Morgan once called a “man with stamina,” told Radar he is game for whatever happens on the show.

“It’s fun. The producers seem to want me back. Sonja is a great woman,” Ancarola said — but he couldn’t help but slam her with a mean zinger.
“Don’t let the editing fool you — I’m seeing six other women half her age, as well!” he blasted.
