Blac Chyna’s privacy has been invaded for the second time this week.

Just a day after Rob Kardashian posted several naked photos of the reality star online, Ferrari — who Rob alleged was secretly sleeping with Chyna — leaked a couple of NSFW shots of his own. Taking to Instagram, the rapper shared two shots of him in bed with Chyna.
Wearing only jewelry, the mother-of-two is seen posing topless in bed. In one picture, Chyna is grinning ear to ear as Ferrari snaps a selfie of them together.

“SMILE😁 @blacchyna,” Ferrari captioned the photos. “That 250k In Jewelry Ain’t mean Shit to RARRI.”
The pics were posted after Rob accused Ferrari of taking a photo from the bed on which he and Chyna allegedly conceived their daughter, Dream Kardashian.
“And this is the dude that posted a pic in the same bed Chyna and I made our baby in. In the house that I pay for. That robe that I prob paid for,” he wrote alongside a now-deleted photo of Ferrari. “Chyna I hope U find help and to this corn ball, u thirsty as f**k for hitting me and begging to link with me and if I don’t help u get money then u gonna expose Chyna.”
“I never been so disrespected in my life,” he continued in another post. “I just bought her 250K of jewelry yesterday. This woman is so disrespectful and I don’t care.”
