Oops! Rae Sremmurd’s Slim Jxmmi is out $100,000 after losing a expensive piece of jewelry at a concert.

While performing at Zenith in Paris Monday (July 3, 2017), the rapper’s diamond chain disappeared when he went crowdsurfing in the audience. Needless to say, he started panicking when he returned to the stage and realized his six-figure necklace was missing.
Via Revolt TV:
In footage shared by an audience member, the brothers can be seen bartering for the chain’s return, promising money and trips on tour:
“Bring the chain up here…we taking you on tour right now, bring the chain up here…We need the chain so we can keep this bitch rocking…Who got the chain? I got you 5,000 euros right now…Who got the chain? Let’s go. You know if you got it…Ooh, I swear to God…Who got the chain? Right now, I will cash you out 50,000 euros right now…who got that chain? Hold that motherf–ker up like this, hold that bitch up like this…come to the stage..If you got it, man, bring the chain to the stage, I’ll take you on tour right now.”
