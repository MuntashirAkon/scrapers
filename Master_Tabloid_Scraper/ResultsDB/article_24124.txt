Kylie Jenner doesn’t just share a tattoo with Travis Scott. She has a ring as well.

The couple continue to fuel marriage rumors when they were spotted wearing matching jewelry on their wedding ring finger Wednesday (June 28, 2017). While stepping out after a lunch date at Plancha Tacos in Los Angeles Wednesday, the two — who have been doing since April — were photographed with a silver ring on each of their left hands.
Kylie, 19, was dressed casually in a white crop top and dark jeans, while her 25-year-old boyfriend was coordinating in head-to-toe in black and a slim white shoelace belt.

Earlier this year, the duo got matching butterfly designs inked on their ankles. In June, a tabloid claimed the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star had secretly wed her rapper beau in a secret ceremony held at her private home.
“It wasn’t a big, glamorous affair like other Kardashian weddings, and only a few close friends were invited,” a source told Life & Style. “But Kylie is crazy about Travis.”
