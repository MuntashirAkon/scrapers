Kim Kardashian may not be flaunting her wealth on social media these days, but it doesn’t mean she’s curbed her lavish spending habits.

Just eight months after her Paris robbery, the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star dropped six figures on a new pricey timepiece to add to her jewelry collection. According to TMZ, the 36-year-old placed the winning bid at a Christie’s auction for a watch belonging to Former Fist Lady Jackie Kennedy.
Though the accessory — a gold Cartier piece with a simple black leather strap — was estimated to fetch $120,000, Kim’s anonymous bid reportedly clocked in at a whopping $379,500!

According to the engraving on the back, the watch was gifted to Jackie by brother-in-law Prince Stanislaw Radziwill just months before President John F. Kennedy’s assassination. The date February 23, 1963 was engraved on the back to commemorate a 50-mile hike the royal took part in on behalf of Jackie’s husband.
Kim was also said to have placed a bid on Jackie’s painting of the hike, but lost out to a higher bidder.
