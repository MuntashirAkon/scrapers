Jewel is having a great 2016 so far.After going public in January with her relationship with NFL star Charlie Whitehurst, the "Foolish Games" singer is enjoying her boyfriend's company on an exotic vacation to the British Virgin Islands. She has been sharing pics of their whirlwind trip on Instagram, making note of their multi-island adventures, which also happen to involve animals and delicious food."Had the best day today. @Cwhitey6 And I went to Necker Island for a short visit and lunch - hung with the Lemur (pics to follow) then hung at the very top of the big house," she captioned a pic of her and Whitehurst hanging on a boat. "Views of the entire BVI for days... So lovely."Now that is definitely the ideal way to beat the winter blues! With gorgeous sunsets and sandy shores, these two must be having the time of their lives while taking a load off. Ironically, some of her time spent on one island was a tad colder than she expected.
