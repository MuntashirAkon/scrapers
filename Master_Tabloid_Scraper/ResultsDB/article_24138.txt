Jewel turned heads after she was spotted leaving a Rangers game with Tim Robbins last night in New York City.The singer was seen leaving Madison Square Garden in the same car as the actor, along with several other mutual friends.So is there something possibly romantic brewing between these two? Hmmm…not so fast!A source tells E! News that "they have been friends for a long time," and that the two aren't dating.Over the summer, the 40-year-old singer announced that she and her husband of 10 years, Ty Murray, were divorcing.

"My husband, friend and partner of 16 years and I have decided to get a divorce," she wrote on her website."Ty and I have always tried to live the most authentic life possible, and we wanted our separation as husband and wife to be nothing less loving than the way we came together. For some time we have been engaged in a private and difficult, but thoughtful and tender undoing of ourselves. Allowing ourselves the time and space to redefine what we are to each other with love rather than malice."She went on to explain that she and her ex are committed to raising their son, Kase, together, saying, "Due to the spirit in which we have gone about this separation, we trust we can remain dear friends who hold each other in high esteem, which is so important to us as parents—as we wish only what is best for our son."
