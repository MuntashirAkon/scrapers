Jewel and hubby Ty Murray are proving they are the friendliest of exes.Just two days after announcing their plans to divorce after 16 years together, the former couple spent Fourth of July together as a happy family with their 3-year-old son Kase.The 40-year-old singer took to Instagram to share a smiley shot of her and her cute fam at an Independence Day parade in Colorado. "Happy fourth everyone! @typbr Kase & I enjoyed the parade here in CO. Send pics of your weekend!" she wrote with a cute pic of the trio surrounded by parade goers.

Jewel announced their split in a personal letter to fans last Wednesday."My husband, friend and partner of 16 years and I have decided to get a divorce," she wrote. "Ty and I have always tried to live the most authentic life possible, and we wanted our separation as husband and wife to be nothing less loving than the way we came together. For some time we have been engaged in a private and difficult, but thoughtful and tender undoing of ourselves. Allowing ourselves the time and space to redefine what we are to each other with love rather than malice."She added, "Our dedication to our son is unwavering and we are both committed to being the best partners in raising our son," she wrote. "Due to the spirit in which we have gone about this separation, we trust we can remain dear friends who hold each other in high esteem, which is so important to us as parents—as we wish only what is best for our son."
