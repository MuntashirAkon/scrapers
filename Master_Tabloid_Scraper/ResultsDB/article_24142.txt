Taylor Swift, Jewel and Kaley Cuoco Among Best Dressed at the 2013 ACM Awards Leave it to our favorite country darlings including Taylor Swift, Jana Kramer and Jewel to light up the red carpet at last night's Academy of Country Music Aw.../n
Leave it to our favorite country darlings including Taylor Swift, Jana Kramer and Jewel to light up the red carpet at last night's Academy of Country Music Awards.There was certainly no shortage of gorgeous embellished gowns smartly accessorized with brilliant jewels, charming clutches and enviable heels; and we were also wowed by the fresh hairstyles seen on this year's crop of stylish stars.

Pretty ponytails were more popular then ever (a savvy strategy to balance an ornate dress), and we applaudKaley Cuoco for taking a big risk with her sky-high 'do—a modern touch that boldly enhanced her curve-hugging halter gown by BCBGMAXAZRIA. Though the overarching theme of the evening seemed to be serious sparkle and all-out glitz, we were also pleasantly surprised with a few unexpected silhouettes and flirty fabrications, too!
