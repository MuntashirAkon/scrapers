Britney Spears' VMAs 'Slave 4 U' Costume Hits eBay, Plus 6 Others /nBritney Spears' old costumes are about to net one of her superfans $1 million ... or at least that's the hope of the collector who's unloading 7 vintage Brit looks. The crown jewel of Dana Proctor's collection is the iconic outfit Brit wore during her 2001  "I'm A Slave 4 U " performance at the MTV VMAs. Python not included, but she's also hawking 6 other wardrobe selections from Brit's music vids, award shows, and Super Bowl performance with Aerosmith. Some highlights: -  "Overprotected " music video Levi’s chaps- 2008 VMAs custom Versace Atelier dress-  "I'm A Slave 4 U " music video costume-  "Me Against the Music " music video (feat. Madonna) costume Important sales point: Dana's ONLY selling the wardrobe as a set. Her eBay auction ends next week, and so far the high bid is $33,400 ... so, she's a long way off that $1 mil goal. But you know Brit fans represent./n
