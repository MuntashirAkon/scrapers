J.R. Smith's Micro-Preemie Baby Takes First Bottle (PHOTOS)/nBig win for J.R. Smith this weekend -- and it happened BEFORE the Cavs' playoff game! J.R.'s micro-preemie daughter -- born at only 1 pound -- made another huge stride on Friday and had her very first bottle! As we previously reported, Smith's wife, Jewel, gave birth to Dakota  "Kota Bear " Smith in early January almost 5 months before her due date. Though the odds were stacked against her, Kota is continuing to fight -- and being able to feed from a bottle instead of a feeding tube is a pretty big deal! J.R. posted about the experience --  "My boo got her first bottle today! #proudofyoubaby #kotastrong. " It's just the latest in a series of impressive feats from the littlest Smith -- her breathing tube was removed last month and she's continuing to gain weight.  Keep fighting!/n
