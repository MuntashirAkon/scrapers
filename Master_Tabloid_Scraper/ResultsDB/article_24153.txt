Lindsay Lohan -- Sued Over Unpaid Bills ... From Her Craziest Days!/nLindsay Lohan is being sued for allegedly stiffing her former driver, but you can understand why she might not have paid ... because she had A LOT of other stuff going on back then.   First, the lawsuit ... a guy named Edson Ricci claims LiLo owes him $26,400 for transportation services he performed for Lindsay ... and another $1,439.18 because he claims he once covered her hotel bill.  All told ... we're talking $27,839.18. So here's the thing ... Ricci claims his services were rendered between August 21, 2012 and October 23, 2012. Here are just SOME of the highlights of LiLo's life during that time:  -- Her dad staged an emergency intervention, cops were called to the scene.  -- She was arrested for leaving the scene of an accident after she allegedly clipped someone with her car. -- She was banned from the Chateau Marmont for allegedly not paying a $46,350.04 bill.  -- She allegedly brought jewel thieves with her to a party ... and they allegedly robbed the place. So yeah ... if she really did skip out on the bill, you can kinda see why./n
