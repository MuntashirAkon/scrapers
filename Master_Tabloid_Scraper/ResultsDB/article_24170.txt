Born Michael Demitri Shalhoub, Sharif was a handsome matinee idol in his prime, so much so that his Doctor Zhivago co-star Geraldine Chaplin recalled how his looks created a distraction for her while making the 1965 film.
“When he walked on the … set in Spain, I took one look and said, ‘I can’t act with that man: he’s too gorgeous!'” she told the New York Times at the time.
