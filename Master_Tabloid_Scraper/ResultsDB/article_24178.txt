The Touching Secret Rachael Ray Shared With Her Dead Aunt Revealed/n
Losing a family member is tough for anyone, but for Rachael Ray, the death of her aunt, Geraldine Scuderi, has likely been especially tragic. Not only did Scuderi die in horrific circumstances after being locked out of a home in freezing temperatures, but Radar has learned that Ray shared a touching secret bond with Scuderi: In fact, she was named after her!
Ray’s middle name is Dominica, which was Scuderi’s middle name as well. No one else in her immediate family shares the moniker, making their bond that much more special.
But despite that connection, Ray was not present at the wake or funeral for her aunt last week in upstate New York, due to prior work commitments.

Her brother, Emmanuel Ray told Radar exclusively that no one in the family saw it as a slight.
“There was no one that was upset [that Rachael wasn’t there,” he said. “It’s sad that Rachael is getting dragged into this when she really has nothing to do with it. She works very hard, and not only does she work for herself, but everyone she cares about. The people that work for her, the people around her, including [Geraldine’s] family. She’s been very good to them …”
Scuderi died on the day after Thanksgiving, as Radar has reported, after getting locked out of Ray’s mother’s home in upstate New York, which she was housesitting. After several hours in freezing temperatures, her body was found in the driveway the next day. /n
