Kim’s Horror: Jonathan’s New Movie Channels Her Paris Attack/n
Kim Kardashian’s tragic Paris robbery rocked the reality star and was even turned into a storyline on Keeping Up with the Kardashians but a new movie might be hitting too close to home after the tragedy.
Her bestie, Jonathan Cheban, plays celebrity publicist Phil Cohen in the movie By Any Means, not far from how he started out with Kardashian, infamously telling her not to smile so much for the paparazzi.
But his film client is in desperate need of good pr when she becomes a victim of a horrific crime, channeling Kardashian’s brutal hold-up in her private apartment in France.

Produced by Triventure Films, Cheban tells his on-screen client the sad truth about her reputation.
“Your brand right now, it just isn’t working. You need a bit of a scandal.”
Cheban warns her “You gotta get that buzz back!”
By Any Means hits theaters on June 27.
