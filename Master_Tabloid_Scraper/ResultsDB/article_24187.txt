It was 1984 and the three-term Congresswoman often drew bigger crowds than the Democrat’s Presidential candidate, Walter Mondale.
The Mondale-Ferraro ticket went down to defeat, but Ferraro remained a force to be reckoned with.
She later taught law at Harvard, was appointed by President Bill Clinton to a position on the UN’s Human Rights Commission, and co-hosted Crossfire on CNN.
Ferraro, 75, had been battling cancer the last two years.  Her spokesperson said she was surrounded by family when she died at Massachusetts General Hospital.
