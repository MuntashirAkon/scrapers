The famed designer slash creative director even gushed about Kristen capturing the role:
"I think she's one of the greatest actors of her generation. She gives the right emotion and the right intensity immediately so it's very easy to work her, like it's easy to work with Geraldine [Chaplin]."
The flick is set to be released for December 1, and will be available only on Chanel's site or at the upcoming MÃ©tiers d'Arts show in Rome.
