The couple, who just went public with lurve back in March, have been friends for five years and both have children from previous relationships.
Sounds like a great match to us!
The lovely duo's wedding announcement was printed in the November 11th edition of Britain's posh paper, The Times: 

"Mr. C.E.J. Horner OBE and Geri Halliwell, The engagement is announced between Christian, son of Mr. and Mrs. G.M. Horner and Geraldine, daughter of the late Mr. L.F. Halliwell and Mrs. A. Parkinson."
Taking a nod from Benedict Cumberbatch's announcement are we?!
Oh, how fancy!
Congrats on your engagement, Geri and Christian!
