We could listen to this all day!
Tori Amos has released a brand new music video for the song Promise, but it was her daughter Tash's musical chops that have our heads swimming!
The 13-year-old, whose full name is Natashya LÃ³rien Hawley, participates in this hauntingly beautiful song off Tori's album Unrepentant Geraldines, and we're mighty impressed with the teenager indeed!
Tori has taught her VERY well! This kid is bound to be a star!
Check out the music video featuring BOTH talented ladies (above) !!!
