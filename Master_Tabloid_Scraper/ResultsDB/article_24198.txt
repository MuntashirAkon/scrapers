 Talk about putting faith in your man! Britney Spears, who has been under the legal control of her father Jamie since her breakdown in 2008, will now be under shared legal control by her fiance Jason Trawick.  He was approved as co-conservator today in court. Brit made the request, not Jason or her father Jamie. 
“Jamie’s thrilled,” his attorney Geraldine Wyle told reporters after the decision was made. “It’s all in the family.” 
Here’s how the new co-conservatorship will work out: 
Jamie will still have control over the 30-year-old pop star’s multimillion-dollar empire. Her father and another attorney will remain in charge of those aspects. A conservator typically maintains legal authority over someone’s personal care, such as medical care. 
A source tells People that “Britney enjoys plenty of personal freedom and that the conservatorship is mostly in name only.”
In order to end the conservatorship, a judge must declare that she can handle her own affairs. 
Most recently, Britney has made headlines with a rumored $50 million deal to join X Factor as a judge on the next season of the show.
