Feud will be third series on which Paulson and Murphy have collaborated, following American Horror Story and The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story.
The 41-year-old actress joins a lineup of A-list actors who are already tied to the project, including Catherine Zeta-Jones, Jessica Lange and Susan Sarandon.
The eight-episode mini-series will showcase the classic rivalry between the Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? stars, which featured actresses Joan Crawford (Lange), Bette Davis (Sarandon) and Olivia de Havilland (Zeta-Jones).
Set to air in 2017, the show will also feature Alfred Molina as the film’s director Robert Aldrich, Judy Davis as gossip columnist Hedda Hopper and Stanley Tucci as Jack Warner.
