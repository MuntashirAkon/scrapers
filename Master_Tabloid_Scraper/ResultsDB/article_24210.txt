Wannabe Geri Halliwell's man? Sorry, fellasâ€”Ginger Spice is engaged!The former Spice Girl and Christian Horner, a Formula 1 racing team boss, announced their plans to marry Tuesday with in announcement in The Times (Benedict Cumberbatch is totally responsible for making this tradition trendy again, BTW).The post reads simply: "Mr C.E.J. Horner OBE and Geri Halliwell, The engagement is announced between Christian, son of Mr and Mrs G.M. Horner and Geraldine, daughter of the late Mr L.F. Halliwell and Mrs A. Parkinson."

Unlike Mr. Cumberbatch, though, Geri took to Twitter to comment further about good news.

Geri, 42, and Christian, 40, went public with their relationship in March 2014. This will be the first marriage for the former Spice Girl, who has an 8-year-old daughter, Bluebell, from a previous relationship. Christian has a 1-year-old daughter, Olivia, from his previous relationship.In a 2012 interview with Hello, Geri described herself as getting "a late star on the romantic front," saying, "I didn't start dating until I was in my 30s.""I quite like having somebody to cuddle," she said. "I like that intimacy. It would be wonderful."Well, we're glad to see she's found it! Now, is it too much to hope for a full-on Spice Girls reunion at the wedding?!
