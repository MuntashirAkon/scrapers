Dr. McSteamy is a McDaddy once again!Grey's Anatomy doc Eric Dane's wife Rebecca Gayheart has given birth to the couple's second daughter.A rep for the proud parents confirmed to E! News that "Rebecca Gayheart and husband Eric Dane welcomed Georgia Geraldine Dane on December 28th, just in time for the New Year! Both mom and baby girl are happy and healthy, Billie is thrilled to be a big sister, and dad is getting ready to live in a house full of ladies!"

Eric and Rebecca will definitely have their hands full now, since  they're already in full-on baby mode with 10-month-old daughter No. 1, Billie Beatrice.Not to worry, though, dutifully daddy Eric definitely seems up for the gig!In any case, little GG is a much more welcome arrival for the couple  than the surprise they had earlier this month when a huge eucalyptus tree crashed through the wall of their Beverly Hills home. Yikes!We're glad everyone dodged that potential disaster, and congratulations to the whole family on the new arrival.
