On Monday, the 39-year-old wrote:
"I am so grateful for the past three years at E!. I had such an amazing time co-hosting with Jason Kennedy and working everyday with the wonderful roster of talent on the show including producers, staff and crew. It was such a special, good-hearted group and one I'll always consider family. A special thank you to Frances Berwick and Adam Stotsky for all the support they have shown me through the years especially during these tough times. I will truly miss everyone and looking forward to this next chapter in my life."
Well there you have it. And it seems as though the network is standing by Maria's decision, as E! Entertainment President Adam Stotsky added: 
"Our thoughts and support go out to Maria and her family and we wish them all the best knowing that Maria will tackle this with the same fierce dedication she is known for. We are grateful for Maria's many contributions to E! over the past three years."
Awwww.
The TV presenter's mother Litsa is also battling stage four brain cancer right now, so family first ALWAYS.
We're wishing Maria only the best as she embarks on the next chapter of her life.
