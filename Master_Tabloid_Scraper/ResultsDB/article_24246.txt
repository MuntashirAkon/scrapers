More Fakery! Kathryn & Faye's 'RHOBH' Truce Is All For Show/n
Feuds and face-offs are ratings gold for RHOBH, but RadarOnline.com has learned two new cast members are flipping the script and faking their truce! Kathryn Edwards will reach a temporary peace agreement with Kyle Richards‘ BFF, Faye Resnick, on an upcoming episode. But according to insiders, Marcus Allen‘s ex-wife still despises Nicole Brown Simpson‘s former pal.
Edwards was formerly married to football player Allen, who was O.J. Simpson‘s best friend. And years ago, Resnick claimed in her tell-all book that her best friend Brown Simpson, O.J.’s wife, was having an affair with Allen.
Fast forward to their explosive meeting on RHOBH.

“Kyle warned Faye that Kathryn had a bone to pick about what was written in her book,” an insider told Radar.
But Resnick claimed, “I’m not about to have a conversation with Kathryn or anyone else for that matter about something that was so painful for me.”
Now, during the upcoming episode of the Bravo hit show, “Faye and Kathryn once again have another confrontation. But the two do reach a sort of peace agreement since they have mutual friends in common. Katherine didn’t want to be the evil witch on the show.”

However, off-screen, ” Kathryn still despises Faye and thinks it was so hypocritical for her to say she wouldn’t talk about Nicole, yet she wrote a tell-all book about Nicole and the murders,.”
