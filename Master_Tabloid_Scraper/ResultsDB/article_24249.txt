Taylor Swift's Record Label Assures 'No Correlation' Between Reputation Release Date & Anniversary Of Donda West's Death/n

Taylor Swift rarely comments on the subtle (and not-so-subtle) shade in her song lyrics.
But her latest perceived slight against Kanye West is a move she apparently wants nothing to do with.
When Twitter users noticed the release date of Reputation was the 10th anniversary of the death of Kanye's mother Donda West, they were quick to call her out for a really disrespectful move.

But for once, Tay has an official statement on this shade — a publicist at Big Machine records reached out to Buzzfeed News to say "there is no correlation" between the dates, saying: 

"It is standard practice that releases come out on Fridays and we locked in this release date based on other Universal Music Group releases."
Hmm. Diabolical marketing? Or unfortunate coincidence?
What do YOU think, Perezcious readers??
