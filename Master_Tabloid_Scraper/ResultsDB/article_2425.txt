Morena Baccarin & Ben McKenzie Got Married In Secret!/n

Congratulations to Morena Baccarin and Ben McKenzie â€” the lovebirds have tied the knot!
Wow, we guess the Gotham stars learned a thing or two about going undercover because we didn't hear ANYTHING about this their wedding plans since news of their engagement dropped in November!
Apparently the couple said their vows at Brooklyn Botanical Gardens on Friday, which just so happened to be Morena's birthday! What a present!
At 15 months, their daughter Frances Laiz Setta Schenkkan probably isn't big enough to be a flower girl in the intimate ceremony, but we're sure she's looking adorable in the wedding pics!
Congrats again, you two!
