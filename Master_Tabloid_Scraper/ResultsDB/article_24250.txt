Director Patty Jenkins Eloquently Responds To James Cameron's Wonder Woman Slam!/n

Now THIS is a clap back.
On Thursday, director Patty Jenkins took to Twitter to eloquently respond to James Cameron's controversial remarks about her summer blockbuster, Wonder Woman. ICYMI, the genius behind Avatar recently stated that he felt the "self-congratulatory back-patting Hollywood's been doing over Wonder Woman" has been "misguided."

Apparently, Cameron believes there's nothing revolutionary about the new Wonder Woman venture as the lead is still "an objectified icon." Not only did the 63-year-old say the flick was "just male Hollywood doing the same old thing," but he also accused the movie of being a "step backwards."
Ouch. No wonder Miz Jenkins wrote the following:

You tell 'em, sis! Also, we love that Patty is channeling Michelle Obama's "when they go low, we go high" mantra.
However, since Mr. Cameron isn't one who enjoys being outdone, we have a feeling he'll offer up a response sometime soon. As always, stay tuned!
