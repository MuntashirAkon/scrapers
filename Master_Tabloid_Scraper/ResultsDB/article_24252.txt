We're about to explode with excitement!
As we reported, after posting a series of cryptic snake videos on social media, Taylor Swift announced she is releasing her first single from her sixth album Reputation (out Novemeber 10) on Thursday night.

MTV executive producer Jesse Ignjatovic tells PEOPLE: 

"She has been on the show many times and [has] performed with a new album coming, but not this time… I definitely wish she was coming on and performing."
In case you forgot, TayTay performed Shake It Off for the first time at the 2014 awards show before the release of 1989.
However, she still might make it to the ceremony! She's nominated with Zayn Malik for Best Collaboration for their Fifty Shades Darker song I Don't Wanna Live Forever.
Speaking of that first single:
On Thursday, Good Morning America — who is releasing the first peek of her new music video on Friday — shared a promo on Twitter, and it sounds like they just said the song title?
