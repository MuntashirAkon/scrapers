Like many singers, The Weeknd’s music has been greatly influenced by some of the greats of our time, including two legends the music industry lost just this year.

In a recent interview with the Wall Street Journal, Abel Tesfaye (alias: The Weeknd) revealed his upcoming album was heavily influenced by the late David Bowie and Prince. “I just love Bowie; I think he’s the ultimate inventor,” he told WSJ. Even the title of his upcoming album Starboy is a nod to Bowie’s “Starman.”

The singer goes on to reveal that he was scheduled to work with the legendary “Purple Rain” singer before his tragic passing this April.
While Tesfaye didn’t have the opportunity to work with Prince, he did work with Daft Punk on the upcoming album. “Their studio is like a spaceship, there’s a lot of gear,” he said, “but the way they make music, the way they explain it, is very cinematic. It’s like they’re reading a page out of a novel—‘We want to make sure that at the end, it feels like the sun’s coming up, and maybe there’s a car chase.’ They can get technical, but it was interesting how they visualize making music.”
