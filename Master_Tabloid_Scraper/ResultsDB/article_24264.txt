The Weeknd’s new single from his third studio album just happens to be prime Brangelina clickbait.

Following the artist’s roll-out of his cover art and shorter hair (RIP Abel Tesfaye’s crashing riptide), The Weeknd released “Starboy,” his brand new single that references Brad Pitt. Though the track does not reference Pitt’s pending divorce, as filed by Angelina Jolie, it’s still a little spooky that the entry of these two events into the world just happened to coincide.

“Let a ni**a Brad Pitt / Legend of the Fall, took the year like a bandit,” reads the “Starboy” lyric, which refers to the success that Pitt had in his acting career after he starred in the 1994 film Legends of the Fall.
