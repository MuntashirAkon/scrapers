Bobby Trendy Foe Jumps on Paris Bandwagon/nThere's no better way to get some much-needed attention these days than by championing Paris Hilton -- just ask Daniel DiCriscio!  DiCriscio, a  "celebrity image consultant " known more for calling Bobby Trendy a  "cheap Chinese buffet " than anything else, showed up to Lynwood jail this weekend, where the Zarf-alike waited in line in hopes of visiting Paris. DiCriscio even took to the press podium and gave an impromptu conference about his visit -- revealing little, since he never saw the incarcerated heiress! So how does this semi-trainwreck know the Hilton clan? He says he's friends with Nicky's godmother, who TMZ uncovered as Faye Resnick -- infamous friend of Nicole Simpson, who testified against OJ in the murder trial, and more recently did the interior design for Paris' pad. It's a small -- and twisted -- world after all.  Related Articles      Trendy Threatened:  "You're a Wannabe Drag Queen "     Paris Hilton's Bizarre OJ Connection/n
