Kris Jenner Officiates Faye Resnick's Wedding/nKris Jenner threw a wedding for her longtime pal and 'Real Housewives of Beverly Hills' star Faye Resnick, and even officiated the ceremony. It went down Sunday at Jenner's Calabasas pad. 'RHOBH' star Kyle Richards was one of the bridesmaids and her daughter Portia was flower girl. Khloe Kardashian even taught her some dance moves.  Kris has married off people before, including her own pastor Brad Johnson.  Faye married lawyer Everett Jack in a small ceremony, and it's hardly her first rodeo. This is marriage #4 for Faye. BTW ... there's a whole O.J. twist to this wedding. Faye and Kris go way back -- they were both besties with Nicole Brown Simpson, and of course ... Robert Kardashian was O.J.'s pal and attorney. We doubt any of that came up on Sunday. /n
