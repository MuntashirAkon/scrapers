Queen Latifah is no longer having any U.N.I.T.Y.– not with Eboni Nichols at least!

While the details of their secret split remain unclear, Latifah and her busty ex-girlfriend, who was once in the Los Angeles Laker Girls dance troupe, have not been seen together since Oct. 23, when they were photographed on vacation in Brazil.
Latifah and Nichols were together for more than a year on the heels of Latifah’s 8-year-relationshp with previous girlfriend, fitness instructor Jeannette Jenkins.
