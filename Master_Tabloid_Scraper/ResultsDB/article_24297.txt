Our Little Tonys Correspondent Scores Another Big Movie — Get The Deets On Iain Armitage's New Role Alongside Brie Larson & Naomi Watts!/n

Big congrats are in order for Iain Armitage!!
Our adorable Tony Awards correspondent landed another major film role, this time for the upcoming drama The Glass Castle starring Brie Larson!
On Monday, Lionsgate announced the start of production on the big screen adaptation of Jeannette Walls' best-selling memoir — which also stars Woody Harrelson, Naomi Watts, and New Girl's Max Greenfield.

The story follows the author growing up in a poverty-stricken family who travels through desert towns to escape the debt of her dysfunctional parents.
Sounds like some pretty dramatic stuff — which means if all goes well, our boy Iain could become the next Jacob Tremblay!
No release date is set just yet, but the film will shoot in Montreal before moving on to New Mexico and West Virginia.
But before you see Iain on the big screen with the rest of the star studded cast of The Glass Castle, make sure you catch him covering the Tonys for us again this year on June 12!
