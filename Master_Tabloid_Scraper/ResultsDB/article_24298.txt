Pennsylvania Man Fined For Goats/n

A small business owner in Jeannette, PA, outside of Pittsburgh is fighting citations for having 4 goats within city limits.
Frank Trigona, owner of Jeannette Italian Store, ignored 5 citations and even appeared in front of a judge where he was ordered to pay a $1,500 fine, which he plans on appealing.
He says he first "hired" the goats to cut his grass, but now thinks of them as his friends.  He told reporters:
"I just like animals.  Is there a problem with that? They're friendly. They do a job for me."
We don't think so at all, but unfortunately city officials like Jeannette Solicitor Scott Avolio think differently, saying:
"The city is facing a lot of matters that have more importance than this.  This is kind of a nuisance interruption that needs to be dealt with. But for whatever reason, it seems to get some entertainment value and attention."
Maybe because Frank named the goats after city officials and marched them in last years Halloween parade.  The goats even have a Facebook fan page with over 2,000 fans.
We're with you, Frank, and think the city officials are the REAL nuisance here.  Some rules are meant to be broken and nless these animals are particularly damaging the city in some way, just let the man have his goats!
Thoughts???
