Lindsanity Continues Twitter Rampage Against Father!!/n

Oh, she is PISSED!
It's an all out war of the crazies right now at the Haus of LOLhan, and the world's favorite trainwreck, Lindsanity, is tweeting up a storm after her psychotic, famewhoring father Michael stormed down girl's apartment with the fuzz to get 16 year old Ali out of that crack den!
After detailing the entire incident in 140 characters or less, LiLo started responding to other Twitter users with these gems:
@Lara_Disco my lawyer isn't answering I NEED A RESTRAINING ORDER! MY SISTER AND FRIEND TOO!!!!! HE'S NUTS!!! 
@Jeannette___ my BUILDING didn't STOP him, isn't it supposed to be safe? THAT'S WHY I MOVED HERE! it coulda been FAKE cops! dressed up!
@SpikedTequila they have no right to…. no warrant or anything
@Werix i'm calm, i just feel that everyone needs to know the truth this time. 
@deb_forman if you have nothing nice to say, don't say anything at all.. bad karma
@Evan_Guerin i'm not angry, i am wondering what the world is coming to when my father can hire cops and walk into my apt w/out notice  
@Evan_Guerin not to mention, he's the one that's been in prison most of my life…he, or the sheriffs had NO legal grounds to be here at all 
@criswatts i am always okay….. i'm not afraid of anything*i mean that
No, bb, you are NOT always okay.  Especially not now.
It's pretty bad when the authorities would agree to a Michael Lohan inspired plan just to try and get you help.
As for Michael, he tweeted - surprisingly lucidly:
Lindsay can twitter all she wants. This is about Ali and her welfare. Ali is 16 and Dina has no right allowing Ali to be in such elements
What an absolute disaster.
Thoughts??
