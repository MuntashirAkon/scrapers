Miss Cali and Mr. Olympian, Sitting In A Tree!/n

Multiple gold medal winner and pot smoker Michael Phelps likes to get around when it comes to the ladies.  Who can blame him with a hot face body like his!
And as we reported earlier, it turns out Phelps has had an on-and-off relationship with Miss USA first runner-up, Carrie Prejean, ever since last year.
During an interview with Access Hollywood's Billy Bush earlier this week, Prejean was asked about her relationship with the swimmer. To which she simply responded,  “He is a great man. Wouldn't you like to know, Billy? We can talk about that a different day.”
And we thought Miss California was open and "honest" about everything. But, not to worry, we now have confirmation that Prejean is Phelp's California bootycall sorta girlfriend when he's in town.
The confirmation that the couple have been casually dating comes from Prejean's own grandmother.  
Grandma Jeannette Coppolla says, "Carrie and Michael have been out to baseball games and lunch.  He always calls her when he is in town and they go out.”
But is it serious?
Grandma adds, “Carrie knows that he has dated a lot of girls but she enjoys going out with him and isn't serious about being in a relationship with him.  He's a nice guy and she likes him."
Wonder if Phelps is also still dating that lovely gal from Vegas too?
