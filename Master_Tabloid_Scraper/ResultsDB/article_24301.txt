At Least She's Not Lying/n

One of our favorite dykons, Queen Latifah is on the cover of People magazine this week, and it's quite telling when she's asked to talk about her private life. And by "private life" we mean who she's fucking.
While she talked openly about her private life, when asked if she was currently in a relationship, the Queen simply answered with a "no comment."
Uh huh.
Wonder what her long-term partner, Jeannette Jenkins (pictured above), thinks about that?
Latifah goes on to say, "My private life is my private life. Whomever I might be with, I don't feel the need to share it. I don't think I ever will."
Baby steps.
Kudos to the Queen for not saying that she isn't gay.
Hopefully one day she will feel comfortable enough to proclaim it publicly!
