Denise's Side Of The Bitter Baby Battle/n

Denise Richards just needs to keep her name in the media!
Fox News has mysteriously gotten its hands on the court papers she filed against ex-husband Charlie Sheen recently, attempting to restrict his custody of their two daughters.
According to her declaration, Denise describes how Sheen refuses to let the girls have common vaccinations because he thinks they will be harmed.
An attached letter from little Samantha’s former pediatrician supports this. The doctor, Jeannette J. Levenstein, actually resigned as the child’s physician in 2004 because of "differing philosophies pertaining to Sam’s preventative care, I cannot, in good conscious [sic] continue to treat her."
Denise’s declaration also alleges that Charlie still has drug and gambling problems, and she claims that he's still hiring prostitutes.
In her warped mind, Denise also claims that Charlie prefers his older daughter vs. the baby and that he has serious issues with his temper.
Someone in Richard's camp seems to have also leaked Fox News the alleged emails that Charlie sent Denise.
One, written on August 22nd, reads:
"You are a pig. A sad, jobless pig who is sad and talentless and, um, oh yeah, sad and jobless and evil and a bad mom, so go fuck yourself, sad, jobless pig."
In another email, Sheen taunts Richard's mother, who is undergoing breast cancer treatment, saying, "Go cry to your bald mom, you fucking loser."
What's so bad about speaking the truth?
