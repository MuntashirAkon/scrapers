Miranda Cosgrove may have only turned 18 on Saturday (May 14) but she is clearly wise beyond her years.
The cast of Miranda’s Nickelodeon show iCarly, as well as the cast of Victorious, celebrated Miranda’s big day by hosting a benefit for St. Jude children’s hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. 
iCarly stars including Nathan Kress and Jeannette McCurdy, as well as Victorious stars Avan Jogia and Victoria Justice, met with fans, signed autographs, auctioned off items, and even got to meet a very special guest.
They got to meet Elvis! Well, an impersonator at least.
Check out all the photos of the stars celebrating Miranda’s big day, as well as a good cause, in the gallery.
