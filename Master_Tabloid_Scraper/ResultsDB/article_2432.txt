Eight months after welcoming their first child together, Ben McKenzie and Morena Baccarin are heading down the aisle.

The couple, who first met in 2014 on the set of Gotham, are reportedly set to wed. A source tells Us Weekly, “They are very happily engaged.”
The news comes after Baccarin, 27, was seen wearing a diamond ring on her left hand while attending the 2016 Gotham Independent Film Awards on Monday (November 28, 2016) with McKenzie, 38. While the couple did not say anything about the engagement at the time, the large bauble certainly confirmed suspicions that the two had plans to marry.

As previously reported, Baccarin stated in her divorce papers from film producer Austin Chick that she had intentions to get married again. In legal documents filed by the actress last year, she wrote that she was in a “committed relationship” with McKenzie and “am planning to re-marry. Also, I am 3 1/2 months pregnant.”
Baccarin gave birth to a baby girl named Frances — a tribute to McKenzie’s mother — this March. She is also the mother to a son named Julius from her relationship with Chick.
