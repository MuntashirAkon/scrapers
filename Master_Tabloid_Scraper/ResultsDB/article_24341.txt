Miley Cyrus may have accepted the fact that Donald Trump has been elected as the new President as the United States, but that doesn’t mean she’s not going to stop voicing her opinions about the controversial politician’s family.

The singer seemingly threw some shade at Melania Trump on Wednesday (Nov. 16, 2016) when she tweeted out a screenshot of the former model gushing about hearing “Wrecking Ball” on the radio. The tweet, which still exists on the soon-to-be First Lady’s Twitter, was presented without a caption.

Though Cyrus, who endorsed Hillary Clinton during the presidential election and even campaigned for the former Secretary of State, didn’t elaborate any further on the tweet, many of her followers believed it was a low-key dig at the Trump family.

That same day, Cyrus was spotted looking chic in Atelier Ace x People Footwear slides while refueling at a local gas station in Los Angeles. With a grin on her face, she picked up a bottle of Guayaki Yerba Mate tea before retreating back to her car.

The word’s still out what Cyrus thinks of President-elect Trump’s tweet about her past breakup with fiancé Liam Hemsworth.

.@MileyCyrus – don’t worry about Liam. You can do much better and you have plenty of time—remain strong!
