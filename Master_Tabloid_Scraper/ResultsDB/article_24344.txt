Kim Kardashian and Kanye West made Cameron Sterling’s sixteenth birthday a little sweeter.

After West’s Saint Pablo Tour show on Wednesday (Nov. 2, 2016), Kardashian and her husband posed for a photo with Cameron, the oldest son of Alton Sterling, who was shot to death by police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana in July of 2016. The Sterling’s family attorney Justin Bamberg shared their portrait together on his Twitter account. “Shoutout to @kanyewest & @KimKardashian for showing 16th bday love last night to my client #CameronSterling, eldest son of #AltonSterling,” wrote Bamberg in the caption.

Kardashian wrote an impassioned essay, “#STRAIGHTUP #BLACKLIVESMATTER,” on her website following Sterling’s death. “I want my children to grow up knowing that their lives matter,” wrote Kardashian. “I do not ever want to have to teach my son to be scared of the police, or tell him that he has to watch his back because the people we are told to trust — the people who ‘protect and serve’ — may not be protecting and serving him because of the color of his skin.”
