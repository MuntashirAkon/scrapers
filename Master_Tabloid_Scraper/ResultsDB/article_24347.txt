The “Mirror” rapper revealed that he personally has virtually no experience with racism.

Lil Wayne visited the FS1 sports show Undisputed recently where Skip Bayless asked him about his experience with prejudice as an African American and a public figure. The rapper offered a surprising response:
“God knows I have been nothing but blessed,” he said, via TMZ. “My whole path, these whole 33 years have been nothing but a blessing. I have never, never is a strong word, never dealt with racism.”
When Wayne was pressed on the highly-publicized racism that’s been reported in the rapper’s hometown of New Orleans, including the killing of Alton Sterling and the turmoil following Hurricane Katrina, he explained that he does see it.

“We all wanted somebody to figure out what’s going on first, and then put a stop to it. Try to put a stop to it. Everybody come together and try to figure something out. And maybe just coming together is the solution.”
Then, the 33-year-old made it clear that, in this racially tense year, his solution is to focus on family.
“Obviously we have a bunch of differences. People feeling this way, people feeling that way. When you come to a person like me, my answer’s always the same, man. My politics, my flag, my country, my nation, my world, all that. It’s Reginae, Cameron, Neal and brother Tony. That’s it.”
