“I remember when the attack in Paris happened, people would say, ‘We need ‘Where Is the Love?’ again,'” will.i.am. says in a video. “And then Belgium happened. And then Turkey. And then Orlando. And then Philando [Castile]. Alton [Sterling] before him. Then Dallas. Everyone was calling on us like, ‘We need that song again.'”
Proceeds for #WHERESTHELOVE will benefit will.i.am’s education-focused i.am.angel foundation. The video is available on Apple Music, but you can watch it above!
