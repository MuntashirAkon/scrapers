Mischa Barton has found herself in some legal trouble after apparently ditching out on a movie job.
According to legal documents, obtained by TMZ, a judge has ordered the actress to pay screenwriter Daniel Lief $200,000 after she missed the start of production on the movie Promoted, in which she had the lead role.
Instead, Barton was apparently in Europe with a mystery man, posting pics on social media.
Leif told TMZ they had to delay production and recast the lead, which cost more than $300,000.
We’ve yet to hear Barton’s side of the story.
