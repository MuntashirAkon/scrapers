Chef Alton Brown Adopts Adorable Stray Kitten, Names Him ‘Stir-Fry’/n
Alton Brown has a new sous chef.
His name is Stir-Fry and he’s the chef’s newly adopted kitten — and Instagram photos show that the kitty is already making himself at home in the star’s kitchen.
“Remember those kittens we found at the office? Apparently I’ve been claimed,” said the caption for one photo, showing the pair posing nose-to-nose.

A name quickly followed after the kitten found a favorite perch in Brown’s kitchen: a frying pan.
“So, due to his love of the wok, I’ve decided to name him ‘Stir-Fry,'” Brown later shared.

But this feline isn’t strictly a foodie. In another photo, the young kitty stirs up some trouble in a bookcase.
“Stir-Fry hittin’ the books,” said that photo’s caption.
