Tyga is the latest star to weigh in on the shocking deaths of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile.The rapper took to Twitter earlier this evening to vent his frustrations over the police shootings, politics and fighting for what he believes in."I'm no politician but I know right from wrong. What is it going to take for innocent black people to stop being murdered by the police. We think this is bad if we don't get out and vote and Donald Trump gets in office we're really f---ed!! Black lives matter!! All lives matter!!"He continued, "They don't give a f--k if you innocent they'll kill you and say you was guilty. There's no justice being served. How would I look to raise my son in this world and teach him to honor a badge when we're being taught to say f--k the police at a young age? All we see if people that sworn to protect and serve dishonor that and murder black men, sooner or later we're gonna start taking s--t into our own hands!!"
