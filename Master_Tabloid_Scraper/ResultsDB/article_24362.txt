Anthony Bourdain isn't the only celebrity chef who can throw shade!In a new interview with People magazine, Food Network star Alton Brown was asked for his thoughts on Bourdain and his love of talking crap about other famous cooks in the industry."I don't have to defend my skills against anybody," the Camp Cutthroat host said. "I've got 14 years and 252 episodes of a show called Good Eats that I'm pretty sure I can use as a résumé for my skills."Brown continued of the outspoken No Reservations host, "When was the last time you saw Anthony Bourdain actually cook anything? I've spent 14 years cooking my own food on television and I've never seen him cook a meal."

Burn!Despite throwing a little shade, Brown added of Bourdain, "I will say this: I think that [he] is probably the best writer about food. I'm jealous of his work. He pokes a lot of things and that's fine; you have to have critics, issue provocateurs, so to speak...I'm a fan, and the few times I've gotten to work with him I enjoyed it immensely."Bourdain most recently made headlines last month when he called Guy Fieri a "douche" and Ina Garten "weird."
