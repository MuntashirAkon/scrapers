Keep an eye on your knives in this kitchen, because backstabbing is on the menu!Following this Sunday's finale of Next Food Network Star, Food Network is debuting its brand spankin' new culinary competition series Cutthroat Kitchen, which finds fan-favorite chef Alton Brown leading four chefs in cooking battles chock-full of sabotage and tricks.We've got your exclusive first look at the new series, including Brown giving a tour of the kitchen the chefs will be competing in and teasing what fans can expect from Cutthroat Kitchen...

Unlike other culinary competitions such as Chopped (a favorite among the TV Scoop team), Top Chef and MasterChef, cooking skills aren't enough to win Cutthroat Kitchen, with Brown saying: "You have to cook, but you're also having to play a game."The game? Four competitors start off with $25,000, which they must use on auction items that can either help themselves or sabotage their competition. There are also culinary curveballs, which range from the exclusive use of salt, not allowing your competition to taste their food and more. Chefs must be crafty, clever and cunning as backstabbing is strongly encouraged.Of the series' competitive premise, Brown says, "I'd like to think we're devilish but not actually mean!"
