Kim Kardashian is speaking out in the wake of the shootings of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile.In an essay posted on her website, Kim talks about the fear she has for her children and what should be done in order to affect change. "This week we watched Alton Sterling and Philando Castile, two innocent black men, get senselessly murdered by police officers. Like a lot of you guys, I watched the videos, and was appalled and completely heartbroken. I was left speechless, angry and numb," she writes."I want my children to grow up knowing that their lives matter. I do not ever want to have to teach my son to be scared of the police, or tell him that he has to watch his back because the people we are told to trust—the people who 'protect and serve'—may not be protecting and serving him because of the color of his skin."The E! star, who is a mom to two biracial children, also discusses how necessary it is for people to take a stand now. Instead of tweeting and using "hashtags," Kim urges everyone to reach out to local legislators to find justice for all the victims of alleged police brutality—not just the most recent.

"The last thing we need is to fuel anger with more hate or violence, especially toward the many incredible police officers who risk their lives every single day to protect our families and communities," she continues. "We must peacefully use the power of our voices and the strength of our numbers to demand changes in the judicial system so that brutality doesn't ever go unpunished."It is our responsibility as Americans and as parents to create a safe future for our children. We must do something NOW. We must speak up until we are heard and real, effective changes are made. Alton Sterling, Philando Castile, Trayvon Martin, Mike Brown, Eric Garner, Freddie Gray, Tamir Rice, Sandra Bland, Sean Bell...and unfortunately so many more. Hashtags are not enough. This must end now."Kim also included links to donate to the Castile's and Sterling's families. She also provided a link to help people find their local representative. She ended her essay, "#BLACKLIVESMATTER."
