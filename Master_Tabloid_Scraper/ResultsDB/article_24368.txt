While the 2016 Teen Choice Awards were full of fun and laughter, there was one, very important and very serious moment that stood out above all the others...Jessica Alba took the stage alongside ten teens whose family has been affected by gun violence and shootings across the nation, including Baton Rouge, Dallas, San Bernardino, Sandy Hook, Orlando and more.Each teen—including Alton Sterling's son—announced his or her name and the name of their family member who lost their life due to gun violence as photos played on the screen behind them and stars in the audience (like Gina Rodriguez) couldn't hold back the tears."Tonight we stand together with these teens, united in our call for peace and an end to this violence," Alba explained. "Now, more than ever, we need to stop, feel and ask, 'What's Going On?'"

Ne-Yo then took the stage to perform a touching rendition of "What's Going On" as the audience shined their cell phone lights in honor of the victims.Following his performance, Ne-Yo rejoined Alba and the teens on stage to ask viewers to encourage an end to the violence by taking a photo of the group and posting to social media alongside the hashtag #StopTheViolence."These teens had the courage to come here and share their grief and take a stand," Alba said. "All of us and all of you watching need to do the same. "Ne-Yo added, "We need to come together as one. We have to do better."
