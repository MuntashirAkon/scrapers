Late Thursday night, Jay-Z released a new song, "Spiritual," as a commentary on police brutality and the shootings of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile. "I made this song a year or so ago, I never got to finish it. Punch (TDE) told me I should drop it when Mike Brown died, sadly I told him, 'this issue will always be relevant.' I'm hurt that I knew his death wouldn't be the last…. I'm saddened and disappointed in THIS America – we should be further along. WE ARE NOT," the rapper said. "I trust God and know everything that happens is for our greatest good, but man.... it's touch right now. Blessings to all the families that have lost loved ones to police brutality."Jay Z's statement, shared via Tidal's Twitter, ended with a quote from abolitionist and author Frederick Douglass. "Where justice is denied, where poverty is enforced, where ignorance prevails, and where any one class is made to feel that society is an organized conspiracy to oppress, rob and degrade them, neither persons nor property will be safe," Douglass once said.In the song's hook, the 45-year-old Brooklyn-raised hip-hop heavyweight raps, "Yeah, I am not poison, no I am not poison / Just a boy from the hood that / Got my hands in the air / In despair don't shoot / I just wanna do good, ah / I am not poison, no I am not poison / Just a boy from the hood that / Got my hands in the air / In despair don't shoot / I just wanna do good, uh."
