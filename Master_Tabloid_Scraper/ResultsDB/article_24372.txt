Cleveland Browns: Police Threaten to Pull Protection Over Player's Dead Cop Post/nCleveland Browns player Isaiah Crowell's apology for a tasteless social media attack on cops is falling on deaf ears -- and in fact, police tell TMZ Sports ... they'll pull out of the Browns' stadium in protest. Crowell got blasted for posting an illustration last week of a cop getting his throat slashed by a masked person. He posted it on Wednesday -- after Alton Sterling and Philando Castile's deaths, but the day before 5 Dallas officers were shot and killed. The running back deleted the post and the Browns demanded he publicly apologize, which he did.But Stephen Loomis, President of Cleveland Police Patrolmen's Association, thinks the  "store-bought apology " isn't enough.  "He needs to go to Dallas, help the families who lost their loved ones last week, write them a check, look them in the eyes and give a heartfelt apology. " Loomis says Crowell's post was as  "offensive as putting a picture of historical African-American men being hung from a tree in the 60s. " He adds that if Crowell doesn't go to Dallas and make a donation,  "I will pull Cleveland officers, sheriffs, state troopers out of First Energy Stadium this season if he doesn't make it right. " As for Crowell admitting he was wrong and acted out of rage -- Loomis says,  "You're a grown ass man, and you claim you were too emotional to know it was wrong? Think we'll accept your apology? Kiss my ass. "  Crowell did meet with Cleveland's police chief, but Loomis isn't satisfied. He's demanding the Browns and /or the NFL drop the hammer./n
