The Game & Snoop Dogg: L.A. Peacemakers /nIt was a remarkable moment ... The Game and Snoop Dogg forged an alliance with L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti and LAPD Police Chief Charlie Beck, in an emotionally powerful plea for peace. Game and Snoop, who were in downtown L.A. Friday morning for a peace march, met with the Mayor and Chief behind closed doors and then they all walked out in lockstep to make their case for everyone to stop the killings, the murders, the carnage. Â  You gotta listen ... there's palpable anger about events over the last week from all of them, but it's all tempered by what has become a revelation for salvation./n
