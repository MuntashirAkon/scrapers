Nick Cannon: Rockin' Cleveland Protest ... in His Turban /nNick Cannon is fully woke and making statements -- both political and fashionable -- outside the RNC in Cleveland. Nick was square in the middle of a Black Lives Matter protest on Monday. He was the one sporting the turban, if you couldn't spot him in the crowd. The  "America's Got Talent " host also led a BLM protest in NYC earlier this month after Alton Sterling and Philando CastileÂ were shot and killed. That time he opted for black headgear. Nick's clearly been stepping up his game in the political activism department./n
