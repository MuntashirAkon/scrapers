Yoko Ono Rushed To The Hospital/n
Yoko Ono was rushed to a New York hospital Friday to seek treatment for “extreme flu-like symptoms.”
Her publicist, Elliot Mintz has since spoken out, denying initial reports that the 83-year-old had suffered from a stroke. “It was never ever a stroke,” he told People. “She was suffering extreme flu like symptoms. Her doctor thought it would be a good idea to go to a local hospital to be checked out. She went to hospital. She is being checked out.”

Ono’s son, Sean Lennon, also denied the stroke rumors. “Hey guys,” he tweeted. “It was only rumors from press: was NOT a stroke, just dehydration/tired. She is FINE Thank you everyone for your concern @yokoono.”
Mintz said that Ono’s doctors were hopeful that she could be released Saturday from Mount Sinai Roosevelt hospital, which is the same hospital where her late husband John Lennon died after he was shot in 1980. /n
