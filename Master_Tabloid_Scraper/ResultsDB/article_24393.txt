“She seems to be back to herself,” Lee’s Facebook team said in a post prior to her departure from the medical facility. They noted that before she was released, the Food Network personality was “rearranging flowers on the table, cleaning countertops and organizing seating for her visitors.”
The Tuesday procedure “went very well” and “lasted for more than two hours,” her Facebook team said Wednesday.

As RadarOnline.com previously reported, Lee said Monday that she and Cuomo agreed this week that she should undergo another surgery in her breast cancer battle.
The 49-year-old had to return to the hospital Aug. 5 following complications after her double mastectomy in May. /n
