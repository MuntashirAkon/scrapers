 Sandra Lee's Operation 'Went Very Well,' Her Reps Say — New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo By.../n
Sandra Lee‘s surgery stemming from complications in her breast cancer battle “went very well” and “lasted for more than two hours” Tuesday, her team said in a Facebook post.
The Food Network personality’s longtime love, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, was by her side “in the recovery room, as her anesthesia” wore off, her team said.

The 49-year-old, who decided to undergo the operation at New York’s Mount Sinai Roosevelt less than four months after having a double mastectomy, exhibited her upbeat flair fresh out of major surgery.
“She was insistent that [Cuomo] please have some dinner, and that her nurses do the same — and that they get some ice cream for dessert. Sandra was very thirsty, but the nurses told her she still had to wait to drink water, but maybe they could negotiate with an ice chip?”
The Semi-Homemade Cooking star, according to her team, “lifted her head slightly and said, ‘… water WAS my negotiation … I’d really love a nice glass of rosé’ … so, let’s just say her celebratory self is right in place!”

Lee’s Facebook team thanks her fans for their “incredible support.”
As RadarOnline.com previously reported, Lee said Monday that she and Cuomo agreed she should undergo another surgery after she had to return to the hospital Aug. 5 following complications after the initial procedure. /n
