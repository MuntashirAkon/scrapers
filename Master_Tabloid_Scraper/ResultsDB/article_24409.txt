Despite the hot and delayed Yeezy Season 4 fashion show on Roosevelt Island on Wednesday afternoon (Sept. 7, 2016), the women of the Kardashian dynasty picked up the slack on New York Fashion Week later in the evening.

Kendall and Kylie Jenner celebrated the launch of their Kendall + Kylie fall collection with an interactive pop-up shop at the Samsung 837 space in New York City. Tyga tagged along and Kim Kardashian stopped by to offer her support while Yung Taco gave a performance.

Guests shopped the collection’s items, such as handbags decorated with dog bag charms modeled after Kylie’s pups, which airbrush artist Malcolm Stuart and monogram artist Logan Real customized for their purchasers.
There was also a tunnel with screens displaying Kylie’s Instagram pictures and captions (as if you didn’t already feel overwhelmed by her social media presence).
