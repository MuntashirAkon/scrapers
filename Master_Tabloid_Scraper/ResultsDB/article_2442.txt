Francesca Kennedy strives to make difference in Guatemala with fashion/n

When Francesca Kennedy went to visit her family in Guatemala in 2010, she was taken aback by what she found— the lake she was baptized in, Lake Atitlan, had been overrun with blue green algae; Kennedy comparing it to “sewage” water. NASA even deemed it to be one of the world’s worst natural disasters being able to see the contamination from space.
After Francesca saw young girls collecting the contaminated water for their households, she felt she had to do something so she founded Ix Style, a fashion company that produces hurrache sandals in collaboration with Mayan Artists.

By now we all know the <a href="http://people.com/tag/queen-elizabeth/">Queen Elizabeth</a> really knows how to live, especially when it comes to <a href="http://people.com/royals/royal-bottoms-up-see-princess-kate-harry-and-the-queen-get-their-drink-on/">how she eats and drinks</a>.

The Queen <a href="http://www.travelandleisure.com/travel-tips/celebrity-travel/queen-elizabeth-travel-demand&quot; target="_blank" rel="noopener">rules the house with her meal choices</a>, including <a href="http://nationalpost.com/g00/life/food/former-chef-to-queen-elizabeth-reveals-food-secrets-including-meal-prep-for-the-queens-beloved-corgis/wcm/e39ea18f-d429-4762-8e87-52d6ac2ab8be?i10c.referrer=&quot; target="_blank" rel="noopener">banning garlic</a> from all meals at Buckingham Palace and refusing to travel without a slice of her <a href="http://www.travelandleisure.com/travel-tips/celebrity-travel/queen-elizabeth-travel-demand&quot; target="_blank" rel="noopener">favorite cake with her</a>.

And just when you thought the Queen couldn’t be more of a culinary inspiration we dug up yet another tidbit that will make you wish you could spend just one day in her royal shoes.

According to <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/what-the-queen-eats-and-drinks-2017-2/#before-lunch-she-enjoys-a-gin-and-dubonnet-a-sweet-wine-based-aperitif-with-a-slice-of-lemon-and-a-lot-of-ice-7&quot; target="_blank" rel="noopener">a report by <em>Business Insider</em></a>, the Queen enjoys not one, not two, not three, but <em>four</em>, yes four cocktails a day.

Just before lunch Queen Elizabeth reportedly has her first cocktail of the day, a <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/11047929/Gin-Glorious-Gin-How-Mothers-Ruin-Became-the-Spirit-of-London-by-Olivia-Williams-review-pacy-gleeful-fascinating.html&quot; target="_blank" rel="noopener">gin and Dubonnet</a> with a slice of lemon and a lot of ice, according to Darren McGrady, a former royal chef.

Then, during lunch, McGrady <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/food-and-drink/features/food-fit-for-royalty-what-does-the-queen-really-like-to-eat/&quot; target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed to <em>The Telegraph</em></a> that the Queen will pair her simple lunch of vegetables and fish with a glass of wine and a piece of chocolate.

“She loves it,” McGrady said.

Moreover, the late Margaret Rhodes, the <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/60-facts-about-the-queen-you-didnt-know-6592256.html&quot; target="_blank" rel="noopener">Queen's cousin</a>, claimed that the Queen will also imbibe in a dry gin martini with lunch for good measure.

The Queen then balances out her day during afternoon tea, where she sips on an herbal drink and enjoys another sweet, such as a slice of pie or chocolate biscuit cake.

Finally, the Queen ends her day with a light dinner and follows a “no starch” rule if she’s dining alone, according to McGrady. She then finishes it all off with an elegant glass of champagne before heading off to bed.

<a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/60-facts-about-the-queen-you-didnt-know-6592256.html&quot; target="_blank" rel="noopener">As the <em>Independent</em> noted</a>, this puts the Queen at six units of alcohol per day, which would technically makes her a binge drinker by government standards, but she’s 91 years old, so who are we to judge?
