Picks and Pans Review: Eleanor Roosevelt/n
PBS (Mon., Jan. 10, 9 p.m. ET)
When we hear about a First Lady with an activist bent and a straying spouse, we tend to think of Hillary Rodham Clinton. But Eleanor Roosevelt was one of a kind, as this admiring portrait on The American Experience makes clear. As the wife of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and as a political power in her own right, she had a profound impact on the national scene through the Great Depression, World War II and beyond. While fighting for economic justice and racial equality, she struggled against her own melancholy and loneliness. In gently probing her weaknesses, this 2Â½-hour documentary increases our respect for her strengths.
Bottom Line: First-class lady
