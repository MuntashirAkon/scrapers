Robin Williams Reprises Role of Teddy Roosevelt in Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb—Watch Now!/n
Robin Williams' character in Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb is front and center in the latest trailer.The late actor, who famously plays Teddy Roosevelt in the series, returns to the hit films alongside Ben Stiller, Dick Van Dyke and Ricky Gervais.He also joins a star-studded cast for the next installment of the movies, including Dan Stevens, Owen Wilson, Rebel Wilson, Rachael Harris, Ben Kingsley, Mickey Rooney and Steve Coogan.This marks the second to last new film that fans of the beloved Oscar winner will get to see.

Williams stars as a cranky old man named Mitch in A Merry Friggin' Christmas, which also features Joel McHale, Lauren Graham, Oliver Platt, Clarke Duke, Wendi McLendon-Covey and Candice Bergen.Earlier this week, the Today show addressed the actor's death investigation and how "findings in this case support the diagnosis of diffuse Lewy body dementia."Dr. James Galvin, professor of neurology at New York University, further explained, "For many people who suffer both from depression and the dementia, the depression will make the memory symptoms worse."Sources close to the Williams family told Today they found the autopsy report "illuminating," and that they hope the news "helps stimulate public conversation so that if others need help with Lewy body, maybe they'll be motivated now to get that help."(E! and NBC are both part of the NBCUniversal family.)
