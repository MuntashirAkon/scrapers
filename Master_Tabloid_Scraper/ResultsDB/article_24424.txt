Like his ladylove, Liam Hemsworth walks softly and carries a big tat.Miley Cyrus' Aussie fiancé couldn't resist showing off a new tattoo he recently got sporting a quote from President Theodore Roosevelt's famous "Citizenship in a Republic" speech—similar to one the erstwhile Hannah Montana star has."If he fails, at least fails while doing greatly," reads the line on the upper part of Liam's left arm, a photo of which he posted on Instagram.In Teddy's 1910 oration, in fact, that memorable phrase actually precedes the quote Miley inked back in July on her left forearm, which reads: "So that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who knew neither victory nor defeat."

How cute—and brainy!The 19-year-old Cyrus, who has several other tattoos including "Just Breathe" and a dream catcher on her side, got engaged to the 22-year-old Hemsworth back in May, three years after the two met while costarring together in the movie The Last Song.
