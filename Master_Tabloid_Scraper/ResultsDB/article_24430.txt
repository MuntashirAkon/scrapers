It appears Emmy Rossum finds Jessica Biel's ex-boyfriend Chris Evans fantastic.Rossum and the Fantastic Four hottie were spotted at Teddy's at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel on Wednesday night, reports an onlooker. "They were making out in front of everyone," the onlooker says.

I'm told the two met just a week ago and have taken quite a liking to each other. Before hitting Teddy's, they were at Prime Grill, a kosher restaurant in Beverly Hills, according to a source. Evans, 25, who costars as Johnny Storm in the Fantastic series and will next be seen in The Nanny Diaries, famously dated Biel for five years. Our own E! ranked him number 18 in last year's 101 Sexiest Celebrity Bodies. Take one look at his shot posted above from the movie Cellular, and you'll see why.Rossum, 20, most recently starred in last year's Poseidon and is currently recording her debut album. She dated David Wildenstein, of the billionaire art-dealing family, for about a year until 2005. (His aunt is the infamously plastic surgery-enhanced Jocelyn Wildenstein, aka the Catwoman.)Rossum' s rep insists the two didn't lock lips: "They are just friends."
