Kate & Owen Go Public/nThey've unsuccessfully attempted to hide their relationship for some time now, but last night Owen Wilson took Kate Hudson to a premiere party -- finally acknowledging their relationship by appearing together and not just snapped on the fly by paparazzi.   The two were spotted rolling into the after party for  "The Wendell Baker Story " premiere, a flick directed, produced and starring Owen's brother Luke, who was also at the bash.Britney Spears was at Teddy's last night, a tidbit Sarah Silverman shared with photogs in an attempt to get them to stop shooting her (clearly knowing her place on the celebrity totem pole).  "EXTRA " host Mark McGrath,  "Entourage " shorty Kevin Connolly, Sean Stewart, David Weintraub and ex- "Desperate Housewives " hunk Josh Henderson were all partying at the Roosevelt Hotel club.TMZ also caught Fergie, the as usual smokin' hot Kim Kardashian, and the still-got-it-goin'-on Rachel Hunter at the Avalon -- for a Lyric Culture fashion show. All this and more in today's Kim Kardashalicious edition of Star Catcher./n
