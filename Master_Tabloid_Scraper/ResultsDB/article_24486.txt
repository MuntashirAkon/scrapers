Henson, Janelle Monáe, Kevin Costner and Octavia Spencer paid a visit to the White House to attend a special screening of their forthcoming historical drama Hidden Figures that was hosted by none other than First Lady Michelle Obama. But, during the festivities, President Barack Obama dropped by to say hello and Miss Spencer could not keep her excitement to herself!

“That face when the President drops by for a visit,” the White House captioned an image of the Oscar-winner looking happily astonished after meeting the commander-in-chief.



That face when the President drops by for a visit. Today, the cast of Hidden Figures visited the White House to highlight the stories of Americans who defied stereotypes and broke glass ceilings to advance human space flight, science, and innovation.

The film tells the true story of three African-American women who played an integral role in helping John Glenn complete the first-ever orbit of the Earth.

Hidden Figures arrives in theaters on Christmas, Dec. 25, 2016.
