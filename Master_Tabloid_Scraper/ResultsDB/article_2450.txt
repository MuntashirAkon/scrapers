After announcing their split in March, Frances Bean Cobain and Isaiah Silva's divorce battle might turn ugly.According to court documents obtained by E! News, Silva is requesting $25,000 per month in spousal support from Cobain, who is worth an estimated $100 million. The documents give a detailed list of Silva's expenses, including what he spends on monthly rent ($4,500), clothes ($200) and even private schooling ($3,333) for his child from a previous relationship. Silva also states that his monetary income from his band, The Eeries, has "changed significantly" as a result of his divorce proceedings."Due to break up of marriage and incidents of violence and harassment against me I have been unable to tour and record music," the documents state.Silva also claims that because he and Cobain did not have a prenuptial agreement, he is entitled to half of her assets earned during their marriage.E! News has reached out for comment.

In the original divorce documents filed earlier this year Cobain requested that Silva not receive any monetary gains from her late father's, Kurt Cobain's, estate. "Petitioner requests that all gifts, inheritance, bequests and all other pre-marital assets, and all of her post-separation earnings, and acquisitions, as well as her clothing, jewelry and personal effects, be confirmed and/or awarded to her as her separate property plus all credits, offsets and reimbursements to which she is entitled," the documents state.She did say, however, that she would be open to paying and receiving spousal support. Cobain and Silva do not have any children together.Cobain went under the radar and married her boyfriend of five years in a small and intimate ceremony on June 29, 2014, E! News reported, and even her famous mom, Courtney Love, had no idea it was happening.Â 

"Courtney loves Isaiah, but was devastated to learn that Frances had gotten married without her knowing," a source told us at the time, adding that, "Courtney really likes Isaiah and is very happy for Frances. Courtney is sad she wasn't at the wedding."The insider continued, "Frances called her after but understands why she did it. Frances needs a man in her life and has always craved stability. She's found it in Isaiah," and reassured that, "This has not caused a rift between mom and daughter. Courtney was sad, but she's cool and Isaiah is a great son-in-law."
