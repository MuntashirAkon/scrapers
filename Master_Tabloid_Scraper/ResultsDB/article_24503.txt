No bunnies were harmed in the making of this Fatal Attraction reunion.
Michael Douglas was on hand to support his former costar Glenn Close at a performance of her hit broadway musical Sunset Boulevard on Wednesday night. The two were all smiles as they posed together backstage at The Palace Theatre in New York City.
The duo famously starred in the iconic 1987 blockbuster Fatal Attraction together, where they played two lovers embroiled in a twisted affair.

And while the film premiered nearly three decades ago, Douglas and Close have remained pals over the years.
“Glenn and I did a little movie in [the 1980s] which stood a lot of people on their heads, called Fatal Attraction,” Douglas said at the 2016 AARP Awards luncheon. “It was a brave film, it’s part of the memory of those films that keeps us all together and our friendships [thriving].”
Glenn received an Academy Award nomination for best actress for her iconic turn, but she controversially lost out to Cher for her performance in Moonstruck.
The actress reprises her role as Norma Desmond in Sunset Boulevard, which previously won her a Tony Award in 1995.
