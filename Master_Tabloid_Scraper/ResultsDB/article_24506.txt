Sunday's Tony Awards featured a whirlwind of emotions. From Corden's emotional tribute to Orlando to Lin-Manuel Miranda's heart-wrenching speech to his wife, the awards show contained laughter, tears and so much more. "We live through times when hate and fear seem stronger," the Hamilton star shared while holding back tears. "We rise and fall and light from dying embers.""Remembrances that hope and love last longer," he continued. "And love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love."Miranda's sonnet came shortly after Corden kicked off the show with his powerful speech. "People all around the world are trying to come to terms with the horrific events that took place in Orlando this morning. On behalf of the whole theater community and every person in this room, our hearts go out to all of those affected by this atrocity. All we can say is you are not on your own right now. Your tragedy is our tragedy," Corden declared."Theater is a place where every race, creed, sexuality and gender is equal, is embraced and is loved. Hate will never win. Together, we have to make sure of that. Tonight's show stands as a symbol and a celebration of that principle. This is the Tony Awards."
