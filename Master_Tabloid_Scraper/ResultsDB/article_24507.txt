Maybe Glenn Close can get Damages from the Navy.The star wants the world to know she's "distraught" that she's been dragged into a naval scandal involving offensive videos made by a U.S. Naval Captain that made use of Close's image without her consent.Seriously, did anyone not see her in Fatal Attraction or The Shield or Damages? You don't want to piss this lady off.

"I am distraught that my image has been used to perpetuate something that I abhor," said Close via a statement issued through her publicist. "The cynical, unauthorized use of my image in this video is deeply offensive and insulting, and was the result of a seemingly innocent request made during a visit to an aircraft carrier over four years ago."Just what exactly does the 63-year-old actor object to?The series of videos were made three and four years ago by Capt. Owen Honors of the U.S.S. Enterprise, one of America's premiere aircraft carriers. The videos were meant to be a morale booster for seamen serving long deployments, but some ended up crossing the line into homophobic behavior and anti-gay slurs.Footage of Close, who had visited the ship, was integrated into one of the videos.After the Virginian Pilot got wind of the videos and posted them on its website Saturday, Honors was relieved today from his post for "showing exceptionally poor judgment."You can see an edited version of the video in question below. Close appears at 10:26.
