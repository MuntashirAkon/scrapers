Eagles' Randy Meisner -- Take It Easy ... I'm Doing Just Fine/nOriginal Eagles bassist Randy Meisner wants to set the record straight -- his life is not in danger, and his wife isn't force feeding him bottles of vodka. Randy and wife Lana hit up a deli in Studio City Wednesday and told our photog they were shocked to hear news of allegations claiming Lana keeps Randy in a constant drunken state. As we first reported ... Randy thinks all the conservatorship talk is really a plot to grab his cash, but in this clip he makes it clear -- he doesn't need anyone making decisions for him.  On a lighter note ... the Rock & Roll Hall of Famer talks about his infamous backstage brawl with Glenn Frey in 1977 ... which lead to Randy quitting the band./n
