Debbie Reynolds’ FBI File EXPOSED: Scandalous Lesbian Past!/n
Goody two-shoes Debbie Reynolds had a taste for lesbian love, newly released FBI documents reveal!
Working under specific orders from President Lyndon B. Johnson’s Oval Office,
G-men checked out the Singing in the Rain sweetheart and discovered both she and first hubby Eddie Fisher enjoyed same-sex romps.
According to newly declassified FBI files, a gay man told investigators,
“Fisher was a homosexual and his wife, Debbie Reynolds, was a person who engaged in both normal and homosexual relations.”
While the file contains “no more information” about Debbie and Eddie, other superstars caught in the probe
of Hollywood’s gay scene included Danny Kaye, Arthur Kennedy, director Vincente Minnelli, Twilight Zone creator Rod Serling and actress Shelley Winters!
Film historian Robert Osborne later claimed Debbie had a lesbian love affair with Bewitched star Agnes Moorehead.
Debbie vehemently denied sharing Agnes’ bed — but her son, Todd, reportedly confirmed the affair!
Meanwhile, Debbie’s daughter, Carrie Fisher, who also experimented with women, insisted:
“My mother is not a lesbian! She’s just a really, really bad heterosexual.” /n
