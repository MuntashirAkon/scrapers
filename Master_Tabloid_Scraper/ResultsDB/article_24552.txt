Lisa Vanderpump Refuses To Apologize To Eileen Davidson Over Affair Comments!/n
Underhanded daggers! Lisa Vanderpump can definitely hold a grudge and she isn’t letting the one between herself, Eileen Davidson, and Lisa Rinna go anytime soon.
At the new girl, Dorit Kemsley’s, Buddha lounge-themed 40th birthday party the claws came out.
First, Rinna’s “nice girl” approach is working. She’s trying to make amends over the Munchausen’s drama from last year but LVP doesn’t want to even acknowledge her existence.
But Rinna thinks LVP taking the piss out of her is “a step in the right direction.” She said in her confessional, “It means we’re communicating. I feel that it’s progress.”
Meanwhile, LVP said in her confessional: “I like the side of Rinna when she’s not calling me an evil, manipulative bitch, for sure.”
LVP blames the catty comments on people misinterpreting her British humor and she really can’t be blamed for that, now can she?
The biggest miscommunication of the night was between Eileen Davidson and LVP. Last year, Vanderpump made an offensive comment to Eileen about the “affair” she had with her current husband before they got married. All Eileen wanted was an apology but she never got it.
And still won’t.
The soap star thought it was finally going to happen (gasp) but the Brit tricked her. She offered condolences instead to Eileen about her mother’s passing.
LVP said in her confessional, “Hell would freeze over before I will apologize to Eileen Davidson again.”
But the most cringe-worthy moment came when Eileen was looking for her hubby Vincent Van Patten and Vanderpump told her, “I saw him. He was in the corner with his head up somebody’s skirt.”
After last year’s comments, those didn’t seem like the wisest choice of words.
