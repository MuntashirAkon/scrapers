Kim Kardashian & Taylor Swift Naked In Bed With Kanye West In Risqué New Video!/n
Just when fans though that the feud with Taylor Swift may be over, Kanye West has added fuel to the fire, featuring the pop princess in his new video – completely naked in bed next to him!
Last night, the 39-year-old rapper held a screening in Inglewood, Calif of the video for ‘Famous,’ his first single off of his The Life Of Pablo album. As Radar readers recall, this was the song in which West said, “I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex.” West took his lyrics a step further by adding a visual.

The video, which reportedly took three months to make, was inspired by Vincent Desiderio‘s 2008 painting entitled, “Sleep.” It featured nude sculpture likenesses of Swift, West, Kim Kardashian, Ray J, Amber Rose, Caitlyn Jenner, Bill Cosby, Donald Trump, Rihanna, Chris Brown, Anna Wintour, and George W. Bush, all together under one sheet in an oversized bed.
“It’s not in support or anti any of [the people in the video],” West told Vanity Fair. “It’s a comment on fame,” he said.

“Maybe in some alternative universe me and George Bush could have been friends. I could have been his O.J. Simpson black friend on the golf course.”
