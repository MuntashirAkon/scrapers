After the overly-formatted hot mess that was Roanoke, fans feared that American Horror Story may be going down hill. Thankfully, all appearances have it shaping up to be the opposite case!
Call us brainwashed, but the upcoming Cult is looking like it's the show's best season in years â€” and Season 7's new stunningly eerie character portraits only confirm our suspicions!
The AHS: Cult website allowed fans to unlock the first images from the series, showing five of the season's main characters played by Billy Eichner, Alison Pill, Billie Lourd, Cheyenne Jackson, and Colton Haynes.
