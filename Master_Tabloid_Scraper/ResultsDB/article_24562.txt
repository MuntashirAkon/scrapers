Chris Christie Closes Beaches Over Holiday Weekend, Then Gets Spotted At The Shore With Family — And New Jersey Is PISSED!/n

Chris Christie is feeling the burn from his day at the beach!
No, not due to sun damage. Due to pissing off the entire state of New Jersey by closing state beaches — then being spotted at one with his family!
The unpopular governor was photographed on Island Beach State Park with his family on Sunday after closing the beach to the public amid a government shutdown.
Several states have faced extended government shutdowns this week after failing to approve state budgets by July 1 — one of them being Christie's Garden State, where lawmakers failed to pass a more than $34-billion budget.
RANK: Tell Us Who YOU Trust To Bring You The News!
So, Christie decided to take it out on shore-goers on the biggest beach weekend of the year. He closed state parks and beaches to the public, with signs blaming Democratic Assembly Speaker Vincent Prieto.
If that wasn't enough to piss off the entire Jersey Shore, Christie was seen lounging with his family on the desolate sands of Island Beach State Park without a care in the world!
The Republican said in a Sunday news conference that he flew on a state helicopter to join his family at the state residence, telling press: 
"That's the way it goes. Run for governor, and you can have the residence."
Spoken like a true man of the people!
Of course, the people weren't too thrilled seeing the governor turn the public beach into a private family vacation over the holiday weekend — and gave some blistering commentary about it on Twitter!
