Kristen Stewart and St. Vincent have been romantically linked for mere months now but it appears to be going so well they’ve decided to work together!

Next month, Stewart will be making her writing and debut with the short film Come Swim in the festival circuit and her rumored girlfriend has written the project’s music.
Consequence of Sound reports:
The short film is part of Refinery29’s Shatterbox Anthology series, which focuses on female directors. Set to premiere at the Sundance Film Festival, the story is described as “a diptych of one man’s day, half impressionist and half realist portraits.” Clark announced her involvement in a post on Twitter:

I composed the soundtrack for Kristen Stewart’s new short film Come Swim, which is also premiering at Sundance! https://t.co/ZE7rUmO206

Now, we know Stewart can sing; is it too much to ask that she join St. Vincent on stage soon?
