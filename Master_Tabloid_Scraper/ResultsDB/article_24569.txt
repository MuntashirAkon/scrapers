Imagine a deserted, post-apocalyptic city of Los Angeles. Now, imagine Kristen Stewart doing whatever the hell she wants with her blue Mustang GT in that deserted, post-apocalyptic city of Los Angeles.

This is the premise of the new music video for the Rolling Stones’ cover of Eddie Taylor’s “Ride ‘Em on Down” from Blue & Lonesome, their just-released album dedicated to blues covers. In the video, directed by Francois Rousselet, Stewart speeds through the city sucking on a matching blue lollipop (dangerous!), encountering a burning car and a stray zebra along the away. Her joyride is halted when another flannel-clad survivor pulls her over in his cop car. When he asks where Stewart got gas for her car, she replies, “My butt.”
