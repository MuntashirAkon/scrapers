Prince Harry arrived to St. Vincent and the Grenadines on Saturday (Nov. 26, 2016), the fourth country on his 14-day Caribbean tour, and when he stopped by an aviary, he got a rude welcome.
The Telegraph reports Harry was up close and personal with one parrot, naturally named Polly, who began the conversation by repeatedly saying “hello” to the prince. But when the royal hottie answered, Polly rudely ignored him, and then tried to nip his finger.

“Naughty!” retorted a smiling Harry, pulling his finger back. He then said, “They are amazing. Do you ever let them out?” When told they could get aggressive, he replied, “I can tell.” See the pics above!
The Prince also visited the island’s 250-year-old Botanical Gardens, the oldest tropical botanical garden in the world, and later enjoyed a concert by a choir of 8-11-year-olds from the Kingstown Government School. Watch below!





Earlier last week, Harry visited the Nevis turtle conservation project at Lover’s Beach and even helped release the little guys into the sea.
