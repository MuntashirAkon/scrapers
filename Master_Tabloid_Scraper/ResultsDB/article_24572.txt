As it turns out, there were a few Gilmore Girls romances that you didn’t even know existed until now.

In conversation with Life & Style, the series’ casting director Mara Casey revealed that Alexis Bledel, who played Rory Gilmore, actually dated her on-screen boyfriend Jared Padalecki (Dean).
“We did have a joke about casting all of Alexis’ [real-life] boyfriends,” Casey told Life & Style. “She dated Jared and Milo (Ventimiglia) And she also dated a young New York actor named Chris Heuisler, who played a guest role. Real sweet kid.”

Another Gilmore Girls casting director, Jami Rudofsky, added that Bledel didn’t even have to do a chemistry read with Ventimiglia because their compatibility was so apparent from the start. Rudofsky had the same feeling when Padalecki auditioned. “There had already been two Deans cast before we found him,” she says. “But there is something about Jared.”

While Bledel’s relationship with Ventimiglia was public, her romance with Padalecki remained under the radar. She is currently married to Vincent Kartheiser and privately gave birth to their first son last fall.
