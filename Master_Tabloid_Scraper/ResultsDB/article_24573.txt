Still not convinced it’s the Suicide Squad star? Last night, Delevingne dropped into Kachette, a nightclub in London, to celebrate becoming an ambassador for Rimmel London cosmetics and her new serpent was on full display. Check it out in the gallery above.
This is definitely not her first hand tattoo. She also has a red heart on her left pinky finger, her initials (CJD) in ornate lettering on the side of her right hand, and a lion’s head on her right index finger.



My first tattoo!! Lions rule! Thank you so much @bangbangnyc @badgalriri

Could this new addition have something to do with her recent breakup with St. Vincent? After all, the singer is already canoodling with Kristen Stewart… time will tell!
