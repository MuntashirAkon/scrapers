Cara Delevingne blasted an article saying she was rejected by Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show for looking “bloated.”
After The Sun published a story saying she wasn’t cast in the 2014 London show because of her figure, the model posted a letter from the show’s producer on Instagram.

Not only did it clarify that the British tabloid’s claims were false, but it also revealed that there’s a possibility Delevingne will make an appearance at this year’s Paris show. “If you’re free on November 30, please join us in Paris,” he wrote. “No casting necessary!”
This means that she might walk alongside her BFF Kendall Jenner.
