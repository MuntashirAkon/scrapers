Bella Hadid is the latest model to land a coveted spot on the Victoria’s Secret runway.

After beating out hundreds of other models for the job, Hadid couldn’t contain her happiness as she was spotted leaving Victoria’s Secret headquarters on Tuesday (Oct. 25, 2016), shortly after receiving the news. She was photographed wearing a black crop top, bomber jacket, camouflage cargo pants, with lace-up heels, and a huge smile on her face as she made her way to her car.
