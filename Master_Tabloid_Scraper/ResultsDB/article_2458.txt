Frances Bean Cobain Offers Robin Williams' Daughter, Zelda Williams, Words of Support—Read Her Moving Message Robin Williams' 25-year-old daughter, Zelda Williams, has received kind words from none other than Frances Bean Cobain, d.../n
Robin Williams' 25-year-old daughter, Zelda Williams, has received kind words from none other than Frances Bean Cobain, daughter of late iconic Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain.Frances was just a toddler when her father was found dead of an apparent suicide at his Seattle home in 1994. Like Robin's, Kurt's sudden death shocked the entertainment world. Robin, one of the world's most beloved on-screen performers and comedians, was found dead on Monday at his home in Northern California. The 63-year-old Oscar winner had suffered from depression for years. Authorities said he had taken his own life.

Following thousands of tweets and other sympathy messages from fans, friends, former comic pals and co-stars from movies such as Hook and Dead Poet's Society, Zelda, one of Robin's three children, took to Twitter herself to pen a heartfelt tribute to her dad, quoting a passage from Antoine de Saint-Exupéry's tear-jerking 1943 novella, The Little Prince, and saying, "I love you. I miss you. I'll try to keep looking up. Z."  Frances' tweet was a response to her post.Zelda also penned a longer tribute to her father on her Tumblr blog. Sadly, while Frances and scores of fans have sent her words of support, Zelda had also received mean comments and posts about her father. She said late on Tuesday that she would be taking a break from her social media accounts.She had also said on her Tumblr blog, "To those he touched who are sending kind words, know that one of his favorite things in the world was to make you all laugh. As for those who are sending negativity, know that some small, giggling part of him is sending a flock of pigeons to your house to poop on your car. Right after you've had it washed. After all, he loved to laugh, too."
