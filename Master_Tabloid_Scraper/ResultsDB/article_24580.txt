Surprise!Alexis Bledel and Vincent Kartheiser are married, E! News confirms. According to reports, the two wed in a top-secret ceremony earlier this summer in California.A rep for the brunette beauty confirmed that the Mad Men star and the former Gilmore Girls actress were engaged in March 2013. The newlyweds met over two years ago when Bledel guest-starred as an unhappy housewife in a series of episodes on the hit AMC show, where she seduced Kartheiser's seedy character Pete Campbell.This is the first marriage for the über-private couple, who has kept their romance under wraps, despite the fact that Bledel happily flaunted her engagement bling when she hit the red carpet back in April 2013.

Although the two met on set, Kartheiser previously said they didn't begin dating until season five of Mad Men wrapped."We were completely professional," the 35-year-old thesp said. "We never saw each other out. We never—it was nothing, it was just work."Still, that didn't stop several of Kartheiser's Mad Men costars, including Jon Hamm and creator Matthew Weiner, from rooting for the two from the moment they met."I did know he liked her from a very early point," Hamm told Vulture in April. "I was a supporter of that union." 

Likewise, Weiner had nothing but kind things to say about the couple, and even predicted that the two would tie the knot."I told Vinnie that they would be great together," Weiner said. "I was like, 'Don't blow it!'""Honestly, they're a really good match," he continued. "They're both very down-to-earth, with a sense of responsibility and strong family ties. And they've been acting since before they can remember, which makes for a very special personality. It's not just that I thought they would look cute together."Although look cute together they do indeed. Congrats, you two!
