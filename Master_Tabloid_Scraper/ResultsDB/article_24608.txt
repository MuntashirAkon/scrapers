K-Fed Be Damned! Brit Drives with Kids/nShe's been plenty o' mess lately, but Britney Spears is apparently still allowed to drive with her children -- for now. TMZ caught the popwreck picking up Jayden James and Sean Preston at the Four Seasons yesterday afternoon, the kids strapped into the back seat as Spears drove and her court appointed monitor rode shotgun. K-Fed's lawyer, Mark Vincent Kaplan, has been trying to change the terms of Britney's custody to bar her from driving with the children -- especially after seeing video on TMZ of Britney blowing a red light with the kids in the back.
