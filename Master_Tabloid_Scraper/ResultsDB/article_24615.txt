According to ABC, investigators also linked Magallanes’ crime to a similar killing near the same location last October, the murder of Onosai Tavita, 52.
“We knew that the same suspect was responsible for both murders but at that time, we had not identified the suspect,” Wyatt said. “Through his confession, we were ultimately able to book him for both murders.”
“We know that both the victims in this case were homeless men,” he continued. “At this point, there is no link to any other crimes, but we want to make sure that that is the case.”
