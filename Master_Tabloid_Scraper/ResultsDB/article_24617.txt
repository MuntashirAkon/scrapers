Ed Sheeran Caught Ripping Off TLC's 'No Scrubs' In New Hit 'Shape Of You'/n
Ed Sheeran‘s no. 1 hit “Shape Of You” may be topping the charts, but could it be for its familiar melody?
According to reports, the pop song rips off TLC’s classic 90s hit “No Scrubs,” which has forced 26-year-old Sheeran to quietly settle a deal to credit members Kandi Burruss, Kevin Briggs, and Tameka Cottle, as well as their publisher HitCo, as songwriters on the track.

Sadly, this isn’t Sheeran’s first copyright run-in. The British singer has also been sued by Marvin Gaye‘s estate for the song “Thinking Out Loud” and its similarities to the icon’s biggest hit, “Let’s Get It On.”
