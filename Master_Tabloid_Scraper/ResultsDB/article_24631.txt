Truce! Pharrell & Will.i.am End Legal Feud With Lawsuit Settlement/n
Pharrell Williams has something new to be happy about! RadarOnline.com has learned that the Oscar-nominated singer recently settled his bitter lawsuit with fellow artist Will.i.am over the use of the phrase “I Am.”
It all began when the former Black Eyed Peas singer sent Williams a cease and desist letter last summer, demanding he stop using the name “I Am Other” for his newly launched YouTube channel. In response, Williams sued, and then Will.i.am fired back with a blistering lawsuit of his own.

Will.i.am even went so far as to accuse the “Blurred Lines” singer of being a serial thief because of the plagiarism lawsuit Marvin Gaye‘s family brought against that song.
But according to court documents obtained by Radar, it’s all water under the bridge. Court documents filed March 10 state that the two have come to a settlement that stipulates they drop their lawsuits against each other.
