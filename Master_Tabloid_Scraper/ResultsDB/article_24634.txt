For example, Michael totally guesses wrong when confronted with the question of when Blake had her first kiss. He's off by several years, in fact! He also fails to guess her childhood crush and the name of her first dog! (He basically sucks at this game, tbh.)
Meanwhile, the actress messes up when asked if the designer's mother ever tried out for the NFL, and what his brand name would've been if he hadn't chosen his own moniker as a kid!
Blake also stumps Michael when revealing what sexy song was playing while she was giving birth! Was it Marvin Gaye's Let's Get It On???
