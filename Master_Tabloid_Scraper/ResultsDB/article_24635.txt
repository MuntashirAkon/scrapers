Don't Let The Door Hit You In The Ass On The Way Out, Stacey Dash/n

Now that Donald Trump is in the White House, it's high time his propaganda outlet of choice the unbiased folks at FOX News made some large-scale changes to suit his rabid, wacky base of fans.
And that means Stacey Dash is OUT at the news channel!

According to a network spokesperson sharing info with The Hill over the weekend, FOX has declined to renew contributor contracts for Dash, George Will, Ed Rollins, Marvin Kalb, and Cal Thomas.
Dash, of course, is best known for starring in the 1995 comedy Clueless, and was most often seen on the afternoon news discussion show Outnumbered on the channel — but now, well, she's gone.
Oh, and she's also famous for this.
And this.
…And this.
Bye bye, Stacey!!!
As for Will, he was a longtime ABC pundit and has been a conservative columnist for decades, before he moved over to FOX News in 2013.
Now, Will is gone at the network, too — and perhaps it's no accident considering The Donald tweeted this about him a few months ago (below): 

George Will, one of the most overrated political pundits (who lost his way long ago), has left the Republican Party.He's made many bad calls

Hmmm…
Rollins is also gone from the network — he had been a long-time Republican strategist and was the most sane of this bunch of un-renewed contributors… which may not be saying very much.
In their places, FOX has handed out a contributor contract to former leader of the U.K. Independence Party, Nigel Farage.
And yes, Farage is the guy behind Brexit. Heckuva job there, FOX News!
But seriously, Stacey, good riddance!!!
