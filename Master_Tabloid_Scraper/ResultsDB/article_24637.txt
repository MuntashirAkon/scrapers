Poor guy!
Of course, this announcement comes shortly after the 24-year-old performed at the Hollywood Bowl for CBS Radio's We Can Survive Concert. In fact, Charlie dropped hints about his struggling health at the show as he told crowd he was getting over the flu. Shockingly, Puth still performed his 30-minute set for the sold out show. Talk about being a professional.
We mean, we knew Charlie wasn't doing well as he posted a pic on Instagram of himself at a doctor's office a couple of weeks ago (below).

Damn indeed, buddy!
Nonetheless, here's hoping the Marvin Gaye artist gets the rest he so clearly needs. Get well soon, man!
