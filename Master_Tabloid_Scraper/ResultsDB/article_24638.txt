Kylie Jenner's Scary Gate Crasher Sentenced Behind Bars!/n

As you may recall, Kylie Jenner had a bit of a scare back in June when a trespasser named Marvin Magallanes tried to crash his car through the security gate of her prior Calabasas home.
Reportedly, the uninvited admirer arrived at The Oaks' security gate and informed the guards he was there for a meeting with Miz Jenner — and after the security professionals told the stranger to hit the road, he rammed into the gate, cracked it, and drove off.

Now, according to docs obtained by E! News, Magallanes was sentenced to 10 days in El Lay County Jail after pleading no contest to vandalism on Tuesday.
Good news for Marvin… Since he already served four days immediately following the incident, he will just have to finish up the six remaining before serving 12 months probation once released.
Hopefully this is the end of his gate-crashing days!
