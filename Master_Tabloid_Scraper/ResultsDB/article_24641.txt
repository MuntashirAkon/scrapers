Eddie Redmayne is currently on a press tour to get the word out (which is totally unnecessary) about his upcoming flick Fantastic Beast and Where to Find Them. This has included explaining his failed attempt at becoming a Star Wars villain, as well as pulling out some hilarious animal impersonations with Ellen DeGeneres. The fun continued on The Tonight Show where the Oscar-winner happily taught Jimmy Fallon how he won the favor of a CGI critter.

In Fantastic Beasts, his character, Newt Scamander, is attempting to round up a number of outlandish animals that have gotten loose under mysterious circumstances. To capture one particular beastie, he apparently must perform a mating dance, which involves some fancy footwork and serious gyration.

“There’s this scene which just goes ‘Newt performs mating dance,’” he said, explaining J.K. Rowling’s script. “Two words have never filled me with so much sweat.”
Redmayne proceeded to Google animal mating dances (obviously) and send some videos to the director, which we hope some day see the light of day. The process apparently took some time but eventually they arrived at some steps to win over this “huge, horny, female, magical creature.”
Check out the lesson in the clip above!
