Bruno Mars and producer Mark Ronson had better lawyer up. The creative team behind the highly-acclaimed track “Uptown Funk” are named in a new suit claiming they ripped off another funky song from the ‘80s.

TMZ reports:
Mars and “Uptown Funk” producer Mark Ronson are among many names listed in a lawsuit filed by members from the music group, Collage. The band released a single in 1983 called “Young Girls” and claim Bruno’s Billboard #1 is a dead-on copy in rhythm, harmony, melody and structure.
It’s interesting — Collage claims  Ronson and Mars have been big fans of Minneapolis/1980s electro-funk soul … of which Collage was a part, along with Prince and others. The suit claims there’s reason to believe Ronson and Mars have heard and been influenced by “Young Girls.”
Last year, Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams were forced to pay $7.3 million when it was determined that their hit song “Blurred Lines” shared a similar “feel” with Marvin Gaye’s track “Got to Give It Up.” Time will tell if Ronson and Mars face a similar, potentially costly verdict.
