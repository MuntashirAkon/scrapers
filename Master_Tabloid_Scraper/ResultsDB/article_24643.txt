Ed Sheeran has been hit with a lawsuit by the family of Ed Townsend, a co-writer of Marvin Gaye, in reference to his song “Thinking Out Loud.”

According to TMZ, Townsend’s kin allege that Sheeran copied the “heart” of “Let’s Get It On,” including the melody, harmony, and rhythm compositions, and repeated it throughout his 2o14 song. They also call out Sheeran for continuing to perform “Thinking Out Loud” even though the family sent him a notice of the copyright infringement last year.
The lawsuit also includes Sheeran’s co-writer Amy Wadge, the song’s producer Jake Gosling, Sony/ATV Music Publishing, Atlantic Records, Warner Bros. and others. Bloomberg reports that the family is demanding a jury trial and compensation for the damages.
