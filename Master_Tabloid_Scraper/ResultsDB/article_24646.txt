Maybe he was just thinking out loud?

Whatever the case may be, Ed Sheeran is now being sued for ripping off a 2012 song released by The X Factor winner Matt Cardle. The British singer has been slapped with a $20 million lawsuit claiming that his 2015 hit “Photograph” is “verbatim, note-for-note copying” Cardle’s single, “Amazing.”
The suing songwriters, Martin Harrington and Thomas Leonard, and their publishing company HaloSongs claim Sheeran’s monster smash is completely derived from the track they wrote for Cardle, who won The X Factor in 2010. They are currently being represented by Richard Busch, who was the attorney responsible for winning the copyright lawsuit over Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams’ “Blurred Lines” on behalf of Marvin Gaye’s family.
“My clients are professional songwriters,” says Busch in a statement to Billboard. “Their work is their life, and I am honored that they have trusted me with this very important case.”
The plaintiffs claim that the chord progressions and musical notation of the two songs are very much similar, noting that the chorus reportedly shares 39 identical notes in pitch, rhythmic duration and placement in the measure.
