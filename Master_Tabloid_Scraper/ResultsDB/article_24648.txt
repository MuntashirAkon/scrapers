“No talking or singing for awhile.”
Singer Michael Bublé announced on Twitter on Wednesday he has to undergo vocal cord surgery so he won’t be able to perform in some upcoming events. But don’t fret, Bublé fans, he is expected to make a full recovery.
The “Haven’t Met You Yet” singer wrote, “To my fans: I wanted to let you know that I am bowing out of some upcoming events due to pending vocal surgery which will require a period of time for me to rest and recover. No talking or singing for awhile, but my doctors expect a complete recovery.”

He added, “I am especially sorry about two events that I will now be unable to attend: I was scheduled to be honored at The Canadian Governor General Performance Arts Award Gala on June 11th. This award will now be presented at next year’s 25th Anniversary on June 29, 2017. In addition, I will no longer be performing at the Marvin Gaye Tribute at the Kennedy Center on June 5th. Thank you in advance for your prayers and good wishes. I’ll keep you up to date on my progress.”
Bublé isn’t the only singer who has had to recently repair their vocal cords. Adele, Sam Smith and Meghan Trainor all had similar surgeries.
