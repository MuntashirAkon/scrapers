There’s trouble in paradise.

Kendrick Lamar was sued on Thursday (Apr. 14) for copying music from Bill Withers’ 1975 song “Don’t You Want To Stay” on his track “I Do This” without permission. The complaint filed in a Los Angeles court by Golden Withers Music and Musidex Music claims that Lamar added his own lyrics to a “direct and complete copy” of Withers’ original, which entails copyright infringement.
Reuters reports that Lamar has ignored requests to stop exploiting Withers’ music, “and ‘admitted’ to copying it ‘with a thumb to the nose, catch me if you can attitude’.”
The lawsuit seeks to put a halt on the infringement as well as unspecified damages. It was filed in the same court where Marvin Gaye’s family was awarded a settlement in the case against Robin Thicke’s “Blurred Lines”.
