Meet Marvin the Royal Hamster – Or Rather, the Genius Behind the Best Thing You Will See All Day  /n
It hasn’t even been a full month since Princess Kate revealed the royal family has a new member: Marvin the hamster.   
And though we haven’t yet gotten a real-life glimpse of Prince George and Princess Charlotte‘s new furry friend, Twitter user Christine Frazier, a 33-year-old blogger and writer from Washington, D.C. has given us the next best thing – adorable drawings of Marvin the Hamster (@theroyalhamster), who is proving to be the perfect pint-sized model for Kate’s ensembles.   
“This hamster is a totally normal hamster living in a ridiculous world,” Frazier, who is American, tells PEOPLE. “I was thinking, ‘If it’s a normal hamster, maybe he’s normal like me, and he’s obsessed with the royals like I am.'”  
So Frazier created a whole persona for Marvin – who, just like Princess Kate fans everywhere, runs out to grab replicas of her outfits for himself.   
Some of the outfits go way back – like the infamous St. Andrews fashion show ensemble.

Her past work with drawing inspired her to capture Marvin in cartoon form.

“It’s nice to have something a bit outside of the typical royal news,” Frazier said.  
The feedback on Twitter has been swift and positive – Frazier has even heard from some of her favorite royal bloggers, like What Kate Wore and What Would Kate Do– but she’s still waiting for comment from Marvin’s family.   
“I’d hope that they would be flattered and happy to see Marvin living out his daydream,” she said with a laugh.  
“We commoners might have gone for something like Whiskers, but they chose Marvin,” she said. “It’s so lovely. I definitely think Prince George had a hand in that name.”
