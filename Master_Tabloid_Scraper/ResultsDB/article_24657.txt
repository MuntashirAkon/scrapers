Nina Dobrev Grinds Up on Tim Tebow to 'Let's Get It On' for Lip Sync Battle

Nina Dobrev is using some old-school soul – and sex appeal – to try to win Lip Sync Battle.
The actress performs Marvin Gaye’s classic “Let’s Get It On” while competing against Tim Tebow on Thursday’s episode, and a preview of the performance shows her shimmying up against the quarterback.

Tebow, 28, laughs as Dobrev, 27, grinds against his leg. (For one of his two songs, Tebow will pay homage to Rocky Balboa with Survivor’s “Eye of the Tiger.”)
