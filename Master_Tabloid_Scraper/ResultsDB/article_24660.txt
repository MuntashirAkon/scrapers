Rapper Capo Killed in Gang-Related Shooting, Say Police  /n
The rapper Capo, whose real name is Marvin Carr, was killed in a possible drive-by shooting in Chicago’s South Shore on Saturday, his manager confirmed Sunday.  
The 22-year-old, a member of Chief Keef’s “Glo Gang,” was shot in the hip and back, according to authorities, NBC News reports. He was taken to a nearby hospital, where he later died.  
“He was a good kid. The streets of Chicago is something,” his manager, Renaldo Reuben Hess, said. “He was murdered. I don’t understand what is going on with all these kids.”  
The same shooting also claimed the life of a baby boy, 13-month-old Dillon Harris, who was struck by a car whose driver was fleeing the scene.  
Police – who said the shooting was gang-related – are questioning two people of interest in the shooting.   
Chief Keef has announced a concert to be held Friday in Chicago, where he will appear via hologram and perform a show benefiting the victims.
