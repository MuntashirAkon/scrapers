Michael Sam's Ex-Teammate -- HE BELONGS IN THE NFL/nMichael Sam's former college teammate -- who's played with NFL stars like Aldon Smith and Sheldon Richardson -- says Sam is RIGHT ... his sexual orientation is the reason he's not in the league. We spoke with Marvin Foster -- who played alongside Sam at Missouri -- and says Sam is one of the best players he's ever stepped on the field with.  "There's no way the Defensive Player of the Year in the SEC should be a free agent, " Foster said.  TMZ Sports posted footage Wednesday showing Sam very strongly suggesting that he has the talent to play in the NFL -- but isn't on a roster because he's openly gay.  "The kid can play and I think he showed he can play, "  Foster added ...  "He had three sacks in the pre-season. I don't know why they cut him. " But not everyone shares Foster's opinion -- we spoke with an active NFL lineman who tells us,  "If Sam was killing he would be on a roster. "The NFL player adds,  "He can make an excuse if he wants to ... but that's silly. If you're good, you're good. The NFL teams don't feel that he is. "/n
