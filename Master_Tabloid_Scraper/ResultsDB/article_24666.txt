Robin Thicke -- I Lost in Court ... But Won Lots Of Birthday Boobies /nRobin Thicke had 7.3 million reasons to crawl into a big dark hole Tuesday night, but instead he chose to fill it with champagne and half-naked chicks to blow-out his 38th birthday party. TMZ obtained pics from inside Thicke's party -- which started at the Chateau Marmont and moved to Robin's Hollywood home ... where a hottie rolled around in a hamster ball and exotic dancers bared and bounced their tatas around the crib. In other words, lots of eye candy to keep his mind off the  "Blurred Lines " loss he and Pharrell Williams suffered hours earlier -- and the massive check they'll have to cut for Marvin Gaye's kids. Party sources tell us Marlon Wayans, YG, Sean Stewart, Russell Simmons and pops Alan Thicke attended. As for Robin's birthday cake wish -- gf April Love Geary was on hand for those duties.    / //n
