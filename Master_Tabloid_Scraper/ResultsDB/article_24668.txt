Robin Thicke -- Furred Lines ... Going Stupid 4 New Puppy /nHe knows she wants it ... so Robin ThickeÂ made damn sure he scooped up an adorable puppy for GF April Love Geary. Sources close to the situation say April's been itching for a pooch since March, so Robin did what any good boyfriend would -- last week he popped over to Bark N' Bitches in L.A. -- a no-kill shelter -- and snagged the cutest one for his lady. We're told he dropped about $350 for the little terrier mix, named Bincy -- and based on April's recent onslaught of mushy-gushy Instagrams ... we're guessing she's shown Robin plenty of appreciation. Fun fact: Marvin Gaye did NOT have a dog named Bincy. Sorry, Gaye fam./n
