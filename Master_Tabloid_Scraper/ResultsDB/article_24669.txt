Blake Griffin -- Space Jams in Venice Beach ... With Jon Favreau (Video)/nBlake Griffin could be the next Michael Jordan -- 'cause the guy was throwin' down in Venice Beach with Marvin the Martian on what appeared to be a  "Space Jam " themed commercial shoot.  Word on the street ... seriously, the people on the street were telling us ... Blake was on-set with director Jon Favreau to film a new sneaker ad for his new Jordan shoes.   He dunked, he shot around, he signed autographs for kids.   Question is ... with rumors of a second  "Space Jam " movie in the works, is this a clue that Griffin is the 'Air' apparent? /n
