Robin Thicke -- Puts Paula Patton On the Hot Seat in 'Blurred Lines' Lawsuit/nPaula Patton could have Robin Thicke by the short hairs ... again -- she's being called to testify in the court battle over whether he ripped off  "Blurred Lines " from Marvin Gaye.According to court docs ... Robin's estranged wife is listed as a witness for the case which still looks like it's heading to trial.

Robin actually went to a holiday party at Paula's house -- so maybe the dust has settled. We'll see, when and if she takes the oath. One thing's for sure ... the video was freakin' hot!  /n
