Stevie Wonder to Marvin Gaye's Family -- You Got Crap Legal Advice/nStevie Wonder thinks Marvin Gaye's family should take higher ground (see what we did there) legally speaking -- because their crappy lawyer is getting them into a lawsuit with Robin Thicke they can't win.Stevie was fired up when we got him outside LAX, and says the fuss about  "Blurred Lines " possibly ripping off Marvin's hit  "Got to Give it Up " ... is stupid.Stevie knows what he's talking about here ... remember he and Marvin were contemporaries during Motown's golden age -- and he says he's dealt with similar lawsuits himself.Stevie delivers a direct message to Marvin's son. He might wanna pay attention./n
