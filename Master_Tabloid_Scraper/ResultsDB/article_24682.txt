Robin Thicke -- Gaye Was Not In My Head/nRobin Thicke is changing his tune ... telling TMZ ... even though he's a big fan of Marvin Gaye, the legendary Motowner is not in his head when he writes songs, including  "Blurred Lines. "It's interesting because Robin's on the record as having told Pharrell Williams he wanted to make a version of Gaye's  "Got to Give It Up. " And get this ... Robin's gonna collaborate with Stevie Wonder, who, BTW, doesn't think Robin is a song thief./n
