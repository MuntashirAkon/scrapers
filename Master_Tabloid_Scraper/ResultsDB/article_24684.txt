Brandon Davis: Charged For DUI In Car Wreck/nBrandon Davis has been charged with drunk driving in the single car wreck back in October that landed him in the hospital and totaled his Mercedes.  Our law enforcement sources say Davis' blood alcohol level was almost twice the legal limit.  He was arrested at the hospital while doctors tended to his injuries. Davis, heir to the Marvin Davis oil and entertainment fortune, would ordinarily be placed on probation, but his prior record could change that. He pled guilty in 2011 to coke possession.  In the DUI case, worse case scenario for him is 6 months in jail. Davis crashed after dinner at Matsuhisa in West Hollywood with pal Mike Comrie. Photos later surfaced of Davis downing wine before the crash./n
