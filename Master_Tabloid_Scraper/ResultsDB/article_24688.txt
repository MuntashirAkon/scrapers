 Going Public! Tiger Woods Making Debut With Girlfriend Kristin At Upcoming Tournament.../n
Tiger Woods isn’t keeping his relationship with girlfriend Kristin Smith a secret for much longer! RadarOnline.com can exclusively reveal the couple will go public with the romance at an upcoming golf tournament.
“She’s going to his tournament in the Bahamas that’s coming up,” a source close to Smith exclusively told Radar of the Hero World Challenge, which is from December 2-4.
The insider confirmed they’ve been splitting their time between Florida and her home in Dallas.
RadarOnline broke the news of the golfer’s new romance with the personal stylist earlier this month.
“It’s awesome,” Smith’s cousin confirmed to Radar of the secret relationship. “But I’m not allowed to talk about it.”
Although Smith wouldn’t confirm the relationship herself, she didn’t deny she’s seeing the golfer.
As Radar readers know, Smith, 33, was stopped by police at Palm Beach Airport with $200,000 in cash that she claimed came from Tiger on April 25.
“Upon arrival I made contact with Kristin, who when asked about the money … stated is this going to be available to the public,” the incident report obtained by Radar read. “I then asked where did the money come from and did she have a receipt or proof of where the money came from. Kristin stated her boyfriend gave it to her,” the officer continued. “I asked her if her boyfriend could show proof [as] to where the money came from, to which Kristin stated she did not want to talk to me anymore.”
Smith was in a previous relationship with Dallas Cowboys star Gerald Sensabaugh. They share a young son Isaiah together.
