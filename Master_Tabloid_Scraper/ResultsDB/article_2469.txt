Courtney Love's Quick Trip to the Hospital/nFrances Bean's mom, decked out in a giant doily, checked in to Cedars Sinai at around 3:00 AM Friday morning after allegedly complaining about throat and chest pains. Love's rep confirms she was diagnosed with strep throat and then sent on her way. We're told the 90s rocker stopped by a gas station on the way home to pick up a pack of smokes and some toilet literature (see left). Looks like it's going to be a good weekend for Love.
