Once, he picked up roses — now, he might be picking up trash off the freeway.
Kasey Kahl, the blond reality star of The Bachelorette and Bachelor Pad fame, received three years probation and 180 days of community service in Fresno County Superior Court Tuesday, as sentencing in his no contest battery plea for a bar brawl at Fresno’s Club Habanos, RadarOnline.com has learned.

In the Jan. 15, 2012 scrum, a man named Richard Chaney, 26, accused Kahl — who once dated Vienna Girardi — of breaking his nose, while the man’s girlfriend, 22-year-old Renee Idsinga, said he hit her in the face.
Kahl, 30, would have faced up to eight years in custody had he been convicted. Should he finish his probation without violation over the next year, the felony case will be knocked down to a misdemeanor and expunged from his record, the Bee reported.

“Kasey is very contrite about what happened,” his attorney Gerald Schwab said. “He felt it was totally out of character. He feels bad that people may think he is somehow violent.” /n
