According to TMZ, the family of the alleged victim has lawyered up with attorneys Gerald A. Griggs and Leif Howard in an "effort to seek the safe return" of Savage.
Not only are they concerned about Joycelyn's safety and well-being, they haven't seen her for almost a year. Griggs plans to contact the singer's reps in order to arrange her return. 
As we wrote last month, the 21-year-old DENIES being "held hostage or anything like that" and says, "I am in a happy place with my life and I'm not being brainwashed."
To make matters more complicated, sources close to Savage say father Timothy was the one who orchestrated her meeting with Kelly in the first place.
Days later, Timothy went on the defensive saying the musician met some of the girls when they were only 17, denies setting his daughter up with the now 50-year-old, and compares the entire situation to "slavery."
We just hope Joycelyn is okay!
