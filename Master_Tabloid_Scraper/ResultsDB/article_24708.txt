Donald Trump Has Been Tweeting Like A Fucking Madman All Morning/n

Serious question: how much longer does this guy have as President? How much longer does he even want to be President?
Donald Trump has been tweeting like crazy all morning, spending literally HOURS mad online as he rails against the media, fake news, the Russia scandal, and Presidential pardons.

Here's all the stupid shit that went from Trump's brain to his Twitter account that, somehow still, his handlers are not able to wrestle away from him (below):

So many people are asking why isn't the A.G. or Special Council looking at the many Hillary Clinton or Comey crimes. 33,000 e-mails deleted?

…What about all of the Clinton ties to Russia, including Podesta Company, Uranium deal, Russian Reset, big dollar speeches etc.

My son Donald openly gave his e-mails to the media & authorities whereas Crooked Hillary Clinton deleted (& acid washed) her 33,000 e-mails!

In all fairness to Anthony Scaramucci, he wanted to endorse me 1st, before the Republican Primaries started, but didn't think I was running!

The Republican Senators must step up to the plate and, after 7 years, vote to Repeal and Replace. Next, Tax Reform and Infrastructure. WIN!

ObamaCare is dead and the Democrats are obstructionists, no ideas or votes, only obstruction. It is solely up to the 52 Republican Senators!

What. The. Fuck.
Somebody take this man's phone away.
Give him one of those little fake phones you give to small children. He'll only think he's tweeting things out to the world!
Thoughts????
