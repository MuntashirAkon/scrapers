Asbestos Found In This Tween Makeup Line's Highlighting Powder!/n

Popular tween clothing chain Justice is coming under fire after it was shockingly revealed they were selling makeup to kids containing asbestos!
ABC's WTVD news team investigated the ingredients into their "Just Shine Shimmer Powder," and according to the Scientific Analytical Institute in Greensboro, North Carolina, it tested positive for asbestos, which can cause lung cancer and mesothelioma.
This is extremely serious as the asbestos fibers can stay in the body for years!

The lab's director, Sean Fitzgerald, explained: 
"In this powder designed for children, they could die an untimely death in their 30s or 40s because of the exposure to asbestos in this product."
He continued:
"I would treat it like a deadly poison, because it is."
Heavy metals barium, chromium, selenium and lead were also found in the highlighting powder.
When confronted about the investigation, a rep for Justice revealed:
"Justice is committed to the safety and integrity of our products. Upon receiving the inquiry from WTVD, we immediately began an independent investigation. We cannot speculate regarding the matter until we have more information. Nonetheless, out of an abundance of caution, we have stopped the sale of this product while we investigate."
And the team took to Facebook on Sunday, to further share:

The brand has taken the powder off its site.
While they seem ready to pass off any blame, we have a feeling they'll still be facing some lawsuits in the future!
