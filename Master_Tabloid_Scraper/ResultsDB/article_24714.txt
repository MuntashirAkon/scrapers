After eight long months, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have finally finalized their divorce.

The couple, who spent the last few weeks trash talking each other in court documents, have settled their affairs. The news comes after Depp demanded that Heard pay $100,000 in legal fees — a request that the actress since denied.
“It is a great day. All Amber wanted was to be divorced and now she is,” Heard’s lawyer, Pierce O’Donnell, told Us Weekly in a statement. “In the words of Gerald Ford, ‘Our long national nightmare is over.'”
In August, Heard agreed to receive a $7 million settlement for her divorce with the Pirates of the Caribbean actor. She vowed to donated the entire sum to charity by 2018. As previously reported, $200,000 was directly donated to the ACLU and Children’s Hospital L.A. by Depp as a part of the settlement.
However, Heard’s future payments were said to be put on hold until she receives the remaining sum of her settlement — all $6.8 million — from her ex.
The actress filed for divorce from Depp in May 2016, claiming she was physically abused during their four-year relationship.
