Tobey Maguire was caught partying with Sofia Richie weeks before it was announced that he and his wife, Jennifer Meyer, are getting a divorce. 
So could Justin Bieber’s ex-girlfriend have anything to do with the actor’s split? It’s very unlikely, but the two were spotted at 1OAK in West Hollywood, Calif. on October 1, where they were photographed intimately talking on the dancefloor.

Sources tell Entertainment Tonight that he and Richie are not together and were only seated at the same table for their mutual friend’s party. Meanwhile, TMZ reports that the Spider-Man alum and his estranged wife have been separated since June. Since then, he’s been hitting up the clubs with his friend and Great Gatsby co-star, Leonardo DiCaprio.
Maguire and Meyer announced their divorce by releasing a joint statement, “After much soul searching and consideration, we have made the decision to separate as a couple.
