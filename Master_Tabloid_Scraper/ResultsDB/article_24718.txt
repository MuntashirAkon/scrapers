Actor Chevy Chase is seeking treatment for his struggles with alcohol at the Hazelden Addiction Treatment Center in Minnesota 30 years after admitting himself to rehab for an addiction to prescription painkillers.

A rep for the Saturday Night Live alum tells TMZ that Chase, 72, recently entered into an in-patient program there for a so-called “tune-up.” The spokesperson adds that Chase just “wants to be the best that he can be” after wrapping production on two films.
In 1986, the former Community star checked into the Betty Ford Clinic for a “dependency on prescription drugs relating to chronic and long-term back problems” stemming from his time on SNL. Almost 20 years later, Chase revealed he felt a sense of gratitude towards Ford for saving his life.
“If it hadn’t been for the courage of Mr. Ford’s wife, Betty, for admitting to an alcohol problem, I would never have received the help I needed in the early 1980s at the Betty Ford clinic, located not far from the Ford residence near Palm Springs,” he wrote in a 2006 The New York Times tribute to the late President Gerald Ford.  “During my short stay there, I often saw Mrs. Ford personally surveying the clinic and generously offering a helping hand to those who were lucky enough to face their problems and, with the learned help of the clinic staff, appraise their behavior and their lifestyles.”
Chase is currently staying at the same facility Robin Williams was treated at in 2014.
