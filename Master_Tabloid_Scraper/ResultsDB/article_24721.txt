Look, TV is where it’s at right now.

Oscar winner Nicole Kidman continues her TV run by starring with Elisabeth Moss in the upcoming Season 2 of Top of the Lake.
Deadline reports the second season of the weird but excellent SundanceTV series, titled Top of the Lake: China Girl, will once again revolve around Moss’ Detective Robin Griffin, who is investigating a case of an unidentified body washed up on Sydney’s Bondi Beach. No word yet on who Kidman will be playing.

Kidman will also be working with her Portrait of a Lady director Jane Campion, who co-created Top of the Lake with Gerald Lee. “I am very excited to be coming home to work with darling friend Jane Campion, whose work I respect and admire,” Kidman told The Daily Telegraph. “I’m also so happy to be joining the incredible Elisabeth Moss.”
Game of Thrones star Gwendoline Christie is also joining the cast in Season 2.
Kidman just wrapped the HBO limited series Big Little Lies, in which she stars with Reese Witherspoon, Laura Dern and Shailene Woodley.
