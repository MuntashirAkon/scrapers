Fall in line, other awards shows.

At the surprise of no one (save for your 102-year-old grandmother), Hamilton the musical swept the statuettes at Sunday’s 2016 Tony Awards. The show took home 11 awards after receiving a record-breaking 16 nominations; a feat that fell just below The Producers’ standing record of 12 wins in one night. Hamilton was named Best Play while its creator, Lin-Manuel Miranda, was given the award for Best Original Score. Lead actor Leslie Odom Jr. triumphed in his category to nab the Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role in a Musical.
Miranda accepted his high honor for Best Score with a moving sonnet that paid tribute to the victims of the mass shooting at Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida.
“We chase the melodies that seem to find us until they’re finished songs and start to play when senseless acts of tragedy remind us that nothing here is promised, not one day,” spoke Miranda. “This show is proof that history remembers. We live through times when hate and fear seem stronger. We rise and fall, and light from dying embers, remembrances that hope and love last longer and love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love cannot be killed or swept aside. As sacred as a symphony Eliza tells her story. Now fill the world with music, love and pride. And thank you so much for this.”





This year’s winners list is receiving acclaim for its diversity in comparison to that of the Oscars, which was criticized for its overwhelmingly white roster of praised actors and shows. Between Hamilton and The Color Purple, last night marked the first year that black performers won all four major musical performance categories. By contrast, the Oscars have only given out wins to three black actors in the past nine years — all Best Supporting Actress nominees — and haven’t nominated an actor of color in the last two years.
