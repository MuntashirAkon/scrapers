Hear that? That’s a sigh of relief.

The District Attorney’s Office dropped assault charges against Orange Is the New Black star Dascha Polanco on Wednesday, Mar. 23, who allegedly punched 17-year-old Michelle Cardona in the head, pulled her hair, and used her fingernails to injure her arm. The DA said that the case didn’t have a leg to stand on due to the “lack of stating the truth and relevant evidence”.
Polanco’s attorney, Gerald B. Lefcourt, released a statement on behalf of the actress that held fast to their supposition that Cardona was looking for a windfall at the end of the trial.

“It is clear to us that the so-called victim was motivated by the prospects of a payday,” said Lefcourt’s statement. “She devised a plan to have Ms. Polanco pay her to withdraw the charges, which was furthered by a campaign of harassment directed at Ms. Polanco and her family and jeopardized their safety. Fortunately, we had irrefutable evidence of the complainant’s misdeeds on tape, including her extortion attempts, which was provided to the District Attorney’s Office.”
He added, “Ms. Polanco is delighted to be able finally to put this matter behind her and refocus her energies on her family, and her career.”
