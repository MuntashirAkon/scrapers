Come September 26, This Is Us will make its triumphant return to NBC. We say triumphant because a) it's true no matter what after a first season like that and b) we're just assuming the show will walk away with at least one win out of its many Emmy nominations.In any case, season two of the NBC hit is one of the most anticipated shows of the fall, and we don't need to explain to you why. If you're anything like us, you've spent the summer clamoring for any info about what's to come next for the Pearsons, so we've collected it for you all in one place. 

If you start scrolling now, you'll find all the info we've gotten so far about season two of the beloved series, from what we'll learn about Jack's death (a lot) to how much time Mandy Moore will be spending in the makeup chair (also a lot), so get to it! 

This Is Us season two premieres Tuesday, September 26 on NBC.

(E! and NBC are both part of the NBC Universal family.)
