Sad news for lovers of cute, quirky comedies and incredibly handsome men of a certain age: Fox has canceled both The Grinder and Grandfathered, depriving us of the sexiness of both Rob Lowe and John Stamos on our TV screens for another year.In The Grinder, Lowe played a mega-famous actor who, after playing a lawyer on TV for many years, moves home and joins his family's law practice, run by his father and brother (Fred Savage). Grandfathered followed playboy Jimmy (Stamos) who discovers that not only is he the father of a twentysomething he didn't know about, Gerald (Josh Peck), Gerald just recently had a kid of his own—making Jimmy a grandfather.Both series pulled modest ratings through their critically acclaimed runs, but ultimately the small but dedicated fanbases for each weren't enough to score renewals for either show.

Stamos told E! News that he was proud of the show he and the Grandfathered team made—and was also happy about the way the first season ended. "We left it cliffhangery enough for it to be interesting and also, whether we come back next year or not, we'll be able to play it either way," he told us."I love this show. I put a lot into it. I love the character," he told us. "This is the show that I wanted to do."We all lose when Stamos and Lowe aren't on our TV screens anymore, but, considering both shows lived for the entire 2015-16 season, didn't we all win?Fox has also pulled the plug on animated comedy Bordertown, about a Border Patrol Agent living near Mexico and his immigrant neighbor, who overcome their differences and eventually become friends.
