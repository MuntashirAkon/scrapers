Well that was not what we were expecting. Drake and Josh reunited on Grandfathered tonight, and it was sort of upsetting to watch Drake act like such a straight up douchebag while all Josh Gerald wanted to do was pitch him an app. There were, however, some glorious references to be had as Drake Bell and Josh Peck reconnected. "You know, you remind me of my stepbrother," Drake (whose name wasn't Drake, but whatever) said. "Oh, is he awesome?" Gerald asked. "No, no. He's in jail for stalking Oprah," Drake revealed, which sounds about right. 

While at first, Drake (Kirk?) seemed to have no interest in Gerald and Vanessa's co-parenting app, he did eventually come around and agreed to give them "double the seed money" which sure sounds like a thing we understand. In the end, there was hugging and selfie-taking, and Drake and Josh were together again. That sure is too bad about Josh's current stint in jail, however. What did you think of the reunion? Was it everything you dreamed it would be? Sound off in the comments!
