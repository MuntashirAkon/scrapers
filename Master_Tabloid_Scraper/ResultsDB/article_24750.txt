Boxer Gerald Washington -- Arrested In Burbank /nBoxing phenom Gerald Washington was arrested in Burbank, CA late Monday night ... TMZ Sports has learned. Washington -- a former tight end at USC -- is 14-0 in the ring ... but last night, the 32-year-old found himself in handcuffs after a routine traffic stop went south. Law enforcement sources tell us ... cops noticed Washington's Chevy truck was  "straddling the lines " just before midnight ... plus, he had expired tags ... so they pulled him over. During the stop, cops determined Washington was NOT under the influence -- but officers noticed a warrant out for his arrest stemming for a previous driving without a license incident. He was taken into custody and bail was set at $5k. We're told Washington -- nicknamed  "El Gallo Negro " -- was very cooperative. We're told Washington is still in custody./n
