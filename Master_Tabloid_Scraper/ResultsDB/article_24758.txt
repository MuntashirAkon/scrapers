Get Out! Barack Related to Pitt -- Hillary to Angie/nThis is one crazy family tree! The New England Historic Genealogical Society, the oldest and largest nonprofit genealogical organization in the country, has found a way to get Barack and Hillary together -- through lineage! They claim Barack Obama and Brad Pitt are ninth cousins, and Hillary Clinton is related to Pitt's baby mama, Angelina Jolie -- they're also ninth cousins. That family reunion would have drama for days! The report also says that Obama is a very distant relative of President Bush. According to the Geological Society , they are 10th cousins, once removed ... whatever that means.Barack is also linked to five other Presidents -- including Harry S. Truman and Gerald Ford. Hillary is a distant cousin of singers Madonna, Celine Dion and Alanis Morissette, because of French-Canadian descent on her mother's side. If she doesn't win the nomination, maybe they can form a band./n
