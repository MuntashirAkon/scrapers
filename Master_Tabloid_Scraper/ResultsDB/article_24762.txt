 Dial 411 for Dannielynn's Real Baby Daddy/nOn the morning of Anna Nicole's death, her half-sister, Donna Hogan, handed over the final manuscript to Phoenix Books of a tell-all about the buxom blonde. Soon after her untimely demise, the book was titled  "Train Wreck: The Life and Death of Anna Nicole Smith, " according to the New York Post. In it, Hogan discusses the  "weird relationship " Anna had with her lawyer Howard K. Stern. And although she falls short of crying foul play on his part, she reportedly implies that Anna Nicole knew Stern wasn't the father of 5-month-old Dannielynn and was threatening to let the world know, which might have ticked him off.As for the whole paternity thing, publisher Michael Viner says naming all the possible papas is nearly impossible.  "Please, we'd need to include a phone book, " he says. Stern to Anna's Mom: Back Off! Howard K. Stern returned to the Bahamas to show Anna Nicole's mother that's she not getting anywhere near his would-be daughter, Dannielynn. Wearing pink, the 5-month-old was reunited with her legal daddy at a secret location â€“ and it was all caught on tape. According to the New York Post, during an interview with  "Entertainment Tonight, " Stern didn't hold anything back about his hatred of Anna's mom.  "Anna despised that woman, " he says.  "As long as I have breath in my body, that woman will not see Dannielynn. She can't take my baby. This is the only piece of Anna I have left.
