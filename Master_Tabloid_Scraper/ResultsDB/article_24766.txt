Not exactly, according to Dorothea, the white haired woman sitting in the middle.
She apparently has said that she's not going to be trying weed again because she didn't like the way it made her lose control.
But how does she feel about decriminalization?? She said:
"I don't understand what the big deal is about being high on marijuana."
Bam! She doesn't like it but she won't poop on other people's parties.
We need women like her in politics! We'd vote for Dorothea!
