Golden girls … on ganja!
This video of three grandmas smoking weed for the first time has gone viral!
Paula, Dorothea, and Deidre profess to have never smoked pot before, and are inhaling for the very first time on camera!
The video was shot in Washington State, where recreational use of marijuana is legal.
