Richie Sambora KICKED OFF Of Bon Jovi Tour For Hard-PAArtying!!/n

We found Richie Sambora!!! 
Unfortunately, we STILL won't be seeing him on the rest of Bon Jovi's tour and that's because Jon Bon Jovi doesn't want him there!
The guitarist was thrown off the tour because he was WAY more interested in playing party animal than playing music. 
A source dished: 
â€œJon has been trying to get rid of him. He drinks constantly and has a stream of Hollywood bimbos around all the time. At the urging of his wife, Dorothea, Bon Jovi wants to keep the tour free of booze and drugs."
And seeing as Richie seemingly has NO INTENTION of cleaning up even though he's been in rehab twice, it makes sense that Jon doesn't want to see his friend self destruct all over again. 
Not to mention, Jon is still recovering from his own daughter's addiction troubles. 
While Richie was easily replaced by guitarist Theofilos Xenidis, we're crossing our fingers that he takes this as a wake up call. 
No one likes a sloppy musician, particularly when it is on stage in front of thousands of fans! 
Clean up your act, Richie. If not for you, than for the sake of your family!!!
