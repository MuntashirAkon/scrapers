Watch out, Blake Lively! Reese Witherspoon has a lifestyle site hit on her hands.The actress' new website Draper James, which features American South-inspired items across apparel, home and jewelry categories, is already a smashing success: Just hours after launching on May 6, the online store has already sold out of some key items, including a $325 black leather "Derby" shoulder bag and the $225 "Solid Edgehill" dress. A pair of $125 "Bristol" flower-print shorts and the $300 "Belle Meade" dress are also nearly gone. (Guess you got to get ‘em while they're hot!)The newest venture is close to home for Reese, who named the website after her grandparents Dorothea Draper and William James Witherspoon, and has described her Nashville upbringing as a major influence for the project.

Draper James, by the way, also includes city and style guides, like how to dress the part all the time and where to eat in New Orleans. The actress is following in the tradition of Lively, who launched her own lifestyle website Preserve in 2014, and Gwyneth Paltrow, whose, er, much-talked-about Goop lifestyle guide has been around since 2008. (Want to know which to go to for, well, what? We've put the three sites to the test.)It's been a really good week for Reese, beyond the e-commerce site success: She's currently promoting her latest flick Hot Pursuit with Sofia Vergara, and made a red-hot Met Gala appearance on May 4, too.
