"I am overwhelmed and a disaster," Gwyneth Paltrow bemoans at the beginning of this year's GOOP holiday gift guide. Here, she is referring to the fact that she's not on top of her Christmas game this year.Still, she has compiled a list of her favorite things and has "included some old favorites and some new finds, all of which will make Father Christmas proud."Looking at some of these prices, they would make Father Christmas pretty damn poor.How much would it cost to buy the entirety of Gwyneth's GOOP gift guide? We did the math.[Editor's note: The items listed below are in the style and quantity pictured on the actual gift guide.
