 ANOTHER Development In Diana 'Murder' Mystery, As Author Claims Princess Killed.../n
Princess Diana was expectant with Dodi Fayed‘s unborn child at the time the two died in an auto accident in Paris, the author of a new book claims, adding that the pregnancy “established a motive for murder” that was carried out by Britain’s SAS, to avoid the fallout of a scandal of having a child out of wedlock.
Alan Power, author of The Princess Diana Conspiracy, writes that Dr. Elizabeth Dion and a nurse Jocelyn Magellan at Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital in Paris saw the late princess had a six-to-10-week-old fetus in her womb. Power, according to the UK Daily Star, said the budding pregnancy “established a motive for murder and explained Diana’s illegal and speedy embalming.”

The pregnancy theory was floated during the 2007 inquest into Di’s death, though Powers said “this evidence [of the nurse and doctor] was not available in court, although available to some others.”
The report furthers a budding conspiracy set forth after a troop identified as Solider N told his wife the 36-year-old princess was clandestinely assassinated in the Aug. 1997 auto accident in Paris after a special forces team blinded the car’s driver, Henri Paul, with a searing laser. /n
