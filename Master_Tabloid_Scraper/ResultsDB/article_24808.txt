Princess Diana's Lover Slams New Movie About Their Affair/n
Dr. Hasnat Khan is angrily speaking out against the upcoming movie, Diana.
The cardiologist was by most accounts the great love of Princess Diana’s  life in her final two years.  She ended their affair and took up with Dodi Fayed just weeks before they both died in a Paris car crash in 1997.
The movie, simply called Diana, features Naomi Watts  as Diana and Lost  star Naveen Andrews as the Pakistani-born physician.
“It is based on gossip and Diana’s friends talking about a relationship that they didn’t know much about, and some of my relatives who didn’t know much about it either. It is all based on hypotheses and gossip,” Khan told The Daily Mail in a rare interview.
Diana referred to Khan as “Dr. Wonderful” to her friends.  She had reportedly wanted them to marry but Khan couldn’t handle the media intrusion into their lives and was not able to commit.

Khan did not cooperate with the filmmakers and is angered by their suggestions that he did.
“There is no way I will watch it,” he said.
