In 2008, the company allegedly gave him a check for $585k, but told him months later that due to an error, he needed to return $496K.
To add insult to injury, they said they wouldn't give the TV presenter any more money until they got their $496K back.
When Nye asked for Disney's money records in 2016, he discovered they allegedly owed him $9.3 million since signing his contract in 1993!
The conglomerate has yet to comment.
Science doesn't lie!
