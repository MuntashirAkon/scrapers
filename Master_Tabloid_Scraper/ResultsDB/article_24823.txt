It seems like bad blood is brewing between Bella Hadid and Selena Gomez.

Word has it that Hadid is “hurt and pissed” about how her ex-boyfriend, The Weeknd, has quickly moved on with Gomez just months after their breakup. Though she was never close friends with the “Hands to Myself” singer despite running in the same social circles, the model is said to be very upset by The Weeknd (born Abel Tesfaye) and Gomez’s budding relationship.
“Bella and Abel’s split wasn’t dramatic, but of course she’s hurt and pissed that he’s moved on so quickly with Selena,” a source tells People, adding that Hadid was the one who broke things off with The Weeknd back in November.

In fact, a Hadid pal even claims the 20-year-old warned The Weeknd, 26, about Gomez, 24, potentially using him to further her music career.
“Bella has reached out to Abel a few times and told him Selena is using him,” the insider tells Us Weekly. “He thinks she’s just jealous and isn’t listening to her.”
Gomez and The Weeknd first met in 2015 when they performed at the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show. Earlier this month, the two were photographed kissing and hugging while enjoying a dinner date in Santa Monica.
Hadid seemingly responded to romance rumors by unfollowing Gomez on Instagram and sharing a photo of herself giving the middle finger to the camera.
