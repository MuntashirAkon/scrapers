Today (Nov. 30, 2016), Bella Hadid made her Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show debut, hitting the runway alongside sister Gigi Hadid, Kendall Jenner and Victoria’s Secret veterans like Adriana Lima and Lily Aldridge.

Bella looked absolutely stunning as she walked down the runway, and no one could keep their eyes off her, including ex-boyfriend The Weeknd. The Weeknd (whose real name is Abel Tesfaye), performed at the VS Fashion Show for the second year in a row, serenading the crowd and models, including Bella, with a performance of “Starboy.”
The singer and the model locked eyes as soon as she stepped on the runway and didn’t look away from each other until Bella made her way to the very end of the runway and even then, The Weeknd stayed close behind her.

While Bella was no doubt a bundle of nerves as she hit the VS runway for the first time ever, sister Gigi confessed she feels much less pressure than she did last year. “I just am trying to have the best time and enjoy every second,” she told E! News. 
Gigi also expressed excitement over one of this year’s performers: Lady Gaga. “She is an amazing person that has been such a great friend to me and kind of a big sister and has given me so much great advice in my life, so I’m always excited to be anywhere with her and especially tonight, to be in her section,” Gigi revealed backstage. “I don’t know if I’m allowed to say that but we will be on stage together tonight and I’m so excited.”
