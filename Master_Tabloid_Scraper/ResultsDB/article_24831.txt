Big Bang Theory actress Kaley Cuoco was spotted walking to yoga class in Sherman Oaks, CA on Monday (Aug. 15, 2016) flaunting a rock-hard set of abs in a tummy-exposing tank.

While paying her parking meter, Cuoco made sure those nearby could read her workout bag, which says: “Carrying this bag full of shit is my cardio.”
The actress and the rest of the hit show’s cast and crew just recently started filming again, meaning Cuoco gave up her long platinum in waves in favor of her character Penny’s shorter, dirty blonde tresses.



Sending mad 💗 and props to @faye.woods for bringing my cut and colour back to its ‘Penny’ roots #nofilter
