"King Kong" Beauty Fay Wray Dead/n
        Fay Wray's claim to fame was simple, yet significant. She was the beauty who killed the beast.                Wray, the platinum-haired heroine of the original King Kong, died Sunday in New York City. She was 96.                Wray appeared in nearly 100 films, from the silent era to the Jimmy Carter administration. She was known for one film: 1933's King Kong.                 In the groundbreaking action-fantasy tale about a giant gorilla--the special-effects of which reportedly caused fainting spells among overwhelmed 1930s audiences--a 25-year-old Wray starred as Ann Darrow, the dewy-eyed actress who charms the great Kong.                 Sadly, as the The Rocky Horror Picture Show song, "Science Fiction/Double Feature," put it, "something went wrong for Fay Wray and King Kong." Wray ended up screaming her lungs out; Kong ended up falling to his death from atop the Empire State Building.                  Critic Roger Ebert, noting that the Variety of 1933 had denounced Wray's performance as "a film-long screaming session...too much for any actress and any audience," agreed with the assessment, but not the conclusion.                 "Nobody has ever forgotten that performance," Ebert wrote of Wray in 2002.                Certainly, Wray never forgot the film that earned her a lifetime of plaudits from genre fans and movie buffs.                "I think it's wonderful that there is a movie that is so enduring and that I'm a part of it," Wray said of Kong in a 1998 interview for Scarlet Street magazine. "I like that feeling, now. It used to be that I was a little 'Oh, dear, an animal picture! Oh, my!'"                As for the screams, Wray told McKay she directed those herself. "I went into the sound room [at RKO studios] and made an aria of horror sounds," Wray said in Scarlet Street. "I was in charge of it; there was no one there to listen to me."                 Wray's long list of non-Kong credits are largely unknown to all but film historians. Two exceptions: 1929's The Four Feathers, the oft-remade epic war tale, and the 1957 Debbie Reynolds confection, Tammy and the Bachelor.                 Wray worked steadily in episodic TV in the 1950s, and costarred in the 1953-54 ABC sitcom The Pride of the Family, featuring a teenaged Natalie Wood.                Her last acting role came in the 1980 TV-movie, Gideon's Trumpet, starring Henry Fonda.                In 1998, she was singled out in the audience of the Academy Awards by admiring emcee Billy Crystal.                Born Sept. 15, 1907, in Canada, Wray married three times, and was widowed twice. Her second husband was Oscar-winning screenwriter Robert Riskin (It Happened One Night and other Frank Capra favorites). Survivors include daughter Victoria Riskin, a screenwriter.              And, in a nod to Wray's best known role, officials at the Empire State Building plan to dim the lights Tuesday night in remembrance of the actress.
