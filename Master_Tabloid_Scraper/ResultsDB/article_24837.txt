In the blink of an eye, Nanny was up on stage herself. "Listen, Grandmas need love, too," the show's M.C. reminded before the half-dressed cast performed yet another steamy routine, including a personal lap dance.  "This guy's grinding all over her—gives her a kiss," Chase recalled about his grandma's visit. "That's disgusting," Savannah retorted. "It was all worth it to make her happy," he responded. No matter what they thought, Nanny Faye's wide grin said it all. 

Tune in to the new episode of Chrisley Knows Best on Tuesday, Oct. 11 at 10/9c.(E! and USA are both part of the NBCUniversal family.)
