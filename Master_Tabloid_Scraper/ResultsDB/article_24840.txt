People v. O.J. Simpson: Could Connie Britton Have Been Any More Incredible As RHOBH's Faye Resnick? Is there anything Connie Britton can't do?  We'd were already happy to have her as our mother, our principal, our guidance counselor, and our life coa.../n
Is there anything Connie Britton can't do? We'd were already happy to have her as our mother, our principal, our guidance counselor, and our life coach, and now we're thrilled to call her one of our Real Housewives. Tonight's episode of The People V. O.J. Simpson covered a whole lot of ground, from preliminary hearings to jury selection to grieving with the families of the victims, but it also brought us one beautiful but contentious piece of the Simpson saga: Faye Resnick's insane tell-all, Nicole Brown Simpson: The Private Diary of a Life Interrupted. First, Faye pitched her story to a book agent and described the drug trips and other shenanigans she got up to with her friend, Nicole Brown Simpson. Just watch the clip below to hear her describe a "Brentwood Hello" and have your idea of Connie Britton changed forever.*(Just kidding. Your idea of Connie Britton was changed when you first saw her have sex with what turned out to be a ghost in a BDSM fetish suit on American Horror Story but you get the idea.) 

Britton-as-Resnick also made a little visit to Larry King Live to promote her book, which Judge Ito was encouraging everyone not to read. Of course, no one followed those instructions, and Faye's juicy tale of drugs, partying, and her and Nicole's shared one night stand became an mostly-hated phenomenon.

In real life, Resnick is more known for her famous appearance on Larry King Live in 1996, nearly a year after the verdict was read.You can watch footage of that interview below!
