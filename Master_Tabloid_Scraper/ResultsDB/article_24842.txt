Hilary Duff Disses Faye Dunaway/n
The Battle of the Bonnie lasses is getting ugly.Hilary Duff clearly had enough of Faye Dunaway's supposed criticism about whether she has the chops to take on one of the Oscar winner's most iconic roles, the gun-toting Bonnie Parker, in a new flick titled The Story of Bonnie and Clyde.During a break from filming a guest spot on the set of Ghost Whisperer, Duff told E!'s Daily 10, "I think that my fans that are going to go see the movie don't even know who she is," regarding the Hollywood legend (repeat, Hollywood legend), adding, "I think it was a little unnecessary, but I might be mad if I looked like that now, too."Duff's diss stems from Dunaway's alleged remark, upon hearing the news that the former Lizzie McGuire starlet would be playing her old part, "Couldn't they at least cast a real actress?"Here's hoping this little war of words ends more peacefully than Bonnie herself did.â€”Reporting by Michael Yo
