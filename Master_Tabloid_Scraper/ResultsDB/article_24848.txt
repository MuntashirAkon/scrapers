Judy Garland's Body Moved from New York to Hollywood/nJudy Garland is no longer in New York ... confused? Garland, who died in 1969, has been ensconced in a mausoleum in Hartsdale, New York ever since. Â  The remains of the 'Wizard of Oz' star were removed from the cemetery last Thursday and placed in the cargo hold of an American Airlines flight Tuesday night from JFK to LAX.  We're told the body will be interred at Hollywood Forever Cemetery at the behest of Judy's daughter, Liza Minnelli. It's unclear why Liza ordered the move nearly a half-century after her mom's death. People first reported the move. Hollywood Forever has a slew of celebs who call it home, including Cecil B. DeMille, 2 of the Ramones, Bugsy Siegel, Rudy Valentino, Fay Wray, and Jayne Mansfield. Also buried there ... Mickey Rooney, with whom Judy did several movies./n
