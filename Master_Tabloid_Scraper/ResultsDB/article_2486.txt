“My surgery went off without a hitch,” she wrote at the time. “There was no endometriosis left. Between my surgeries and hormonal intervention, I was disease-free. That doesn’t mean it can never return, but for now, once my sutures have been removed and my bruises have changed . . . I will be healthy.”
A source close to Dunham told Page Six that her hospital visit stemmed from her health condition.
