It was an artsy Saturday night in Los Angeles as A-listers hit the MOCA Annual Gala The Artist’s Museum Happening wearing mostly glam getup from Chanel. Kate Bosworth was clad in our favorite look of the weekend, wearing a flutter-sleeved gown with a satin clutch and jewels, all from the French fashion house. Other Best Dressed nods at the swanky soire? Rachel Bilson, who opted for a sexy mini, and Ginnifer Goodwin, who showed off her legs in a lacy and racy Chanel gown.
