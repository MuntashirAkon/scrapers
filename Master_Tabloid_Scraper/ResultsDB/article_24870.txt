See How Kendall Jenner Looks With A Giant Snake Tattoo On Her Thigh!/n

Oh, so this is what Kendall Jenner would look like with a giant thigh tattoo! Got it.
We almost wish this were real because just imagine Kris Jenner's face upon seeing it, LOLz! It would be AWESOME.
Kenny covers V Magazine's spring 2017 issue with a huge, elaborate snake on her right thigh, and it's quite a sight. It's also quite a departure from the tiny "meow" tattoo on her inner lip and the broken heart tattoo she's got inked on her finger.

We can't picture the supermodel ever diving into the commitment of getting some large artwork on her body, but this makes it fun to imagine.
The 21-year-old also just happens to look gorgeous and seductive with very dark eye makeup and her long hair hanging wet and sleek down her side.
Vamp!
Other models joining the tattooed cover include Joan Smalls, Amber Valletta, and Carolyn Murphy. Talk about being in good company!
We're just surprised Gigi and Bella Hadid didn't also make the cut. They must've been busy!
