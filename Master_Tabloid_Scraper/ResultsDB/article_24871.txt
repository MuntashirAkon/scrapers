EXCLUSIVE! Rising Star Haley Bennett Shows Off Her Real Sultry Singing Voice In A Kind Of Murder Clip!/n

We are just so impressed with Haley Bennett!
When she isn't kicking ass in films like Kristy and The Magnificent Seven, she's getting her mystery on in literary fare like The Girl On The Train and now A Kind Of Murder.
Based on the Patricia Highsmith novel, A Kind Of Murder tells the story of a Walter Stackhouse, just your average 1960s man who endangers his life and his marriage when he becomes fascinated with a beautiful woman and an unsolved murder. It's like Mad Men Noir.
