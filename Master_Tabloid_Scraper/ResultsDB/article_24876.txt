When Harry Styles is on stage, the only direction he goes is down.

The crazy hot One Direction star fell down again during their concert in Toronto, Canada last night (August 20 2015). And how appropriate, ‘cuz the video for their newest song “Drag Me Down” just came out today.

It looks like his heels were slippery and he really lost his footing while hopping back (or something of that sort), falling smack down on his back.

The last time he fell was back in July in San Diego, when he had the most adorable spill because he was yanked back by his microphone cord. The image in your head is just as funny as the video footage fans caught.
Talented yet aloof, beautiful yet clumsy, we love him in every way.
