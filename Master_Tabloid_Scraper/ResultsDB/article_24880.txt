What, No ‘Under My Mozzarella-Ella-Ella-Ey-Ey-Ey’ Jokes?/n
“It’s-a me, Rihannio!”
Sorry, I just had to add my own caption today, because I cannot resist a good Mario joke. And by “good” I mean not. And by “joke” I mean also not. Besides, this pizza with Rihanna’s face on it is no laughing matter! It is a work of art, really, created by Domenico Crolla, who you can see grinning like a proud papa in the photo above.
Should you feel hungry for a slice of Bad Gal Riri’s face, you can simply book yourself a reservation (and a plane ticket and a hotel room) at Bella Napoli in Glasgow, Scotland. Meet you there after we all finish reading today’s winning captions?
