 Disney Channel’s Jessie is getting into the nature conservation business – kind of – on Friday’s new episode.
Everyone knows the famous Disney movie, One Hundred and One Dalmatians. Well, Jessie is serving up its own spin on the tale. And Celebuzz has an exclusive first look photo from the episode.
On “101 Lizards,” Ravi’s (Karan Brar) monitor lizard – and link to his homeland, India – becomes a handful with her 12 baby lizards. Of course, he wants to find them the perfect homes for the scaly dozen and Jessie (Debby Ryan) and the other kids are willing to help. But, it isn’t exactly an easy thing to find homes for a lizard that could grow to seven feet.

Plus, the gang thinks that Ms. Chesterfield (Carolyn Hennesy) might have pulled the wool over their eyes by hiring someone to adopt the lizards so that she can turn them into purses and belts. Um, she’s mean, but is she capable of that?
Take a look at our exclusive photo above.
Jessie airs Fridays at 8:30 PM on Disney Channel.
