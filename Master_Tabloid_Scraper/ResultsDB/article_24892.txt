Jason Collins' Ex-Fiancée, Carolyn Moos, Reacts to the NBA Player Coming Out as Gay/n
NBA player Jason Collins coming out as a gay man may have shocked many, but perhaps no one was more surprised to hear the news than his onetime fiancée of eight years.Carolyn Moos opened up to E! News' Catt Sadler today about her former beau's revelation, saying that for "33 years of his life he put on a mask everyday."Moos, who says that she "absolutely" thought they would be together forever, explained that the Washington Wizards center most certainly did not tell that part of his story when he broke off their engagement.

"At the time I wanted reasons," she said. "I asked of him, 'Can you write some reasons down?' At the time he didn't know how to phrase it but he said, 'When I'm ready I'm going to back to you with the truth,' or something that wasn't tangible."But Moss finally got her answer this week. "He said, 'The only reason I never married you is because I'm gay,'" she told E!Collins called Carolyn and left a message telling her he had something important to share with her and, when  she called him back, he explained."What he shared with me never crossed my mind," she said. "You ask his parents, his twin brother, his teammates...They'll say the same thing."

Although the news caused Moos to rethink her future, she doesn't feel betrayed by Collins. "I definitely want to have children and I definitely want to be married and that was the hardest part," she said. "I think as women, we do have goals and timetables, but I think when you're writing a dream and a life-long script with somebody who you truly believed you're going to wake up to for the rest of your life—that's not easy to let go of. But I think with time and information, you can have a prospective on it. It's all processing. It's literally three days fresh."Moos added, "Hopefully in that process we can still be a part of each other's lives in a positive way."
