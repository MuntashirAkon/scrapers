By George! John F. Kennedy Jr. Weds Carolyn Bessette/n
In what could be the biggest blow to hopeful women since Paul McCartney got hitched, John F. Kennedy Jr. renounced his title as America's most eligible bachelor Saturday, marrying longtime gal pal Carolyn Bessette on a remote Georgia island.The 35-year-old magazine publisher, forever known as John-John, married the former Calvin Klein flack in a Roman Catholic ceremony at a black Baptist church on Cumberland Island, a secluded resort formerly owned by fellow robber-baron clan, the Carnegies.Security was beefed up on the tiny island. "It was important for us to be able to conduct this in a private, prayerful and meaningful way with the people we love," Kennedy said through a spokesperson. The couple exchanged vows at First African Baptist Church, which was built by freed slaves after the Civil War.The hush-hush ceremony included the bridegroom's uncle, Sen. Edward Kennedy, and sister, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, who was matron of honor. Her daughters Rose and Tatiana served as flower girls, and her son Jack was the ring-bearer. The Reverend Charles J. O'Byrne oversaw the double-ring rites Saturday evening. The best man was Kennedy's cousin, Anthony Radziwill.Kennedy wore his father's watch during the ceremony. "I know Jack and Jackie would be very proud of them and full of love for them as they begin their future together," said Ted Kennedy in a statement today.Bessette, a 29-year-old blonde from Connecticut, has lived with Kennedy since he broke up with Darryl Hannah. In addition to his duties as sexiest man alive, her new husband edits his own political magazine, George. He was previously an assistant district attorney in Manhattan for a short time after successfully passing the bar--it took him several tries. The couple is reportedly honeymooning off the Georgia-Florida coast.
