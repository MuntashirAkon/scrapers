A landmark 30th season of Survivor has come to an end, meaning another Sole Survivor has been crowned. So who walked away with the title, and were they white collar, blue collar, or no collar at all? In the end, that million dollar check was made out to...Mike Holloway! The 38 year-old Texas oil driller was a member of the blue collar tribe, Escameca, and after the game he played in that finale, it was pretty clear that he was about to win. He dominated all three challenges (one with help from his mom!) and ended up in the final three with Carolyn and Will, after Rodney and Sierra were eliminated. 

Jeff Probst revealed that if he hadn't won, Mike would have been in the top ten to join next season's fan-voted second chance cast, so now another former cast member will take his spot. The official cast of season 31 of Survivor is: Kelly Wigglesworth, season 1Kimmi Kappenberg, season 2Jeff Varner, season 2Keith Nale,  season 29Peih-Gee Law, season 15 Ciera Eastin, season 27 Vytas Baskauskas, season 27Terry Deitz, season 12 Andrew Savage, season 7Abi-Maria Gomes, season 25 Kass McQuillen, season 28 Monica Padilla, season 19Kelley Wentworth, season 29Shirin Oskooi, season 30 Woo Hwang, season 28Stephen Fishbach, season 18 Tasha Fox, season 28Jeremy Collins, season 29Spencer Bledsoe, season 28 Joe Anglim, season 30 The season will take place in Cambodia, and starts filming immediately!
