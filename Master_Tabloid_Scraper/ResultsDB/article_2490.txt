 Run Out Of Waco? Chip & Joanna Gaines Plan Shocking Move During 'Fixer Upper' Filming.../n
Chip and Joanna Gaines are heading out of Texas, RadarOnline.com has learned.
The couple rose to fame as the resident home flippers in Waco, but revealed that they are ready to expand their business elsewhere.
“We’ve got four young babies and so the farther we get from home, it makes it almost impossible for us to figure out how to keep everything in balance or in line,” Chip explained to PEOPLE.

He added that he would choose to move to Las Vegas, while Joanna would choose New York City.
“It’s so funny because anytime we go to the Big City — any big city really, but New York specifically — and you see these beautiful little families and they are walking their one little baby, two max, and I’m like, What would we do with four kids?” Chip added. “You know, you would lose at least one of those kids every time you walked down to the store and back.”
“Waco is our meet in the middle spot: half big city, half tropical —maybe not,” he joked. “We talk about it. We’ve been to Kansas City a lot recently and have just fallen in love with that community. Salt Lake, every time we go there it just kind of really inspires us, obviously New York City for Jo. There are a few cities across the country that we would possibly consider if Waco did not work out.”

Radar previously reported that the family was starting to loosen up their ties to Waco, as they’ve begun to rent out their summer home. They have also cut off ties to their controversial Antioch Community Church.
But, they still have a connection to the area, as their Magnolia Silos neighbor is currently suing them for over $1 million. The neighbor claimed Chip and Joanna wrongfully put a fence on his property.
The Gaines family has no immediate plans to move, as they still call Waco home.

😂 Not sure how that got twisted but Waco is our home, we love it and we aren't going anywhere…
