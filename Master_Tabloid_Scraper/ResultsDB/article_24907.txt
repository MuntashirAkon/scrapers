Trump's Ex-Henchwoman Has Two Flat Ones/nDo not cross the Donald. He has evil powers over Manhattan real estate.Or so it seemed when Carolyn Kepcher, Donald's ex-right-hand-betch in  "The Apprentice, " plowed through a big ol' Big Apple pothole and got herself not one, but two flat tires. Remember, she got the real  "You're fired! " treatment from His Comboverness last year, when she reportedly got a little too big for her bitches.Rather than blowing a gasket, Carolyn actually held it together -- and even posed next to the blown tires -- while waiting a very, very long time for AAA to rescue her.
