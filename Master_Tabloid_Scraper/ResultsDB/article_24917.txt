Queen B has been chillaxing in a $25 million mansion since giving birth last month. But even at over 12,000 square feet, the 35-year-old feels trapped.
“She’s desperate to get out again and start moving, but she’s still under strict orders to stay at home and let her body heal.”
As Radar has reported, Bey and hubby Jay-Z were forced to stay at the hospital a little longer than expected, while doctors dealt with “minor issues” with newborns Rumi and Sir.
