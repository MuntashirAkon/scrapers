Carlos Santana SLAMS Beyonce: 'She's Not A Singer!'/n
The Beyhive may be buzzing that Beyonce was robbed at the Grammy Awards on Sunday, but Carlos Santana believes she deserved to lose!
In a new interview with the Australian Associated Press, the legendary guitarist said Adele‘s victory over Queen Bey was justified because “she can sing.” As Radar readers know, the 28-year-old Brit won out for her album 25, leaving Beyonce’s renowned Lemonade in the dust.
“I think that Adele won because she can sing, sing,” Santana told the publication, via the New Zealand Herald.
“With all respect to our sister Beyonce, Beyonce is very beautiful to look at and it’s more like modeling kind of music — music to model a dress — she’s not a singer, singer, with all respect to her,” he added.
Of course, it didn’t take long for Bey’s posse of fans to come after Santana.

The fact that Carlos Santana said those comments after he's performed on stage with Beyoncé at halftime and witnessed her talent is baffling

Meanwhile, as radar exclusively revealed, Bey and Adele are recording a duet together.
“They’re still talking about what they want to do,” a source told Radar. “But this is going to be one of the biggest duets of all time.”
