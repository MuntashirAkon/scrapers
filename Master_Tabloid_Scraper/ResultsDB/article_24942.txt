It looks like Adele won’t be hitting the road for a long time.

The singer announced that she may never tour again when she shared a handwritten letter about her future plans during her concert at Wembley Stadium Wednesday night (June 28, 2017). Celebrating the end of her international tour in support of her album, 25, the 29-year-old reflected on her time traveling the world.
“So this is it after 15 months on the road and 18 months of 25 we are at the end,” she wrote. “Touring is a peculiar thing, it doesn’t suit me particularly well. I’m a real homebody and I get so much joy in the small things.”

“I only ever did this tour for you and to hopefully have an impact on you the way that some of my favorite artists have had on me live. And I wanted my final shows to be in London because I don’t know if I’ll ever tour again and so I want my last time to be at home,” the letter continued. “I might never see you again at a live show. Who knows. But I will remember this for the rest of my life.”
In the past, Adele had to cancel her tour due to a vocal hemorrhage. When tickets Adele’s concerts went on sale in 2015, it sold out within minutes of its release.
“If my throat goes, then I’ll never be able to do a tour again,” she lamented to Rolling Stone at the time. “I’ll be able to get my throat fixed again and do studio work, but do I want to do some-thing and then fail at it and be too scared to ever try it again?”
