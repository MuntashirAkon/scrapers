Forget freeing the nipple. Kendall Jenner just got smacked in the face with a pair of boobs.

The model and pal Cara Delevingne got a whole new lesson on the female body when they visited New York City’s Museum of Sex on Wednesday (May 31, 2017). The two reportedly spent an hour inside the explicit exhibit, which featured a room made out of giant inflatable breasts.
Apparently, the two BFFs couldn’t resist the urge to make a few mammaries memories as they bounced around on pairs of boobies. Fortunately for us, the X-rated experience ended up on social media.

Delevingne also shared a cheeky post about the museum on her Instagram. Sharing a photo of a pair of breasts sitting on glass plates, the Suicide Squad actress wrote, “👀 big ones, small ones, some the size of your head. You give em a twist, a flick of the wrist 👀”

According to Jenner, visiting the special installation has always been on her bucket list.
“I just always have fun in NYC! I have a lot of really good friends there and there’s never a dull moment,” she wrote on her app last year. “This is going to sound funny, but I’ve always wanted to go to the Museum of Sex. Maybe next trip. ;)”
Well, it looks like she finally got her wish.
