New month, new hair.

Cara Delevingne debuted a seriously white-hot ‘do when she stepped out with pal Kendall Jenner over the weekend. Hitting the town for Paris Fashion Week, the model was spotted rocking a platinum blonde layered bob, which contrasted her signature bold, brown brows.
The 24-year-old was last spotted with golden tresses. The word’s still out if this new color is for the runway or a new movie role, or if Delevingne is just having some fun with hair dye.
