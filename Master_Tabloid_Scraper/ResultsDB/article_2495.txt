While Malia Obama Parties, Sister Sasha Slaves Away At Summer Job/n
As Malia Obama shakes her booty at Lollapalooza, little sister Sasha has been working away at a seafood restaurant in Martha’s Vineyard.
According to the Boston Herald, the 15-year-old has been working the morning shift at Nancy’s, a fried-fish eatery, surrounded by Secret Service agents, of course.
“We were wondering why there were six people helping this girl, but then we found out who it was,” an employee said, reports Page Six.

For her summer gig, the teen has been going by her full name, Natasha, working the takeout counter, prepping lunches for the afternoon rush, and busing tables.
Meanwhile, as RadarOnline.com was first to report, sister Malia was partying the week away at Lollapalooza instead of attending the Democratic National Convention.
During Bryson Tiller‘s Petrillo Bandshell set in Grant Park, WGCI-FM even spotted the president’s daughter twerking and grinding away in the crowd.

Page Six reported that the Obama family will be vacationing in Martha’s Vineyard starting next week. Since then, rumors have swirled among local residents that Sasha’s job is “punishment” or “a humbling real-life experience” for the teen.
Malia, on the other hand, worked on the set of Girls with Lena Dunham last summer.
