It’s Monday morning, and it looks like you could use some tea brewed from the finest celebrity news stories to kick your day into high gear.

While you wrapped up in blankets all weekend, Nicki Minaj and Azealia Banks were showing off major skin during events at Paris Fashion Week. Supposedly inspired by a painting by Pablo Picasso, Minaj exposed her left breast while sitting in the front row at the Haider Ackermann Womenswear Fall/Winter 2017/2018 show. Banks, on the other hand, created her own art by strapping on a thong disguised as denim shorts in the front while attending the Heavensake ‘A Better High’ Awareness Performance at the American Cathedral. See photos of both looks in the gallery at the top of the page.
