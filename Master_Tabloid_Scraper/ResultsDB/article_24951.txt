Family comes first for Adele.

The “Hello” singer canceled the fireworks display at her concerts after her 4-year-old son, Angelo, was hit in the eye with debris  during a soundcheck for her concert in Perth, Australia this Tuesday (Feb. 28, 2017).
At the actual performance, Adele explained the situation to the sold-out crowd, telling them she put the kibosh on the spectacle to prevent any injuries.
“Up until last night, we did have fireworks for you,” she told the audience at the Domain Stadium. “My son was watching [soundcheck] in the crowd … a bit of debris went in his eye so we got rid of them.”

However, Adele expressed interest in bringing back the display after polling the crowd.
“Let’s get a cheer for fireworks if you want them,” she asked. “Let’s get a ‘boo’ if you don’t want sh*t in your eyes.”
After receiving a massive roar for fireworks, the 28-year-old quipped, “Alright, we’ll do it next time.”
Adele’s next performance is set Saturday in Brisbane. Better bring your safety goggles.
