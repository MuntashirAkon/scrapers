Bobbi Kristina Brown Sings Adele in New Video Shared on Two-Year Death Anniversary/n
Bobbi Kristina Brown's legacy lives on. Today marks the two-year anniversary of Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown's only daughter's tragic passing at the age of 22. Just over three years following Whitney's own drowning death, Bobbi Kristina was found unresponsive in a bathtub. She spent nearly seven months in a medically-induced coma before ultimately succumbing to what her estate claims was a "violent altercation" and "toxic mixture" injected by her then-boyfriend Nick Gordon. As time passes, Brown continues to honor her memory, and this painful milestone proved no different. "I [love] you BabyGirl," the New Edition singer captioned a black and white video of Bobbi Kristina singing acapella to Adele's "Someone Like You."

Gone, but certainly never forgotten.
