Jennifer Lawrence and Emma Stone: Don't Worry ... We'll Get Your Duck, Adele/nThe #1 album isn't the only thing Adele scored this week -- she got a free meal courtesy of her celebrity friends ... TMZ has learned.  As we told you, Adele did dinner with Jennifer Lawrence and Emma Stone Monday night at Cosme NYC ... a Mexican restaurant in the Flat Iron District, and the big question's been --  "Who paid? " Our sources tell us when the bill came ... Adele was told her money's no good here -- and Emma, J Law and a 4th non-famous diner split the tab. As for what they ate -- we're told they went for duck carnitas, blue shrimp a la veracruzana, corn husk meringue, and beets with corn salsa and cheese.  Fancy. And pricey ... the duck alone goes for $59!/n
