Adele's L.A. Sellouts Are Cute, But Taylor Swift's Still Queen/nAdele selling out 6 nights in L.A.'s Staples Center is a record, but it's nowhere near good enough to stop Taylor Swift's banner from flying in the rafters there.   Earlier this year, Taylor played 5 consecutive sellouts at Staples, and sources at AEG tell us Adele did break that record by selling out her 6 nights in mere minutes. What she didn't do ... is top T. Swizzle's lifetime record of 16 sold out shows. You'll recall Kobe Bryant presented Tay Tay with her own championship-style banner that hangs in the arena. A lot of fans thought Adele's 6 night run would mean the banner comes down. No dice. Adele will be looking up at Taylor every night at Staples.  /n
