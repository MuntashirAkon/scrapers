Kesha: Sony Says She Could be the Next Adele/nKesha could become the next Adele ... at least that's what Sony Music is claiming in a last-ditch effort to keep the singer under its label. Kesha's locked in a nasty battle to drop Sony and Dr. Luke, claiming the deal she's got with them is torpedoing her comeback. According to legal docs -- obtained by TMZ -- Sony has scoffed at Kesha's claims, pointing out Adele, JT and D'Angelo all took long breaks and came back stronger. Sony also says it's invested more than $11 mil in Kesha's career and she's made a ton of cash as a result --  $3 million in royalties alone. As for Kesha grousing she's falling out of the public's eye ... Sony's calling BS, saying the singer's taken on acting roles on  "Jane the Virgin " and  "Jem and the Holograms. " An Adele-like comeback is possible ... but it's hard to picture Adele brushing her teeth with a bottle of Jack./n
