Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom ... Shotgun Approach to Dating/nKaty Perry and Orlando Bloom had dinner with friends in Silver Lake Thursday night, but left alone in his car which means, if you couldn't tell by now  -- they're totally banging! Maybe. Probably.  They've been inseparable since hitting it off at a Golden Globes party in January, even taking in last week's Adele concert together.  Katy got to sit shotgun this time. He'll be opening her door in no time. /n
