Women Dress In The Handmaid's Tale Costumes To Protest Senate's Awful Health Care Bill Proposal!/n

Preventing life from imitating art.
Hulu's acclaimed drama series The Handmaid's Tale shows a dystopian future where women are stripped of their basic rights — and ladies are using this eerily timely tale to send a message to congress.
On Tuesday, about 30 women stormed Washington D.C. dressed in long red robes and white headpieces to protest the Senate's GOP health care bill.

The dramatic wardrobe was inspired by the robes worn by the handmaids themselves in the series based on the 1985 novel by Margaret Atwood.
The protesters believe the Obamacare replacement bill — which proposes to cut federal funding for Planned Parenthood for one year — will severely cripple women's care. And their message has been received loud and clear!
The Senate had hoped to vote on the bill before July 4, but Majority Leader Mitch McConnell revealed Tuesday the vote would be delayed.
The spectacle also caused a good amount of buzz on Twitter. See more pics (below)!
