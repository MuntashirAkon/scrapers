Taylor Swift, Justin Bieber, & Jennifer Lawrence Are Just A Few Of Forbes' Highest Earning Celebs Under 30! See The Full List!/n

One person's success does NOT mean another's failure. But come on — these kids make the rest of Hollywood look bad!
Forbes released this year's list of the highest earning celebs under 30, and its top earner will be no surprise to anyone: Taylor Swift!
Not only is the Blank Space singer the highest paid woman in music, she's also the highest paid human under the age of 30, raking in an intimidating $170 million in just one year!
Aside from her mega-successful 1989 World Tour, Tay earned some major dough from her many endorsement deals with brands like Diet Coke, Keds, and Apple.

The 26-year-old beat second place's One Direction by $60 million (or by about two Ed Sheerans, who earned just over $30 million), though the popular boy band would have to split their $110 million earnings four ways.
Other stars in the top 10 include Justin Bieber, Rihanna, The Weeknd, and Adele.
Nestled in the list of mostly professional athletes — like Cam Newton and Kevin Durant — is highest paid actress Jennifer Lawrence, who took the no. 12 spot with $46 million.
