And as many of may have noticed, the Oscar winner has added a chic statement piece as her accessory of choice these days while promoting Disney's Queen of Katwe!

On her chic accessory choice, the A-lister dished to People: 
"Going with the theme of the movie, they are my crowns. It's the quintessential African accessory."
Fierce. While the It girl browses for inspiration on Pinterest, her passion for the head pieces come to life thanks to her stylist Micaela Erlanger and her hairstylist Vernon Fran√ßois. She continued:
"It's definitely teamwork to make the head wraps. Micaela and I like to be inspired by the thing we're promoting. So we find our own little secrets and sources of inspiration. So, for this film we're inspired by the character I play."
AH-Mazing! In regards to finding the fabrics for her red carpet crowns, the Star Wars: The Force Awakens alum noted:
"We use the fabric either from the designer that I am wearing or African fabrics that we sourced in east Africa and in the African fabric stores here in New York. And it's been lots of fun to work to create these crowns for my head and celebrate the release of this film."
YAS KWEEN!
Although Lupita has always looked FABULOUS on the red carpet, we think she's taking her style to bigger and better heights.
Snaps all around!
