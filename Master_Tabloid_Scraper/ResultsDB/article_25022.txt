Billboard Music Awards 2016: Twitter Reacts To All The Inneresting Red Carpet Moments — From Kesha's Matador Ensemble To Ariana Grande's Fall!/n

The Billboard Music Awards FINALLY arrived — and boy, did a lot of people have things to say about it online.
As per usual, hordes of fans took to social media sites to comment on the A-list-filled magenta carpet. Classic!
While we OBVIOUSLY have our thoughts about all the looks from this year's awards show, we thought we'd turn to the peanut gallery for the best reactions surrounding the Sin City event. You're welcome!
Be sure to ch-ch-check out all of the best Twitter commentary from the hot event for yourself (below).
The lady of the hour was most definitely Britney Spears. The Baby One More Time singer was slated to slay a medley of her hits before accepting the Millennium Award… but before all that, she STUNNED viewers on the red carpet!

Still, it seems that Shawn Mendes may have stolen some of Brit-Brit's thunder as the teenager was giving fangirls everywhere heart palpitations on the social media site.

Nonetheless, it appears that no one could help but talk about Fifth Harmony star Normani Kordei's shocking new cleavage. HELLO!

Keke Palmer certainly made people scream, as the Scream Queens starlet stepped out in a wine red latex number and had only her big toe painted. WHAT?

as a sweaty bish i feel for keke palmer. the thought of being in latex in any temp over 65 is making me sweat rn

What's up with KeKe Palmer? She doesn't have a stylist?
— J e s s y. (@highoff_cocoa) May 22, 2016


Keke Palmer only painted one toe like she had on peep toe shoes 😂😭

Unfortunately, many people were not fans of Halsey's quirky ensemble for the evening out. Sorry, girl!

Of course, Kesha sparked some controversy when she arrived FASHIONABLY late to the BBMAs and paid tribute to Prince in a purple matador-esque outfit.

— PETTY LA BELLE (@Foreigncoochie_) May 22, 2016
