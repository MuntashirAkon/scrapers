Walter White Gets a Second Final Resting Place/n
There’s no reason for Walter White to turn over in his grave.
Because Bryan Cranston’s infamous fictional TV character will now have a permanent place to rest for eternity… just how he’d like it — outside a bar.
And CB! has the first pics of where Breaking Bad’s newly-deceased meth-making madman will live on.

The nondescript locale outside Vernon’s Steakhouse in Albuquerque, New Mexico will soon come back to life as a place for fans to gather and pay their respects.
Organizer Jackamoe Buzzell has plans to place the tombstone in a wall outside the restaurant’s Black Diamond Lounge…

And the gravesite will host yet another burial ceremony (this time for free).

Buzzell says he also plans on installing a live webcam so not only can diehards say hi to mom and dad, but also so people don’t get any not-so-smart ideas.
“There’s been some talk of stealing it on social media,” he said, “so we’re going to protect it.”
It’s actually the second choice since White’s headstone and vault were moved from nearby Sunset Memorial Park after an online petition prompted those with loved ones buried at the cemetery to protest.
So far organizers have raised about $24,000 with proceeds from the first fictional funeral and sale of cars used on the hit show going to a charity effort to raise money for Albuquerque Health Care for the Homeless.
