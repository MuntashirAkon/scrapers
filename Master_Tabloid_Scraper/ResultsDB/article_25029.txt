Vince Vaughn and Wife Kyla Welcome Second Child: Report/n
Hollywood’s little tots club has a new member.
Vince Vaughn’s wife Kyla Weber gave birth to the couple’s second child on Aug. 7, PEOPLE reports.

The baby boy, who weighed in at 8 lbs. 4 oz., has been named Vernon Lindsay Vaughn, after the 43-year-old actor’s father.
The funny man and Weber, who have been married since January 2010, are also proud parents to daughter Locklyn Kyla, 2.
“My wife’s Canadian, so I have the most polite child ever,” Vaughn said on The Ellen DeGeneres Show back in April, when he first announced Weber’s second pregnancy.
“Everything’s thank you, I’m like, wow, this is unbelievable. She’s an angel among angels.”
Vaughn’s next film The Delivery Man (coincidentally, a film about a sperm donor fathering many, many children), opens in theaters on Nov. 22.
