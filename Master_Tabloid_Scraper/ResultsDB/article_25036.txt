Kim Kardashian’s Flour Attacker Identified as Former PETA Member Christina Cho/n
The woman who flour bombed Kim Kardashian last Thursday has been revealed as Christina Cho. Christina is the older sister of Michelle Cho who is an active member of PETA. It appears as though Christina is a volunteer for the animal rights organization as she was photographed participating in a protest as recently as January 31, 2012.
This isn’t Christina’s first time making headlines when it comes to protecting animals.

Back in 2010 while Donna Karan was in attendance at the Women’s Conference in California, Christina crashed the party. She got on stage to reveal to the crowd– that included First Lady Michelle Obama, Dr. Jill Biden, Maria Shriver and Oprah Winfrey– that DK’s then collection was made with real rabbit fur from China.
PETA then boasted about the event and praised “PETA member” Christina Cho for her actions, but they are now denying any involvement surrounding the incident with Kim. However, they have offered to pay the legal fees for Kim’s flour attacker, telling Celebuzz exclusively: 
“We don’t believe Kim would be so shortsighted as to go after this woman, but if she does, we’ll definitely look at how to maximize exposure to the cruel fur industry, and that could mean defending the activist if she wishes.”
