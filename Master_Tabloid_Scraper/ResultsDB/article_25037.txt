Denver Broncos' Vernon Davis Called Out By His Fiancée on Instagram, Accused of Cheating with 20-Year-Old/n
Vernon Davis may have just scored a Super Bowl win with the Denver Broncos, but off the field things are less celebratory.   
On Monday, the tight end’s fiancée Janel Horne took to Instagram calling out Davis, 32, for allegedly cheating on her with a younger woman.   
In the post obtained by Total Pro Sports, Horne shares a split image of Davis and a woman, tagging both as she writes, “When you give a man your all, 15yrs, 3kids, and you sacrifice your life and he cheats on you with 20yr old child and lies on you #yourealiarandacheater #youwantedtobeoyighereyougo #lowselfesteem #imoverit #nothidingbehindyourlies”  





 When people do these things then we should hold hands and pray for them. #Letshelpthem by #praying

Davis has not responded to the accusations.   
Although the athlete has kept mum about the allegations, he did take to Instagram sharing three photos since Horne posted her message. One image, a quote from the bible was captioned, “When people do these things then we should hold hands and pray for them #Letshelpthem by #praying.”
