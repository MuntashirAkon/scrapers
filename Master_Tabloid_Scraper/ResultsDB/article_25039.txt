Bon Iver Frontman Justin Vernon: Cats Are Good for Your Brain/n
The hit album Bon Iver, by the band of the same name, was born in a very unlikely place: a Wisconsin veterinary clinic that was converted into a recording studio. Wander around the unique ranch house and you might run into a muse that meows. Namely, Flo and Melmon, the cats of frontman Justin Vernon.  
“I’m really into my pets,” Vernon tells PEOPLE. “They are a good thing to have around for your brain. It’s good to take care of something other than yourself.”

Much of the musician’s life is focused on his felines, who were both rescued from an animal shelter (Flo when she was 2 and Melmon at 6 months). Vernon has even dedicated a section of the band’s website to the cuddly kitties, who enjoy lounging atop the studio doorway and playing with iPads.  

“They are just weirdos,” he says. “Totally mutt cats, but they have a lot of love and hunt and play outside. They live the high life.”   
As does Vernon, who will be traveling the globe playing songs from the new album for the rest of the year. Tour dates in Vancouver and Stockholm mean the singer won’t be adding another furry friend to his brood anytime soon. “I can’t really have a dog with my lifestyle,” he says.
