Richard Griffiths, the veteran British character actor best known for playing the heartless Uncle Vernon Dursley in the Harry Potter movies, has died. He was 65.According to Sky News, Griffiths passed away on Thursday from complications following heart surgery.His Harry Potter costars remembered him as a kind and gentle mentor with a gift for storytelling.Daniel Radcliffe, who played the titular boy magician, paid tribute to Griffiths, who was there the first day he set foot on the set of the fantasy franchise.

"In August 2000, before official production had even begun on Potter, we filmed a shot outside the Dursleys', which was my first-ever shot as Harry," said Radcliffe in a statement. "I was nervous, and he made me feel at ease."He continued: "Seven years later, we embarked on Equus together. It was my first time doing a play, but, terrified as I was, his encouragement, tutelage and humor made it a joy. In fact, any room he walked into was made twice as funny and twice as clever just by his presence. I am proud to say I knew him."Harry Melling, the actor who played Vernon's muggle son, Dudley Dursley, also praised him."Sad news today. What a beautiful man. Beautiful actor. Thoughts and love to anyone who was lucky enough to have listened to one his stories," tweeted Melling.
