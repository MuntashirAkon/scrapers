NaVorro Bowman -- Chip Kelly Can Come To My Wedding ... Maybe /nIf 49ers head coach Chip Kelly wants an invite to star linebacker NaVorro Bowman's wedding he's gonna have to EARN IT ... so says Bowman who claims he isn't sure yet if CK will witness the nuptials. Bowman and his brand new fiancee Mikale joined the  "TMZ Sports " TV show (weeknights on FS1) when we wanted to know exactly who was on the guest list for the big event in April. We know NFL stars like Vernon Davis and Ted Ginn, Jr. are in ... but when we asked about Chip, Bowman said the head man hadn't made the cut yet ... and he was still considering his wedding worthiness. It's a tough league. /n
