VOTE: Who Wore It Better — Selena Gomez Or Fifth Harmony's Lauren Jauregui??/n

Ladies in red!!
Selena Gomez and Lauren Jauregui both have killer bodies, and apparently they both love showing them off too!!
At the 2016 Grammys, Selly opted to rock a cutout red gown backstage, while the Fifth Harmony starlet wore an almost identical piece to Sunday's MTV VMAs!!
So, you know we have to ask…
