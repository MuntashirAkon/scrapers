Maurice Gibb’s Alleged Son Calls For Final DNA Test/n
Musician Nick Endacott claims he’s the secret son of the late Bee Gees great Maurice Gibb —
but he needs Mo’s surviving brother to prove he’s not jive talkin’!
Nick says his biological mom, Patti Nolder, who gave him up for adoption at birth, had an affair with Maurice
during London’s Swinging Sixties, and three facial recognition tests confirm he strongly resembles the late star with a 95.2 percent probability.
Now he’s begging surviving Bee Gees brother Barry for a DNA test to prove whether he’s Maurice’s love child for medical reasons.
“I’ll be 50 next year and this is a crucial stage in my life, health-wise. I need to know if I need to worry.”
Maurice died at age 53 of a twisted intestine in 2003. Also, Maurice’s twin brother, Robin,
was 62 when he passed away in 2012 following a long battle with colon cancer.
He tracked down his birth mom and met her in 2003. She told him she’d been a music studio manager
“and had known and worked with all these famous names.” After that, Patti refused to help, but did claim she’d slept with Maurice.
“It isn’t about money. I just want to know who my dad is. I have a right to know!” says Nick. /n
