Prince's Sick Final Days: Music Icon Was Awake For '6 Days Straight' Before Death/n
While Prince‘s personal life remains somewhat of a mystery to fans, the iconic musician’s troubled final days have started to unfold — and RadarOnline.com has the details.
According to brother-in-law Maurice Phillips, married to Prince’s sister Tyka Nelson, the legendary pop star and devout Jehovah’s Witness hadn’t been sleeping at all leading up to his sudden death.

“He worked 154 hours straight [six and a half days],” Phillips, 52, told fans outside Paisley Park on Saturday, the Daily Mail reported. “I was with him just last weekend. He was a good brother-in-law.”
Of course, recent reports indicate that Prince had possibly been struggling with an opiate addiction, which often causes drowsiness. In some cases, however, users can been kept awake using “downers” like Percocet, one of the drugs Prince allegedly used.
Medical examiner Dr. A. Quinn Strobl did not directly address a possible drug overdose in his initial statement following Prince’s autopsy, but sources say it’s a possibility.

“As part of a complete exam, relevant information regarding [Prince’s] medical and family history, will be gathered,” Quinn’s statement read. “Anything which could be relevant to the investigation will be taken into consideration.”
Meanwhile, Prince’s family and friends gathered for a private funeral for the “Purple Rain” singer at the Paisley Park studios just hours after his body was secretly cremated. He was 57 at the time of his death and was found at 9:43am on April 21 in the elevator of the studio.
Phillips told Radar that a massive public musical memorial is also “in the works” in Prince’s honor.
