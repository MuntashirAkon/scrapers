A Fond Farewell! Prince's Family Planning Public Memorial/n
As Prince‘s family deals with the heartbreak of losing the man they knew as Prince Rogers Nelson, RadarOnline.com has learned they’re also busy planning a massive memorial tribute for fans of the music icon called simply Prince.
Maurice Phillips, the husband of Prince’s sister Tyka Nelson, told Radar that a massive public musical memorial is “in the works.”
Meanwhile, Prince’s body has been transferred to a local funeral home for cremation, and the family is still coming to terms with what has happened.

“We’re just waiting for the toxicology tests to come in,” Phillips told Radar. An autopsy was completed this afternoon, but full toxicology results are not expected for several weeks.
Prince’s sister Tyka visited with fans at his Paisley Park home on Friday, telling onlookers that her brother cherished his legions of supporters.
But behind the scenes, Phillips said, “She’s holding up as best as she can … it’s really hard for her. Death isn’t easy for anybody.”

And Phillips said he has his own personal plans to honor the memory of the “Purple Rain” singer, who was found dead April 21 at 57 in Paisley Park.
“He trusted me with his sister, so I’m not going to let him down,” Phillips said. “He was a good brother-in-law.”
