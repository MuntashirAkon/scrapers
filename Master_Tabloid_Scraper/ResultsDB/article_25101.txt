The paparazzo captioned it:

"WOW WHAT A WAY TO BRING IN MY BIRTHDAY! SHOTGETTER POWER! I WISH BIEBER WAS STILL ON TOUR!!"
In the video though, Maurice spoke out about what went down right before he went in to get X-rays: 

"Hour before my birthday hits, I get ran over by Justin Bieber. Isn't that something? He's a good kid, though. I think the truck was a little bit too big for him, though, because there's no way he could see over the front â€” it was the slope it was on. But like I said, he got out, he was compassionate, he's a good kid, accidents happen."
He continued:

"Hopefully everything works out here."
We're sure the Biebs feels the same way!
Watch Maurice speak out (below)!
