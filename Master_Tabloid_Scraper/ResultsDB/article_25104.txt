While there are other serious contenders vying to snag the collection, sources say the rapper is the top prospect. In fact, the father already met with Prince's sister Tyka Nelson and her husband Maurice Philips to discuss the sale.
As for how much dough the New Yorker is willing to throw down, insiders claim the figure is around $40 million. Talk about a nice chunk of change!
The only catch is, Tyka has to get the OK from her other siblings and the manager of Prince's estate before she can sell the collection. Not to mention there are plenty of other interested buyers in the game.
