The full-length trailer for Beauty and the Beast is finally here — and it’ll have you falling in love.
Not only is the first trailer for Disney’s live-action remake a total nostalgia-fest, but we finally get to see Belle (Emma Watson) and the Beast (Dan Stevens) together.

The two-minute clip also features the enchanted castle, characters Lumiere, Cogsworth, Chip, and many more familiar scenes from the animated classic. We even get to see Kevin Kline as Belle’s father, Maurice, and Luke Evans as the villainous Gaston.
By the look of things, the new film (due out on March 17, 2017) seems like the perfect representation of the original already. Check out the trailer above!
