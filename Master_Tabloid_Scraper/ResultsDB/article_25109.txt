Sorry, she’s not.

Beyoncé has filed a lawsuit against against Feyonce, a Texas company that sells engagement apparel that’s based on her 2008 hit “Single Ladies”.
You’ve probably witnessed their items if you are connected to any sorority girl on social media who has gotten engaged over the past eight years. They sell mugs, t-shirts, and other Pinterest-ready clothing that probably looks a little something like this:

Now, Beyoncé is calling copyright infringement on Feyonce and three individuals from San Antonio, saying that they “brazenly” capitalized on products that are too close to her likeness. She also said that one of the individuals named Andre Maurice has gone too far by filing two U.S. trademark applications for “Feyonce”, both with an accent over the “e” and without.
“Defendants adopted the Feyonce mark to call to mind Beyoncé and her famous song,” the lawsuit said, via Reuters. “Defendants’ conduct described herein is intentional, fraudulent, malicious, willful and wanton.”
The lawsuit also seeks unspecified damages.
