The family changes their hair together, stays together.

Caitlyn and Kylie Jenner were both rocking fresh ‘dos when they showed up at the Dash boutique in Los Angeles on Monday (Nov. 30, 2015). While Caitlyn showed off her bangs, her 18-year-old daughter stepped out with dark green tresses and brunette roots to celebrate the launch of Kylie’s new lip kit.
Kris Jenner and Kylie’s BFF Anastasia Karanikolaou and Shamari Maurice were also in attendance.

As previously reported, Kylie launched her new makeup line in time for Cyber Monday, releasing three colors — named Dolce K, Truly Brown K, and Candy K — available in a matte liquid lipstick and matching lip liner.
“Wow. Been dreaming of this day for 2 years now. This was a long process but an amazing one! Visiting the factories and sitting with the amazing chemists creating the perfect colors and formulas for you guys! This is all me and I put my everything into these lip kits,” Kylie wrote on Instagram while debuting the three shades. “I hope you guys love them as much as I do. Definitely more to come. I only hope for it to get better.”
