Earth, Wind & Fire Founder Maurice White Has Died/n

Founder of the band Earth, Wind & Fire Maurice White has died at 74, his brother confirms.  
White, who suffered from Parkinson’s disease, died Wednesday at his home in Los Angeles.  
“My brother, hero and best friend Maurice White passed away peacefully last night in his sleep,” his brother Verdine White, told the Associated Press. “While the world has lost another great musician and legend, our family asks that our privacy is respected as we start what will be a very difficult and life changing transition in our lives. Thank you for your prayers and well wishes.”   
White’s brother Verdine was also a member of the nine piece band, known for their hits including “That’s the Way of the World” and “Shining Star” (both of which have been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame).   
At the time of the band’s Hall of Fame induction in 2000, White had spoken about his battle with Parkinson’s and had already retired from touring with the band in 1995.  
As well as his success with the band, White was also a notable producer, co-writing and co-producing Emotions’ smash hit “Best of My Love,” in 1974. He also worked with artists such as Cher and Barbra Streisand.
