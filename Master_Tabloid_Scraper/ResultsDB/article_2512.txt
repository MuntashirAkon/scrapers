The Canadians that stick together, make great music together.

This seems to be case after Drake hinted at collaborating with The Weeknd during the eight annual OVO Fest in Toronto. Announcing to the crowd he was ready to make another album, the “Hotline Bling” rapper invited his fellow Torontonian onstage to talk about a potentially joining forces.
Via Revolt TV:
The Weeknd was also a surprise guest during the star-studded concert and, while two were onstage, Drizzy revealed that it may finally be time to officially form an OVOXO dream team and make the joint album that fans have wanted for years. Abel smiled and nodded in approval.
