Emma Thompson Will Play Mrs. Potts in Beauty and the Beast/n
Emma Thompson will portray Mrs. Potts in the upcoming live-action retelling of Beauty and the Beast, Disney announced in a statement released to PEOPLE.   
Is there anyone better suited to the role of a doting, wisdom-dispensing mother who has no qualms about using hot tea as a weapon in a crisis?   
Also joining Thompson in the tale as old as time is Kevin Kline, who will play Belle’s father, Maurice.  
Emma Watson leads the cast as the beauty herself, and Dan Stevens has been cast as her beastly prince.   
Luke Evans will play Gaston and Josh Gad his minion Le Fou in the film set to hit theaters on March 17, 2017.   
With more cast announcements to come, we’ll patiently wait for Disney to notice our dream cast of Chris Pratt as Lumière, Ricky Gervais as Cogsworth and Clémence Poésy as Fifi the featherduster.
