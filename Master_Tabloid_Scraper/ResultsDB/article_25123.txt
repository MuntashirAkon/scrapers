Maurice Greene’s Dancing Run Comes to an End/n
Former World’s Fastest Man Maurice Greene‘s race to the ballroom finish line came to an abrupt end last night on Dancing with the Stars. 
On the eighth week of competition, Greene and his partner Cheryl Burke were voted off the show just one week shy of the semifinals. Greene was up for elimination against Hannah Montana star Cody Linley. Both contestants tied for the lowest scores— 48 out of 60–after Monday’s ballroom and Latin dances.
“I had a lot of fun. I made a lot of good friends out here. I learned how to dance out here in front of millions of  every night. I had a great time,” Greene told co-host Samantha Harris of his experience on the show.
The two-time Olympic gold medalist in track & field was a fierce competitor in the ballroom–and he got paid the highest compliment by someone who should know: his partner Burke. The two-time Dancing champ told Greene: “Out of all the seasons I’ve been on the show, Maurice, you have been the hardest working partner I’ve ever had. And you will always, most importantly, be the winner winner, chicken dinner of my heart (a phrase Greene coined on the show).” 
The remaining four couples who will compete in next week’s semifinal round are Warren Sapp and Kym Johnson, Lance Bass and Lacey Schwimmer, Brooke Burke and Derek Hough and Cody Linley and Julianne Hough.
