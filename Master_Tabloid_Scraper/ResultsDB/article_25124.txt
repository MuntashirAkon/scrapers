Bee Gees Died with Maurice, Says Twin/n
The Bee Gees died with Maurice Gibb, his twin brother Robin, 53, said on British TV Tuesday.  
 “The Bee Gees to us was the three brothers,” Robin said on GMTV. “In Maurice’s name we would respect that and not be the Bee Gees any more.” 
 Robin’s statement contradicts an earlier one by third band member and older brother, Barry Gibb, 56, who had said that the falsetto-voiced group would continue as a tribute to their late sibling. 
 Maurice died Jan. 12 after his small intestine and bowel had become twisted and restricted his blood flow, according to an autopsy report that blamed the condition on a genetic defect. 
 The musician had collapsed Jan. 9 at his home in Miami and was rushed to Mount Sinai Medical Center, where he underwent emergency surgery for intestinal blockage. Just before surgery, the bassist-keyboardist suffered cardiac arrest. 
 Said Robin: “Anything (Barry and I) do, we will do together, but it’ll be as brothers and not under the name of the Bee Gees … We don’t want to be the Bee Gees again.”  
 Maurice was laid to rest in a private ceremony Jan. 15 in Miami. Two hundred family members and friends, including Michael Jackson, attended.
