Jackson Mourns Bee Gee Maurice Gibb/n
About 200 family members and friends, including Michael Jackson, attended a private funeral celebrating Bee Gees member Maurice Gibb on Wednesday in Miami Beach. 
 Gibb, 53, died early Sunday, after he “experienced cardiac arrest” before surgery, according to a statement released by Miami’s Mount Sinai Medical Center. While Gibb’s family is questioning Maurice’s treatment, a county medical examiner is reviewing the case, and autopsy results are expected Friday, reports the Associated Press.  
 Jackson, Harry Wayne Casey of KC and the Sunshine Band and singer Randy Newman were among the mourners at the service, along with Maurice’s wife, Yvonne; his children, Adam and Samantha; and Maurice’s twin brother Robin and older brother Barry, who had arrived in the same limo with Jackson, says the New York Post.  
 The paper notes that Jackson wore a turquoise-colored suit. 
 “It was emotional, there was humor. … Everybody talked about how this was a man who really celebrated life and so this was a celebration of his life,” Gibb family friend Jennifer Valoppi tells AP about the service, which was decorated with pictures of Maurice and his family. 
 A quarter of a century ago, the Bee Gees, short for the Brothers Gibb, helped lead the disco craze, epitomized by their soundtrack to the 1977 John Travolta movie “Saturday Night Fever,” which included the hits “Stayin’ Alive” and “Night Fever.”  
 A spokeswoman for the Bee Gees says the family has yet to decide whether to cremate or bury Maurice’s remains.
