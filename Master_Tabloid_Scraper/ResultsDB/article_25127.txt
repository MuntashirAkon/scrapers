Maurice Gibb's Quiet Sendoff/n
         His life was marked by music, but no tunes played Wednesday as the family of Maurice Gibb said their final farewells.                  About 200 friends and family members attended a subdued private memorial service in Miami for the Bee Gees' keyboardist and bass player.                  Gibb, part of the trio that rocked the world with hits like "Stayin' Alive" and "How Deep Is Your Love," died last Sunday after emergency surgery for intestinal blockage. He was 53.                  According to autopsy findings released Thursday, Gibb died when blood flow to his bowels was restricted. The Miami-Dade County coroner's office said the impeded blood flow was brought on by a twisting of Gibb's bowel and a rotation of his small intestine. The condition had been present since birth, the coroner said, but it was unclear whether Gibb knew it.                  Though the surviving Gibbs had criticized the care their brother received at the Mount Sinai Medical Center, there was no immediate comment today regarding the autopsy findings.                  As for the memorial, twin brother Robin and Maurice's son Adam reportedly spoke at the secular service, held at the Riverside Funeral Chapel. Also in attendance were Maurice's widow, Yvonne, and daughter Samantha.                  Among the other mourners paying their respects: Eric Clapton, Harry Wayne Casey (aka KC) of KC and the Sunshine Band and Randy Newman.                  "It was emotional," said family friend and local NBC reporter Jennifer Valoppi. "Everybody talked about how this was a man who really celebrated life and so this was a celebration of his life."                  The dark brown coffin was surrounded by white flowers, and photos of the musician and his family were hung from the walls, according to Valoppi.                  Valoppi says grief-stricken big brother Barry, 55, arrived at the chapel with Michael Jackson some time after the service ended to pay his respects privately.                  Both Barry and Robin have suggested Maurice's surgery should not have proceeded after he suffered cardiac arrest and have called for an investigation (the hospital says it is "committed to bringing this to a positive resolution" and "willing to cooperate fully" with the family).                   However, the autopsy was not related to any allegations of wrongdoing. The medical examiner investigates all deaths when a body is going to be cremated. It also looks into deaths not caused by a readily recognizable disease.                  A spokeswoman for the band's manager told the press that the family has not yet decided whether Gibb would be cremated or buried.                  The music industry honored the former Bee Gee on Sunday night at the American Music Awards. The live broadcast was dedicated to the memory of the late Gibb, who with his brothers won seven Grammys and sold more than 110 million records worldwide.                  A "celebration of life" ceremony that would allow fans to publicly mourn the musician is expected to be announced shortly.
