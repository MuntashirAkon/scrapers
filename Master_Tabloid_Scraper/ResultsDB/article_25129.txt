Bee Gee Maurice Critically Ill/n
         "Stayin' Alive" is the anthem being sung by one of the Bee Gee brothers today.                  Boogiemeister Maurice Gibb, one-third of the iconic disco band, is recovering in a Florida hospital after undergoing emergency surgery.                    The 53-year-old performer collapsed at his Miami home Thursday with severe stomach pains and was rushed to Mount Sinai Medical Center. Doctors operated immediately and found Gibb suffering  from intestinal blockage.                  "It was completely out of the blue," the musician's manager, Carol Peters, told Reuters. "No pains or anything beforehand, just all of a sudden, boom."          Gibb emerged from surgery in critical condition, but has "opened his eyes, wiggled his toes and feet, so it's good," said Peters.                   According to reports, surgeons had to remove half of Gibb's stomach and most of his intestines. To make matters worse, the performer suffered a mild heart attack during the procedure.                  A statement released by Mount Sinai Medical Center would only confirm that Gibb underwent emergency abdominal surgery at the hospital and was currently in critical but stable condition in the intensive-care unit.                   A spokesman for twin brother Robin confirmed Maurice had undergone surgery for an intestinal blockage. "We are awaiting a full medical prognosis...but everyone is very,           very worried."                 Robin and brother Barry were with Maurice at the hospital, according to Robin's manager.                   Formed as a teen pop-rock group in the late '50s the British-born brothers had a string of soulful pop hits in the '60s but really hit their stride in the '70s when they reinvented themselves as a disco act.                  When shimmy-heavy Saturday Night Fever hit theaters, the jive-talkin' Bee Gees were propelled to superstardom. The movie's chart-topping soundtrack album sold 25 million copies and yielded the sibling group three number-one singles: "Stayin' Alive," "Night Fever" and "How Deep Is Your Love."                  Maurice, the band's bass guitarist and keyboard player, was known to fan's as the "funny one," distinguished by his hat collection.                  A fourth brother, Andy, who had a successful solo career, died in 1988 of a drug-related heart ailment at the age of 30.                  Spurred by the news of Maurice's hospitalization, fans went online to offer their best wishes to the ailing Gibb. "Please say a prayer for Maurice and his family. We hope he'll get through this and has a speedy recovery," read a fan-site post written Friday by sysemple.                  "My prayers are with you Maurice. And with Yvonne and your kids. This is something both my parents had, and it's very painful. Hope you get better soon. Lots of love from all your fans," wrote Dutcherica.                  The Grammy-winning brothers, sampled by everyone from Celine Dion to Wyclef Jean and inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997, released their most recent studio album in 2001, This Is Where I Came In.
