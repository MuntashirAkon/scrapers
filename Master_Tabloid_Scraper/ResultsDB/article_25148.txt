I'll Be Ready to Kill It Next Season/n Maurice Jones Drew is winning the battle of the bulge ...  'cause the Jacksonville Jaguars running back tells TMZ Sports he's dropped 15 POUNDS in the past 2 weeks ... and plans to keep it off.

Maurice acknowledged that his 2013 season rubbed a lot of fantasy owners the wrong way ... but says,  "It's a brand new off-season. Started working out ... I've lost 15 pounds in the last 2 weeks. "You can already see the difference -- it was just last May that MJD was out partying in Florida while smuggling what appeared to be a spare tire under his tank top. Take THAT, Jenny Craig!/n
