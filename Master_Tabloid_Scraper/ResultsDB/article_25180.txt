“I’ve never said this on television before. We are married!” he said to a round of applause on the morning show.
The RuPaul’s Drag Race legend, 56, added that the two said “I do” in January, on the 23rd anniversary of their first meeting at former New York club Limelight in 1994.
But it wasn’t necessarily romance that finally convinced the couple to walk down the aisle.
“We never wanted to do it! We were looking into it really for tax breaks, and for financial reasons,” Charles explained.

While Charles has been a staple in Hollywood for decades, he leads a much more quiet life with his husband, 44, on their 60,000-acre Wyoming ranch during his time off-camera.
“He’s a great guy, but he doesn’t care about show business,” Charles revealed. “He couldn’t care less!”
The 9th season of RuPaul’s Drag Race premieres on Logo on March 24.
