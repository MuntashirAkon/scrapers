Congratulations are in order for Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Tasha McCauley again!

The couple are expecting their second child, according to a spokesperson for Gordon-Levitt. The proud parents, who welcomed a baby boy in August 2015, first sparked baby reports when McCauley was spotted with a budding baby bump just outside the Comoncy Cafe in Beverly Hills on Wednesday (May 3, 2017).
“My son, he’s just a baby, you know? He hasn’t made the choice to be in the public eye, and that’s a choice that I would like him to be able to make when he’s older, when he can think about these kinds of things and make that decision for himself,” Gordon-Levitt, 36, said on Live! with Kelly and Michael just six weeks after his son’s birth.
“And so, for now, I’m just a protective dad, and I want to protect his privacy,” he explained of his decision to not reveal the newborn’s name.
The Inception actor and McCauley, the co-founder of Silicon Valley-based company Fellow Robots, married December 2014 in a private ceremony at their shared home in California.
