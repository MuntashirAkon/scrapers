Later in the day, she spoke to her followers in her Instagram Story to clear up any confusion.
“So I saw some pictures of myself [looking] really fat on a boat. I have to tell you, all I did was eat cheese,” Longoria said. “So that’s the news of the day,” she continued. “I’m not pregnant, just eating a lot of cheese, a lot of wine, a lot of pancakes.”
“I just had to share because my whole family is calling me asking if I’m pregnant. Yes, I look pregnant, but it was just a ball of cheese, a ball of cheese in my stomach,” she continued. “But seriously, I look so fat but you know what, that happens to people. Everybody gets bloated. I’m not bloated today but this is pre-pancake. I’m about to go eat a pancake.”
Get that pancake, Eva.
