Aaron Hernandez committed suicide late Tuesday night using his bed sheet in his prison cell in Massachusetts, according to police officials.

The 27-year-old ex-NFL star had been acquitted in a double murder case on Friday. His lawyer Jose Baez told TMZ that he believed Hernandez had a “real shot” at getting a previous murder conviction overturned.
TMZ reports:
“Wednesday morning, officials at the maximum security Souza-Baranowski Correctional Center in Massachusetts found Aaron dead in his cell.
‘Mr. Hernandez hanged himself utilizing a bed sheet that he attached to his cell window,” a rep for the Massachusetts Department of Corrections said in a statement.
‘Mr. Hernandez also attempted to block his door from the inside by jamming the door with various items.’
Officials say Hernandez was discovered at 3:05 AM on Wednesday morning, and they tried to save his life. He was transported to a nearby hospital where he was pronounced dead at 4:07 AM.A prison official told local news there does not appear to be a suicide note at the scene.”
