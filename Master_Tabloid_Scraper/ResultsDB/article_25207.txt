During a 2015 interview on Live! With Kelly and Michael, the 3rd Rock from the Sun alum explained that his career and in-the-spotlight status was a choice he made — and that he wants to afford his son that same decision.
“My son … he hasn’t made the choice to be in the public eye, and that’s a choice that I would like him to be able to make when he’s older, when he can think about these kinds of things and make that decision for himself,” said Gordon-Levitt.
“So, for now, I’m just a protective dad, and I want to protect his privacy,” he added.
