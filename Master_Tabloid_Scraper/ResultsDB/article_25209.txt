Model Josie Canseco, daughter of retired baseball star Jose Canseco, has been named Playboy's Playmate of the Month and strips naked for a sexy pictorial.The magazine's Miss June 2016, who is 19 years old, wears nothing but white socks while sitting in a chair in one photo, while other pics show her topless in white underwear and bottomless in an orange string bikini top.In another photo, Josie wears a coral silk boho crop top and matching mini skirt, hiked up to reveal her underwear as she poses seductively on a beige couch.

Josie is Jose's only child. Her mother is his ex-wife, Jessica Canseco. The two divorced in 2000 after four years of marriage.

"I'm so over people asking, 'Are you related to the baseball player?'" Josie told Playboy. "My family name has a lot of talk behind it. I believe one of my biggest achievements to date is maintaining my career and image through all the chaos."Josie starred with her mother on the Lifetime reality show The Mother/Daughter Experiment: Celebrity Edition along with the likes of The Hills alum Heidi Montag, who appeared on the cover of Playboy in 2009, and Courtney Stodden, who is known for her racy pics and who is featured on the magazine's website."I didn't learn anything surprising about myself, because I don't want to be a reality star," Josie told Playboy about her experience on the reality show. "I'm actually a weird, goofy and friendly person. Giving in to drama simply isn't me."Josie is also set to appear on the Esquire Network's new show This Is Mike Stud alongside her boyfriend and rapper Mike Stud. The series premieres on June 21 at 10 p.m.
