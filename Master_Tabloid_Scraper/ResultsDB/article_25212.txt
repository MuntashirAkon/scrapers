And as it turns out, it's not only Jose's inaugural Turkey Day with the actress, but his first ever!Eva explained, "This is going to be our first Thanksgiving married and my stepkids and my Mexican husband don't celebrate Thanksgiving so this is the first time they're coming to the United States for Thanksgiving."Like most hungry Americans, Longoria shared that her main man and rest of the fam are "very excited about turkey and I'm cooking up a storm."The Mexican-born media mogul has four children of his own from a previous marriage, but that doesn't mean Eva's ruled out welcoming even more little ones into their bunch.
