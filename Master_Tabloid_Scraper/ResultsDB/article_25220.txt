Well, he's not exactly the suffer-in-silence type.Real Housewives of D.C.'s Tareq Salahi has already sounded off on the betrayal he felt when his soon-to-be ex-wife Michaele was found canoodling with Journey guitarist Neal Schon instead of actually being kidnapped.And now, during a press conference for Celebrity Fight Night, Salahi explains to E! News that there's a new man he's after.

Watch out, Jose Canseco!While in Beverly Hills Sunday night, Salahi held up a picture on his cell phone of Canseco with Michaele and said he's coming for him, but relax, it's not what you think.Salahi and Canseco will be facing off against each other in the ring to raise money for charity, along with Michael Lohan and Kato Kaelin, Coolio and Jeremy Jackson, Joey Buttafuoco and Amy Fisher's husband, Lou Ballera, and Fisher and "Octomom" Nadya Suleman.Now if it was Schon in there with Salahi, it'd be a different story.
