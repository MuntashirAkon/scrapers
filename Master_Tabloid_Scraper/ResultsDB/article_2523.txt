Selena Gomez Looks White-Hot During Date Night with The Weeknd/n
Selena Gomez and The Weeknd are taking a bite out of the Big Apple!

After a whirlwind promotional tour for her new single, “Bad Liar,” SelGo was spotted letting her hair down — literally! — as she enjoyed a romantic date night with her boyfriend. Clad in a revealing lacy number, the singer held hands with the “Starboy” crooner as they grabbed dinner in New York City.
Via TMZ:
The couple stepped out Monday night dressed to the nines — more so Selena, but Abel was rocking a sweet jacket too — as they did dinner at famed Italian restaurant RAO’s.
No such thing as a low-key dinner for these 2 anymore though — they had a small army surrounding them at all times.
