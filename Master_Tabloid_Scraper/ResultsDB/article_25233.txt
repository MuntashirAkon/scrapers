'Love & Hip Hop: New York' Star Arrested on Birthday for Roommate Beatdown /n "Love & Hip Hop: New York " star Tahiry Jose got an awful birthday present  -- handcuffs and a trip to jail after an alleged beatdown. The incident went down on Cinco de Mayo, Tahiry's 38th birthday, after she got into a physical altercation with a woman who was staying in her New Jersey home. According to arrest docs, Tahiry punched and scratched the woman in her face ... and yanked her hair, leaving  "reddish bruises " on the right side of her face. Tahiry tells TMZ ... SHE was the victim, and was merely defending herself. She claims she got home and the woman -- whom she'd just recently allowed to stay with her -- jumped her and started breaking stuff. Tahiry was booked for assault and released the next day, but says she plans to press charges too. We'll say this, the ex-roomie probably stepped to the wrong chick. As 'LHHNY' fans know, Tahiry's always down to throw down./n
