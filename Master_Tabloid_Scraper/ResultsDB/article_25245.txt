Aaron Hernandez Commits Suicide In Prison Cell, Officials Say/nAaron Hernandez killed himself in his Massachusetts prison cell late Tuesday night using a bed sheet, this according to prison officials. The 27-yr-old ex-NFL star had just been acquitted in a double murder case on Friday and his lawyer Jose Baez had told TMZ Sports he believed Hernandez had a real shot at getting a previous murder conviction overturned. But Wednesday morning, officials at the maximum security Souza-Baranowski Correctional Center in Massachusetts found Aaron dead in his cell.  "Mr. Hernandez hanged himself utilizing a bed sheet that he attached to his cell window, " a rep for the Massachusetts Department of Corrections said in a statement.  "Mr. Hernandez also attempted to block his door from the inside by jamming the door with various items. " Officials say Hernandez was discovered at 3:05 AM on Wednesday morning, and they tried to save his life. He was transported to a nearby hospital where he was pronounced dead at 4:07 AM. A prison official told local news there does not appear to be a suicide note at the scene. Aaron is survived by his 4-year-old daughter. FYI, the Souza-Baranowski CC is considered one of the most high tech maximum security prisons in the country with hundreds of security cameras installed all over the facility. Officials say they're investigating -- we're guessing there will be TONS of security footage to go through. Hernandez was serving a life sentence for the 2013 murder of Odin Lloyd. He had also been on trial for killing Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado near a Boston nightclub in 2012 but was found not guilty of murder in that case. /n
