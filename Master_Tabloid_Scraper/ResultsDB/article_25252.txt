According to official documents, the troubled dad began serving time in the St. Clair County Jail on November 16, 2016, and was eventually released on December 2.
As Radar exclusively reported in the fall, Butch was placed in custody for six days until he was released on October 13. The local police department and parole’s office declined to comment on this previous stint.
As Teen Mom OG viewers know all too well, fan-favorites Tyler, 25, and his wife Catelynn Lowell, 24, were elated when Butch completed a long-term prison sentence in August 2015, and vowed to remain sober for the rest of his life.
