Tyler Baltierra Blames Dad Butch's Arrest On Drug Use: 'I Think He Relapsed!'/n
Tyler Baltierra‘s worst fears came true when his father Butch was thrown behind bars after celebrating his one-year release from prison. During part one of the Teen Mom OG reunion show, Catelynn Lowell’s husband revealed his father might have relapsed before the arrest.
“He was doing fine I guess and then he missed a parole meeting and his parole officer wanted to violate him so now he’s in jail,” Baltierra told Dr. Drew Pinsky. “He’s supposed to be off parole in 90 days. He came back from his parole meeting the week before all excited and proud of himself.”
While Baltierra believes his troubled father is “afraid of his own freedom,” he also believes drug use played a role.

“I know exactly what’s going on,” he said. “I think he’s using. I think he used or he relapsed.”
Baltierra explained how he noticed “signs” of his father’s possible relapse.
“He was sleeping in later,” he said. “And not coming home a lot.”
