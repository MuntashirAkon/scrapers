Tyler Baltierra Devastated Over Dad Butch's Arrest One Year After Jail Release/n
Tyler Baltierra‘s father returned to prison one year after completing his sentence for breaking and entering, home invasion, and larceny — and the devastating news completely blindsided his son.
In a Teen Mom OG sneak peek, Catelynn Lowell video chatted with her father-in-law Darl “Butch” Baltierra to check in on him.
“Did you text your parole officer today?” she asked, as he responded, “I’m gonna call her right now on my phone. I forgot to call her yesterday.”
The next day, Tyler received a phone call from his dad from jail.

“Well guess what? Dad is in jail,” he told his wife after the call. “He’s in jail. He missed his parole meeting for the first time. Isn’t that a little weird? He never misses his parole meeting.”
When Catelynn asked what that means for Butch, her husband responded, “I have no idea what that means.”
As Radar readers know, Butch, 54, was locked up in St. Clair County Jail for six days until October 13, a spokesperson for the facility exclusively confirmed to Radar.
Jail representatives confirmed he was either released or transferred to another correctional facility.

Butch was released from prison in early November, as Lowell broke the news by captioning a Snapchat photo of her father-in-law, “Butch is back!”
“Catelynn and Tyler are breaking the news to friends,” a source told Radar at the time of the bust. “They are obviously upset.”
