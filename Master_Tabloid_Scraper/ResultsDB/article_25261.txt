The Reebok Classic x Kendrick Lamar Classic Leather will launch on Saturday, January 16, 2016. This limited release is Kendrick’s second sneaker design, after the Reebok Classic x Kendrick Lamar Ventilator release in 2015.  It showcases his personal take on the timeless Reebok Classic Leather silhouette, celebrating the powerful vision of unity that can be heard so prominently in his music.

The Reebok Classic x Kendrick Lamar Classic Leather is a continuation of the blue/red LA neutrality theme for Kendrick, with the neutral colorway contrasted by minimal hits of blue and red on the sockliners, embroidered tongue labels, debossed heels and woven rope laces. A secondary set of waxed tonal grey laces are also included with this limited edition launch. Kendrick’s connection to Reebok Classic Leather’s also runs deep, as he wore the silhouettes as a kid growing up in Compton.

The Reebok Classic x Kendrick Lamar Classic Leather launches Saturday, January 16 on Reebok.com, Reebok stores, and Shoe Palace for $90.

Actress Jennie Garth posted a photograph late last week with husband Dave Abrams on Instagram while wearing Khombu! The former Beverly Hills, 90210 star was in Aspen, CO for the holidays with her family and was seen on the mountains in her Khombu Down Parka Jacket in Black ($280; zappos.com).12 of 41isla-booties Singer Kelsea Ballerini was gearing up for a day with Radio Disney this past weekend, rocking a pair of ISLA boots in Red Lux ($245, bedstu.com), perfectly complimenting her winter fringe look.

 The Nashville native took a style note from bestie Taylor Swift - who was spotted rocking the same pair in Brown Driftwood during a daytime Australian adventure with Blake Lively earlier this month. Jaime King, who picked them out for Swift, also wore pair of ISLA in Teak Rustic  in Malibu last month.

The Reebok Classic x Kendrick Lamar Classic Leather will launch on Saturday, January 16, 2016. This limited release is Kendrick’s second sneaker design, after the Reebok Classic x Kendrick Lamar Ventilator release in 2015.  It showcases his personal take on the timeless Reebok Classic Leather silhouette, celebrating the powerful vision of unity that can be heard so prominently in his music.

The Reebok Classic x Kendrick Lamar Classic Leather is a continuation of the blue/red LA neutrality theme for Kendrick, with the neutral colorway contrasted by minimal hits of blue and red on the sockliners, embroidered tongue labels, debossed heels and woven rope laces. A secondary set of waxed tonal grey laces are also included with this limited edition launch. Kendrick’s connection to Reebok Classic Leather’s also runs deep, as he wore the silhouettes as a kid growing up in Compton.
