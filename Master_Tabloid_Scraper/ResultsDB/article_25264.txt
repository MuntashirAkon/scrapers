Oh Fudge! Claire Danes Curses on 'Jimmy Fallon'/n
Oh fudge! Claire Danes made the censors work overtime during her appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon last night, and RadarOnline.com has the video.
The Homeland star was on the show on Monday when her conversation with Fallon got a little intense. 
The 36-year-old actress already seemed nervous when the two got into a fast-paced game of Family Fued. But once the game started, she really got swept up in the competition.
On the first round, she and Fallon both pressed their buttons to buzz in. Fallon pressed first, but they both said their answers at the same time!
“Dude!” exclaimed Danes. But when she realized that it wasn’t her turn, the F-word came out!
She then corrected herself: “Fudge, fudge.” But it was too late.
The segment continued to bring laughs from there, as Danes admitted she has no idea what people bring back on spring break, with her answer being “homework.”
Maybe she should just stick to stopping terrorist attacks!
