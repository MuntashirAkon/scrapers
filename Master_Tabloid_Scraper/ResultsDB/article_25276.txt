Frank and Claire Underwood aren’t leaving the White House without a fight.

Netflix has dropped the highly anticipated first trailer to the fifth season of House of Cards. As per usual, the Underwoods are scheming for political gain as they face the upcoming presidential election in the minute-and-a-half teaser.
“One nation, Underwood,” Frank (Kevin Spacey) tells Claire (Robin Wright) in a warped interpretation of the Pledge of Allegiance.
This is the first season without Beau Willimon, who developed the American remake of the BBC series, acting as showrunner. Melissa James Gibson and Frank Pugliese has taken on the role as his replacements.
Season 5 of the political drama will premiere May 30.
