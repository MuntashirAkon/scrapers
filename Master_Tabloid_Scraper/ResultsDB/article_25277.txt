Capturing the terror many Americans feel on Donald Trump’s presidential inauguration day, Netflix released a chilling teaser for the fifth season of House of Cards that alluded to unrest in the White House.

In a tweet, the streaming service announced that the political drama will return on May 30. The premiere date was revealed along with a ominous note reading: “We make the terror.”

As devoted fans know, the line is a direct quote from President Frank Underwood (Kevin Spacey) in the series finale. “We don’t submit to terror. We make the terror,”  he told his wife, Claire (Robin Wright), after declaring that the nation is at total war.
The upcoming season will be first one with Melissa James Gibson and Frank Pugliese serving as co-showrunners. Beau Willimon, who developed the American remake of the BBC series, stepped down from the role after the fourth season.
