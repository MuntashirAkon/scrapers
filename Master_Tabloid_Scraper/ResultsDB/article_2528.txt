Want to steal Selena Gomez‘s leg-sculpting secret? Now you can: For strong stems, the 25-year-old star relies on toe circles, hot potato, pulses, and hydrants. “They tone small muscles and make legs lean,” says her trainer, Amy Rosoff Davis, who suggests you start with 20 to 30 reps of each, working up to 60. Do the full series four to six times a week for maximum results.

Hydrants: From “A,” bend left leg to 90 degrees (E); lift leg, then lower it in front of you (F). Repeat entire series on other side.
