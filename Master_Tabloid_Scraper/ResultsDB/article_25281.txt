Showtime released the official trailer for the sixth season of Homeland with just one month to go before it premieres.

Though the cast already revealed that Quinn is alive after his fate was questioned at the end of Season Five, the plausibility of his return has been solidified just a little more in the new season’s trailer. The clip ends with his voiceover asking Carrie (Claire Danes), “What happened to me?”
Additionally, the trailer shows that Season Six’s plot will run parallel with real events in the United States. Elizabeth Marvel will transition into her role as President just as Donald Trump makes his official move into the Whtie House early next year, though a visit from Kanye West isn’t included the trailer. There’s a better chance that he’ll show up in 2024 anyway.
