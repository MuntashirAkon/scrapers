In  2015, Seyfried talked to Marie Claire UK about having a child. “I keep feeling like my eggs are dying off. I need to get on it… I want a child. Badly. I want to be a mother, badly. That’s what I feel. I’ve been feeling it for like, two years. I’m not ready but nobody’s ready. It changes everything… so how you can ever be ready for that?”
Congrats to the happy parents-to-be!
