/n

Claire Foy plays the Queen of England in Netflix’s The Crown, and she actually got to meet the real Queen Elizabeth II, albeit for a brief moment of time.
Foy, 32, described meeting monarch during PEOPLE and Entertainment Weekly‘s red carpet show.
“It was very brief,” she said. “She touched my hand and I touched hers.”

Foy won the Golden Globe for best actress in a drama series earlier this month.
“I’m having an out-of-body experience,” she said accepting the Golden Globe. “When you play a real-life person, it’s tricky and you rely very much on the people around you. A big shout out to John Lithgow and Matt Smith.”
Foy thanked the Queen when she won, saying, “She’s been at the center of the world. I think the world could do with a few more women at the center of it.”
