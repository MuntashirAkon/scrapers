If you feel like you've been waiting years to see Jamie Fraser's "hiding in a cave" look on screen, your moment is here. Starz just released a new first look at season three of Outlander, and it's positively packed with new footage. While we've seen glimpses of Claire (Caitriona Balfe), Frank (Tobias Menzies), Brianna (Sophie Skelton), and Roger (Richard Rankin) in the 60s and Jamie (Sam Heughan) after the disastrous battle of Culloden, we hadn't yet seen what becomes of Jamie after he escapes the battlefield and ends up hiding from the English in a cave near his home of Lallybroch. Basically, he's rocking a serious mountain man look, and we don't know how we feel about the fact that we kind of dig it. 

The second half of the season takes place largely on ships in Jamaica, with South Africa standing in for Jamaica and the ships on loan from Black Sails. As for when the show will eventually end someday, do not expect Outlander to pull a Game of Thrones and pull ahead of the books. There are currently eight of them, and no signs of stopping. "I cannot imagine a scenario where we catch up with Diana Gabaldon," Moore said, adding that she will determine when the story comes to an end. 

Outlander premieres Sunday, September 10 on Starz, and in case that's not enough for you, Starz confirmed that season four will air in 2018.
