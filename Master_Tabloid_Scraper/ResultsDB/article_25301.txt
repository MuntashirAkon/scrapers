"The worst Spring Break ever!" he screamed as the actress covered her face in shame. It appears Fallon's former Spring Breaks have been far more interesting than Danes' since he guessed "crabs" immediately. He was right. The top answer was "STDs.""I meant the seafood! I had Spring Break in Maine!" he joked. However, Danes was able to redeem herself when asked, "What's a clean word you can use instead of a curse word?"While she might not know the meaning of BRB and she may have done homework on her Spring Break, she knows "fudge" and "shoot" are perfect fill-ins for when you want to blurt out something a little dirtier. As a first-time mother to her son Cyrus, we can imagine Danes has had plenty of practice blurting out "shoot."
