Claire Danes' magnificent Zac Posen dress for the 2016 Met Gala is both breathtaking and theme appropriate!The Homeland star sported the designer's custom baby blue gown—which gives us a hint of Cinderella vibes—and needed the help of both Posen and her husband Hugh Dancy while going up the museum's famous grand steps.Posen's gorgeous glow-in-the-dark dress is lined with fiber optics all throughout, highlighting the delicate detailing from the corset to the full skirt and train.Danes revealed to E!
