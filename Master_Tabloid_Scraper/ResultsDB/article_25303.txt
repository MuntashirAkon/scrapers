Imagine a Homeland without Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) and her tears. Imagine a Homeland without Saul Berenson (Mandy Patinkin) and his beard. This is something that could happen.Following the end of Homeland season five—don't worry, it's already been renewed for season six—Showtime boss David Nevins opened up about the show's age (as well as the ages of Episodes and Shameless, two other veteran Showtime series) and whether endgames are at work."I'm not going to talk about specifics, but yeah, you do start to think of endgames. But the thing about Homeland is, it's a slightly different show because it really is able to tell a new story every year. I would like to be able to keep Homeland going because it's able to renew itself every season by just telling a story about a different part of the world," Nevins told Vulture. "It's not doing the same thing. I don't know what Alex [Gansa, the showrunner] is thinking in terms of an endgame. I do know he thinks there are a couple more years left in the show, two or three. I've gotten that from him. But how he plans to end it, I don't know."

As for going the anthology route, like many other cable and basic cable shows have started to do recently, i.e. a Homeland with new characters at the center, without Carrie and Saul, Nevins said the show "could definitely do that.""There's no question. Do we think a version of Homeland won't be relevant 15 years from now? Of course it will. Who knows what that version will be, but its franchise is both big enough and specific enough that you could imagine it outlasting any individual character," he said.Do you want to see a Homeland without Carrie and Saul?
