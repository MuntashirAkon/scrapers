Carrie Gets Carried On Stage At ACM Awards/n
Carrie Underwood‘s outrageous performance garb for the ACM Awards was the big secret of the country music world and last night, the monstrosity of a dress was revealed, taking up nearly half the stage!  A source on the scene tells RadarOnline.com that Underwood’s behemoth of a gown, possibly Marie Antoinette inspired, was so heavy that it had to be carried on stage by 3 handlers and “to get off she grabbed as much as she could and scampered off, stumbling a bit.”  Poor thing!
Before the big night, Underwood described the dress as “hard to describe” and “maybe like lava”, but this merlot silk taffeta Rafael Cennamo confection is best described as a big waste of beautiful fabric!
Aren’t country singers about boots that are made for walkin’, not gowns made for incarceration.
