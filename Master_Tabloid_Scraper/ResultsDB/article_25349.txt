Drake & Rihanna Continue The Party Together After The Rapper's El Lay Concert!/n

After the party is the after party!
Drake had a killer performance last night in El Lay — and he continued the celebrations with his lady Rihanna as the two hit up The Nice Guy together after the concert!
The Too Good rapper has been living on cloud nine the past couple of weeks — well, minus that whole robbery thing… — since going public with RiRi, and we're sure Kanye West's announcement about their joint album didn't hinder the party at all! Blessings on blessings.

It looked like Drizzy and the Sex With Me singer got things started in their shared SUV on the way to the celeb hot spot as they both had a red cup in hand both in and out of the vehicle.
These two are just livin' the dream!
Plus, it was probably a pleasant change to hit up the venue without Kylie Jenner and her teenage pals hanging around for once! LOLz!
