Can Rihanna do any wrong?
In the fall/winter edition of CR Fashion Book, the gorgeous RiRi channeled a very seXXXy version of the infamous french queen Marie Antoinette. We couldn't think of a better female icon for the singer to portray!

In the spread photographed by Terry Richardson, the beauty rocks a variety of elaborate updos and seductive corsets at the behest of stylist Carine Roitfeld and hairdresser Yusef Williams. Makeup artist Stephane Marais also played a role in bringing the star's HAWT look to life.
Mr. Wiliams said of his royalty inspo:

"I wanted to show that she is not just a villain to be despised or a muse to be channeled. She is neither, actually. She is a prototype for contemporary fame, body, beauty, celebrity and femininity."
Hmm… it sounds like Rihanna and the historical figure have A LOT in common!
The editor of the mag also chimed in, explaining:

"In this issue, I wanted to capture that sense of attraction and repulsion: the fantasy of glamour but also the poison and prison of femininity and society. The magazine is crafted around key elements of [Marie Antoinette's] life—her exuberant sense of fashion, her elaborate hairdos, her intense sexuality—almost like a modern biography through fashion imagery," the editor explained. "And on the cover is Rihanna, who shares with Marie Antoinette an air of royalty that I, and the world it seems, find intoxicating."
"Intoxicating", indeed! We could stare at these pics for days!
So, will you pick up this issue when it hits newsstands on September 15?
