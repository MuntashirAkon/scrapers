Antoinette Robertson, actress: Being from New York, I find myself enjoying the warm L.A. weather, but sometimes it gets super unpredictable and chilly at night. That’s exactly when I get to take advantage and bring out my COZIEST SWEATER ever. My favorite Free People knit sweater is my idea of comfort and it’s effortlessly cute, worn with shorts, jeans or as a dress if you dare. My ideal garment is something that makes me feel comfortable, and since oversized sweaters are trendy and cute it’s a WIN-WIN-WIN!
