Let them eat cake!  
Holland Roden poses alongside Jaime King and Lydia Hearst in Tyler Shields’ new star-studded, Marie Antoinette-era photo series Decadence, and PEOPLE has an exclusive first look at the Teen Wolf actress rocking a powdered wig and period costume.  
 “I wanted to give my version of an inside look into what I imagine it would be like if you were able to take a photograph of the Court of the Palace of Versailles and Tuileries Palace, an intimate look inside one of the most fascinating times in history,” says Shields, 33, who shot the project using a 50-year-old camera.
