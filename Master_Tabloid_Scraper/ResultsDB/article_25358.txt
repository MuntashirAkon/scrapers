Kim Kardashian Channels Audrey Hepburn and Marie Antoinette and Wears Cornrow Braids in New Hype Energy Film (Who's Confused?)/n

Kim Kardashian West serves as a muse for makeup artists, stylists and, of course, her husband, Kanye West. She’s also the inspiration behind Hype Energy USA. The 34-year-old star is a celebrity ambassador for the energy drink, and her short film for the brand has just been released. (Warning: There’s so much going on in the under-three-minute spot, your head might spin.) 

The clip starts off with a blissful Kim riding a bike around a city landscape, her basket filled with Hype. This would be less weird if Kim weren’t dressed as Audrey Hepburn, wearing an all-black outfit similar to one the film icon wore for her role in 1954’s Sabrina. (She even has the clip in bangs.) All of a sudden Kim falls, which leaves her unconscious on the pavement.

What’s next? A dreamlike sequence in which we see the star as a Marie Antoinette figure (drinking her Hype from a crystal champagne flute on a chaise lounge in some palace), her skin powdered to porcelain and her hair white.

Towards the end of the film, Kim is transported into a futuristic setting, and she’s wearing a cutout bodysuit. She sports tight cornrows as she dances around. We also see her with a short haircut, wearing an oversize T-shirt as a dress and lace-up over-the-knee boots — an outfit that looks like it’s straight out of her younger sister Kylie Jenner’s closet.

Now, Kim is five months pregnant and still pushing the fashion envelope. She also just revealed on Twitter that a dramatic hair change might be coming soon.
