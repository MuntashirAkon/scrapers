First, Marilyn Monroe and now, Kim Kardashian is channeling Marie Antoinette and Audrey Hepburn! Back in April 2014, we first saw a pic of the 34-year-old reality star wearing clip-on bangs and an all-black ensemble, à la the British icon, and now, we know the mystery shot was taken for her Hype Energy campaign. E! News has obtained a number of never-before-seen photos, which feature the pregnant star sporting epic braids, a sexy body suit with cleavage cut outs and even posing as the former Queen of France—complete with her blond wig and all! .

The images, which are believed to have been taken in 2014, also seeKanye West's wife flaunting her engagement ring as she takes a sip of the energy drink in addition to showing off her hot bod in a skin-tight dress teamed with over-the-knee lace-up sandals.

Safe to say Hype Energy has never looked so hot! 

Meanwhile, the soon-to-be mother-of-two was most recently spotted heading back to Los Angeles after a quick trip to Paris and was photographed wearing a see-through sweatshirt jumpsuit paired with sky-high booties.

Her adorable baby bump has just begun to pop—just as the E! star predicted about 10 days ago. "I'm at the stage now where I wake up with a flat belly but then as I eat and by the end of the day it pops out! This means it's about to pop," the brunette beauty tweeted last week. 

North West's mama also recently covered the latest issue of Vogue España and appeared on the mag sans a stitch of makeup.

"This has to be my favorite shoot I've done! Thank you @VogueSpain & Theo Wenner for these amazing pics! #NoMakeUp #KimNoFilter" she captioned a pic from her cover shoot.
