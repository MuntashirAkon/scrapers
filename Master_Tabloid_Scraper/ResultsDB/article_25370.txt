From the time of Marie Antoinette to now, French women have become famous for exuding a beauty that is both natural and effortless looking—without appearing underdone. How do they strike that delicate balance between not trying too hard and looking chic (and how can the rest of us capture it for ourselves)?The answer is in a dedicated beauty plan that only seems to reek of nonchalance. While French women may find it boring to disclose beauty regimens in public, a big part of attaining that certain something is found in the ritualistic way they approach skin and hair care—and accented by a penchant for carrying on their mother's beauty legacies. In lieu of having a chic French mother to draw from, we culled a few rules to live by to get that easy-yet-chic look.

Moisturize, then moisturize some more: Go into any French pharmacy; instead of being confronted with aisles of over-the-counter ear, nose and throat medicines, you'll find a remarkable selection of skin hydrators. And just like their mothers before them, today's French girls use these creams with the allegiance of doctor-prescribed Rx. They often reach for rich formulas stocked with a blend of proven skin hydrators (something akin to Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream, sold stateside) to smooth skin.

Seek all-in-one oils: While relatively new on the American scene, using dry oils to nourish limbs, cuticles and hair has long been a staple in French culture. These formulas don't feel sticky and are known to give girls that healthy body glow without the skin-aging tan.Keep imperfectly coiffed: Most French women aren't compelled to spend hours in front of the mirror, shellacking their hair into a perfectly-coiffed ‘do. Instead, a more laissez-faire approach is in order. Notice that French girls frequently rock hair that's a little disheveled? The key to getting the look is found in the frequency of hair washing.

Capitalize on third-day hair: You read it right—third day hair. Ask any French girl how often she washes her hair. Most don't reach for shampoo every day. Because day-after-day washing can strip the scalp of nourishing oils, many French girls suds up just a few times a week. This creates hair that's less slippery and better holds that slightly-disheveled shape.
