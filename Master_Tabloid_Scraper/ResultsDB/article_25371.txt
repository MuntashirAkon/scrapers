Christian Grey, is that you?The designers out of Art Hearts Fashion seemingly took a page out of the Fifty Shades of Grey franchise when they recently debuted a number of bondage-inspired looks at New York Fashion Week. The models, both male and female, left little to the imagination with their barely-there ensembles of leather, lace and lots of skin. Marie Antoinette also appeared to have shaped the runway show's daring vibe, as girls rocked larger-than-life grey wigs and pale makeup while strutting down the runway in scantily-clad lingerie by Liviaria. The guys, on the other hand, mixed business with pleasure in edgy ties, BDSM collars and six packs on top of six packs. We're not blushing. You are!

And speaking of everyone's favorite guilty pleasure, the trailer for the dark and twisted fantasy's sequel Fifty Shades Darker just premiered this week. Released Tuesday, the clip offers fans of the infamous series a new look at what's in store for the second installment of Christian (Jamie Dornan) and Anastasia Steele's (Dakota Johnson) romance. With two other movies already in the books, we knew the hot-and-cold couple couldn't stay apart for too much longer—and this trailer is proof of that.From the looks of it, Ana comes face to face with a crucial person in Christian's life while attending a Masquerade Ball at his mother's house—a meeting that ignites some personal flames, and not the romantic kind.Until Fifty Shades Darker hits theaters Feb. 10, 2017, bask in Art Hearts Fashion's racy looks and check out the trailer below!(E! and Focus Features are both members of the NBCUniversal family.)
