Los Angeles Judge Carol Boas Goodson granted a request the 29-year-old thesp's lawyers made in December to extend an order of protection against Prudhon after her camp said he had bombarded Dunst with more than 50 letters and even showed up at her mother's home in an effort to meet her.The judge originally was set to rule on the matter Dec. 21 but since Prudhorn wasn't actually served in his native France until the day before his court date, Goodson pushed the hearing until today and extended the temporary keep-away already issued.Neither Dunst nor Prudhon attended this morning's proceeding.Per the protection order, the Frenchman must remain 100 yards away from the actress.That's good news for Dunst, who's on a career high at the moment with the accolades she's been receiving for her performance in Lars von Trier's acclaimed new film Melancholia, which is topping many critics' year-end lists.
