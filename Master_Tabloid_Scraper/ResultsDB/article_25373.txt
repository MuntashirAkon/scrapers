If you ask pretty much anyone, anywhere, chances are they'll know who people like Katy Perry, Mariah Carey and Oprah Winfrey are icons of this generation.And now these stars, among others, have been transformed into icons of past generations by Carine Roitfeld and Jean-Paul Goude in the September issue of Harper's Bazaar.Perry poses as Elizabeth Taylor, while holding a shredded Andy Warhol picture of her likeness over her face. The 30-year-old singer said about Taylor, "An icon transcends time. Liz was so fabulous and decadent and had a style that evolved with the years...and I'm sure I'll be married just as many times!"

Carey, meanwhile, wears an elaborate French outfit as Marie Antoinette on Fragonard's swing. The singer said, "I'm pretty much the opposite of Marie Antoinette, but it's always fun to throw on a costume!"

And Oprah is Glinda the Good Witch from the 1939 classic The Wizard of Oz."The Wizard of Oz is one of my favorite spiritual tales," Winfrey said of her character, "and Glinda is a spiritual goddess. I love when she says to Dorothy, ‘You've always had the power.' That is the message for all of us: You're born with it, you always have it. It doesn't matter how many yellow brick roads you go down, it's always right there in your heart."

Dakota Johnson, Jessica Chastain, Lucky Blue, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Willow Smith also appear in the issue, on newsstands Aug. 18.
