Holiday Miracle! Inside The Hanks Family's Joy At Troubled Chet's Surprise Baby/n
Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson have finally bonded with their formerly estranged old son, Chet Hanks – just in time for the holidays – and RadarOnline.com has learned they have his surprise love child to thank.
Chet, 26 posted an emotional video last week to confirm that he is, in fact, the father to a newborn baby girl.
“I do have a daughter, she’s the best thing that’s ever happened to me,” Chet told his fans on Instagram, adding, “She’s the reason why I turned my life around and got sober. I’ve been sober for over a year and a half from everything.”
Now, RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned that Chet’s 60-year-old Sully star dad and his mother, Rita Wilson, 60, are “doing everything that they can to make sure they are a part of their new granddaughter’s life.”

“Chet will always be their baby,” a source close to the Hanks family said. “And of course his daughter has met the entire family.”
As previously reported, Chet, who has two other brothers – Colin, 39, and Truman, 20 – had his parents worried sick earlier this year after he went missing amid ongoing drug and alcohol addiction issues.
At the time, he reportedly cut off contact with his parents and nearly everyone else as he fought to overcome his battle with addiction.
“Tom and Rita have worked hard to reestablish their bond with Chet, especially after learning that Chet had a daughter,” the insider said.
