Great Scotts! Property Brothers Drew and Jonathan Really Embrace their Heritage on a Kilt-Filled Family Vacation
/n
Pack your bagpipes! It’s a Property Brothers invasion.
Drew and Jonathan Scott, along with their significant others, Drew’s fiancee Linda Phan and Jonathan’s longtime girlfriend Jacinta Kuznetsov; the twins’ parents, Joanne and Jim; and older brother J.D. have traveled to Scotland for a special family outing.
The HGTV stars are sharing selfies, photos of the scenery and shots of at least one member of the family rocking a kilt.
J.D. captured this group photo (note: Jonathan with his own set of bagpipes) of the crew before takeoff, warning those across the pond that the Scotts were coming. “Watch out Scotland, we’re on our way!” he says.

Jonathan is seemingly the first to don the local uniform, posting this plaid-covered collage with Kuznetsov from “Part 1” of their trip.
“Adventures in Scotland!” he writes of the two smooching and sauntering through the highlands.

Drew and fiancée Linda Phan give Jonathan and Kuznetsov a run for their #couplegoals money, with this smiley selfie. Unlike his brother, though, Drew appears to have forgone the leg-baring uniform for his usual shirt and tie.

Phan has taken to the 39-year-old twins’ ancestral homeland, writing,” Old buildings + flowers + fresh air = soul food,” on her own snap.





 Have you ever felt connected to a place in your bones? That's always how I feel in Scotland. ❤️

It’s J.D., though, that so far seems to have found himself most at home. “Have you ever felt connected to a place in your bones?” he ponders. “That’s always how I feel in Scotland.”
