Rita Wilson -- Double Mastectomy ... Second Opinion a Lifesaver/nRita Wilson had a double mastectomy and reconstructive surgery after she was diagnosed with breast cancer.  The 58-year-old actress says she underwent the procedure last week -- with husband Tom Hanks by her side -- after a diagnosis of invasive lobular carcinoma. She says the first test for cancer came back negative, but she got a second opinion which detected her true condition.   Rita told People,  "I hope this will encourage others to get a second opinion and to trust their instincts if something doesn't 'feel' right. "  Wilson had been appearing in the Larry David Broadway play  "Fish in the Dark, " but has taken a leave of absence./n
