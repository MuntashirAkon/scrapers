‘DWTS’ Feud Explodes! Heather Morris Vows To Beat Nemesis Nancy Kerrigan/n
The feud between Dancing With the Stars competitors Heather Morris and Nancy Kerrigan is getting nastier than ever.
All bets are off after Morris, 30, and Kerrigan, 47, tied with a score of 33 out of 40 from the judges during last night’s ‘Vegas Night,’ and RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned that the tension didn’t end after filming wrapped.

When judges called the Olympic skater’s samba routine “the best of the season,” a source close to production claims Glee alum Morris was livid.
“She was overheard telling another contestant that she does not really care if she wins, as long as she beats out Nancy,” said the source of Morris, who also impressed judges with her sexy Tango routine to Britney Spears’ “Toxic.”
But Kerrigan, who was infamously attacked in a sick scheme involving Tonya Harding during the 1994 Olympics, is taking the jealousy and bad blood in stride.

“The level of competition is giving her so much motivation,” the source added. “Nancy knows that Heather does not like her, but she is used to it. All it did was really force her to up her game this week because she does not want to get kicked off before Heather does!”
