Now, “Heather is complaining about Maks quitting and saying she thinks that she is being sabotaged,” a source close to production told Radar.
“She is so detached from reality and is claiming that her new partner, Alan, just doesn’t push her at all. At least, not in the same way Maks does!’
However, even though Chmerkovskiy did not dance with Morris this week, she and new coach Bersten still avoided elimination with a score of 30 out of 40!
And although sources insist to Radar that Chmerkovskiy’s injury will keep him out for at least “three weeks,” the insider said that Morris has been hinting that he might not be hurt as badly as he claims!

“Heather said that she doesn’t think that Maks’s injury is as bad as he is saying, and that maybe Peta had something to do with him balling on her,” the source told Radar.
“Peta has a reputation on set for being jealous,” the insider claimed, “but Heather just seems focused on proving to everyone that she can win this competition.”
And that might mean rubbing a few people the wrong way.
“She is just acting like a total b***h right now,” the insider said.
