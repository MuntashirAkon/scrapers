“Heather and Nancy were super cold to each other, and already have a duel going on,” a production insider revealed.
As previously reported, Morris has gotten a lot of heat from other contestants over the fact that she has a professional dancing background. (She toured with Beyonce before hitting it big with Glee.)
After Morris and pro partner Maksim Chmerkovskiy, 37, scored the exact same score as Kerrigan, 47, and her coach, Artem Chigvintsev – a 28 out of 40 – the source said that Morris had a mini backstage meltdown!
“Heather was visibly upset last night after tying with Nancy for third place and said that her score was unfair,” said the source. “She was just so cocky going into the competition.”
In an interview yesterday with THR, DWTS executive producer Ashley Edens revealed that there is truth to rumors that the judges are holding Morris up to a different set of standards.

“We’re not shying away from the fact that she 100 percent has dance experience. Because of that, she will be judged on a higher level and there will be higher expectations on her,” Edens said.
Dancing With the Stars airs Mondays from 8 to 10 p.m. on ABC.
