'DWTS' Rigging Scandal: Cast ERUPTS Over Heather Morris' Secret 'Huge Advantage'/n
Another season of Dancing with the Stars is here — and another cast member is already getting bashed by her fellow contestants over her professional dance background!
According to insiders, Glee star Heather Morris is following in the footsteps of Zendaya, Nicole Scherzinger, and other DWTS stars who were called out for having prior ballroom experience.
Morris, 30, was a backup dancer for Beyonce for two years before auditioning for So You Think You Can Dance.
“Heather is a professional dancer and a lot of people on the cast thinks that it is totally unfair because she has such a huge advantage,” an on-set source told Radar.
“She is already acting like the Mirror Ball Trophy is her trophy!”

As Radar previously reported, Morris isn’t the only diva on set – ice skating queen, Nancy Kerrigan, 47, is also creating a lot of tension behind the scenes, too!
“Just like Nancy, Heather is also trying to choreograph her own routines and she just does not seem to be giving it her all during rehearsals,” the source told Radar.
“That being said, she is really, really good. She seriously is the one to beat this season and she is blowing her partner away with how quick she is learning the material.”
