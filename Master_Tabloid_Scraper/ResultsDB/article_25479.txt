Why Me?! Skating Queen Nancy Kerrigan 'Total Diva' During 'DWTS' Rehearsals/n
It’s been years since Nancy Kerrigan has been in the spotlight, but RadarOnline.com has learned that she’s fallen right back into the role of ice queen diva on the set of Dancing with the Stars.
“Nancy is really starting to make a lot of people angry because she is acting like she already knows what she is doing,” a production insider told Radar.

“She is trying to choreograph her own routines and is just being incredibly bossy to the other contestants and to the production crew.”
But according to the source, it is not only the routines that Kerrigan, 47, is trying to control!
“Aside from the choreography, Nancy seems just not willing to train as long as everyone else and she is constantly trying to make up excuses for herself,” the source told Radar.
“It got so bad that they had to straight up tell her, this is Dancing with the Stars, not Skating with the Stars!”
