New Girl is coming to an end.

After months of cancellation speculations, the Fox comedy starring Zooey Deschanel has been renewed for its seventh and final season. Sources tell Variety the new season will be shortened, comprising only of eight episodes.
In March, actor Jake Johnson told The Daily Beast the show was almost certainly “done” after its sixth season and the cast had “shot a finale where, if this was the end, the core fan base would be OK.” He later clarified on Twitter that the series’ renewal was still up in the air.

Let’s be clear. I have no idea if NG is coming back. I was doing an interview for #WinItAll & was asked my guess. We’ve been told it’s 50/50 https://t.co/fxhLi7gySU

“Let’s be clear. I have no idea if NG is coming back,” he tweeted at the time. “We’ve been told it’s 50/50.”
Also starring Max Greenfield, Lamorne Morris and Hannah Simone, New Girl is currently Fox’s longest-running live-action comedy on the air. The show has been on since 2011.
