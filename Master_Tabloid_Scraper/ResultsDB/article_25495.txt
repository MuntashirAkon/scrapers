Maybe they’re just too good for each other?

Six months after their breakup, Drake and Rihanna found themselves in the same room again when they attended a children’s birthday bash in Los Angeles on Sunday (Apr. 9, 2017). In a series of videos shared by Gavin Morris, the former couple seemingly tried to avoid crossing paths as they kept their distance and did their own thing. Rihanna — who came to the party with BFF Melissa Forde — focused on laying with the kids at a ball pit, while Drake chilled by the stairs with a drink.
It’s unclear if the two actually interacted, though you can pretty much cut the awkward tension with a knife.

The on-again, off-again duo made things official last summer after Drake publicly declared his love for Rihanna at the 2016 MTV Video Music Awards, admitting to the crowd he had been in love with the “Work” singer since he was 22. The two confirmed their relationship in September — and even got matching tattoos — before splitting just months later.
Seeing how they’ve been toying with our hearts since 2009, we have a feeling things aren’t completely over for Drake and Rihanna just yet.
