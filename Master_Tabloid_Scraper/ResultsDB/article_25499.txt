Proving she can literally have it all, the superhuman that is Beyoncé is slated to perform at this year’s Grammys. That’s right, the “Hold Up” singer — who is currently expecting twins with husband Jay Z — will make an appearance at the star-studded award ceremony.

According to Entertainment Tonight, Queen Bey was spotted on Thursday (Feb. 2, 2017) rehearsing for the broadcast in Los Angeles.
The 35-year-old’s father, Matthew Knowles, confirmed the performance to The Insider, saying, “She sounded a little tired because she’s been working on the Grammy performance … We just had a wonderful daughter-dad conversation.”
Leading the nominations with a total of nine nods, Beyoncé is now one of the many A-list talent performing next weekend, including Adele, The Weeknd, Daft Punk, Alicia Keys, A Tribe Called Quest, Dave Grohl, Maren Morris and Anderson .Paak.
This news comes just a day after Beyoncé revealed she was pregnant, writing in an Instagram post, “We would like to share our love and happiness. We have been blessed two times over. We are incredibly grateful that our family will be growing by two, and we thank you for your well wishes.  -The Carters.”
At the time, fans wondered if Bey would be able to perform at the 2017 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, where she is the headlining act for both weekends. Well, it certainly seems pregnancy isn’t going to stop the show!
The 2017 Grammy Awards are set to air live on CBS on Sunday, Feb. 12 at 8 p.m. ET/5 p.m. PT.
