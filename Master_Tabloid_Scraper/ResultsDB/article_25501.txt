Maren Morris and fiancé Ryan Hurd have been on cloud nine since announcing their engagement this July. And the couple couldn’t stop gushing about the magical proposal at their first red carpet appearance at the ACM Honors Thursday night in Nashville.
Hurd revealed to Entertainment Tonight the process of designing Morris’ custom one-of-a-kind sparkler.
“I know what she likes and I had somebody in Canada put it together. The stone is from New York City, it’s from an uncut diamond, and then the rest of it’s cast just custom for her,” Hurd shared. “I couldn’t just buy something. I had to make it something that fit her.”

When it comes to actually planning their wedding, Morris admitted the couple’s moving at a “glacial pace,” but would love a spring affair. “I think we’re kind of honing in on the springtime, before we kick off our tours again,” she said.

Morris, 27, and Hurd, 32, started dating in December 2015 after starting a friendship in 2013 when they met during a writing session shortly after Morris moved to Music City, where she scored a recording deal.
“We were both at different publishing companies, and our publishers’ job is to fill our calendars up, so they just randomly put us together on a write one day,” Morris previously told PEOPLE.
