Morrison has been documenting much of the trip, writing on another post of his expectant wife, “the sights of Italy are astounding…but I can’t stop looking at this sight!”
Earlier in the week, the star’s wife showed off her growing belly from overseas, writing, “I can’t possibly explain the sensation that is my child kicking and punching my INSIDES!!!!!! It’s wild to say the least… I’m beyond obsessed and can’t get enough.. I want to be pregnant forever! What a miracle it is to be a woman… I am so unbelievably grateful!”

“We do feel like this will be our first Father’s Day, we really celebrated Mother’s Day this year for [Renee],” he said, adding, “We’ll be just enjoying our travels before we have our addition.”
