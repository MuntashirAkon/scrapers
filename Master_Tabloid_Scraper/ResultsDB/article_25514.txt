The twosome took to her Instagram to share the happy news with fans on Sunday.In one of the photos, the country girl and proud Texan appears to be sitting on Ryan's lap while holding a Corona Light and resting her hand on her love's leg, which is a nod to the lyrics of his single about their relationship, "Love In a Bar." The images show off the singer's dazzling new accessory.Other snaps in the post show the couple staring into each other's eyes.The 28-year-old simply captioned the Instagram, "Yes," along with an engagement ring emoji.Meanwhile, Ryan's most recent Insta is a little more mysterious.

It's been a big 2017 for the pint-sized singer. In addition to getting engaged, she won Best Country Solo Performance for her song "My Church" at the 2017 Grammys in February. She beat out veterans including Carrie Underwood, Miranda Lambert, Brandy Clark and Keith Urban for the accolade."Oh, my goodness. This is so crazy," she shared with the audience during her acceptance speech. "Thank you to the recording academy."The singer continued, "11 years ago, I went to the first-ever Grammy camp. It was the first time I ever flew on a plane by myself to L.A. and it's crazy to be here a decade later."What a year!
