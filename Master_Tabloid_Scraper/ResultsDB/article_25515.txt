Look at that form! Look at that posture! Look at that chemistry!

Aside from her time spent on Glee, Heather, 30, has been dancing since she was a kid, and even appeared on So You Think You Can Dance and served as a backup dancer for Beyoncé.But even with her impressive dance experience, Heather admitted to E! News, "I'm nervous about the live audience…I'm just not totally used to it."As for Maks, he was quick to sound off on the couple possible having an advantage in the competition, with the new dad saying, "To say that we just have this massive advantage, I think so, but I don't think we're the only ones that could pull off beautiful, beautiful numbers. I'm ready for us to be scrutinized a little different and judged a little different and rightfully so, we'll do our best."
