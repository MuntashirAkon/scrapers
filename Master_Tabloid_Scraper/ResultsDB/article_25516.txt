Heather Morris Welcomes Baby Boy No. 2—See His Precious Debut!/n
"He's really cute around babies and baby dolls and I adore it. He's really excited to have somebody to play with because he's at that age where he's active and wants to do stuff," Morris told us in November.As far as dealing with pregnancy the second time around, the blond beauty previously told us that she felt more aware of what was happening with her body, and how to stay in shape."I don't really have a lot of cravings this time. Just trying to eat really healthy. I'm kind of aware of what my body's going through and what to expect and just more prepared and just being more body conscious, exercising and fit and ready. I go on the treadmill and take Pilates like once a week to make sure I'm staying in shape."She even shared a selfie from the gym recently, explaining that she was trying to walk everyday to help induce labor. "Gym time! Walking walking walking!! All day long and night..only 12 days left," she wrote.Looks like it worked better than expected, because this little guy came early! Congratulations to the growing family!
