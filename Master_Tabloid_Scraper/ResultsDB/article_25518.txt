Congratulations are in order for Heather Morris and her hubby Taylor Hubbell.The Glee star revealed to her friends tonight that she's pregnant with their second child! Showing her tiny baby bump from the side, Morris posed alongside a large blue ruler that says "The Growing Hubbells" and used that as her hashtag.Soon-to-be mommy and onscreen love interest Naya Rivera was quick to respond to the exciting news, tweeting, "SO exciting! Congrats @HeatherMorrisTV #thegrowinghubbells."The couple welcomed their first child, a son named Elijah, in September of 2014.

Then, in May of this year, Morris tied the knot with her longtime beau and high school sweetheart at Old Canyon Ranch in Topanga, Calif. on Saturday in front of a large group of family and friends, including a handful of Morris' co-stars.After her first pregnancy, Morris decided not to return to Glee for its fifth season. However, she made a guest appearance appearance in its 100th episode, and ultimately returned for the show's final season."I love being a mom," she gushed to E! News at Glee's 100th episode party. "Boys are the greatest."Congratulations!
