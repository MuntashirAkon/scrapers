Huge bouquets of purple balloons flew outside the event.  And there's this ... Morris Day -- lead singer of The Time and Prince's nemesis in  "Purple Rain " -- released a new song in his honor ...  "Over That Rainbow. " Morris told Rolling Stone the last time he saw Prince,  "I thought maybe something wasn't right. I thought, he looked thin, even though he always looks fragile. After he passed away, I just wondered if he knew something that he wasn't telling me. I just felt like he knew. Like he knew that something wasn't right. " #RIPPrince/n
