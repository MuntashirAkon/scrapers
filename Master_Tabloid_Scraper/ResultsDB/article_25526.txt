'New Girl' Star Lamorne Morris -- Jay Cutler Can Be a Winner ... If He Starts Bangin' Gisele/n / /   Well, this doesn't bode well for Kristin Cavallari.  If Chicago Bears QB Jay Cutler wants to turn things around and start playing like a winner ... he's gotta do things that winners do -- and that starts with banging Gisele.  At least, that's the strategy  "New Girl " star Lamorne Morris -- a HUGE Chicago Bears fan -- was recommending when we talked to the guy at The Improv in L.A. last night.   "Until [Cutler] starts inserting himself into Gisele every night ... she has a magical vagina ... then I will believe in him. " Hey, at least he has a plan. /n
