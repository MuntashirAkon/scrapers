1972 Miami Dolphins Star Mercury Morris RIPS Richard Nixon -- Dude Was a Racist/nMiami Dolphins legend Mercury Morris ain't a fan of the N-word -- as in, Nixon ... Richard Nixon. The unofficial mouthpiece for the undefeated '72 Super Bowl champs arrived in D.C. this week ... and told TMZ he’s glad his victory trip to the White House is coming 40 years after the fact -- so he doesn't have to deal with a racist President like Tricky Dick.   FYI -- The Fins never got a chance to meet the POTUS after their undefeated season because the President was dealing with some issues of his own at the time ... issues that rhyme with shmatergate. But today, members of the team have finally been invited to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. to get their long-awaited congratulatory handshake from the Commander In Chief ... and running back Mercury Morris is pumped.

But you won't see them at the White House anytime soon ... thanks to Eli Manning and one sticky helmet./n
