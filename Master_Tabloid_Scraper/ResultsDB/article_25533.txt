Mercury Morris: Props to Panthers ... But You're No '72 Dolphins/nTMZ Sports asked Mercury Morris -- the mouthpiece of the '72 Miami Dolphins -- how he felt about the Carolina Panthers making a run at an undefeated season. His response:    "Go ask the Patriots how difficult it is to do it and how they feel about some little kid in Guatemala wearing those perfect 19-0 Super Bowl tees. " The 68-year-old running back says he's impressed with Cam Newton and company, but says at the end of the day -- it only gets harder from here.   "I have to take my hat off to them. It's not easy to get 12 wins, " Morris says.  However, Mercury warns that a  "ton of teams " have made it to 12 only to lose at game 13.  "The Broncos did it, Colts and the Saints a few years back. "  "Let [the Panthers] get past that jinx of the 13th game and then come ask me again if I think they will have a perfect season. " Still, Morris says even if they run the table, they'll always play second fiddle to the '72 Fins.   "Do you know the second biggest canyon in the U.S.? No, because everyone only knows about the Grand Canyon. No one cares about the second to do anything. "  For the record, it's Palo Duro Canyon in Texas. /n
