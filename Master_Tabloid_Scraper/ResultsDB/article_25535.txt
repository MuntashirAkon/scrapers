Justin Timberlake -- We Finally Got a Piece of the Piiiiiie!!!/nJustin Timberlake got a fabulous parting gift Friday night as he left a fancy Oscar party ... a DELICIOUS pizza pie! Justin and Jessica Biel hobnobbed it at the William Morris /Endeavor party in the Hollywood Hills, but it's hard to eat at these things with all the jawboning. Â  Justin wasn't afraid to ask, so he scored semi-burnt (the best way) pie on his exit. The real burning question ... will he return the platter?/n
