Cheetah Girl Purrs at Old Man/nKiely Williams of the Cheetah Girls took a break from eating at Mr.Chow Saturday night to exchange digits with someone a little outside of her target demo.The 3LW hottie flirted with an older gentleman who everyone initially thought was trying to get some change from the beauty -- but it looks like he may have just been trying to get closer to that booty!The singer actually exchanged phone numbers with the sly playa and after she gave him a kiss on the cheek he turned to our camera and said,  "How you like me now! " Get some, gramps!Wait a minute ... was that Garrett Morris?!/n
