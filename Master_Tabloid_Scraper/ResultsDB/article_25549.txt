Hillary Clinton Charging Up To $100,000 For 'Hamilton' Tickets!/n
Hillary Clinton‘s donors now have the chance to see a special performance of the hit Broadway show Hamilton, but it’s going to cost them an enormous sum!
The Democratic Presidential candidate’s campaign is selling tickets to the Tony-winning show, ranging from $2,700 to $100,000!
And to those who can afford the steep prices, there is still one major caveat: Creator and star Lin-Manuel Miranda won’t even be performing! Miranda, a tough get for the Clinton campaign, and co-stars Leslie Odom Jr. and Phillipa Soo will be performing in their final show on July 9, three days before Clinton’s scheduled fundraiser.

The lowest price guarantees only a general audience seat.
For $5,000, donors get a preferred seat and $10,000 lands a donor the opportunity for a “photo reception” with Clinton.
Clinton’s website says that $33,400 “includes Premium Seat and Wrap Party with Hillary and other special guests.”

The whopping $100,000 donation, meanwhile, grants donors two premium seats, a chance to attend the wrap party with Clinton and “other special guests,” and an invitation to the upcoming Democratic National Convention.
Clinton has long been chummy with A-listers and has made headlines for her lavish fundraisers once charging $353,000  to have dinner with Clinton and George Clooney.
