By Debbie Emery – Radar Reporter
Tyra Banks shocked viewers when she fired not one but three key cast members on America’s Next Top Model last week, and now the reality host is explaining why the show is cleaning house.
“We reached a point where we feel the show needs a new boost,” she told Access Hollywood at New York City’s Matrix Awards, referring to why creative director Jay Manuel, runway trainer J. Alexander (known as Miss J) and photographer Nigel Barker were all given the boot just days earlier.

As RadarOnline.com previously reported, ANTM is now heading into its 19th season and is apparently eager to become more social media savvy and show executives have approached bloggers and fashion industry favorites to update the flavor of the show.
“It’s very difficult because I love my guys, they’re my guys. They’ve been there since the beginning of the show,” said Banks, who didn’t rule out the possibility of working with her trio of experts again in the future.

“My partner Ken Mok and I have projects we’re developing, and we’re a family, it doesn’t end,” she added.
Another change on the show this season was the introduction of People’s Revolution public relations maven Kelly Cutrone, who took over from Vogue editor-at-large, Andre Leon Talley.
