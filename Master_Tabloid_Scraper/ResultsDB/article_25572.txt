Winter is finally here.

Ironically on the first day of summer, HBO drops the second trailer to the much-anticipated seventh season of Game of Thrones. Packing more thrills and chills than the initial teaser, the two-minute clip features Jon Snow (Kit Harington) doing battle with the Night King and Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke) taking over Dragonstone.
“When the snows fall and the white wind blows, the lone wolf dies but the pack survives,” Sansa Stark (Sophie Turner) cautions in a voiceover. (So does this mean Jon Snow is doomed to die… again?!)
Also starring Lena Headey, Peter Dinklage, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, Maisie Williams, Aidan Gillen, Liam Cunningham, John Bradley, Hannah Murray, Ellie Kendrick, Isaac Hempstead Wright, Gwendoline Christie, Conleth Hill, Nathalie Emmanuel, Bella Ramsey, and Kristofer Hivju, Season 7 premieres July 16 on HBO.
