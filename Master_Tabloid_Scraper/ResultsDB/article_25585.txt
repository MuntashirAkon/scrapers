Lin-Manuel Miranda's Vacation Reading List Includes A Wrinkle in Time, David Sedaris
/n
Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda is coming back from vacation, and he’s shared his wildly diverse reading list on Twitter. He tackled some classics (War and Peace, One Hundred Years of Solitude — in Spanish), brushed up on A Wrinkle in Time to prepare for Ava DuVernay’s forthcoming adaptation, and even threw in some TV history (Letterman: The Last Giant of Late Night) and humor (John Hodgman’s Vacationland).
But before you start combing through this list for clues to Miranda’s next project (after all, he first picked up Ron Chernow’s Hamilton as a vacation read), the Mary Poppins Returns star posted the list with a crucial subtitle: “The Books I Enjoyed On Vacation (none of which I am adapting into a musical, good reads all).”
Check out his list below, and beneath that, links to order the books yourself.
