The Fast and Furious squad is real.
Tyrese Gibson took to Instagram on Thursday to prove to his 8.7 million followers that the bond between his Fast and Furious costars goes far beyond the screen. The actor posted a video of himself hanging out with Vin Diesel and Nathalie Emmanuel.
In the clip, the three are seen sitting outside as they joke around with one another — even putting on fake British accents at one point.
“Ya’ll think we only move as a family for movies….” he captioned the video.
Diesel and Gibson even gave Game of Thrones a shout-out, in support of Emmanuel, who also stars in the hit HBO series.

 
 
“Our angel that we love so much, Nathalie,” said Diesel after complimenting the talented actors in Game of Thrones.
The cast has been open about their love for one another in the past, constantly posting photos with each other on social media.
Diesel recently reunited with pal Gal Gadot for some quality time with their respective daughters.
“When we aren’t playing superheroes … All love,” Diesel wrote alongside a sweet Facebook photo of himself holding his daughter Pauline, 2, with Gadot feeding her 3-month-old daughter, Maya.
The stars acted together in the fourth, fifth and sixth movies of The Fast and the Furious franchise.
