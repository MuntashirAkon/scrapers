Alexander Hamilton, she was waiting in the wings for you...How's this for a perfect Hamilton experience?

You are the Shakespeare of our generation. I will never understand your genius, but I will continually be inspired by it.""Congrats to the incredible cast of #hamiltour #hamiltonlosangeles - you blew us all away," she said, quoting a lyric from the show. "@hamiltonmusical (ps I'm also slightly obsessed with your mom).""It happened," Miranda wrote on Twitter, alongside the same selfie.The Buffy the Vampire Slayer alum had seen the musical on Broadway before and has expressed her love for Hamilton online in the past. A few months ago, she got involved in a couple of adorable GIF-filled conversations with Miranda on Twitter.

While Miranda did not reprise his role of Hamilton, he appeared on a stage outside the theatre on Hollywood Boulevard, where he greeted fans who gathered for a cheap ticket lottery and introduced the National Tour Cast and also made a brief appearance onstage inside during the curtain call."My heart is so full," he told the crowd inside. "Thank you so much for being with us tonight."
