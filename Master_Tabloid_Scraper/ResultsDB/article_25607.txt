'Sicario' Star Bernardo Saracino Busted for DUI After Medium Speed Chase/nOne of the drug cartel bad dudes from  "Sicario " was on the run from real life cops in L.A. before they chased him down and arrested him for DUI. Law enforcement sources tell us cops spotted Bernardo Saracino -- drug lord Manuel Diaz in  "Sicario " -- around 3:30 AM swerving on an L.A. freeway. Officers lit him up and the chase was on. We're told Saracino refused to pull over for about 8 minutes, leading LAPD cops on a chase that covered 3 freeways ... although never exceeding speed limits.  We're told Saracino -- who's also in Tina Fey's  "Whiskey Tango Foxtrot " -- eventually pulled over and surrendered peacefully. Officers booked him for misdemeanor DUI and evading police. We reached out to Saracino's rep for comment ... so far, no word back./n
