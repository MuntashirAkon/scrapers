Mike Pence Booed at 'Hamilton'/n9:40 AM PST -- Dixon responded to Trump on Twitter, saying,  "conversation is not harassment sir. And I appreciate Mike Pence for stopping to listen. "VP-elect Mike Pence was booed and lectured Friday night on Broadway, courtesy of  "Hamilton, " and Donald Trump is pissed off. Trump just tweeted,  "The cast of Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man, Mike Pence.  Apologize! " Pence and some family members hit up the play, and they entered the theater to a chorus of boos.   When the cast took their bows, Pence stood up to leave, but Brandon Victor Dixon, who plays Aaron Burr implored him to stay and read what was clearly a prepared statement, saying in part,  "We are a diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us. " Lin-Manuel Miranda, who wrote and originally starred in the play, says he's proud of Dixon for  "leading with love, " adding  "ALL are welcome at the theater. "  But Trump begs to differ, saying,  "Our wonderful future V.P. Mike Pence was harassed last night at the theater. "/n
