From the Hamptons to the 909/nLooking more like Diddy's event planner for his yearly  "white party, " Mary J. Blige recently graced the cover of Hampton's magazine. Holla!The religious Blige, who was born and raised in Yonkers, NY, has come a long way in her spiritual journey -- to the Hamptons. The multi-Grammy-winning diva is currently on tour, but Miss Thing won't be performing in the hoity-toity Hamptons. God bless her! Instead, Blige will be making a pilgrimage to the San Manuel Indian Gaming Casino -- sinless! The casino is located in the sizzling 909, in glamorous San Bernardino County, Calif. The performance is totally sold out! Praise God! Sinners like them some R&B!/n
