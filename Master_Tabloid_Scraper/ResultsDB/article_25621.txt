Daft Punk -- UNMASKED at LAX!! Robots Can't Fly International/nThe guys from Daft Punk were forced to drop their annoying robot act -- 'cause TSA tends to frown on that kinda thing -- and reveal their faces at LAX yesterday.If you spent all 14 hours of the Grammys wondering what was behind those shiny helmets -- you might be disappointed to see the duo ... actually looked pretty damn boring in baseball caps before their flight back to France.2 French guys returning home victorious with 4 trophies. No surrender. Go figure.FUN FACT: Their real names are Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and Thomas Bangalter. Très French./n
