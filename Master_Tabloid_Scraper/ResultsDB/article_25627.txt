Mitt Romney Attends Manny Pacquiao vs. Juan Manuel Marquez Fight/nMitt Romney and wife Ann had a ringside seat to witness Juan Manuel Marquez knockout the great Manny Pacquiao last night in Las Vegas.  In a bit of foreshadowing someone in Manny's camp should have prevented, Romney actually met Pacquaio before the fight, reportedly saying to him,  "Hello Manny. I ran for president. I lost. " That fight was more of a split decision than a knockout./n
