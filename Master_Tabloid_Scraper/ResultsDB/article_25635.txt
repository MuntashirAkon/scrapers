Jennifer Aniston & Justin Theroux: Dinner Date With Their Moms!/n
Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux spent the day out in the Big Apple Saturday, escaping the sweltering heat with a movie in the afternoon and dinner last night.
And they had two very special women with them for dinner, their moms!  Jen’s mother, Nancy Dow, recovering from a stroke, and Justin’s mother, Phyllis Grissim, were along for the meal — and you just know the conversation must have been about their merging families.
The engaged pair, who attended Jimmy Kimmel‘s nuptials last weekend, seemed in great spirits after the dinner.

They held hands and smiled for photographers – wow! — as they left the Blue Hill restaurant in Greenwich Village, and Jen was even spotted tenderly taking her mom’s hand.
Aniston’s We’re the Millers opens August 9, and she is now at work on Squirrels to Nuts. Theroux is shooting the upcoming HBO series, The Leftovers.
When will these two ever find time for their own wedding?  Tell us what you think, in comments.
