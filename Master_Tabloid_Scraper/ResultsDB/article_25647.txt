Giffords’ doctors reported she’s walking a bit. Her speech is gradually progressing, as she’s up to giving one-word answers or short, declarative statements, the paper reported.
She’s primarily relying on her left side, though she’s regained some use of her right arm and leg (which were damaged after she was shot in the left side of her brain).

She’s expected to be present for the launch of her husband’s shuttle Endeavour on Friday afternoon in Cape Canaveral, Florida.
The Arizona Democrat, 40, was shot January 8 allegedly by Jared Loughner in a Tucson rampage that left six people dead.
The victims of the January 8 desert massacre were U.S. District Judge John Roll, 63; 9/11 baby Christina Taylor Green, 9; Giffords aide Gabe Zimmerman, 30; Dorothy Morris, 76; Dorwin Stoddard, 76; and Phyllis Schneck, 79. Thirteen others were injured.
