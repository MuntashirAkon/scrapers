Christina Aguilera is bidding farewell to her marital mansion and RadarOnline.com can take you inside the stunning multi million dollar home.

Situated just off Sunset Strip in Beverly Hills, Aguilera’s plush pink pad used to be home to Sharon and Ozzy Osbourne, but a peak inside shows how the singer made the house uniquely her own.
Adorned with animal print cushions, chandeliers and decadent decorations it looks more like a set for one of her movies, than a family home.

Patterns rule the roost with black and white also playing a strong theme throughout.
Even her son, Max’s room is over the top, with a giant man in the moon stacked from floor to ceiling and anime images painted on the wall.

Aguilera once described the interior to her home as “gothic, burlesque, Hollywood Regency and chinoiserie elements juxtaposed with modern flourishes like graffitti artwork, Japanese anime, and kaleidoscopic rugs.”
Much of her exuberant furniture was bought from Phyllis Morris’ expensive Circa Collection which sells for tens of thousands of dollars a piece.
