BAFTA Award Nominations Announced — But Some Of Your Favorites Have Been Snubbed! See The Nominees & Biggest Snubs HERE!/n

Time for more announcements!
Award season is here which means we get to find out what 2015 movies will be nominated!
While the Golden Globe nominations have already come in, as well as the SAG Awards, and the People's Choice Awards have already passed, it's time for some bigger award shows!
While the Academy Awards won't be announced until next week, the 68th Annual BAFTA Awards were announced via live-stream video this morning by Stephen Fry and Gugu Mbatha-Raw.
Video: Check Out All The Highlights From This Year's People's Choice Awards!
The list is mostly what you'd expect, but there were a couple major surprises regarding snubs as neither Jennifer Lawrence or Tom Hanks were nominated. In fact, David O. Russell's Joy wasn't nominated at all!
Another arguable snub was British actress Charlotte Rampling who didn't receive a nomination for her romantic drama 45 Years despite there being buzz that she could land an Oscar nod this year!
Perhaps one of the most puzzling omissions though was Spectre which didn't receive a SINGLE nomination! The reason this is a bit of a shock is the previous Bond film, Skyfall, not only won Outstanding British Film in 2013, but it was nominated for eight total awards!
Ch-ch-check out the full list of nominees (below) and let us know who you think was snubbed!
