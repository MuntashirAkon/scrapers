The airline is getting heat for playing a cut of the film that omits Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara’s intimate scenes.

Apparently, the Todd Haynes’ film Carol, about a lesbian love affair in 1950s New York, has been deemed too racy for in-flight viewing by Delta Airlines. The solution? A version stripped of any kissing or sex scenes between the film’s leads, leaving women in ‘50s fashion giving each other long, smoldering glances.
“There were two versions of this film that the studio makes available — one that is edited and one that is not edited,” Liz Savadelis, a rep for Delta, told AfterEllen. “The edited version removes two explicit scenes that do not meet our guidelines. The edited version also removes all kissing.”
The film’s screenwriter Phyllis Nagy weighed in on Twitter when a viewer expressed their confusion after seeing the neutered version on a flight.


@trishbendix @Delta yup. Makes zero sense without the intimacy.
