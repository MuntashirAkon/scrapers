The 88th Academy Award nominees have been revealed, and those who were bestowed the honor of a nomination are, as expected, humbled and ecstatic.

First-time Oscar nominee for Best Actress (and Best Actress winner at last Sunday’s Golden Globes for her role in Room) Brie Larson called into the Today show from her Kong: Skull Island set in Australia, and expressed, “I am feeling incredible…I can’t even believe it. I am just sitting here in complete and utter shock over all of this. I feel like I’m in a very bizarre Alice in Wonderland dream right now.”

She added, “Just the nomination alone is so incredible…it’s so cool. I feel like I get to join this cool club of people that I love.”
In a statement to E! news, Larson expressed similar sentiments.
I’m unbelievably honored and excited to be recognized by the Academy, and even more thrilled to share this honor with Lenny Abrahamson, Emma Donoghue and the entire Room family of filmmakers, cast, and crew. I’m so lucky and humbled to be a part of this beautiful story, in a once-in-a-lifetime role. Congratulations to my fellow nominees. Truly, I am very grateful this morning.
Her initial reaction when she heard her name announced, E! notes, was “I thought, ‘Holy shit!’ It’s that mixed with a total flat line.” Explaining she had a long, “very physical day” with “a lot of climbing,” the 25-year-old continued, “I didn’t realize how strong my reaction would be. My whole body was shaking. I started crying. It really was when they gave [Abrahamson] a Best Director nomination that I really lost it. He’s so deserving of it. So well deserved and so exciting to see.”



It takes the dedication and hearts of many to bring a film to life. I’d like to take today’s nominations as chance to thank the crew of @roomthemovie for all the hard work they put in. Thank you to @theacademy for recognizing Emma(Best Adapted Screenplay), Lenny(Best Director), myself(Best Actress) and all the sweet faces in this photo(Best Picture). This film changed all of us for the better and it has been a pleasure to see it flourish in the world and change others. Congrats to the other nominees. We can’t wait to celebrate your talent with you. 🍾🍾🍾

Alicia Vikander, another first-time Oscar nominee for Best Supporting Actress in The Danish Girl, called into the Today show later on upon waking up and hearing the big news. “I just woke up and I was trying to look at the live thing and as soon as it came up for the Best Supporting Actress category, my wifi just went off and then I got a call and I was really nervous to pick it up,” she commented.
Up for Best Actress for her role in Joy, 2013 Best Actress winner Jennifer Lawrence expressed, “I am beyond grateful and humbled by this nomination. I feel incredibly honored to be recognized among the other amazing women in this category.
Meanwhile 21-year-old Saoirse Ronan, who was nominated for the first time at age 13 for Best Supporting Actress in Atonement, is up for Best Actress this year for Brooklyn. She revealed to Today, “I was asleep…My mom ran into me, tears streaming down her face so I knew it was either good news or bad news and it was the best news ever. We’re delighted.”

 Lady Gaga is one step closer to becoming an EGOT winner (i.e. someone who has won all four major annual American entertainment awards in a competitive, individual category: the Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony) with her first Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song. Gaga and Diane Warren co-wrote “Til It Happens to You” for The Hunting Ground documentary, an exposé on college campus rape and sexual assault worldwide. She commented:

This nomination lends a voice to so many victims and their families around the world. Thank you to The Academy for recognizing the movement of people who have come together around The Hunting Ground and “Til It Happens To You” in the name of sexual assault. Diane Warren and I are simply honored to represent the voices of so many survivors.

Warren echoed her sentiment: “I am so excited about this nomination for my song “Til It Happens To You.” It means a lot to Lady Gaga and me that the song has been recognized by the Academy and has also resonated so deeply with survivors of sexual assault, giving a voice to this movement as well as comfort and empowerment to those who have experienced any difficult situation in their lives.

Last year’s Best Director winner (for Birdman) Alejandro González Iñárritu is nominated again this year for The Revenant, which leads the nominations with 12 total. He said in an exciting statement, “I am in London and just heard the good news! We gave it our all on this film and this appreciation from the Academy means a lot to me and my colleagues who made it possible. Champagne and Mezcal will run tonight!”
Star of The Revenant and six-time Academy Award nominee Leonardo DiCaprio is hoping this year will be the year he finally gets an Oscar. DiCaprio expressed in a statement:
I am so grateful to the Academy for their recognition of this film. Making The Revenant was one of the most rewarding and collaborative experiences of my life. None of this would have been possible without Alejandro’s talent, vision and determination. Our dedicated crew also deserves to share in this moment. Together, they have created a truly unique cinematic experience. Congratulations to all of my fellow nominees this season. Thank you to the Academy.
Jennifer Jason Leigh is up for Best Supporting Actress for Quentin Tarantino’s The Hateful Eight. She commented, “This is incredible news to wake up to. I am thrilled. I didn’t think the experience of working with Quentin and this cast could get any more rewarding….to get this recognition for this role is such a joy.”

Nominated for Best Supporting Actor for Bridge of Spies, Mark Rylance expressed:
It is a delight to be celebrated as a supporting actor in Steven [Spielberg]’s beautiful film, Bridge of Spies. I cannot separate my work in the film from the work of my friend Tom Hanks. Every thought, every look, every expression you are celebrating in my portrayal of Rudolf Abel, I found them all in the thoughtful generous presence of Tom Hanks beside me, or behind the camera, yet still with me 100%, every take, every moment. Of course you would witness none of it without Steven, nor are any of the choices of what you witness mine. The performance belongs equally to him and all his wonderful crew, who I am proud to call friends, as I admire them enormously. May I say, I am particularly proud to be nominated as a supporting actor, as I find the level of supporting acting in films these days utterly convincing and very often extremely moving, even the smallest parts.
Reprising his acclaimed role from Rocky nearly thirty years later in Creed, Sylvester Stallone earned his a Best Supporting Actor nod. Stallone, who was nominated for Best Actor in 1977 and took home the Best Picture award, said in a statement, “I am incredibly humbled by this honor. I was not expecting it…especially at this time in my life.  I am certainly grateful to the artists and collaborators who helped make it possible.
Phyllis Nagy, nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay for Carol, expressed:
I am humbled and thrilled by the Academy’s nomination, and for the recognition of the work of so many of my Carol collaborators. It’s the stuff of dreams, for sure, and I certainly never imagined this happening when I began this journey 18 years ago. I am so proud that Patricia Highsmith’s groundbreaking novel has also been saluted. I know my friend Pat is knocking back a few neat scotches in writer’s heaven. The Weinstein Company, Liz Karlsen, Stephen Woolley, Christine Vachon, Film 4 and Todd Haynes allowed all of this to happen, and I am profoundly grateful to them.
