 House Pixar has made a lot of films that tugged at our emotions and (hopefully) made us better at feeling things.
Its latest movie should be no different. On Thursday, the world got a first look at Inside Out.

The premise will make you flash that sweet smile of yours: a young girl moves from the Midwest to San Francisco so her dad can start a new job. Her emotions guide her as she adjusts to her new surroundings. That’s where Inside Out begins: inside the little girl’s mind.
