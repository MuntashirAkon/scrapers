 Perhaps Walter White should make a stop by Downton when Breaking Bad wraps for good this year.
On Saturday, Downton Abbey cast members Phyllis Logan (Mrs. Hughes), Sophie McShera (Daisy), Amy Nuttal (Ethel) and Allen Leech (Tom Branson) hit the red carpet at the 2013 Screen Actors Guild Awards, and found themselves in awe of the star-studded spectacle.
“Trying to be cool and not look star-struck is so hard,” Nuttal told Celebuzz, noting that she was excited to see Breaking Bad stars Aaron Paul and Bryan Cranston.
“Jennifer Garner, I have a huge crush on her. Huge. She’s amazing.”
“Some of the Mad Men [too],” added McShera.

Leech, who let the ladies do most of the talking, made fun of his own silence on Sunday.

“You have to wear a dress to have a comment. Unfortunately, I left mine at home . . . I’m only kidding.”
What Leech did dish on was the upcoming Matthew Crawley-less season four. (Dan Stevens announced his exit late last year).
“We start back on the 11th of February. We read the first two scripts . . . very exciting,” said Leech.
