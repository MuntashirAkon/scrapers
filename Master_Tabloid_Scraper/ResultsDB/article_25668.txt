Nebraska Hospital Organizes Special 71st Anniversary Celebration for Elderly Patients/n
Gerard and Phyllis Gottula probably didn’t dream of spending their 71st wedding anniversary in a hospital, but a group of Nebraska nurses made the day one to remember.  
Last week, Julie Gottula posted a photo on CHI Health Bergan Mercy Hospital’s Facebook page showing her mother and father sharing a fancy meal in the Omaha hospital.  
“Both parents in the same hospital on their 71st Anniversary,” she captioned the photo. “Some wonderful people at CHI Bergan Mercy helped make it a special evening. A big thank you to all who had a hand in this and getting all the approvals knowing this was a very special day.”  
Gottula continued: “The look on my parents faces was priceless when they saw the special meal that was prepared for them. Smiles from ear to ear feeling very special. You pulled off something with such short notice since our mother was just admitted that morning. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for the wonderful thought and actions!!!”
