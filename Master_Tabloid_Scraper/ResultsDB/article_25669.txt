Inside Out and The Office Star Phyllis Smith's Secret to Success? 'I'm a Normal Person'/n
Best known as sweet-but-spiky sales rep Phyllis on The Office, Phyllis Smith steals the show as the character Sadness in the hit Disney/Pixar movie Inside Out. For her, the best way to stay humble in Hollywood is to head on home.  
 “My family in St. Louis brings me to my roots,” the actress tells PEOPLE. “You should see me in the backyard, I walk around in my nightgown! I’m just a normal person, believe me.”   
 Smith, 63, currently divides her time between L.A. and St. Louis, where she grew up.  
 “I travel back and forth once or twice a month,” says Smith. “When I’m home I go back to the same routine that I’ve had since I was a kid. I don’t feel like I have to look good.”

In Inside Out, released on June 19, Smith lends her voice to an emotion that is very important to acknowledge, says the actress.    
 Sadness is “a true emotion,” says Smith. “Life is not all a bowl of cherries. There are days when you aren’t going to feel up to par. And it’s healthy to see it in yourself, and to ask, ‘Hey, what’s going on?’ ”   
 Smith says she is thankful that her work for the movie coincided with the final days of filming The Office two years ago.   
 “The cast grew up together, it was almost nine years of our lives. It was tough,” she says. “I really felt, like, this empty sense of, okay, now what? Luckily I had other projects; I was working on the movie at the time.”  
 When asked what her character from The Office might be doing now, Smith smiles.  
 “She’s probably sitting back, still reading Fifty Shades of Grey, and getting ready for the DVD of Inside Out to come out!”
