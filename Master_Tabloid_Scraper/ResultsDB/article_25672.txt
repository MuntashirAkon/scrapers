Adam Arkin and Phyllis Lyons to Divorce/n
Sons of Anarchy star Adam Arkin is heading for divorce court.   
His wife of nearly 14 years, Phyllis Lyons, has filed divorce documents in L.A. County Superior Court, citing irreconcilable differences.  
The couple, who wed Aug. 21, 1998, are parents to a son, Emmet. Lyons, 52, has filed for joint physical and legal custody of the 8-year-old boy.  
They reportedly split on Monday, and Lyons, an actress best known for her role on All My Children, has filed to block the court from awarding spousal support to Arkin, 56, well-known from his Chicago Hope days and range of TV and movie roles. She also asks that Arkin pay the attorney fees and costs, with property rights to be determined.  
Prior to Lyons, he was married to Linda Arkin.
