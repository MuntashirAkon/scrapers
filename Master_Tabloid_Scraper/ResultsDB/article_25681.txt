Phyllis Diller is gone but certainly not forgotten.The 95-year-old comic legend died Monday morning, and her famous friends and fans were quick to honor the late, great star."I'm beyond saddened by the death of Phyllis Diller," Joan Rivers said in a statement. "We were friends—Melissa and I had a wonderful time with her at lunch just a month ago. The only tragedy is that she was the last from an era that insisted a woman had to look funny in order to be funny. If she had started today, Phyllis could have stood there in Dior and Harry Winston and become the major star that she was. I adored her."

Barbra Streisand said, "I adored her. She was a wondrous spirit who was great to me."Rosie O'Donnell posted a recent picture of herself and Diller on her blog, adding simply, "what a joy she was""Gonna miss Phyllis Diller. Rest in peace my friend," tweeted Reba McEntire. "The world is a better place because of you. Happy Trails."

"A true original has died," wrote Whoopi Goldberg. "Phyllis Diller There was NOOne like her, no 1looked like her sounded like her. A FUNNY FUNNY. Classy& Smart RIP""We lost a comedy legend today. Phyllis Diller was the queen of the one-liners. She was a pioneer," tweeted Ellen DeGeneres."RIP Phyllis Diller. Comedy legend. Always made me laugh," wrote Jim Gaffigan. She will certainly be missed.
