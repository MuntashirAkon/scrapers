Will O.J. Simpson finally be a free man?
The disgraced football star is appearing before the Nevada Board of Parole via satellite from the Lovelock Prison on Thursday, July 20, 2017 at 1 P.M. ET asking to be released from lockup after serving nine years behind bars and RadarOnline.com will be livestreaming the proceedings.
Orenthal James Simpson was arrested in 2007 for felony armed robbery and kidnapping after he and group of men stole some of his sport memorabilia at gunpoint in a Las Vegas hotel room. He was found guilty and sentenced to 33 years in prison in 2008, with the possibility of parole in nine years.

Inmate No. 1027820 at Lovelock Correctional Facility in Nevada will have a hearing on Thursday and the four-member board will deliberate in private and then vote in public if he should be released from prison.
The only people allowed to speak during the hearing will be victims, direct family members of victims, Simpson, and his representatives.
The four members must unanimously agree to release Simpson and if they do he could be set free from prison in October, 22 years after being found not guilty for the murder of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman.

O.J.’s late ex-wife and Ronald were found brutally slaughtered outside Nicole’s Brentwood condo, with her head almost completely severed from her body. The Juice was arrested and tried for the murders but a Los Angeles jury found him not guilty after a 10 ½ month trial on October 3, 1995.
The former USC football star was defended by a legal dream team including Robert Kardashian and Johnny Cochran, who stunned the country when he had Simpson try on the gloves the prosecutor claimed he was wearing when he killed Brown Simpson and Goldman. Simpson couldn’t get them on, saying “they don’t fit,” and Cochran told the jury “if the gloves don’t fit, you must acquit.”
Simpson’s parole board hearing cameras will begin to broadcast at 12 noon E.T. and Radar will be livestreaming the proceedings.
