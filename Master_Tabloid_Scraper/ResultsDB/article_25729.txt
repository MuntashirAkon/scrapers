“He could always change his mind, but as of now, he’s not expected to attend,” the source said.
Another source revealed that the on-off couple split for the umpteenth time this week.
“They broke up again, but Amber has a hard time saying no to him,” the friend said. “She knows he has nowhere to go if she kicks him out.”

In a puzzling quickie romance, Baier moved from his native Massachusetts to be with Portwood in Indiana after meeting online in 2014. They got engaged just a few months after meeting in person.
Radar revealed earlier this month that Portwood dumped Baier after he failed a lie detector test over rumors had had cheated.

They patched things up, and even began talks to star in a sex tape with Vivid Entertainment.
But it seems Portwood just can’t get over Baier’s alleged infidelities and lies.
As Radar exclusively reported, Baier told his girlfriend that he was a father of two, but in actuality, he fathered at least nine secret children with various women. Five of the mothers sued him for unpaid child support, though the cases were ultimately dropped.
He also told her he had never watched Teen Mom before, but in reality, he hit on costar and nemesis Farrah Abraham, 26, via Twitter first.
