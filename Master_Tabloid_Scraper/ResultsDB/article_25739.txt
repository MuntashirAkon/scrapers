Teen Mom OG's Amber Portwood & Fiancé Matt Baier Are Reportedly Marriage Boot Camp Bound!/n

Of course they are…
Things have been pretty rocky between Amber Portwood and her fiancé Matt Baier for a while now. In case you forgot, the Teen Mom OG starlet pulled the plug on her wedding to the Massachusetts native after he gave her costar Catelynn Lowell a Xanax. As seen in Monday's episode, this fact upset the young mom as Baier was clearly lying about his sobriety.

Not to mention, Matt had also previously lashed out at Amber after she refused his proposal to elope. It wasn't until well after these incidences were filmed that the author revealed he had relapsed. So it's no wonder reports are now claiming the twosome are joining WeTV's upcoming season of Marriage Boot Camp.
On top of the couple's existing issues, we're not shocked the duo are heading to Boot Camp as the mother-of-one teased the new gig on Instagram on Sunday. During a post to her story, the MTV celeb revealed she'd be  working in El Lay for the next 18 days. Hmmmm.
Also, a source dished to Us Weekly:

"Matt and Amber are still together and still living together. They're trying to work things out."
Sounds like they'll be perfect contestants for MBC. Amber and Matt aren't the first pair from the Teen Mom franchise to appear on Boot Camp as Kailyn Lowry and Javi Marroquin previously appeared on the program. Oh, and Amber's nemesis Farrah Abraham is currently starring on the Family Edition of the show alongside her parents, Debra and Michael.
We're sure this news will inspire Miz Abraham to, once again, call out Gary Shirley's ex for copying her. LOLz!
