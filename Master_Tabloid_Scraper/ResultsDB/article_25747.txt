Amber Portman revealed she’s leaving Teen Mom OG over a lack of respect following her fight with Farrah Abraham.
The reality star made the announcement on her social media accounts on Thursday (Dec. 15, 2016), explaining why she’s leaving the series. Obviously, her decision has to do with the epic reunion fight which resulted into a physical altercation.

“I’ll be leaving #teenmomog sadly. The lack of respect is too much anymore! But still sending all my love!” Portwood, 26, wrote on Instagram.

However, it didn’t end there. She also went on a little rant on Twitter.

If I was treated fairly it wouldn't be an issue but it's been nothing but disrespect since the reunion show. Which keeps continuing today.

Nothing has been dealt with or has made me feel any safer to even move on with people who have continuously hidden things from the network.

The day I'm shown some respect by the people I've worked with for 8 years is the day I'll be back. I've sacrificed a lot for this show. @MTV

Of course, she’s referring to her fight with Abraham, whom Portwood took a swing at on stage after she implied her’s fiancé, Matt Baier, is a “pedophile.”
Whether or not Portwood is really done with the show is uncertain, but we’re very sure MTV will do whatever they can to keep her on. Viewers love the drama.
