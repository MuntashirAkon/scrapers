Australian actress Melissa George was taken to the hospital with bruises on her face after she was allegedly assaulted by her longtime partner and the father of her two children, Jean David Blanc.

The former Grey’s Anatomy star, who lives in Paris with Blanc, showed up at a police station around 3 a.m. on Wednesday (Sept. 7, 2016) with noticeable facial injuries, according to French website Purepeople. After noting some pain and nausea, George, 40, was escorted to Cochin Hospital for treatment.
George also reportedly told authorities that Blanc, 38, had attacked and physically abused her.
“According to statements by the actress … she was assaulted by her companion, also father of their two children,” French news site M6info reported. “The police were called last night to intervene in the centre of Paris. In shock, Melissa George, had a swelling of the face and complained of pain, nausea and dizziness.”
So far, there have been no reports that charges have been made against Blanc.
Blanc, a French businessman and the founder of AlloCiné, started dating George in 2012 after meeting her at a BAFTA after-party the year prior. They currently share two sons: Raphaël, 2, and Solal, 10 months.
