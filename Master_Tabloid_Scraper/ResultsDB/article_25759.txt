Shirley Temple's Birthday Blues/n
It's her party and she'll cry if she wants to. And Shirley Temple Black wants to.              Black--forever the singing, dancing moppet of the 1930s--improbably turns 70 Thursday, and she's none too pleased.              However, it's not becoming a septuagenarian that's irking the curly-tressed child star turned diplomat. No, she's peeved at the studio that she made famous.              To celebrate the "70th birthday of America's favorite sweetheart," 20th Century Fox is releasing a video Tuesday called Shirley Temple--Sing and Dance Along. The video features some of Shirley's signature numbers, including "I Love to Dance in the Rain" with Bill "Bojangles" Robinson, culled from flicks like The Little Colonel, Curly Top and Poor Little Rich Girl.              You'd think a retrospective project would be a flattering b-day gift, but for Black, this isn't exactly a cruise on the Good Ship Lollipop. Why? She's not getting "a dime" from Fox, she says--she hasn't even seen the video.              A Fox Home Entertainment spokesperson says the company didn't need Black's okay for the project.              Guess they're not sending a card, either.
