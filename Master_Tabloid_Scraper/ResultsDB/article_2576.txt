Hunting Down Angie? Johnny Depp Ditches U.S. for U.K./n
Johnny Depp is ditching the US for the UK, an insider told RadarOnline.com.
According to an insider, the newly single star is looking for a new home in the U.K. before he begins filming the Fantastic Beasts sequel in September.
“Johnny’s filming schedule is pretty much keeping him in Europe for most of the year and he wants to find a base that’s comfortable,” an insider told Radar.

But the move is also fueling rumors that Depp, 53, and Murder on the Orient Express costar Lucy Boynton, 23, are more than just friends. What’s more, Angelina Jolie recently jumped across the pond to pursue a guest lecturer position at the London School of Economics.
Life stateside has been pretty pricey lately for Depp, with ex-business managers claiming his spending is out of control.
As Radar reported, Depp filed a lawsuit against his former longtime business managers, the Mandel Company, alleging fraud and other offenses, and asking for $25 million in damages. They said in return that he needs to get his spending in check.

In any case, after a string of box office failures and an embarrassing split from Amber Heard last year, Depp needs the Beasts sequel to once again establish him as one of Hollywood’s go-to stars.
“Johnny will be the top-billed actor in the next movie so a lot will be riding on his shoulders,” the source said. “He wants to be settled in the UK by the time cameras start rolling and he’s looking around where the Clooney’s have bought.”
