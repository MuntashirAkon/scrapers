Don't Call This Epic Gross, Shirley/n
Spoof comedies don't win Oscar gold. They just make lots of box-office green.Epic Movie, the latest heir to the Airplane! throne, scammed $18.6 million in its debut weekend, per Exhibitor Relations, topping all comers, including freshly minted Academy Award contenders such as Dreamgirls.Overall, the box office was down nearly 9 percent from the same weekend last year. One reason: Epic Movie was big, but Big Momma's House 2 was bigger.The box-office benchmark for spoof comedies remains Scary Movie 3, which opened with $48.1 million in 2003, per Box Office Mojo. Epic Movie's opening is more in line with Date Movie's. The latter grossed $19.1 million in its debut weekend last February. In a roundabout way, Epic Movie, a send-up of super-sized cinematic tales from Titanic to, um, Nacho Libre, can trace its lineage all the way back to the mother of all hit spoof comedies, 1980's Airplane! That's because Epic Movie was written, in part, by writers who worked on the Scary Movie franchise, the two most recent installments of which were directed by David Zucker, who helped helm Airplane!, not to mention its cult-classic predecessor, Kentucky Fried Movie. Smokin' Aces doesn't share any bloodlines with Ted Striker, et al., but still managed to acquit itself nicely in its opening weekend. The R-rated crime drama, made for an estimated $17 million, collared $14.6 million, which was good for second place.According to Box Office Mojo stats, Smokin' Aces is star Ben Affleck's biggest debut weekend in four long years, although it's not nearly as big as his last truly big debut—Daredevil's $40.3 million in 2003.Affleck's wife, Jennifer Garner, was not 13 Going on 30 in her new comedy-drama Catch and Release, which only snagged a so-so $7.7 million (fifth place).Dreamgirls has a bigger tale of woe. First, it didn't get a Best Picture Oscar nomination. Then, it didn't get an Oscar bounce at the box office. In the wake of its field-best eight nominations (and giant-size snub), the musical's ticket sales fell 16 percent, down to $6.7 million (sixth place; $86.8 million overall).The Departed, which did get a Best Picture nod, got an Oscar bounce, and then some—up 1,015 percent from the previous weekend, thanks to its $3.4 million take ($125.2 overall) and 1,300-plus additional screens.The Queen was the highest grossing Best Picture hopeful, with an estimated $4 million (ninth place, $41.3 million overall).Fellow Best Picture nominee Little Miss Sunshine got its Oscar bounce in the form of a 100 percent increase in DVD shipments, Fox Searchlight said Sunday. The comedy was released on home video last Dec. 19.Elsewhere, The Hitcher ($3.6 million; 10th place; $13.4 million overall) was stranded by moviegoers in its second weekend, while Freedom Writers ($3.5 million; $31.3 million overall) and Children of Men ($2.2 million; $30.9 million overall) both fell out of the top 10.Here's a rundown of the top-grossing weekend films based on final studio figures compiled by Exhibitor Relations:1.
