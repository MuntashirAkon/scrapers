J.R. Smith's First Photo Home After Leaving NICU With Preemie Daughter/nJ.R. Smith had a helluva day Tuesday ... taking his baby, Dakota, home and winning a playoff game ... and now we have the first photo of daddy and daughter at home. As we previously reported, Smith and his wife, Shirley, took Kota home yesterday after a miracle 4 month stay in the hospital. Kota was born in January at only 21 gestational weeks ... and many  "experts " thought survival was virtually impossible. They were wrong. Kota's home, and J.R.'s 1 win away from the NBA Finals. It's good to be J.R. Smith./n
