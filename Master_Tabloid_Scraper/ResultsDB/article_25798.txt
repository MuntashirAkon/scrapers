From A Cinderella Story To Wet Hot American Summer — Here's Everything Coming (And Going) On Netflix Next Month!/n

Nothing beats the summer heat like staying indoors. And just in case you were running out of excuses to stay clung to the AC, Netflix is providing yet another month's worth of binge-worthy entertainment!
On Monday, the streaming service announced which movie and TV titles would be coming and going in August, and this might just be the best trade off yet.
Viewers have to say goodbye to the Hilary Duff classic The Lizzie McGuire Movie on August 1, though you won't have to go through Duff-withdrawals — Netflix will be rolling out A Cinderella Story the very same day!
