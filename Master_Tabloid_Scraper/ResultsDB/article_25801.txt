John Legend is close to making history.

The “All of Me” singer became only one award away from achieving an EGOT — winning an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar, and a Tony — when he won Best Revival of a Play at the 2017 Tony Award Sunday night (June 11, 2017). As the co-producer of Jitney, the 38-year-old was on hand to receive the prize.
Chrissy Teigen quickly gushed about her husband almost hitting major career milestone, writing on Twitter, “John won a Tony!!! He has a GOT!”

John, a 10-time Grammy winner since 2006, scored his first Oscar in 2015 when he won Best Original Song for Selma’s “Glory.”
If the musician manages to win an Emmy this year, he will join Audrey Hepburn and Whoopi Goldberg as the the 13th person to have received all four awards. For now, he’s in the company of Cher, Kate Winslet, Viola Davis, Al Pacino, Helen Mirren, and Jessica Lange as stars who are one award away from a complete EGOT.
However, John’s going to have to work a little harder for that Emmy. The TV series he produces, WGN America’s Underground, was recently canceled after two seasons.
