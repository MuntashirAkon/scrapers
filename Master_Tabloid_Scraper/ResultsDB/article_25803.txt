Beyoncé announced her “Formation Scholars’ program on the one-year anniversary of her latest album, Lemonade.

The scholarship program, which will launch for the 2017-2018 school year, aims to “encourage and support young women who are unafraid to think outside the box and are bold, conscious and confident,” according to the official statement on her website.
Scholarships will be awarded to four incoming, current, or graduate female students pursuing studies in creative arts, music, literature, or African-American studies at Berklee College of Music, Howard University, Parsons School of Design and Spelman college. The scholarships will be divided equally across the four colleges, meaning that one will be issued through each school.
Details and further information about application deadlines are available through the participating schools.

Beyoncé recently received a Peabody Award for Lemonade. A statement from the Peabody Awards Board of Jurors praised the album, saying, “the audacity of its reach and fierceness of its vision challenges our cultural imagination while crafting a stunning and sublime masterpiece about the lives of women of color and the bonds of friendship seldom seen or heard in American popular culture.”
