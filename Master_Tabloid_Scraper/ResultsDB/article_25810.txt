Michael Bublé is focusing solely on his son Noah”s recovery, the singer’s friend and producer David Foster told Entertainment Tonight Canada in an interview.

Three-year-old Noah was diagnosed with liver cancer last week. Foster said that Bublé and his wife, Luisana Lopilato, are dedicating all their time to their son’s treatment right now.
Though fans have offered support on social media, Foster said, “Michael right now is in a huge bubble, as you would expect when this happens… I don’t think he’s looking at social media right now.” Foster did assure fans that Bublé feels their love.
Foster also mentioned that Revlon’s Ron Perelman and actress Marlo Thomas have reached out, offering help for the family.
He also reports that things are looking good for Noah. “He’s in good shape. He’s got good doctors around him. We will hope and pray for a good outcome, which I believe that they will have.”

US Weekly reports that the boy’s aunt spoke to an Argentinian magazine describing Noah as “a warrior.” The magazine says Noah will undergo chemotherapy for four months, which gives him a 90 percent chance of beating cancer.
