A marriage maybe over but this family looks stronger than ever!

This week, Drew Barrymore appeared with her ex-father-in-law Arie Kopelman at Advertising Week in New York after finalizing her divorce to his son Will Kopelman in April.
Although a few barbed jokes were lobbed, the two made nice for the event. At one point, Arie jokingly commented that he’s not receiving royalties for helping Barrymore put together the packaging for her cosmetics company, Flower Beauty. The daughter of Hollywood royalty had the perfect response:
“I gave you two granddaughters,” Barrymore said, according to People. “And they love their poppy.”

But she didn’t stop there. Barrymore went on say Kopelman was a terrific grandfather to his granddaughters Olive, 3, and Frankie, 2.
“He’s the grandfather of all grandfathers,” she gushed. “He always says there’s nothing overrated about being a grandparent and he is the ultimate grandparent.”
But, despite their friendly rapport, Kopelman had more zinger up his sleeve for his ex-daughter-in-law.
“And you know the old joke, why are grandparents and grandchildren so close? They have a common enemy,” he said before adding, “Just kidding.”
