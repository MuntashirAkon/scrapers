 Police Report Reveals New Details In Bobbi Kristina Brown's Tragic Bathtub Accident—She's.../n
Roswell, Georgia, police were originally called out for a “drowning” at the home of Bobbi Kristina Brown, RadarOnline.com can reveal after obtaining the police report for the tragedy.
The two-page document, dated Saturday, January 31, shows that Whitney Houston’s daughter was found unconscious in a bathtub at her home.

The report shows that when Brown’s lifeless body was found in her townhouse there were two other people present: Brown’s husband, Nick Gordon, 25, and the couple’s friend, Max Byron Lomas.
However, police refused to release more information while the case is still under investigation.
As RadarOnline.com reported, 21-year-old Brown remains in an induced coma at North Fulton Hospital, where family, including Bobby Brown, is by the aspiring singer’s side. “Please pray for Krissy, that is what is needed right now,” Maxine Gordon, the grandma of Brown’s husband, told Radar exclusively.

The Houston family has also released a statement: “Bobbi Kristina is fighting for her life and is surrounded by immediate family,” they said on Monday afternoon. “As her father already stated, we are asking you to honor our request for privacy during this difficult time. Thank you for your prayers, well wishes, and we greatly appreciate your continued support.”
The tragic events are unfolding nearly three years after Brown’s superstar mother’s Feb. 11, 2012, death at 48, in a bathtub at the Beverly Hilton. /n
