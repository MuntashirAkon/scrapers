Nick’s grandmother refused to address reports that cops are conducting a homicide investigation, or Nick’s ongoing tensions with Bobby Brown.
According to reports, the former New Edition singer remains “inconsolable” as his 21-year-old daughter clings to life on a ventilator, reportedly brain dead after being found unresponsive on Saturday in her bathtub.
“This is his worst nightmare: Losing Whitney [Houston] was hard, but this is a million times worse, and to lose her in the same way would devastate him,” a family source told People Sunday.
The tragic twist of fate comes nearly three years after her mother’s Feb. 11, 2012, death at 48, in a bathtub at the Beverly Hilton. /n
