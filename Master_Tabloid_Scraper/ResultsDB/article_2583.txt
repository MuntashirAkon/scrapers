Paula Deen fired her social media manager Tuesday, after a post featuring the chef’s son’s face painted brown went viral, spurring yet another racial controversy.

The 68-year-old extended her “apologizes to all who were offended” by the I Love Lucy-themed shot, which she said was taken on Halloween four years ago for Paula’s Best Dishes, one of her now-canceled Food Network shows.
The image — featuring her son Bobby with brown makeup to resemble Desi Arnaz‘s Ricky Ricardo character — was posted to Facebook and Twitter with the caption: “Lucyyyyyyy! You got a lot of esplainin’ to do! #TransformationTuesday.”

Since leaving cable in 2013, Deen has opened a large restaurant in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, and started a website called the Paula Deen Network.
RadarOnline.com has been on the forefront reporting revelations linked to Deen’s downfall dating back to 2012, from the initial accusations of her bigoted statements; to her grovel-filled, inept handling of the career crisis; to a string of embarrassing incidents over the past two years. /n
