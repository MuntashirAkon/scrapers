This is not the first time Bale has dramatically changed his looks for a film – he bulked up for the Dark Knight trilogy, and he also famously dropped a massive amount of weight to play emaciated insomniac Trevor Reznik in 2004’s The Machinist and also for his role as drug-addicted retired boxer Dicky Eklund in 2010’s The Fighter, which won him an Oscar for best supporting actor. /n
