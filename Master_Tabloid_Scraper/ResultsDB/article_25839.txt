Hillary Clinton Accuses The White House Of 'Everyday Sexism' In Fiery New Speech!/n

Our champion is officially back in action!!
Hillary Clinton gave an inspiring speech at the Professional Women's Conference in San Francisco on Tuesday — and it was everything we needed (aside from her being in the White House)!
Taking aim at White House press secretary Sean Spicer and Fox News host Bill O'Reilly for their recent derogatory comments against April Ryan and Maxine Waters, two prominent African-American women — Miz Clinton labeled the men's actions as "everyday sexism."

ICYMI, Spicer told Ryan to "stop shaking her head" during a briefing, while O'Reilly said the 78-year-old California congresswoman's hair looks like "James Brown's wig."
The longtime politician responded: 
"Just look at all that has happened in the last few days to women who were simply doing their jobs. April Ryan, a respected journalist with unrivaled integrity, was doing her job just this afternoon in the White House press room, when she was patronized and cut off trying to ask a question. One of your own California congresswomen, Maxine Waters, was taunted with a racist joke about her hair."
Hillary went on to address the discrimination women — especially women of color — face in the workplace, and now more so than ever, in the White House.
We highly recommend watching the full fiery speech where she slams Donald Trump's failed healthcare bill (below)!!
