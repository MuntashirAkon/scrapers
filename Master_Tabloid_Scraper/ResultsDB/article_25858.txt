The Mentalist's Maxine Bahns Welcomes a Girl/n
Maxine Bahns, who plays Simon Baker’s wife on the CBS drama The Mentalist, has given birth to a daughter, the actress’s rep tells PEOPLE exclusively.  
Bahns and her husband, professional adventure racer Patrick Watson, welcomed Madison Rose Watson on Sunday at 1:50 p.m. in Santa Monica, Calif. The girl weighed 6 lbs. 2 oz. and was 19 1/4 inches long.  
“Madison is doing great and the happy parents are excited to bring her into their home,” says spokesperson Jerry Shandrew. 
As for the baby’s name? “I love the nickname Maddie,” Bahns told PEOPLE earlier this year. “And my husband’s mom’s name is Rosemary, so we wanted to honor her by giving our daughter the name Rose.”  
An accomplished tri-athlete who has competed in the Hawaiian Iron Man Championships, Bahns is planning to get back in shape by competing in a Half Iron Man competition in July.     
Bahns, 40, and Watson, 39, were married in October 2007.
