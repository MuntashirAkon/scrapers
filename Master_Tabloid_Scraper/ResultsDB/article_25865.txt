The show is hilarious!"The headfirst dive back into his lucrative Madea franchise comes on the heels of his mom, Willie Maxine Perry's death in early December, which Perry addresses in his announcement.

"My mother was the apple of my eye, so this has been difficult to say the least," reads the emotional statement. "I am so glad I have decided to go out on tour. You can't imagine how much I need to be in front of the people right now."Perry's first Madea stage show in five years debuts Jan. 4 in Texas, with several more shows popping up throughout the nation.
