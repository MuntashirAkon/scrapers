En Vogue -- Legal War Settled ... Losers Stripped of Name/nOnly two of the original four members can still call themselves  "En Vogue " ... and the other two can go pound sand ... this according to a judge. According to legal docs, a judge granted  "EV " founding members Cindy Herron and Terry Ellis the exclusive right to use the name  "En Vogue " while performing and touring ... after a long, drawn-out legal battle with former bandmates Maxine Jones and Dawn Robinson﻿.Here's what happened ... Cindy and Terry sued Maxine and Dawn for the name plus $1 MILLION in damages back in 2012. They claimed M & D were illegally touring under the  "EV " name after the band broke up ... but had no right, since C&T owned the LLC. The judge recently sided with Cindy and Terry -- giving them the name -- but said the duo failed to prove damages, and were awarded no money. Still a pretty big victory ... even more so if it was 1992.Although Dawn Robinson was named in legal documents as a defendant in the case -- her rep tells TMZ ... Dawn was not involved in the dispute, and says she gave up the legal right to use the name En Vogue several years ago./n
