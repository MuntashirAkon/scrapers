Widow Of Robin Williams 'Forced Into' Estate Battle With Stepkids/n
Robin Williams‘ widow Susan Williams said she was “forced into” an estate battle with her stepchildren, after the initial terms presented to her didn’t leave any other choice.
“I was forced into it, basically,” Susan told Good Morning America Tuesday of the estate battle with the three children, Zak, Zelda and Cody Williams. “Two-and-a-half weeks after Robin had left, I was still in shock. Not back in our home.

“I was told that I might not be able to keep our wedding gifts, that in fact, ‘While you’re out and out of the house, we need to come in and take everything out [and] eventually, once we’ve gone through it all, you tell us which items are yours and we’ll decide whether or not that’s true,'” she said.
The late star’s widow said that she would “never forget being on the phone with one of the trustees and asking, ‘What is this? I know Robin Williams is famous … he’s my husband … if we’re talking that, you think everything is memorabilia, then take me, he’s touched me! Where does this end?'”
After the dispute was settled last month, Susan said that she received “basically what my husband wanted, which is that I can live in the home until I die.”

Asked how she’s coping more than a year since the actor’s Aug. 14, 2014 suicide, Susan — who broke her silence about the star’s health downturn earlier this week — said she’s slowly getting stronger to deal with the fallout as time goes on.
“It’s not that the wounds go away, it’s not that the pain goes away, it’s that you get stronger,” she said. “I just keep doing the things that work. Robin [was] kind, quiet and sometimes funny at home. He was meditative, contemplative, intellectual and sometimes very, very funny.” /n
