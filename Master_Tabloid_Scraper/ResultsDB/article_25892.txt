 Kinda hoping I fly thru that very cloud on the way home ✈️ on another note, I will be taking a break from social media in the coming weeks. It's a time better served away from the opinions or sentiments of others, and I appreciate your understanding. In my absence, I understand there will be those who wish to leave messages regarding Dad on my board, but please attempt to be respectful and kind to one another in the process, both because I will not be here to delete or mediate trolling, and because kindness is in short supply these days anyhow 😋 Thanks guys.  Buh-bye now! ❤️
