Is Tyler Posey Dating THIS Costar?!/n

Well, well, wellâ€¦ what do we have here???
Last night at Variety's Young Hollywood party, Tyler Posey couldn't help but gush about his mysterious new girlfriend while chatting with E! News â€” and we think we know just who he was talking about!
Of the blossoming romance with an unknown lady, the MTV star said:

"It's fresh. It's so fresh. It's not like a secret or anything. It's just pretty newâ€¦.[But] I'm happy."
The 25-year-old added of the person he said he met while filming a recent project:

"I really admire her. I think she's extremely talented and a great person. I'm inspired by her a lot, and she intimidates me sometimes, which I'm not really used to. I'm nervous right now talking about it. She's beautiful, really cool, has a lot of the same interests. I could go on about that, too."
So who could it be, you ask?
