When word broke out about the tragedy, Debra Messing just so happened to be participating in a campaign raising awareness for gun violence. When the actress saw the breaking news, she posted a selfie on Twitter to illustrate her point about the danger of guns.
The Will & Grace star wrote and then deleted :

Almost immediately, the 47-year-old received backlash from social media users who thought her photo was insensitive and in poor taste.
She clarified:

Take a stand. This day was predetermined as a day of awareness. Don't belittle the effort. #wecandobetter https://t.co/ufHHkeGXQX

Today we were asked to have our Voices heard. The horrendous Irony is the timing of yet another shooting. This has NOTHING to do with me.

However, the New York-native eventually apologized, and said she was horrified how her message could be seen as insulting to those affected by the shooting.
