While the exes filed to divorce in 2012, they actually separated in 2010 but continued to live together. One can assume they took on the unique living situation to care for their only son, Roman Walker.
Even though Deb's divorce has just become final, she dated her former Smash costar Will Chase for three years before splitting in 2014.
Hopefully Ms. Messing finds new love when she's ready!
