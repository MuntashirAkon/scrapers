Debra Messing Opens Up About Devastating Divorce & Raising Her Son In A Broken Home!/n

A year after removed from divorce, Debra Messing is finally able to talk about how her relationship went so horribly wrong!
After ten years of a seemingly blissful marriage, the Will & Grace star and writer Daniel Zelman called it quits and parted ways in 2012.
The hardest part for Debra, though, is how all the broken relationship affected their 9-year-old son Roman Walker Zelman.
In June's More magazine, she revealed:
"We both wanted it to last forever, and it's a sad thing that it wasn't able to go the course… Part of me will always contend with guilt that I wasn't able to give my son the fantasy that my parents were able to give me."
Aww! While the 44-year-old actress's guilt might is understandable, it is probably unwarranted.
Children are very perceptive, especially when it comes to trouble in the home. Staying together for Roman's sake could've brought disastrous consequences!
Debra continued:
"We really tried. We made sacrifices and compromises, and in the end we both realized that we like the day-to-day domestic life. Now we are co-parenting beautifully … We had Thanksgiving together. In my mind, we will be a nuclear family forever."
Yay! We're glad they're working hard to remain excellent parents!!
