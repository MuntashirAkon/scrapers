Debra Messing Finally Files For Divorce!/n

It’s off to Splitsville for one Hollywood starlet…
Looks like SMASH actress Debra Messing is getting a divorce from her hubby Daniel Zelman, citing — what else — irreconcilable differences.
The two have an 8-year-old son together, and according to documents, Debra is seeking joint custody, as well as spousal and child support.
Debra was quoted last month saying:
“I think the institution of marriage is a noble thing. I think the idea of a partner for life is incredibly romantic. But now we're living to 100. A hundred years ago, people were dying at age 37. Til death do us part was a much different deal.”

Though they got separated last year, they ended up still living with each other and supposedly, continue to get along pretty well.
The couple tied the knot back in 2000 and we wish them both the best!
At least there's always SMASH costar Will Chase…!
