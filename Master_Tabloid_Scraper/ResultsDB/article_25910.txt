Debra Messing Blames Modern Medicine For Split With Hubby!?/n

That’s a new one!!
Her show Smash is huge right now and she's in a great relationship with co-star Will Chase, but life hasn't always been quite so peachy for Debra Messing.
In a detailed interview with Ladies Home Journal, the re-emerging super-star  spoke about divorcing theater guru Daniel Zelman after their two decade relationship fell flat.
Debra suggests modern times are to blame: 
“I think the institution of marriage is a noble thing. I think the idea of a partner for life is incredibly romantic. But now we're living to 100. A hundred years ago, people were dying at age 37. Til death do us part was a much different deal.”
If only those two unfortunate souls lived 700 years ago, they might have contracted The Plague together and died in each other’s sweet embrace at the unripe young age of 19!!
How romantic!
But she's a 21st Century gal and modern times haven't been easy on Debra and her eight-year-old boy, Roman.
She describes rolling the dice on Smash with an abrupt move to NYC:
“[It was] completely traumatic. I had to find a school for my second-grader. We didn't have a home, we didn't have furniture. It was literally moving here with nothing but faith and hope.”
Score one for faith and hope because Deb's life has taken a turn for the AWESOME!
Smash has already been renewed for season two — which translates into more kiss-filled commutes for cutesy co-stars Deb & Will.
Awwww. What more could a girl want?
