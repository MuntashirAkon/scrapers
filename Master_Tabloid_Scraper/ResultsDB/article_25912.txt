Will Chase on Dating ‘Smash’ Costar Debra Messing: We’re Private/n
Smash stars Debra Messing and Will Chase have sparks on — and off — the screen. But that doesn’t mean they want us talking about it!
“My personal life is personal,” Chase, 41, says in a new interview with Rob Shuter, the celebrity columnist and host of Naughty But Nice on HDNet.
In the interview airing March 29, Will stays mum on the intimate details about his relationship with the 43-year-old actress, who split from her husband of 10 years, Daniel Zelman, last year.
But for the first time, the veteran thespian gets close to admitting he and Debra are indeed serious!
“I guess,” he says, when Shuter asked if he was close with Debra. He added, “I believe she (Debra) was always private, and I was off of the radar, so I was always private.”

Will was more willing to discuss the bare truth about another topic — stripping down in front of thousands of people during his time on Broadway in The Full Monty. He says:
There were people wearing sunglasses in the audience when we got totally naked because they were getting blinded by the backlighting and wanted to see everything. It wasn’t just creepy old men – it was middle-aged housewives. I’m not a small guy.
The full interview airs on the HDNet show Naughty But Nice with Rob Thursday’s at 8 pm.
