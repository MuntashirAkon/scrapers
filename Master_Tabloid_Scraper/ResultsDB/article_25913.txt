Jessica Simpson and her sister, Ashlee, took part in their own version of Bridesmaids, at the Parker Palm Springs on Sunday, where they took part in their friend Lauren Zelman’s wedding to actor Bret Harrison.
Of course, given that she is nine months pregnant, Jessica could only do so much as a bridesmaid; according to reports, the singer-actress had to stay seated during the ceremony.

Also in attendance were Adam Brody and Josh Schwartz of The OC, as well as Ashlee’s adorable son, Bronx, who was the ring bearer.
It’s been a busy couple of months for the ready-to-pop Jessica. In addition to promoting her new reality TV show, Fashion Star, Jess also celebrated her baby shower with friends last week. (See photos from her baby shower here!)
