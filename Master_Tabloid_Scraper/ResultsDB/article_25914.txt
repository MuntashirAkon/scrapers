Jessica Simpson isn’t letting her baby bump slow her down one bit! Sporting a silky green maternity gown, the Fashion Star mentor stepped out to attend a friend’s rehearsal dinner in Palm Springs on Friday. Jess was all smiles as she celebrated engaged pals Bret Harrison and Lauren Zelman upcoming nuptials at Las Casuelas Nuevas restaurant.
While we love this emerald color on Jessica, we’re unsure if the unstructured frock did the singer’s curvy figure justice. What do you think of her maternity gown? Cast your vote in the poll now!

Being a gentleman, Jessica’s fiance Eric Johnson was also on hand to assist the pregnant starlet as the couple walked to their car after the dinner. Jessica was also joined by little sis Ashlee Simpson and her boyfriend Vincent Piazza.

Recently, the 31-year-old refuted claims that she was carrying twins and explained the cause of her huge belly on Jimmy Kimmel Live. She told the host, “Apparently I have a lot of amniotic fluid, so whenever my water breaks it will be like a fire hydrant!”
The singer is currently expecting a baby girl. Jessica is due to give birth this spring.
