Will and Grace star Debra Messing and Daniel Zelman, her husband of 10 years, have separated US Weekly reports.
In a statement released to the magazine, they say:
“Debra Messing and Daniel Zelman privately separated earlier this year after a 10 year marriage. The decision was mutual, and they remain supportive of one another and committed to raising their son as a family.”

The couple, who were even spotted out together at a Halloween bash in October, have a 7-year-old son, Roman.
A source also told US, “They have been separated the better part of the year but continue to live together in New York for Roman. It’s very amicable.”
Debra will have work to keep her minds off of things, as she is set to star in Smash, a much anticipated NBC series about musical theater, that debuts after the Super Bowl.
