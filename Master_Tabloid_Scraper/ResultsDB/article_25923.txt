Three More Women Come Out With Sexual Assault Claims Against Bill Cosby While The Actor Reportedly Tries To Keep His 2005 Deposition Sealed/n

While it has been quiet on the Bill Cosby front recently, the sexual assault claims against the comedian just keep coming.
On Thursday, three new women gathered the courage to come out and publicly talk about their alleged encounters with the actor.
Janice Baker Kinney, Marcella Tate, and Autumn Burns held a press conference with Gloria Allred, who represents most of Cosby's accusers in this lawsuit against him.

The well known attorney revealed the timing of the announcement wasn't done at random, but it was in fact calculated to hurt The Cosby Show actor's upcoming tour shows.
She said during the press conference: 
"I hope that the public will not buy tickets to his performance and that there will be many empty seats by the end of his performance."
Every one of the women's stories are similar to past accusers, with them claiming he drugged and sexually assaulted them.
Meanwhile, Daily Mail is reporting that Bill and his legal team are doing everything they can to try and keep his 2005 deposition from his case with Andrea Constand under wraps.
Tamara Green, a woman who came out earlier with similar claims to the women above, recently filed court documents with her legal team to unseal the previously mentioned deposition.
Except the 77-year-old actor's legal team believes that the lawsuit can help Tamara's case if Cosby admitted in his deposition to sexually assaulting Andrea and other women.
And it could also help others in their lawsuit against Bill as well.
