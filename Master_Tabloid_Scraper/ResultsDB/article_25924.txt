The happy couple, Marcella and Johnny Vick, wed in Lake City, Arkansas recently - among close family and friends - to get a shot at rekindled love.
Marcella's oldest daughter revealed that her mother always talked about her teenage love: 

"I knew who Johnny Vick was way before I ever met him, so I'm not really surprised that they have ended up back together, because they apparently had a great connection back then when they were young."

One of Johnny's daughters added:

"He was so happy, you could hear it in his voice when he told me 'I have a date.' He's been like a young teenage boy out sharing his adventures with his sweetheart."
