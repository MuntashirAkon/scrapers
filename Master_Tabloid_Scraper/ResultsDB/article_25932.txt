With a show like last night's William Rast fashion event, it's no wonder Justin Timberlake topped GQ's Most Stylish Men in America list.The crooner, along with partners Trace Ayala and Marcella and Johan Lindeberg, designed the classic denim and leather looks that graced the runway last night during New York's Fall 2009 Fashion Week.In cased you missed our minute-to-minute Tweets, celebs came out in droves—GF Jessica Biel, Anthony Anderson, Emile Hirsch, Gerard Butler and Aubrey O'Day, among them—to see the collection embellished with rock-star fringe and studs."We believe that during this coming era of modern America, it is creativity that will be one of the most important ingredients to bring energy into today's culture," the one-sheet distributed on guests' chairs read. "The William Rast Fall Winter 2009 expression draws upon inspiration from the American Classic Movies of Rumble Fish and Thelma & Louise...Blended with sharp tailoring, featuring strong, confident shoulders and slimming silhouettes, the collection expresses a bold direction for New America."With such moving words and a show that appeared to go off without a hitch (not even a model trip-up), it's a shame Mr. Stylish Man USA couldn't eke out a smile.
