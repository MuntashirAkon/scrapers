Rob Kardashian shocked fans by putting baby mama Blac Chyna on blast this morning, posting explicit naked photos and accusing her of cheating and abusing drugs and alcohol. Now, the hot-tempered father, 29, is following his threats to take away their daughter, RadarOnline.com can reveal.
“Rob has hired a lawyer to go after full custody of Dream right away, because he feels she is an unfit mother,” a Kardashian family friend said.

As Radar reported, the nasty battle started  earlier today when Kardashian went on a social media rant.
After he deleted the naked pictures, he then accused Chyna, 29, of cheating on him with “20 men in one month,” as well as using drugs in front of their daughter.
