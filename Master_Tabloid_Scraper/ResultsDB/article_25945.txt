Kanye West And Jay-Z Feud Explodes!/n
Things have gone from bad to worse between Jay-Z and Kanye West.
RadarOnline.com revealed recently how Jay-Z had dissed Kanye on his new album 4:44 over a reported $20 million loan.
Now it is being reported that Kim Kardashian‘s husband has hit back by cutting ties with Tidal – the music streaming company launched by Jay-Z back in 2015.

The rapper, 40, is said to be ‘owed more more than $3 million’ from the music streaming site – with his lawyers sending a letter to the company telling them they were ‘in breach and the contact was terminated.’ 
TMZ reports that Kanye’s lawyers sent another letter two weeks after the first one after the conflict failed to be resolved.
The fight stemmed after Kanye’s Saint Pablo album brought in more than 1 million new subscribers to Tidal – which he was supposed to receive a bonus for.

The company also reportedly went back on their promise of reimbursing him for music videos – but Tidal stated that he ‘didn’t deliver the videos required by contract.’
Music giant Jay-Z has hit back after his lawyers sent a letter stating they ‘still have an exclusive contract with Kanye and if he goes to another streaming service they’d sue him.’
It now looks like the pair, who used to be close friends, are about to get embroiled in a full blown legal war over the dispute.
