Kim Zolciak and Kroy Biermann’s nightmare lawsuit is set to continue, RadarOnline.com can exclusively reveal.
Just days after the Don’t Be Tardy stars claimed their holiday decorator was wrong to sue them for $6,000 in unpaid services, a Fulton County, Georgia judge ruled that they needed to work out their differences with Seasonal Designs LLC in mediation.

Their legal troubles began in March when the suit was first filed, but they came to an explosive turn in May when Biermann, 31, was served weeks after 4-year-old Kash’s horrific dog attack.
Kim, 39, was previously sued for failing to pay her party planner after Brielle’s 11th birthday party, but the case was dismissed and settled out of court.
