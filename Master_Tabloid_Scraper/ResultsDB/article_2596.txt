Pretty Little Liars isn’t the only thing Lucy Hale is leaving behind this year.

Just weeks before her show’s finale, the actress has parted ways with musician Anthony Kalabretta, according to Entertainment Tonight. In true millennial fashion, the two appear to have unfollowed each other on social media following two years of dating and deleted photos of their time together from their respective accounts.
“She became a homebody when they were dating,” a source tells the publication. “They stayed in a lot. She really loved him.”

Hale, 27, and Kalabretta, 28, first started dating in 2015 after being introduced by a mutual friend. They were rumored to have called it quits in 2016, but Hale quickly took to Twitter to refute the “false” reports.
“I’m just always trying to surround myself with better people and be the best version of myself possible,” Hale told Byrdie earlier this month. “I know it sounds obnoxious to hear people say that, but why not?”
