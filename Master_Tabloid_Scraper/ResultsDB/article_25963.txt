Meek Mill did it for for ‘gram, and he got arrested.

The rapper was taken into police custody this week on reckless endangerment charges. He was arrested by the New York Police Department after authorities responded to a disturbance call about a group of men recklessly doing wheelies on motorcycles in the Inwood section of Manhattan. Though the group was gone by the time police arrived to the scene, Meek and his friends were identified as the culprits when he uploaded a since-deleted clip of the dangerous stunt on Instagram.
However, there is a silver lining to the story.
Via Revolt TV:
Meek Mill will not be charged with felony reckless endangerment charges following an arrest Thursday night (August 17) in New York City.
As reported by TMZ, the rapper’s lawyer, Joe Tacopina, revealed that prosecutors will not pursue felony reckless endangerment charges after he was arrested for riding dirt bikes in New York City on Wednesday night (August 16).
