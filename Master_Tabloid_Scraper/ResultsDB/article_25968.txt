Aaron Carter is on the mend in more than one way!

The singer — who was arrested last month on charges of DUI refusal, possession of marijuana less than one ounce, and possession of drug related objects — revealed he just underwent surgery for something super hush-hush. During a run-in with a TMZ tour truck in Hollywood this week, the 29-year-old got candid about secretly going under the knife following his brush with the law.
Via TMZ:

He’s mum on the medical issue — but happy to interact with everyone.
