Imagine this: You’re in London hustling through St. Pancras International Station to get to work when 10-time Grammy winner John Legend suddenly begins to perform his biggest hits in the middle of the congestion.

This scenario was a reality for commuters on Wednesday morning (Mar. 29, 2017) when Legend made it happen for Piano Day 2017. The singer teased his public appearance on Twitter by asking his followers, “Arriving at London @StPancrasInt on @EurostarUK. Do they still have that piano there?”
Legend played one of the station’s public pianos shortly after he stepped off of a Eurostar train from Paris, France. His set included “Ordinary People,” “All of Me,” and “Surefire” from his latest album, Darkness and Light. At the end of his performance, he stepped away to a waiting car and left the station.
