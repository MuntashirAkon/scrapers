Amber Rose is getting roasted by the citizens of Philadelphia after claiming that its inhabitants aren’t “aren’t traditionally attractive people.”

During an episode of Revolt TV’s “Drink Champs,” the 33-year-old model said it was “difficult” and “a blessing and a curse” to grow up in the City of Brotherly Love as a beautiful woman since her looks sparked a lot of jealousy. Needless to say, many who live in the city took offense to the remark.
Via Revolt TV:
Rose’s comments sparked multiple lines of criticism on Twitter. Some said that she is detracting from her feminist initiatives like the Slutwalk by putting down other women, while others said that her comments perpetuated issues of colorism. Many users also flatly disagreed with Rose’s assertion, saying that Philadelphia does indeed have beautiful women – including celebrities like Jill Scott, Eve, Phyllis Hyman and the late Lisa “Left Eye” Lopes of TLC.
