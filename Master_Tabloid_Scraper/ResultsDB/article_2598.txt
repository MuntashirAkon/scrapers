Paris Hilton is getting very serious Chris Zylka.

The 36-year-old heiress, whose relationship with The Leftovers actor went public just last month, already believes she’s found her soulmate. While making her way through the Los Angeles International Airport with her beau on Wednesday (March 22, 2017), Hilton confirmed Zylka, 31, is “the one” and told a photographer that her boyfriend is making plans to move into her home.
“It’s already happening,” Hilton said with a sly smile as she walked hand-in-hand with Zylka. “Stay tuned!”
Previously, Zylka dated Lucy Hale and House of DVF star Hanna Beth Merjos. He was engaged to the latter for 10 months before splitting with the fashion blogger in March 2015 over an alleged affair.
