Stallone Driven to Sue/n
Greed is a disease. Meet the cure.          Sylvester Stallone is ready to take on a different kind of enemy--his former money man.          The fading action hero has flexed his legal muscles by filing a $17 million-plus suit against his ex-business manager over the financial black hole otherwise known as Planet Hollywood.           Stallone claims he got some seriously bum advice from the accountant, who allegedly duped the actor into hanging onto his Planet Hollywood stock, even as the theme restaurant's share price tanked and the company went bankrupt.          In the lawsuit filed Thursday in Los Angeles Superior Court, Stallone accused Kenneth Starr (not the former independent prosecutor who dogged President Clinton during the Monica Lewinsky scandal) of negligence for advising the actor to keep 3.9 million shares of Planet Hollywood International stock despite Starr allegedly knowing the company's future was in jeopardy.          As a result of the poor advice received by Starr, the 55-year-old actor lost more than $10 million as Planet Hollywood spun out of control, the suit says.          According to court papers, Starr "had actual or constructive knowledge of the poor financial condition of Planet Hollywood" given his relationship with Keith Barish--a member of the company's board of directors and one of Planet Hollywood's largest investors--whom he also represented.           Of course, one of the keys to Planet Hollywood's initial success was the marquee names of its star investors. Stallone and Planet Hollywood pals Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger happily plugged the franchise and would show up at sites around the world each time a new restaurant opened.          At the time the chain went public in 1996, the share price hit a company high of $28.50 and the erstwhile star of Rocky and Rambo had stock worth an estimated $111 million--well over the amount he's earning these days for duds like Driven.          According to court papers, Barish talked Stallone into signing with Starr in 1997, as Planet Hollywood began to struggle--losing money at virtually every turn thanks to an overly aggressive expansion strategy and cuisine as lackluster as a Stallone performance--and the share price dipped to about $16.          Stallone claims he repeatedly asked Starr whether he should sell the shares--at the time worth between $60 million and $80 million--but was told not to because "he would be sending the wrong message to the market."          By October 1999, the chain filed for bankruptcy. And it wasn't until March 2000, when the stock price was worth less than a dime, that Stallone ended up cashing out his investment to the tune of $295,256.74.          In addition to the $10 million lost in the Planet Hollywood collapse, Stallone is also seeking another $7 million from Starr for allegedly failing to follow the actor's investment plans. Stallone says he gave explicit instructions to Starr to invest conservatively in low risk liquid investments as opposed to unstable high risk mutual funds, but Starr didn't.           Stallone, who finally fired Starr in 2001, seeks repayment of all his lost investment with interest, along with special damages and legal fees.           Stallone's rep did not return calls for comment.
