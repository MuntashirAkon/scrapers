Who Wants to Sue a "Millionaire"?/n
The company that insures ABC's hit Who Wants to Be a Millionaire wants out.              And that's its final answer.              London-based Goshawk Syndicate filed suit in Britain's High Court of Justice on January 24 against Buena Vista Entertainment.          It wants to end its contract with the quiz show because the questions are too easy and the company claims to be at risk of paying out too much prize money.              Under the policy, Goshawk is responsible for paying contestants who win $500,000 or $1 million on the show. ABC is responsible for the first $1.5 million; the insurance company's total losses are limited to $5 million (ABC picks up anything over the $5 mil).            So far, Millionaire has doled out nearly $10 million in prize money.         IRS worker John Carpenter, who answered all 15 of Regis Philbin's questions correctly in November, was the show's first $1 million winner. In January, a Miami attorney nabbed the top prize, as well.              The insurance company asked the Alphabet Network to increase the difficulty of the questions in December. ABC's refusal is what prompted the lawsuit. (The insurers also back the tougher, original British version of the show, which has yet to give out the grand prize.)              Goshawk is not offering any comment, but ABC reps say viewers shouldn't concern themselves with this little legal flap.              "Unquestionably, the integrity of the show is above reproach and nobody is claiming otherwise," ABC spokeswoman Julie Hoover said in a statement. "This is simply a dispute in which the company providing insurance is trying to get out of coverage on the basis of a conversation it had with a broker."              Even if the insurance company does drop the show, Millionaire is in no danger if being dropped from the network. Its three-night-per-week run has propelled ABC to become the No. 1 network on television, and the show consistently stays at the top of the Nielsen top ten.              On Tuesday, ABC announced it will air three more special editions of Millionaire during February sweeps.        In other Millionaire news, the Rosie O'Donnell secret is out. The talk show queen (and show fanatic) will be heard on Sunday's edition of the show as a "phone-a-friend." The show was taped earlier this week, and show officials have been trying to keep specifics of her involvement under wraps.        Looks like they were unsuccessful.        The New York Daily News says O'Donnell helped answer the $32,000 question: "What title was taken away from Diana when she divorced Prince Charles?"         O'Donnell's answer, "Her Royal Highness," helped the contestant proceed to the next round.
