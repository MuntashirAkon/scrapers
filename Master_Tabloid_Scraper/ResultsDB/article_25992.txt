Simpson Kids Sue Grandparents/n
It's a family feud of the Simpson kind, but this one has a sadly bizarre twist. The two young children of O.J. Simpson are suing their mother's family.        A lawyer for Sydney and Justin Simpson says Nicole Brown's parents and sisters pocketed hundreds of thousands of dollars from the sale of her wedding video, private diaries and other memorabilia to supermarket tabs and TV shows. That money, he argues, rightfully belongs to the kids.        The petition, filed by B. Wayne Hughes, the guardian of Sydney and Justin's estate, claims the children are the beneficiaries of their mother's estate. Hughes demands the Brown family repay $100,000 from the sale of Nicole's diaries and $162,500 from the sale of wedding videos and photos to A Current Affair.        The guardian seeks additional remuneration from the sale of photographs and memorabilia made by Nicole's parents, Louis and Juditha Brown, and sisters Denise, Dominique and Tanya to various media outlets. A trial is set for December.        And Hughes also is laying claim to another $6,665 of estate money Louis and Juditha Brown spent in their unsuccessful bid for custody of their grandchildren. The Browns waged a bitter, protracted legal battle with Simpson over Sydney, 12, and Justin, 9, with a judge ultimately granting the former footballer sole guardianship last December. The Browns were given visitation rights.        Two years ago, Simpson was acquitted in criminal court of the murders of his ex-wife and her friend, Ron Goldman. However, he was found liable for their deaths in civil court last June and ordered to pay the Browns and Goldmans $33.5 million in damages.
