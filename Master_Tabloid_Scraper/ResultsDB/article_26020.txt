Kidnapping Survivors Elizabeth Smart & Amanda Berry Meet For The First Time/n
Kidnapping survivors Amanda Berry and Elizabeth Smart met for the first time this week, sharing their chilling experiences on a new episode of Crime Watch Daily.
In a preview clip of their emotional interview, Smart confesses, “I have wanted to meet you for years,” before telling Berry, “You’re just my hero.”
During their tearful talk, the pair discussed the difficulties of captivity and what kept them fighting for freedom.
“There were so many days [while I was captive] that I just felt like, this is never going to end,” Smart, who was held by Brian David Mitchell and wife Wanda Barzee for nine months after being taken at age 14 from her Salt Lake City home in 2002, shared.

“Oh gosh, there was plenty of days where I felt like not going on — where I’m like, why?” Berry, who escaped captor Ariel Castro in 2013 after 10 years of captivity with two other women in his Cleveland home, replied knowingly.
“I feel like I could sum up my days in three words: boredom, abuse and rape,” Smart added. “And that was my life.”
Now, Berry, who mothered daughter Jocelyn in captivity, says she’s much more cautious.

“To this day I think I’m still not really comfortable going out a lot by myself,” she told Smart. “I don’t necessarily think that I have fears from it, but I think that I am very cautious. And when I don’t feel safe, I remove myself from that situation.”
The episode of their full sit-down airs Wednesday on Crime Watch Daily.
