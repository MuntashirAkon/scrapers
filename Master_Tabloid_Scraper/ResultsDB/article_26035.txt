Satterthwaite is currently in the midst of a nasty legal battle to try to force Jay Z to take a paternity test, but in the meantime, he hasn’t stopped his attempt to build a music career on his own.
The song, “Beautiful Girl,” is off Rymir’s first album called Rymir Is Here Volume 1.
“It was shot at the New Jersey aquarium and I chose to use this song as my first video because everyone can relate to beautiful girls all around the world,” Rymir tells Radar.
