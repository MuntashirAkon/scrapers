As Bobbi Kristina faded away Sunday, the spiritual group focused on Bible verses relevant to the situation, including Psalms 23’s “The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.”
One of the relatives said that the spirit of Bobbi Kristina’s late mother Whitney Houston was strong in the room, as she could be felt summoning her daughter to the other side.
When Bobbi Kristina died at a recorded time of 8:17 p.m. EST, the close group – who had been loyally holding vigil for Bobbi Kristina in the six months since she fell ill – was chanting the phrase “Hallelujah,” relatives told ET.
