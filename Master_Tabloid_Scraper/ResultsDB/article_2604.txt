Recently Freeform released the first teaser for the final episodes of Pretty Little Liars hinting at loads of violence, fresh accusations and more games with A.D.!

“You have ruined everything I ever had!” Spencer (Troian Bellisario) shouts at someone, who we can probably assume survived that gunshot. Aria (Lucy Hale) and Ezra’s (Ian Harding) relationship also appears to still be at a bitter standstill. But Hanna’s (Ashley Benson) lovably doofy comments just keep coming, not matter whose life is at stake!

And because this is a PLL promo, there’s also a fair amount of ominous images like doors getting pounded on, packages from A.D., phones exploding (seriously) and someone taking off their disguise.
Check out the ridiculous fun above!
Pretty Little Liars returns April 18, 2017 at 8 p.m. EST on Freeform.
