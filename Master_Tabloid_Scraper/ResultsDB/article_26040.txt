Ring The Alarm â€” Twitter Thinks Barack Obama Revealed That BeyoncÃ© & Jay Z Are Having Twin GIRLS!/n

OMGOMGOMG.
Did Barack Obama just accidentally reveal that BeyoncÃ© and Jay Z are having twin GIRLS???
We mean, these lil babes are already destined for greatness but just thinking about Queen Bey having three daughters blows our minds.
Girl group idea: Destiny's Children? Just throwing that out there.

Anywho, as you know, Jay was inducted into the Songwriters Hall Of Fame last night with a special message from POTUS44, who said: 
"Jay and I are also fools for our daughters, though he's gonna have me beat once those two twins show up. And let's face it, we both have wives who are significantly more popular than we are."
Excuse us, what was that, Barry?? Did you just say the 47-year-old artist will have *more* daughters than you after the twins will get here, meaning THREE?!
*Faints*
We all know how that Cindy Crawford debacle went! LOLz!
Anyway, we find comfort in knowing Twitter is losing their shit at the thought of this just like we are.
Ch-ch-check out the best reactions (below)!!

So BeyoncÃ© is having twin girls. Only way Jay would have Obama "beat" once they arrive. He's gonna be in trouble for spilling the beans. ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜‚ https://t.co/qDdANW4ofw

The twins are girls. Obama said Jay-Z will have him beat once the twins come. So that means the twins are both girls, right??
