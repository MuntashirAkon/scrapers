Tonight (April 25, 2015) is the annual White House Correspondents’ dinner (and 101st year of the dinner), more affectionately known as the “Nerd Prom,” and you can stream it live right here.

Saturday Night Live’s Cecily Strong will be hosting the event this year (and she’s the first woman host since Wanda Sykes in 2009, and the fifth woman ever in 101 years).

The A-list event will be attended by a number of journalists and, of course, celebs this year such as Bradley Cooper, Naya Rivera, Chrissy Teigen, Laverne Cox, Gina Rodriguez, Lucy Liu, Kerry Washington, and many more (see some highlights from the guest list down below).
Barack Obama will be making his second and last speech at the dinner as President, so surely his comedic routine will be on point as he pokes fun of his rivals and butters up the crowd with chuckles.
Live stream the event (starting at 8 p.m. EST!) here in the video below:
