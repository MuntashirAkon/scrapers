Rare Gorilla Twins Born at Volcanoes National Park in Rwanda/n
The Volcanoes National Park in Rwanda, Africa, received a double dose of cuteness on Jan. 18!
Isaro, the 16-year-old female gorilla who lives at the park,  gave birth to twins, a rare occurrence among mountain gorillas, according to the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund, which released the news.
The babies — who join siblings Keza, 6, and Icyororo, 3 — will be named at the 12th annual Kwita Izina ceremony this year, the Fund said.
Isaro, pictured with her newborns above, is taking motherhood very seriously.  Like all gorilla mothers, she is completely responsible for infant care at this stage and, despite the demands of nursing twins, she will not allow other group members to hold or assist her.
Thankfully, food is not hard to come by where they are situated, an area that is very cold and hard to reach. “Their group is settled in a place with an abundance of food—good news for a mother of #twins!” reads a message on the Fund’s Instagram page.
Sadly, Isaro and her kind are critically endangered, with less than 900 mountain gorillas left in the world.
