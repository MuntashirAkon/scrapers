Still, they both came up guilty when DeGeneres gave the next statement: "Never have I ever forgotten the name of the person I was fooling around with."

When asked if any of them have had a crush on the people sitting next to them, Arquette immediately said yes to both, while Sykes and DeGeneres slyly turned their signs to the "I Have Not" position. Sorry, David. The feelings are so not mutual.
