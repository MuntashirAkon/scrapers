Kevin Durant's Mom Went Crazy with Steph Curry's Mom After Game 3!/nKevin Durant's mother was FIRED UP after her son stuck the dagger in Cleveland Wednesday night -- and went crazy (in a good way) with Steph Curry's mom right after the game! This video is GREAT -- Wanda Durant turns to Sonya Curry and screams,  "They tried to give it to 'em but they wouldn't take it! " It's awesome. By the way, we spoke with Wanda earlier this week and she told us watching KD play now is just like when she watched him play as a kid ... same emotions. Only now, he's killin' LeBron James.Â       MAMA CURRY AND MAMA DURANT ARE HYPE A post shared by NBC SPORTS BAY AREA (@nbcsauthentic) on Jun 7, 2017 at 8:55pm PDT/n
