Kevin Durant's Mom -- Where Should KD Sign? Here's What I Think ... (VIDEO)/nWe all know ... the most important person in Kevin Durant's life is his mom -- THE REAL MVP -- so, when we saw her out in NYC Wednesday morning, we had to ask ... where should he play next season?? Of course, KD's future is a huge topic right now -- especially after Magic Johnson came out this week and said the Lakers need to go after him in a big way!  Check out the clip ... Wanda Pratt is absolutely awesome (which is probably why they're making a movie about her) -- and also reveals the best Mother's Day gift she ever got from her NBA son.  We also asked her who the real MVP is this season -- you're gonna love her answer. /n
