Derek Carr & Latavius Murray Treat Linemen to Warriors Game/nThe Oakland Raiders offensive line got a celebratory night out courtesy of their QB and RB -- with Derek Carr and Latavius Murray springin' for tickets to Monday night's Warriors game!  And talk about timing ... the game turned out to be insane -- with Klay Thompson dropping 60 points in 3 quarters.  Of course, the guys made sure to get a pic with Klay after the game. Kevin Durant's mom, Wanda, was also at the game -- and got her pic with Derek Carr ... the  "Real MVP " meeting the next NFL MVP???/n
