More Heartbreak For Tom! Hiddleston Dropped From James Bond Movie After Swift Split?/n
Tom Hiddleston can’t catch a break!
Just days after news of his split with Taylor Swift, 26, went public, the 35-year-old actor could be canned from the James Bond movie he has been gunning for.
Actor Marcus Gilbert revealed to Star that he thinks Hiddleston is “too posh” to be the next secret service agent.
“Posh actors like Tom are handsome, but they tend to lack the hardness you need,” Gilbert — a former Bond man — said.
“I’ve heard Daniel Craig has been offered an eye-watering deal to stay,” he added. “He’s better than this new wave of posh boys.”
