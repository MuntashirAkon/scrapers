'Alaskan Bush People' Star Ami Brown To End 36 Year Estrangement — ON CAMERA!/n
Ami Brown hasn’t seen her family in 36 years— but as RadarOnline.com exclusively reported, her mother is planning to reunite with her long-lost daughter in Alaska next week.
As is customary with the Alaskan Bush People clan, the meeting will take place on camera, Radar can reveal.
According to Ami’s brother, Les Branson, the reality star’s mother Earlene Branson, sister Jeana Williamson, and cousin Chuck Gilbert are flying to Alaska from their native Texas on June 28, and plan to document the life-changing experience.

Chuck will post video updates on Facebook and YouTube throughout the journey.
As Radar previously reported, Ami and her husband Billy have ignored Earlene’s calls for decades, leaving the frail 83-year-old no choice but to head north in order to see her daughter before she dies.
The Bransons last spoke with Ami just after she married Billy at 15 years old in 1979.
