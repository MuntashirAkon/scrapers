O.J. Simpson Murdered Nicole Brown Because She Came To Door With Knife, Agent Claims/n
Mike Gilbert, former agent of O.J. Simpson has dropped bombshell new claims about what really happened the night that Nicole Brown was murdered.
Not only did Simpson confess to the murder of his ex-wife and her friend Ron Goldman, but he also blamed her for her own death, Gilbert claims.

In the ESPN documentary OJ: Made In America, Gilbert says that he asked his client about what really occurred on the night of June 12, 1994. “I always thought you probably did it,” he admitted, adding that he didn’t think he’d brought a knife with him to Brown’s home.
“Yeah,” Simpson allegedly agreed. “If she wouldn’t have opened the door with a knife she’d probably still be alive.”‘
Gilbert, however, insists that he was not buying that version of events. “I believed that for the longest time… He went there to kill her.” /n
