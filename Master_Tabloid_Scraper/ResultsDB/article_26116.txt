Knife Found On O.J. Simpson Property Is NOT The Murder Weapon/n
Cops have confirmed RadarOnline.com’s report that a single blade knife allegedly found by an off-duty police officer on O.J. Simpson‘s property is not the murder weapon used to kill Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman.
LAPD traffic officer George Maycott claimed that a construction worker at Simpson’s Rockingham house gave him a single blade knife a few years after the 1994 slayings and he held onto it until this year. He turned the knife over to the authorities who tested the blade for any evidence that it was linked to the double-homicide, but according to NBC News, law enforcement sources have now decisively ruled out the knife as the murder weapon.
Two weeks ago, Radar first reported that the knife could not possibly have been the weapon that was used in the brutal killing.

“Absolutely no way this is the knife!” Mike Gilbert, Simpson’s former agent, told Radar exclusively, pointing out that the weapon that killed Brown Simpson and Goldman “was a Swiss Army knife.”
“Plus there is NO way O.J. would have left the knife there,” Gilbert explained.
“He would have told me to go and get it. He would have drawn me a map and told me where it was. He would have been so afraid while he was in jail that the LAPD would have gotten another search warrant and found it. He couldn’t have dealt with the stress of it being there. And he would have gotten rid of it after he got out.”
