Eat, Pray, Love Author Elizabeth Gilbert & Cancer-Stricken Partner Celebrate Their Love In Commitment Ceremony/n

Congratulations are in order for Elizabeth Gilbert and her partner Rayya Elias!
The Eat, Pray, Love author (unofficially) wed her longtime best friend in a "precious and perfect" commitment ceremony on Tuesday!
As you may know, last September, Gilbert left her husband of 10 years after realizing she was in love with Elias, who has been battling pancreatic and liver cancer.

And now, their love story was celebrated in a "simple and spontaneous ceremony of love, surrounded by a small handful of friends and family." Amazing!
Gilbert penned of the special occasion alongside the loving photo on Instagram (above): 
"Dear Ones: Over the last year, Rayya Elias and I have been through some really difficult days together — but not today. Today was precious and perfect. A simple and spontaneous ceremony of love, surrounded by a small handful of friends and family. Our ceremony was nothing legally binding (no need to alert the authorities, folks!)…just a quiet and private celebration of what we have long known to be true: We belong to each other."
The writer went on:
"More difficult days are to come. It doesn't get easier from here. Her illness is grave. But our love is strong. We will walk together as far as we can go together. After that, it all gets turned over to God. Create beauty with every day you are given. Onward, LG."
Are anyone else's eyes sweating???
Congrats, you two!
