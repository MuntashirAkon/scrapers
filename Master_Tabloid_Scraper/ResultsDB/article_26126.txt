Will Whoopi Goldberg Leave The View Without THESE Three Things???/n

Is Whoopi Goldberg looking for a better View??
Word is the longtime host will vacate her place at the table if her demands aren't met. And they're not small!

A source tells Dailymail.com that Whoopi is looking for three things:
First, a raise from $2 million per year to $3.5 mil. That sounds huge, but it's only halfway to the $5 mil she was getting paid just two years ago before her salary got cut.
The source says: 

"She's asking for no less than $3.5 million a year to return. She feels that she helped this show turn the corner again in the ratings and knows she plays a huge factor in its success. She wants them to pay her what she thinks she's worth, despite the fact the network is crying budget concerns."
Next, she wants an exec producer credit on the show "so that she has a seat at the decision-making table and can have more control over the things going on." Seems fair.

Finally, she's demanding the head of a specific ABC network executive! The source spills:

"She wants this one ABC executive off the show. She blames this person for trying to turn The View into Good Morning America with the rotating hosts and contributors and doesn't want that exec involved in the show any more."
Dang! ABC exec, you in danger, girl!
You may recall Whoopi announced on Wendy Williams back in September that she was probably not returning to the show for season 21.
Was that just a negotiating tactic?
We'll just have to see.
