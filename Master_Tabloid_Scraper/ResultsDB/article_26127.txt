It's being reported an eight-episode limited series revival of the hit comedy is totally happening, and cast members Roseanne Barr, John Goodman, and Sara Gilbert are going to be back!
Other cast members like Laurie Metcalf and Johnny Galecki are currently in talks, but will most likely be returning as well! Meanwhile, several networks, including ABC (where the series originally aired for nine seasons) and Netflix, are currently bidding for the rights to the project.
Can you believe it???
It's been 20 years (!!!) since the blue-collar family comedy's finale aired. The show was hailed as one of the most honest and relevant portrayals of working class families ever. And it's primed for a comeback during a time when many working class people feel underrepresented in the media.
Will YOU be watching???
