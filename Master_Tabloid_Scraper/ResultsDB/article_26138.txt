The world-famous rapper takes on the controversy.

Iggy Azalea has had a brutal 2016 thus far. She and Nick Young were plagued by infidelity rumors throughout the course of their engagement. They ultimately called off the engagement over due to Azalea’s lack of trust, and in the aftermath, a woman named Keonna Green came forward claiming she is pregnant with Young’s second child. Now the rapper is opening up to Notion magazine about not just the turmoil in her personal life, but the litany of feuds and controversies that have overshadowed her music.
“We can all see I get a lot more shit than other people in the music business, that’s not even debatable,” Azalea told the publication. “There isn’t anything awful left I haven’t heard said about me.”
But despite the endless hate she fields on social media (often fueled by her polarizing comments), she hasn’t lost the hardened determination she touts in her music.
“I’m tough and don’t like to be vulnerable even around my own mother,” she confided.

And although she’s still picking up the pieces in her personal life after a messy, public breakup, she’s got big plans for her career in the coming years.
“I would still like to get into producing movies and television series, behind the scenes and will be doing that in the next one or two years.”
