Wanting to see this ghoulish remake? Here’s all the details!

After all the press that’s come out about this new movie, the onslaught of trolls not wanting an all-female Ghostbusters and the controversy surrounding the film’s confusing first trailer, it’s hard to imagine you’re totally in the dark in terms of what this comedy spookfest has to offer. But we’d better make sure you have the basics, if for no other reason than to get you excited to head to the theater this weekend!

Who’s in it?
The new ghost-busting team is made up of Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy, Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones. But the fun doesn’t stop there! The supporting cast includes Andy Garcia, Charles Dance (Tywin Lannister, anyone?), Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Sigourney Weaver, Ozzy Osbourne. Oh, Chris Hemsworth shows up as well.

 What’s it about?
Authors Erin Gilbert (Wiig) and Abby Yates (McCarthy) join forces with nuclear engineer Jillian Holtzmann (McKinnon) and subway worker Patty Tolan (Jones) to create a team that combats the steady stream of specters taking over New York.





Why should I care?
Whether all the controversy has piqued your interest or you’re in desperate need of some feel-good nostalgia, this big-budget, star-studded, slime-covered comedy aims to deliver.
