The lovebirds, who wed in March 2014, also brought along Sara's two kids from a previous relationship, son Levi and daughter Sawyer. Perry and Gilbert doted on their son while smiling for the camera and were later seen noshing on the kid-friendly food, including grilled cheese sandwiches, french toast sticks and watermelon slices, at the event, which was held at the home of Au Fudge co-founder Estee Stanley.

Perry carried little Rhodes in a baby sling throughout the entire bash and their bundle of joy looked happier than ever, flashing a giant smile at the fellow guests. Since the birth of her son, Gilbert has kept a relatively low profile, although she and Perry recently announced their plans to release a children's album titled Deer Sounds, out Sept. 18. "These songs just started to show up when he was born and then it just got really exciting because we were all in the house and all a part of it, all throwing in ideas and making artwork," Gilbert told People. "It was a very sweet experience​."She added: "[Rhodes] would stand on the piano and make all these sounds. We put it on the album and his little voice. Everybody contributed whatever they could — such a special part of it."
