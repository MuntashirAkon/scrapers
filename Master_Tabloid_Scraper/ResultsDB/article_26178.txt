Nick Young's NBA Hazing Photo Surfaces ... Hog-Tied In Hotel Bed/nSwaggy P got the stripper treatment during his rookie hazing back in 2007 ... and Gilbert Arenas just provided the photo proof.  Nick Young was a 1st round pick of the Washington Wizards -- where Arenas was a superstar at the time.  One of the hazing rituals Young had to endure ... he was hog-tied in his hotel room surrounded by cash.  Arenas called it  "50 Shades of Nick " and added,  "Welcome to stripping game playa. " Wonder how this would go over in 2017? /n
