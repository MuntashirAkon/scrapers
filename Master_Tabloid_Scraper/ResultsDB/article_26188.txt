Seahawks' Michael Bennett -- Tom Brady's a Cheater /nNo more sugarcoating it ... Tom Brady is a cheater ... period ... so says Seattle Seahawks badass Michael Bennett.  Bennett -- one of the best defensive ends in the NFL -- played against Brady in the game AFTER the Deflategate ... and though he admits Seattle got beat fair and square in the Super Bowl, MB says there's no question Tom broke the rules in the AFC Championship.  But after that, this clip gets HILARIOUS -- here are the CliffsNotes: --  Advice for QB Russell Wilson now that he's dating Ciara? ( "Watch out for Future ") -- Favorite Leonardo DiCaprio movie of all time?( "'What's Eating Gilbert Grape' ... the one where he played like he's retarded ") -- Which celeb he thinks he looks like?( "Denzel or Will Smith ")  There's more ... it's pretty great stuff -- and props to Michael for launching a foundation to fight childhood obesity. /n
