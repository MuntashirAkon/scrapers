Kylie Jenner DOES Have A Pet Pig! Watch Her First Bonding Sesh With Baby Wilbur In This KUWTK Deleted Scene!/n

The Kardashian fam just got even bigger!
It's no secret that marrying into the Keeping Up with the Kardashians krew is the modern version of the American dream… and one lucky pig made the move from farm to table Calabasas on Tuesday.
While we had seen that Kylie Jenner was taking photos of an unknown piggy on Snapchat back in May, his status as Bambi and Norman's little brother wasn't confirmed until E! released a deleted scene of the docuseries showing Kris Jenner giving the animal to her youngest daughter as a present!

Kris temporarily named the little guy Wilbur… but we have a feeling that'll change seeing as Kylie probably doesn't understand the reference.
Unfortunately, we haven't seen the farm animal pop up on Kylie's social media in a while, which means she may not have wanted such an obscure pet, but for now…
Welcome to the family, you lucky little piglet!
Ch-ch-check out the adorable KUWTK deleted scene (below)!!!
