Lauren Conrad & Lucy Hale's Hairstylist Kristin Ess Demos Modern, Messy Waves — Two Ways!/n
It's a known fact that every time Target releases a designer collab—folks freak out. So when the mega store announced last month that they'd had partnered with celebrity hairstylist Kristin Ess on her first ever hair care line—well, pandemonium wasn't just assumed it was fated.Ess, a Pinterest darling and Instagram goddess, has been creating digital hair hysteria for years thanks for her sublime skills—which she uses regularly on clients Lauren Conrad, Lucy Hale, Jenna Dewan Tatum and Halle Berry –and knowledge, which she drops weekly on thebeautydepartment.com.Of course, the hype surrounding her collection only increased when it was revealed that all the products ranged from $10- $14. In a world where high-end shampoo is typically $30 plus, Ess' line is not just affordable, it's practically free.

So, unsurprisingly, fans treated her release just like a giveaway—snatching up as many of the pretty blush, gray, black and white bottles as they could within hours of them hitting the shelves. In fact, most Target stores we're sold out completely within days.But fear not, a lot of the line is available online. And because we know you're wondering how to use it, Kristin kindly created an easy video guide for—what else?—two of her signature wave styles.
