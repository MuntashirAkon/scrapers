Truck Carrying Thousands Of Piglets Crashes On The Highway — Read The Sad Report/n

These little piggies cried all the way home — and we don't blame them!
A truck in North Carolina carrying 2,600 piglets overturned on the highway on Tuesday!
Animal control officers and police were on the scene after the tractor trailer — traveling to Iowa on the Raleigh Beltline — fell on its side and smashed against a guard rail.
According to the report, the truck was driving on the Beltline when a car changed lanes and the truck collided with the vehicle.

This caused the pig-loaded truck to descend down towards a ramp and overturn on the wet road.
An unknown number of pigs were killed in the wreck, and many others were "seriously injured." The total estimated cost of the damage was $90,000.
We're glad no humans were seriously hurt in the crash, but SO sad for the piglets!
This should be a reminder for drivers to be extra safe in bad weather conditions — especially with adorable baby animals on board.
