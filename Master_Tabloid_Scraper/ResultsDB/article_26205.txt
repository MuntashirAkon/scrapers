Ciara’s two-year-old son, Future Zahir Wilburn, is already calling her new husband “papa,” according to a video shared by Russell Wilson.

In a Facebook Live clip shared by the football player just days after his wedding, little Future gives Ciara a “mama kiss” before asking for a “papa kiss” and planting one on Wilson. An assistant who is carrier the toddler in the video also refers to Wilson as “Papa Russ” while talking to baby Future.
 
The video comes amid a heated battle between Ciara and her ex-fiancé Future, who is little Future’s biological father. In legal documents recently filed by Ciara, the songstress claims her ex has been making threats against Wilson.
Earlier this year, Ciara sued the rapper for alleged slander and libel, demanding $15 million in damages. Future responded with a countersuit, which he later dropped after being granted joint custody of their son.
