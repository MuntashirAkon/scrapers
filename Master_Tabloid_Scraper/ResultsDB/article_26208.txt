 Both Ciara and Future are both keeping quiet on their broken engagement since news broke that the latter had cheated on the former. However, Future may have broken that silence with his latest contribution to Instagram.

Posting a photo of himself in the recording studio, the rapper captions the portrait, “I Dnt [sic] respond to rumors I respond to money #MONSTER.”

Hmmm, is this Future’s dig at all the reports about him allegedly hooking up with wardrobe stylist Tyrina Lee? Are these just random lyrics for another song? Or, is he genuinely telling us that we should pay him for a scoop?
Either way, the whole cheating scandal has turned messy. According to E! News, the “Body Party” songstress “humiliated and angry” about the whole situation.
“She’s very embarrassed and keeping to herself right now,” a source tells the publication. “She’s usually so outgoing but most of her friends haven’t heard from her since the news broke.”
Ciara, 28, and Future, 30, got engaged in October of last year after the latter popped the question to with a 15-carat engagement ring. Ciara later gushed about her man to Brides magazine in June, saying, “I knew right away that he was different. Now he’s my best friend in the world, my partner.”
Ciara gave birth to the couple’s first son, Future Zahir Wilburn, in May.
