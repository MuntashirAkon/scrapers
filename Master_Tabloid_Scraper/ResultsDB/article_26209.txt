 A reconciliation between Ciara and her former fiancé Future seems unlikely.
Us Weekly reports the “Body Party” singer discovered the rapper was cheating on her with his stylist, which is why she ended the couple’s engagement.
According to Us, Ciara “found out about the affair through multiple sources in recent weeks. There was clear evidence when she approached Future about the cheating. This was clearly not just a one-night thing.”
The “I’m Out” songstress gave birth to the couple’s first child, Future Zahir Wilburn in May, and the two were engaged to be married.
Now, Ciara is a single mom after discovering Future was carrying on an affair with Tyrina Lee, a personal shopper and wardrobe stylist. While said to be “devastated” about the infidelity, Ciara was seen out and about in NYC last week smiling through the pain as she pushed her baby boy in his stroller.

Ciara and Future got engaged in October of last year, when the “Honest” singer surprised Ciara with a 15-carat diamond ring on her birthday.
