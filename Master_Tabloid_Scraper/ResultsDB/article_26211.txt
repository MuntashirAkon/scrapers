 The spirit of Father’s Day is going strong all over Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. And Ciara, not wanting to be left out of the fun, shared the very first photo of her adorable baby boy.
This baby is the cutest (and coolest) celebrity child we’ve seen all day.

Ciara, who just gave birth to little Future Zahir Wilburn a month ago, revealed the picture Sunday morning via Instagram.

He is rather obviously named after the 28-year-old’s partner, rapper and fiancé Future.
In another pic posted earlier, the little guy can be seen holding onto his father’s hand.
