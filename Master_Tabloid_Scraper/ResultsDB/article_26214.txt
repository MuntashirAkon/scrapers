Chris Christie's 82-Year-Old Dad Is His Most Dedicated Volunteer/n
New Jersey Governor Chris Christie‘s campaign for the Republican presidential nomination has one secret weapon: His 82-year-old dad Wilbur.  
Bill Christie knocks on an average of 160 doors a day on behalf of his son’s campaign, most recently in New Hampshire.  
“I come up here to help Chris, and they couldn’t stop me if they tried. I’d come and do it on my own actually,” Bill Christie told ABC News. “It’s a labor of love.”  

If they didn’t meet him personally, Christie’s supporters might have glimpsed Wilbur on his son’s Instagram account, which posted a picture of Bill in New Hampshire, clad in a bright yellow rain slicker, pounding the pavement despite poor weather.  





 That's Wilbur Christie going door to door in New Hampshire today. Thanks, Dad!

The elder Christie is surprisingly tech-savvy: He gets notifications on his phone every time his son tweets, and his canvassing is aided by an app that details voter registration information.  
“To me, it’s the thing to do,” he explained. “It’s been that way all our lives, though. We never missed a baseball game, and I’m not going to miss this – that’s for sure.”
