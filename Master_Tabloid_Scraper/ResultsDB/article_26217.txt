Picks and Pans Review: Wilbur Wants to Kill Himself/n
Jamie Sives, Shirley Henderson
As the title of this lovely, bittersweet film plainly states, Wilbur (Sives) is trying to do away with himself. A preschool teacher in Glasgow, Scotland, he’s not particular about his suicide method. He pops pills, gasses himself, slashes his wrists and jumps in the river. But with the support of his caring older brother (Adrian Rawlins), who runs a used bookstore, along with a doleful new sister-in-law (Henderson) and her young daughter, Wilbur finds reason to live.
Director-cowriter Lone Scherfig, a Dane whose last movie was the delightful Italian for Beginners, scores again with a genuinely moving film about life’s seeming losers. You realize just how much you have come to care only when you find yourself tearful near the end. (R)
