Wilbur Wants to Kill Himself/n
Leave it to the Scottish to find the humor in a story about suicide, depression and single parenting. Sure, there's an underlying seriousness to director Lone Scherfig's (Italian for Beginners) first English-language picture. But there are plenty of smart yucks in this tale of two brothers, upbeat Adrian Rawlins and doleful Jamie Sives (he's Wilbur), and the inspirational, shy single mother they both love (Shirley Henderson).

 What elevates this film above an ordinary, bittersweet romantic comedy are the details, drolly captured by Scherfig. The depressed and always illin' Sives' hospital visits and interaction with the medical staff yields gratifying scenes. Yet it's the simple depiction of romantic and familial love that sticks with the viewer at the end of this thoughtful and winsome film. It's deadly good.
