Lucy Hale clearly isn't one for down time.After having recently wrapped eight seasons of the hit show Pretty Little Liars, your favorite little liar's got a brand new gig: Creative Director of Casetify. "Most people don't think twice about tech accessories, but really, they should be an extension of who you are and what you wear," said Hale. "Choosing your phone case should be a part of picking your everyday wardrobe, like the way you decide what shoes to wear."

In order to switch up your phone cases (and other tech accessories) like you switch up your clothes, you're going to need some new stock. That's why Lucy designed a 34-piece capsule collection full of Elvis (her dog)-like drawings, gorgeous floral patterns and so much more to help jump-start your stash. For a peek at the line, keep scrolling!
