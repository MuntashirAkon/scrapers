Update: New shows in Anaheim and Anchorage (!) added. Wouldn't it be amazing to see Joel McHale, your much beloved host of The Soup, as he actually appears in real life: sans makeup, girdle and press-on chest hair? Of course, it would. If we wanted you to answer that question, we wouldn't have asked it. That's why we've taken the liberty of randomly selecting a few dates this summer and fall to install Joel in a series of totally tricked-out high school cafeterias around the United States.Since many of these venues also serve as comedy clubs, patrons can expect Joel to favor his audience with a few choice knock-knock jokes and LOL cat screenshots. The shows should be a convivial hoot, and, based on our preliminary testing, the psychic damage rarely lasts beyond six weeks.July 11 -13  Caroline's Comedy Club – New York CIty, NYJuly 25  Wilbur Theatre – Boston, MAJuly 26  Newport Yachting Center – Newport, RIJuly 27  Hampton Beach Casino Ballroom – Hampton Beach, NHAug. 8   Theatre at Mandalay Bay – Las Vegas, NVAug. 23 University of Alaska – Anchorage, AKAug. 29 "Thunder in the Rockies" Budweiser Events Center – Loveland, COSep. 20 The Grove of Anaheim – Anaheim, CAOct. 3  Hard Rock Live – Orlando, FLOct. 4  Tampa Bay Performing Arts Center – Tampa Bay, FLOct. 5  Sunrise Theatre – Fort Pierce, FLNov. 28  Moore Theatre – Seattle, WAP.S.
