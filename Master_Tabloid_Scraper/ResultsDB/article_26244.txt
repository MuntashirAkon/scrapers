Nicole Curtis Suffers Heartbreaking Death Amid Custody Battle/n
Nicole Curtis‘ beloved sidekick Tessa lost her battle with cancer on Saturday night, RadarOnline.com has learned.
Tessa’s mom, Karin Prothero, revealed the news in a heartbreaking post early Sunday morning, saying: “Our sweet girl passed tonight at 8:25 while peacefully sleeping. Bobby and I were cuddling her and talking about how strong she’s been through this when it happened.”

The Rehab Addict star, 40, met Tessa, 9, in 2015 while she was working with her father, Bobby. She quickly bonded with the elementary schooler, and even hosted fundraisers in her fixer-upper projects in her honor.
Curtis has yet to respond to the news on Facebook, but has been vocal on Twitter.
