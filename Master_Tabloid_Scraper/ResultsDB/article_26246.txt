Justice For Nicole? Curtis’ Lawsuit Tossed By Judge/n
Nicole Curtis finally had a judge rule in her favor, RadarOnline.com can exclusively reveal.
A dismissal was filed in the Rehab Addict star’s “$2 home” lawsuit on June 6, a Hennepin County, Minnesota clerk confirmed to Radar. In other good news for Curtis, another clerk confirmed there are “no delinquencies” for taxes on the property.
Radar previously reported she owed two years’ worth of taxes, totaling $4,920.
Curtis was sued by the City of Minneapolis on January 31 after she “failed to redevelop the property” as she promised in exchange for purchasing the home at just $2.

A judge gave her until October 15 to complete work on the home just last month — but now she is in the clear!
But, that’s the only courtroom victory for Curtis so far as she is still fighting over her son Harper, 2, with Shane Maguire.
Their custody battle began shortly after Harper’s birth, and has been extremely bitter. Maguire even requested the court force her to undergo a psychological evaluation, but he was denied.
