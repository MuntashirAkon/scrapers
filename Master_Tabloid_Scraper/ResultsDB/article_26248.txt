DOOMSDAY! 'Rehab Addict' Nicole Gets A Deadline For $2 Home Renovation/n

Nicole Curtis must rush to complete the renovations on her latest project if she wants to keep it, RadarOnline.com has learned!
The Rehab Addict star has until Oct. 15 to complete work on her infamous “$2 home,” or she must give it back to the city of Minneapolis, according to a new settlement in the case. As Radar previously reported, the city sued Curtis after she “failed to redevelop the property” as she promised — and failed to pay her taxes, too!
The home improvement guru owes two years’ worth of taxes on the property.

Meanwhile, her custody battle with baby daddy Shane Maguire continues to rage on, as he claims she is still denying him time with their son Harper, 2.
