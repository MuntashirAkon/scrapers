Rikki will pay $2,000 a month in child support until the kids turn 18 ... and he'll also cover their club activities -- karate, tennis, swimming, etc. Melanie gets $1,000 per month in spousal support for 3 years. Everything pretty much went according to their prenup, with one twist -- if Rikki's on a  "full scale " tour with Poison ... his child and spousal support payments double in those months. Rikki also has to pay off a Dodge Charger for Melanie and fork over $45k from the sale of one of their properties./n
