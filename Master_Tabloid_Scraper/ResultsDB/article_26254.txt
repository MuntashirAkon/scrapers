‘Rehab Addict’ Disaster! Nicole Curtis Sued Over Incomplete Home Renovations/n
Nicole Curtis is due back in court — and not for her custody case!
RadarOnline.com can reveal that the Rehab Addict star was hit with a lawsuit from the city of Minneapolis for breaching a contract she made over her “$2 home.” (Yes, that’s not a typo!)
The suit was filed on January 31, and the discovery plan was put into motion earlier this week.
READ THE DOCUMENTS
The city claimed that she “failed to redevelop the property” as she promised, and neglected to “complete minimum improvements.” As a result, the city wants the home back.
Curtis fired back on social media, saying: “I fight for the underdog -always have, always will-never one to schmooze 😉 and for the past two years, I was threatened and harassed regarding our work in Minneapolis [sic].”
“There is no financial gain for me to complete 1522 Hillside, but I took the house on so that it would not be demolished,” she added. “No one else wanted it and it had been abandoned for two decades. The cost of demolition to taxpayers is approx. 20k. We applied for a building permit and were told a 200k deposit would be required. Ever heard of that? Me neither.”

“The City has spent time and resources blocking our plan for restoration-I have no answer for that [sic],” she concluded. “It’s not a secret that I’ve highlighted examples of inept moves by the current administration. It’s not a secret that I have asked for attention and funds to go towards North Minneapolis. I’m not a glorified TV STAR as some refer to me-I’m a person who came forward with her money and a solution.”
However, Radar previously reported that Curtis, 40, also owes two years worth of property taxes on the home, according to a Hennepin County clerk. The unpaid taxes were mentioned in the suit.
