RadarOnline.com can exclusively reveal that Curtis’ right-hand man was formerly known as Lacey Mistina Lundeen, and transitioned around 2014.
That year, he posted a photo of his license, with the same name and caption: “Just received my new drivers license with the right name! # happiness #ftm”. “FTM” is common shorthand for “female-to-male” transition.

The 35-year-old has been working for Curtis, 40, for years and has even appeared on Rehab Addict alongside the home improvement star and her older son, Ethan.
The reality star has acknowledged that one of her best friends is transgender, but did not previously mention Lundeen by name.

One of my bestfriends is transgender, but to me he is simply my friend & a great human #lovedonthate #dropthelabelstheyhurt

He did not immediately respond to Radar’s request for comment.
