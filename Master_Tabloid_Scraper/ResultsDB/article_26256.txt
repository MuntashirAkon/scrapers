'Rehab Addict' Nicole Shares Photo Of Son After Slamming Baby Daddy In Court/n
Nicole Curtis violated her own request, RadarOnline.com can reveal!
Curtis asked a judge in her custody battle case to sign an order prohibiting Shane Maguire from sharing photos of their son Harper online — even on his private Facebook account.

But, a judge refused — and now Curtis is taking advantage!
“I can build a thousand houses, but it won’t have as big of effect on the future for women as simply showing my boys the way,” she captioned the photo. “Moms of boys have the responsibility of raising men who get it. If my boys don’t, call me, I’ll get to straightening that out right away 🙂 to all the little women out there -the world is just as much yours as it is theirs.”
Curtis, 40, and Maguire, 52, have been fighting over Harper, 2, since his birth. Their battle intensified after Maguire asked the court to have Curtis undergo a psychological evaluation. Maguire’s relatives even went so far as to call Curtis “manipulative” and “controlling.”
A judge denied the request, and Curtis’ battle is still ongoing.
