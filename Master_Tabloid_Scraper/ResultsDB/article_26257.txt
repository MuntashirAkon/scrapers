She later clarified that the photo was two years old, and from when she was pregnant with Harper, 18 months.
Curtis, 40, and Harper’s father Shane Maguire, 52, have been locked in a custody war since his birth. She recently slammed him in a Facebook post, saying, “I’m the mom who advocates for children to have both parents…And mind you, the offer has stood since day one for the other person to be at my house, use my car and even have their flights paid for so that this baby doesn’t have to live like this…”
Maguire’s niece told RadarOnline.com exclusively that Curtis “manipulates” her time with Harper and is extremely “controlling.”
Maguire previously asked the court to have Curtis undergo a psychological evaluation, but his request was denied.
