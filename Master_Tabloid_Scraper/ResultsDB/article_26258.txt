‘I Did Not Choose Any Of This!’ 'Rehab Addict' Star Nicole Slams Ex AGAIN/n
Nicole Curtis’ bitter custody war won’t be put on hold during Rehab Addict filming!
Curtis, 40, began filming for season 8 on Feb. 20 while she was separated from her son, Harper, 2. The outspoken mom took to Facebook to vent her frustrations about going back to work without him.
“Going back to making TV today,” she wrote. “My body is a mess. Another long stretch without my little one. I’ve never had to withdrawal from anything in my life -like drugs, alcohol, etc. However, I have been so sick the past few days, chills, headache –a lot of traveling and not enough time to adequately pump. This is a morning where I look in the mirror and want to scream-how the hell does anyone rationalize taking a nursing baby from their mother?”
“I’m the mom who advocates for children to have both parents,” she continued. “My little one was sick, again, last week and I had to load up on a plane and leave him. And mind you, the offer has stood since day one for the other person to be at my house, use my car and even have their flights paid for so that this baby doesn’t have to live like this…”
The Rehab Addict star then edited her post a half hour later to include “disclaimers” including: “I’m not traveling and doing the show-I’m at home” and “I did not choose for any of this to be public.”
The next day, she posted a photo with Harper to advocate for “#infantmentalhealth.”





 Just like that, my little one jumps into my arm and reaches for a breast —I sit for a long time in the car when we do these returns while getting screamed at -put your boob away in my driveway 🙁 never a thought that this child just went from their arms screaming for mamma and the "boob" … Just counting my blessings that another extended visit is over #breastfeeding #familylaw #fathersrightsvsbabysrights #infantmentalhealth

She never named her ex, Shane Maguire, and hasn’t been shy about slamming him either. She previously attacked him on Facebook for having Harper during Christmas.
Maguire’s niece told RadarOnline.com exclusively that Curtis is “controlling” and “manipulative” — especially when it comes to her baby.
Their custody battle has been extremely messy, and Maguire has even requested that Curtis undergo a psychological evaluation.
The judge denied the request, and Curtis continued to defy the court’s orders.
