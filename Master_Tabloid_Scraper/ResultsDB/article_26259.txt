Vetrano’s mother Cathie grieved outside the courthouse over the weekend.
“He’s a demon! He can burn in hell,” she reportedly shouted.
As Radar previously reported, the 30-year-old’s beaten, bloodied body was found off a grassy path in Queen’s Spring Creek Park on August 2, just hours after she had gone missing.
She had been planning to run with her father, Phil, but he had canceled due to an injury.

“We hoped to get to this point, one day,” the grieving dad said on Sunday. “I am not going to say it’s good, but we can move forward now. We are in a place we were never at, we know who did this.”
Lewis faces 25 years to life in prison.
Vetrano was one of three female joggers who were murdered within the same week in the northern United States.
So far, Lewis is not considered a suspect in the other killings.
