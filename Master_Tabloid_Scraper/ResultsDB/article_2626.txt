John Legend & Chrissy Teigen Dance and Laugh Off Wardrobe Malfunction!!!/nJohn Legend and Chrissy Teigen were kind of Ricky and Lucy Tuesday night, when she got in the act and then jacked his performance with the help of a nip slip. John was smooth as silk Tuesday night while singing  "Slow Dance. " That's when he brought Chrissy up for some slow dancing. It all looked fantastic ... and then the boob -- let's get real, even more fantastic! Chrissy owned it, and the show went on. #RelationshipGoals  The best night ever! Thank you!!! @chrissyteigen @johnlegend pic.twitter.com /0KIL5mK4zu — Kenneth Razon (@kentrazon) June 28, 2017/n
