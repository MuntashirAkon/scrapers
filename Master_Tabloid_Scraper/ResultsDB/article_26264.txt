An insider said: 

"They are definitely getting more serious… When they are apart, they speak every day. It's like they can't get enough of each other."

This past weekend, the 47-year-old actress and the 41-year-old athlete spent time in their shared hometown of NYC where the couple enjoyed a shopping spree with Miz Lopez's mom Guadalupe Rodríguez.

"Jennifer's family is excited about her dating him. They think she finally scored… [Meeting the parents] is of course a big deal but a natural step … She is spending time with his family, too."

But it's not just their parents… their kids have met each other too! 

"It's always unpredictable when you try to merge to families with young kids, but so far so good… The kids have all spent time together, and everyone is getting along."

While Jennifer has twins Max and Emme (9) from her ex Marc Anthony, Alex has two daughters Natasha (12) and Ella (8) with ex Cynthia Scurtis.

"Jennifer says she has never been in this kind of relationship… It just works and is easy. She is very happy."

We smell marriage!!!
