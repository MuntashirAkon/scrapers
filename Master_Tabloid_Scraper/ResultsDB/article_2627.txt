"   "I saw him limping on TV and just wanted to make sure he was ok. " She added,  "I've loved Scott Dixon since I was really little and when I saw the crash I got so scared and started crying. " The letter got to Dixon -- and he wanted to personally thank Lucy for caring about him so much, so he surprised her at home ... and it was awesome!!  #FeelGoodMomentOfTheDay/n
