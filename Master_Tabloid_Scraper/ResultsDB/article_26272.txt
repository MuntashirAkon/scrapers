Like Gretchen Weiners and “fetch,” Lindsay Lohan is trying to make a Mean Girls sequel happen.

During her latest appearance on The View, the actress (once again) touted the idea of starring in a follow-up to the 2004 high school comedy. Now 13 years since the film’s release, Lohan is adamant on reprising her role — so much so that she’s resorted to pestering producer Lorne Michaels about it.
“I went to SNL the other day and I was like harassing Lorne. I’m like, ‘We have to do [it]. I’ll write the treatment if Tina Fey’s too busy.'”
Lohan added that she’s “hopeful” a Mean Girls 2 will happen, saying, “They’re smart with timing. It will come when the time is right.”





“It’s a great movie. It’s a cult film,” she quipped.
Last year, Lohan revealed she had already penned a treatment for the sequel and expressed interest in casting Jamie Lee Curtis and Jimmy Fallon in new roles. However, in March 2016, Fey confirmed she was working on a Mean Girls musical with husband Jeff Richmond instead.
The word’s still out if Fey is also thinking about doing another movie, though Lohan claimed in 2014 that she’s already spoken to the screenwriter about a possible follow-up.
