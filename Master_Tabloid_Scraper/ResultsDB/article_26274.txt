The Kardashians are living the high life, and little Penelope Disick is no exception.

In a recent post on her app, Kourtney Kardashian gave fans a tour of her 4-year-old daughter’s bedroom. Needless to say, it was EVERYTHING. Not only did subscribers find out that Penelope sleeps on a custom built bed wrapped in blush-colored velvet upholstery, but that her room is filled with pricey artwork from Connor Tingley and Curtis Kulig.

“When we moved into the new house Penelope was ready for a big girl room, but she definitely still wanted a space that was both playful and pink!” Kardashian wrote. “We kept a lot of accents from her previous room, but went for a more sleek and modern feel. I even passed down the ‘Love Me’ neon light that was previously in my bedroom.”
A $7,500 nightlight aside, the room also features a vintage clothing rack for — yes, you’re reading this correctly — Penelope’s rag dolls.

“This vintage lucite clothing rack for doll clothes came from my grandmother MJ’s kids clothing shop in La Jolla called Shannon + Co,” Kardashian shared. “It makes Penelope’s play area look neat and organized. Toys can be chic too!”
