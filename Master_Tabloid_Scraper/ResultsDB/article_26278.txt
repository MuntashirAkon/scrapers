Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, and more celebrities have taken to Twitter to voice their opinions on the recent election protests. 
After Donald Trump was elected President of the United States, protestors took to the streets of New York, Los Angeles, and other cities across the country with anti-Trump signs.
But as thousands of Hillary Clinton supporters chanted “Not My President” and “Love Trumps Hate,” reality star Bethenny Frankel took to her Twitter account to slam those demonstrating, calling them “moronic.”


This protesting is moronic. What is the government going to say? Just kidding. Do over??? The man did happen to win NY.

The chaos in USA is the result of Trump's irresponsible campaigning. He is not a role model, look at this mess he created. #LoveTrumpsHate

Guys, the #TrumpProtests aren't "riots." They're to assure a nervous planet Earth that we'll go against him if he tries something crazy.
