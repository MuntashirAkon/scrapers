The chef—who will appearing at the Food & Wine Classic in Aspen (June 16-18)—shares a cool dish from his L.A. restaurant Maude 
Curtis Stone’s Cucumber Gazpacho
1 (3-oz.) French baguette, cut in half lengthwise
1½ cups whole milk
1 cup crème fraîche
3 large English cucumbers, peeled and diced
2 cups lightly packed fresh cilantro (from 1 bunch), plus more for garnish
1 cup green seedless grapes
½ cup toasted slivered almonds
¼ cup roughly chopped red onion
¼ cup fresh lemon juice, plus more for garnish
½ tsp. kosher salt
3 small radishes, thinly sliced
2 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil
1. Heat a large heavy skillet over medium-high. Place baguette halves, cut side down, in skillet, and cook until charred, 6 minutes. Cut into 2-inch pieces.
2. Stir together milk and crème fraîche in a large bowl. Place bread pieces in milk mixture, and let stand 15 minutes.
3. Reserve ¾ cup diced cucumber for garnish. Add remaining diced cucumber, cilantro, grapes, almonds, onion, lemon juice and salt to bread-and-milk mixture. Cover and let stand until bread softens, about 25 minutes.
4. Add mixture to a blender in batches, and process until smooth and velvety. Ladle soup into bowls, and top with reserved diced cucumber, cilantro and radish slices. Drizzle evenly with olive oil and additional lemon juice, if desired.
Serves: 6
Active time: 20 minutes
Total time: 1 hour
Tip! “Don’t be afraid to really char the bread,” says Stone. “If you can do this on a charcoal grill, even better. This adds an oh-so-delicious layer of flavor.”
