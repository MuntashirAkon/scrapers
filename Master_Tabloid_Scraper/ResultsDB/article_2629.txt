'Dallas' Star Charlene Tilton -- My Landlord's Driving Me Bonkers!!!/n "Dallas " star Charlene Tilton says her Burbank apartment has been overrun by 20 sweaty dudes with jackhammers, and it's driving her crazy. Tilton, who played Lucy Ewing on the show, claims in a new lawsuit she plunked down $2,600 a month for a nice Burbank apartment, but her peace was shattered when the landlord broke ground on a 3-month construction project, which involved several weeks of breaking concrete. Charlene claims her building is now a living hell. She can't use the pool or gym, the elevator doesn't work half the time, she can't open the windows because of ear-shattering noise, and the dust is unbearable. The 56-year-old actress says she's suffered extreme emotional distress and wouldn't wish the apartment on her worst enemy ... which we're guessing would be the photographer on the soap. Charlene believes the apartment is unlivable, so she's suing for rent she paid during construction and all sorts of other damages, including emotional distress. The landlord tells TMZ, he's tried to work with Charlene and even offered a discount in rent, but they just can't reach an agreement./n
