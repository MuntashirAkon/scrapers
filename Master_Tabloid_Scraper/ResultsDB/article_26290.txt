Of course, since this is Scream Queens, things get a lot nuttier than that, in more ways than one.You saw the shot of Munsch being hauled off in a straitjacket, right? That's barely the tip of the iceberg of this insane episode, which also features a funeral, a séance, and—you guessed it!—lunch meat. And murder, of course. Through it all, Jamie Lee Curtis reminds us why she is the actual scream queen by giving a performance that is both hilarious and a little bit scary. There also might be a few semi-answers to be had by the time the night is over to at least a couple of questions, and you won't want to miss it. Scream Queens airs Tuesdays at 9 p.m. on Fox.
