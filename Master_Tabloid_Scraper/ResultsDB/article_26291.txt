Nicole Curtis, star of HGTV's Rehab Addict, and ex Shane Maguire are still fighting over visitation rights of son Harper, more than a year after beginning a custody battle.Maguire recently filed his sixth motion against Curtis, alleging that she has been preventing him from seeing the 22-month-old boy, despite a court order. Curtis has not responded."Shane just wants a relationship with his child and doesn't have a desire to take Nicole to court," Maguire's lawyers told E! News Wednesday. "He thinks his son should have a relationship with both parents.""Nicole has denied Shane parenting time as recently as this past Tuesday night," the attorneys continued. "Nicole Curtis has been sanctioned by the court more than once for violating parenting time and for violating the judge and the courts orders." 

Maguire also accuses Curtis of frequenting disparaging him on social media and "falsely attacking" his ability to parent their son. He is seeking a court order that would prohibit her from continuing to do so.
