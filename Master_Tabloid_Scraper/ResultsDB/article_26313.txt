Dr. Dre's Son -- My Billionaire Dad's Not Sharing ... And I'm Cool With It/nDr. Dre's son is celebrating his dad's multi-billion dollar Apple deal -- but adds he hasn't seen a DIME of Dre's fortune, doesn't expect to even now ... and he's not the least bit bitter.We caught up with rapper Curtis Young -- Dre's spitting image and firstborn -- living the most NON-baller lifestyle possible: outside Ontario airport (1 hour east of L.A.), about to board a commercial flight to Mexico ... with a coach ticket! Watch the clip ... Curtis is a unicorn -- celeb spawn trying to make it on his own. He says Dre hasn't hooked him up with a steady cash flow since the Beats to Apple deal was announced ... and he explains why he's fine with that.Kudos to Curtis, but still ... a private jet would be nice./n
