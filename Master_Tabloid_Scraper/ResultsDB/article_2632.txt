Scott Weiland's Ex-Wife: Don't Glorify His Demons ... He Gave Up On His Kids /nScott Weiland emotionally abandoned his 2 children and completely gave up on even trying to be their parent ... according to his ex-wife.  Mary Weiland wrote a scathing open letter to Rolling Stone about Scott's death. She pulled no punches, saying ... reports Scott had been drug-free for years and loved spending time with his kids were false. She says the truth is Scott  "was a paranoid man who couldn't remember his own lyrics and who was only photographed with his children a handful of times in 15 years of fatherhood. " She also said she can't say he's in a better place now because,  "He belongs with his children barbecuing in the backyard and waiting for a Notre Dame game to come on. " Mary added, Scott's kids -- Noah, 15 and Lucy, 13 --  "never sought perfection from their dad. They just kept hoping for a little effort. " /n
