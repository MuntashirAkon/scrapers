In a video that’s quickly going viral, Abby Roeser posted on YouTube 15 amazing tricks performed by her two rats.

With the video, Abby writes: “I brought Nami and Pepper home about 8 months ago. When I got them, I had no idea that they could be taught tricks. Now I’ve done loads of training with them. Nami (the white one) is a much faster learner then Pepper which is why she know more advanced tricks. Pepper is a bit on the slow side, but I love her just as much!”
