The talented 33-year-old — also known for his roles in Bully, Sin City, House of Lies and Carnivàle — was released on his own recognizance following the incident. He had yet to tweet about his arrest early Friday.
Stahl made headlines in 2012 when he disappeared for a few days, which led to his wife filing a missing persons report.
