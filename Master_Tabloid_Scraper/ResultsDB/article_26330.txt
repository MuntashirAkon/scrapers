“A female bartender told officers that Gooding entered the bar with a group of people, and after a few minutes, other customers recognized him and started asking him to take photos with them. The bartender said Gooding soon became very aggravated with them,” the NOPD press release stated.
“That’s when she says she approached him and asked him to calm down. Gooding then allegedly pushed her away with an open hand. One of the bartender’s co-workers then called 9-1-1. At that point, the bartender says she informed Gooding that the police were on the way, and that he needed to leave. Gooding then allegedly pushed her again, and left the bar.”
