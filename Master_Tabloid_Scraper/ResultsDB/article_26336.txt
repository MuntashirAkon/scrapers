Trey – whose real name Willard Carrol Smith III — is from Will’s previous relationship with Sheree Zampino, who he divorced in 1995.
Reports that Will and Jada were divorcing after 13 years of marriage surfaced on Tuesday and the report was quickly shot down by another family member who told RadarOnline.com, “No way are they splitting up. They are totally together and are not separating.”
