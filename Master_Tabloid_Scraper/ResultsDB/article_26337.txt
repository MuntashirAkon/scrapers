Stay Home Los Angeles -- Carmageddon Is Coming!/n
By Amber Goodhand – Radar Reporter
It promises to drive motorists in Los Angeles crazy  — yes, “Carmageddon” is coming!
The city of Los Angeles asked Hollywood A-list celebrities to take to their Twitter accounts and warn local residents to stay off one of the city’s busiest freeways, the 405, as it will be closing this weekend for construction.
“This weekend, LA! Avoid Carmageddon, Gas-zilla, 405-enstein, Grid-lock-apalooza! STAY HOME. Eat & shop local! Hanx,” actor Tom Hanks wrote.

America’s Got Talent judge Piers Morgan thinks the city is over-reacting saying, “Re this whole #Carmageddon nonsense in LA this weekend – try coming to London, it’s #Carpocalypse there every day.”
A 10-mile section of the 405 will be closed from 7 p.m. on Friday until 6 a.m. on Monday, leading many businesses to close early and many companies to let their employees out of work early on Friday (Hint! Hint!) to avoid the dreaded gridlock.
The 405 is the nation’s most congested highway – on a typical weekend, 500,000 cars pack it.
