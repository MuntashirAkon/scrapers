TV: Saturday Hot Picks/n
Saturday
TV goes to the dogs tonight!
Tune in for an hysterical episode of Groomer Has It! Who says you can’t turn an old dog into a cougar?! Watch and L.Y.A.O. as contestants must style older dogs to make them look like young, hot pups! Plus, we get one of the most appropriate, and brilliantly cast, guest judges ever…. Janice Dickinson! Oh, the jokes I could make here, but it would just be too easy!
We also get a spin off tonight with the series premiere of Beverly Hills Groomer. The new series follows Groomer Has It winner from last season, as he works towards opening his chic Beverly Hills doggie salon. And how does one build a 90210 canine clientele? By cruising Rodeo Drive in a groovy grooming van and lurking around hip puppy parks of course! Don’t we warn our kids to stay away from these people?
Move over Night At the Museum! The BBC is kicking off its 3rd season of Primeval tonight with a monstrous crocodile from ancient Egypt unleashed in London’s British Museum. Seriously sci-fi fans, this UK import is well worth a US cult following!
And after 14 years of giving SNL a run for their funny money, Madtv is closing its West Coast comedy doors. The brilliant Fred Willard hosts the series finale titled, Madtv Gives Back, which features Mad alums, Alex Borstein, Mo Collins, Will Sasso and Debra Wilson S kelton. Farewell Coach Hines! We shall miss you!
Notable mention… Celebrity Apprentice winner, Joan Rivers will continue her trashing of rival Annie Duke on the Graham Norton Show, and Will Ferrell hosts the season finale of SNL, with performances by Green Day.
