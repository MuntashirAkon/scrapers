Billy Ray Cyrus -- Awkward Tribute to JFK ... Worst Moment of Silence Ever/nBilly Ray Cyrus asked a room full of people to quiet down and pay respect to JFK on the 50th anniversary of his death today ... but none of them did ... and it got weird.The whole thing happened during an interview with Ali Fedotowsky for Will Calder & Lucy Lopez's WPOW Miami show at a crowded press junket in L.A.B.R.C. is being interviewed at the table next to them ... when suddenly he leaps out of his chair and calls for everyone to quiet down and pay respect to JFK.Only problem ... there's a whole bunch of interviews going down ... and nobody listens.Watch the clip ... everyone's reaction is classic./n
