Today, Tonight/n
     
It’s not a regular part of the primetime schedule — yet.
But NBC is giving The Today Show a nighttime slot on December 22 with 2008: Today Looks Back, a Holiday Special which will star regular hosts Matt Lauer, Meredith Vieira, Al Roker, and Ann Curry. In addition to recapping the year’s top news stories, the show will offer bloopers from the morning edition.
“It was such an incredible year, with the economy and the election and the Olympics, just for starters,” the show’s executive producer Jim Bell told The Hollywood Reporter. “There were a range of emotions and stories that resonated.”
Kathie Lee Gifford, Hoda Kotb, Amy Robach, Willard Scott, and Lester Holt will also have time in the spotlight.
And if it scores in the ratings, look for NBC to ramp it up in the event of that pesky SAG strike. /n
