The 48-year-old, who was married to Will back in the early '90s, posted the sweet throwback pic (above) of Smith, the former couple's son, Trey Smith, and Willard with a sweet message, saying:

"We're gonna miss you Daddio! You lived & played by your own rules…you truly were 1 of a kind! You instilled discipline, and a work ethic that has created a legacy in your honor! (Pic left to right: Will Smith II; Will Smith III (Trey); Will Smith I (Daddio!) #RIPDaddio#donttellmetheresnothingyoucantdo#WillSMITH1"
