Today Show's Willard Scott Retiring After 65 Years On NBC!/n

America's favorite weatherman is signing off!
No, we're not talking about Al Roker, but his predecessor Willard Scott — who will retire on Tuesday after 35 years on the Today show and 65 years on NBC!
The 81-year-old's retirement was announced by Matt Lauer on Friday's show.
Scott handed off weather reporting duties to Roker in the 1990s, but stayed on the air for his renowned segment celebrating viewers' 100th birthdays with Smuckers' jelly!

But that's not all Scott is known for — he also played Ronald McDonald in the McDonald's commercials back in the 1960s!
Roker paid tribute to his predecessor, saying: 

"He's my second dad, he really is. And you know, he was in the control room in Washington, D.C., the morning this show first went on the air, as a page."
The Today show will be honoring the retiree in a Tuesday morning special — so hopefully we can expect a nice trip down memory lane to pay tribute to such an amazing career!
