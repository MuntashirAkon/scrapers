Ariana Grande’s Back-To-School Style Deserves An 'A' On The September Cover Of Seventeen/n

Summer isn’t over yet, but the September issues are already starting to roll out!
Thankfully, we have Ariana Grande’s cute cover of Seventeen magazine to make up for it!
The Bang Bang songstress is decked out in a perfect back-to-school outfit consisting of a multi-colored, checkered Sass & Bide romper, paired with a Dsquared2 leather belt, blue thigh-highs, and leather Derek Lam 10 Crosby boots.
As for the spread, it’s pretty selfie obsessed, with Ariana in varying picture taking poses, and of course way different schoolgirl ensems!
Our fave has got to be the white Jeremy Scott sweater paired with a red Milly plaid skirt!
What do U think??? And don't forget to ch-ch-check out the entire spread in the gallery (above)!
