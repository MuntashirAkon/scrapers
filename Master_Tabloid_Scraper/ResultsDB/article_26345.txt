Tennessee Titan Rescues Family And Dog From Burning Car!!/n

Not ALL professional sports players are reckless criminals with huge piggy banks — some of them are humble people, and some of them are flat-out heroes!
Jonathan Willard of the Tennessee Titans is a hero!! He rescued a family and its dog from a burning car!
Apparently Jonathan was traveling from South Carolina to report to the Titans' training camp when he was in the right place at the right time —  he found a family in distress on Interstate 40 in Tennessee. Here's what he had to say:
"I saw this car in front of me, and it had all kinds of black smoke coming out of it. I tried to speed up and get up next to the car to let them know the car was on fire."
He even took a pic (above)!
Jumping into action, Jonathan then alerted the driver to pull over! He continued:
"When she pulled over, the car was really on fire at that point. The driver, she acted like she was in some kind of daze or something. She told me that she didn't stop because she didn't think it was her car that was on fire. Another guy stopped, and we managed to get the kids and the dog out and get them to safety, and then I finally got the woman out.
"I was thinking that I was just doing what everybody else would do, but there were cars just going past us and no one else was stopping, so I don't know if that is what would happen or not."
That's so scary!!
Well, Jonathan's bravery is to be commended, but a lot of the times drivers are told to not to intervene with extreme accident situations for their own safety — so it might be less about their willingness and more about YOUR willingness!
We'd say that neither choice is wrong, but one has a much better outcome!
