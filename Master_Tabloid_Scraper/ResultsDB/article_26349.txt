Will Smith’s father, Willard Carroll Smith, Sr., has passed away.

The former Fresh Prince of Bel-Air star’s ex-wife, Sheree Fletcher, shared the sad new on Monday (Nov. 7, 2016) by posting a tribute to her former father-in-law on Instagram. Fletcher, who was married to Will for three years and shares a 23-year-old son named Trey with the actor, shared a sweet photo of three generations of Smith men together.
“We’re gonna miss you Daddio!” she wrote. “You lived & played by your own rules…you truly were 1 of a kind! You instilled discipline, and a work ethic that has created a legacy in your honor! (Pic left to right: Will Smith II; Will Smith III (Trey); Will Smith I (Daddio!) #RIPDaddio#donttellmetheresnothingyoucantdo#WillSMITH1.”

Will’s dad was the owner of a refrigeration firm in West Philadelphia.
“Dad was tough but not tyrannical,” Smith once told Essence magazine [via Entertainment Tonight]. “He kept me in line. He’d get this look that said, ‘One more step, Will, and it’ll get ugly.’ He was an independent businessman — he set up refrigeration in supermarkets — and he always provided for us. He’s a steady and positive figure in my life.”
