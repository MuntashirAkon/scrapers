Caprice Willard has been in style practically since the day she was born.
So it only makes sense that the UCLA alum works in fashion these days, as the Vice President/Regional Planning Manager for Women’s Apparel at Macy’s.
On Friday, Willard will also kick off her second season on NBC’s Fashion Star as one of the buyers, along with last season’s Terron Schaefer for Saks Fifth Avenue and newcomer Nicole M. Christie for H&M.
Jessica Simpson, Nicole Richie and John Varvatos will return as judges, with new host Louise Roe.

Willard, who is based out of L.A. these days, has been in style since she was a toddler.
