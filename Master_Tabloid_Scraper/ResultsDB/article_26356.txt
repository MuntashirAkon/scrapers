The 2010 Emmy Nominations Are Finally Here!/n
Hooray: The Emmy Award nominations are finally here!
Overall the nominations went as expected: Mad Men, 30 Rock, and Lost were all nominated for many of the top awards. However, there were some new additions to the mix: Modern Family earned a huge chunk of the nominations and Betty White even got a nomination for her hosting stint at Saturday Night Live!
After the jump, find out if your favorite shows were recognized (Parks and Recreation!) or snubbed (where’s Community and Party Down?) and which celebs are loading up on nominations.
Who are you rooting for?
