Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie Receive Lipstick Service/n
Yearning to score some lip contact with Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie? Today may be your lucky day.
Pitt, 45, and Jolie, 33, won a readers’ poll for the “most kissable” smackers on FeelUnique.com. To honor their perfect pouts, the site commissioned micro-sculptor Willard Wigan to carve their heads on tubes of lipstick.
Wigan spent more than 50 hours painstakingly carving the duo, which measure 9 millimeters tall and 4 millimeters wide. Bidding for the sculptures on eBay is up to $300, with seven days left. The auction’s proceeds will go to the Breast Cancer Campaign.
Wigan also created a micro-sculpture of the Obama family in the Eye of a Needle.
Do you think Jen Aniston might be pouting right about now?
