Hats Off to You, David Archuleta!/n
Kudos, David Archuleta.
It’s not easy to out-creep Hayden Panettiere’s 13-year-old brother, Jansen, who looks like a ventriloquist’s doll that’s come to life for the express purpose of killing people in their sleep. But you managed to pull it off Saturday at the premiere of Disney’s futuristic robot flick Wall-E at Los Angeles’ Greek Theatre. 
The secret to this dubious distinction? Your curious choice of chapeau, which makes you look like you’re trying to single-handedly revive the Chi-Chi Rodriguez look. 
No doubt your cap has many practical uses. Such as concealing the bad-hair day that has plagued the past several months of your life. And blocking the mind-control rays from your psycho loving and supportive stage father Jeff. Especially if you’ve done the smart thing and lined the hat with lead.
Also at the premiere were Wall-E star Fred Willard, Marlee Matlin, Sigourney Weaver, Kevin Smith and Katie Cassidy, all of whom were no doubt awestruck by Archuleta’s unique fashion sense.
