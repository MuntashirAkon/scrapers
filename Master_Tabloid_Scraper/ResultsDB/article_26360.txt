Willard Scott Retiring After 35 Years on Today/n
America’s weatherman is officially signing off.   
 Today‘s Willard Scott will retire Tuesday after 35 years on the morning show and 65 years on NBC, anchor Matt Lauer announced Friday.   
 Scott, 81, ceded weather report duties to Al Roker in the 1990s but still went on air for his famous segment celebrating viewers’ 100th birthdays with Smucker’s jelly. He also played Ronald McDonald in the fast food chain’s commercials throughout the ’60s.

 “Suddenly I look over and see this very happy face, race over, give that face a kiss, race back to George,” Barbara, 90, recalled in a Today segment Friday. “He says, I didn’t know you knew Willard Scott.’ I said, ‘I don’t know Willard Scott, I just love that face.’ ”

Roker, 61, also paid tribute to his predecessor.   
 “He’s my second dad, he really is,” Roker said. “And you know, he was in the control room in Washington, D.C., the morning this show first went on the air, as a page.”   
 Today‘s special honoring Scott airs Tuesday morning on NBC.
