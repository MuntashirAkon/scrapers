Willard Scott Marries Paris Keena/n
It’s a sunny (and romantic!) forecast for Willard Scott, who tied the knot on Tuesday.  
The legendary Today weatherman, 80, known for wishing centenarians a happy birthday, wed his longtime girlfriend, Paris Keena, in Fort Myers, Fla., according to Today.com.   
Scott met Keena some 36 years ago when she worked for NBC’s Washington affiliate, and the couple have been together for 11 years. Scott’s first wife, Mary, died in 2002.  
Scott and Keena divide their time between Florida, Virginia and Connecticut.  
When asked if the newlyweds plan to honeymoon, Keena told Today, “Our whole life has been a honeymoon.”  
This is the second recent wedding for the folks at Today – co-anchor Savannah Guthrie and her new husband Michael Feldman said "I do" on March 15.
