Fred Willard's Firing: Was It Fair?/n
On Wednesday night Fred Willard was arrested for lewd conduct at an adult movie theater in L.A. The next day, the comedic actor was fired from the PBS show Market Warriors.  
Willard, 72, has not been convicted of a crime and his lawyer denies the actor did anything illegal.   
“With all due respect to the individual officer,” attorney Paul Takakjian tells TMZ, “our belief is that Fred did nothing in any violation of any law. We will be working vigorously to clear his name in this matter.”  
Willard had been doing the voice-over on Market Warriors, which is a spinoff of the popular Antiques Roadshow. The show’s host, Mark Walberg, will take over Willard’s gig.  
So, was PBS too hasty in letting Willard go before he was convicted of a crime? Or did the public TV station do the right thing by firing Willard, who has not denied being at Hollywood adult movie theater?   
Tell us what you think about the Best in Show star’s firing.
