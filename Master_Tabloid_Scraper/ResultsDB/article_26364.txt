Fred Willard Fired by PBS After Lewd-Conduct Arrest/n
Within hours of news that Fred Willard was arrested for lewd behavior in an adult movie theater, he lost a television job.  
The comic actor, 72, was dropped Thursday from his voice-over gig on PBS’s Antiques Roadshow spinoff, Market Warriors.  
“Given the unfortunate news reported today, effective immediately, Fred Willard no longer will be involved with the Market Warriors series,” Jeanne Hopkins, a rep for WGBH, the Boston public broadcaster that produces the show, said in a statement. 
Willard’s duties on the program will be taken over by Mark Walberg, host of the show.  
As for the actor, his lawyer issued a statement defending him.  
“With all due respect to the individual officer,” attorney Paul Takakjian tells TMZ, “our belief is that Fred did nothing in any violation of any law. We will be working vigorously to clear his name in this matter.”
