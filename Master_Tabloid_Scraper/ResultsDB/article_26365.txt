Fred Willard Arrested for Alleged Lewd Conduct/n
The incident would hardly qualify as comic actor Fred Willard’s best in show.  
The septuagenarian satirist found himself in a serious position in a Hollywood adult movie theater Wednesday night, when he was arrested and charged by the Los Angeles Police Department for allegedly committing a lewd act, Officer Bruce Borihanh confirms.   
LAPD confirms that the incident happened at about 8:50 p.m. as vice officers were conducting a routine investigation, and that Willard was cited and released, meaning he will have to appear in court to answer to a misdemeanor charge.  
The actor’s rep had no comment, the Los Angeles Times reports.   
Willard, 72, is best known for his scene-stealing roles in Christopher Guest parody films (Best in Show, A Mighty Wind) and Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy as well as TV shows such as Get Smart, Everybody Loves Raymond, Modern Family and The Closer.  
TMZ, which reports Willard was arrested at the Tiki Theater on Santa Monica Boulevard in L.A., lists the films playing at the time: Follow Me 2 and Step Dad No. 2.   
According to the Internet Movie Database, Willard’s next movie is called The Yank.
