Usually we skewer actors for chewing up the scenery, but in this remake of the 1971 rat-packed horror flick, we say dig in! Glover plays a mousy man living with his mom who's constantly pushed around by his overbearing and shady boss, R. Lee Ermey. But when he befriends a rodent in his basement, he trains a pack of rats to do his bidding and chomp away on those who've done him wrong.

 But what's up with that other giant, jealous rat named Ben? Glover was born to do stuff like this: It's strange, stylized and kind of campy, but it's also endearing. More creepy than suspenseful (it ain't that gory), the computer-created rodents seamlessly blend with the real deal and will make your skin crawl. And that's all you really want from a movie like this, isn't it?
