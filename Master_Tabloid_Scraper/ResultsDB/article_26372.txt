Willard Scott Hits the Pipe on Today/n
Thanks to the Today show, Americans who have managed to survive disease, war and choking on boba balls to live to be 100 are rewarded with the fitting tribute of seeing their face on the side of a Smuckers jar. And strange comments from Willard Scott, who loves chortling to the oldies. Especially when they have a heartwarming nicotene addiction.Now let Joel McHale do Willard one better, and virtually everybody else too, on a brand new Soup tonight at 10 p.m. ET/PT!
