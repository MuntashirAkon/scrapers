'Indiana Jones' & 'American Graffiti' Writers: Creative Writing Pays Off ... How's $16 Mil for Ya?!!/nScreenwriting duo and real-life couple Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz are proof words have great worth ... they're selling their Brentwood home for $15.9 million! Willard and Gloria were Hollywood all-stars in the '70s and '80s ... with film credits that include  "American Graffiti " and  "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. " They also worked on the 'Star Wars' franchise.  The home's around 5,200 square feet, but the steep price is more about acreage ... 1.45 in the pricey Mandeville Canyon area of West L.A.   The couple is repped by Cindy Ambuehl at The Agency. /n
