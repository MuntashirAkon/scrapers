Canseco Swats, Cannon Bombs the Juice/nTMZ asked Jose Canseco, the pumped-up former baseballer, if he knew who the  "biggest juicer " was in MLB today, and sadly, he wasn't in the know.  "Wild 'N Out " star Nick Cannon had something to say about a different juice, Mr. O.J. Simpson, telling TMZ to  "Stop messin' with him! "  Also seen in L.A.: Masi Oka with  "Borat " sidekick Ken Davitian, a  "stylish " Fred Willard,  "chubby chaser " Carson Kressley, and a smiling (not spitting) Avril Lavigne. In NY: Sexy  "Good Luck Chuck " co-stars Jessica Alba and Dane Cook at TRL, where Ashanti was spotted as well. Also, an impatient Steven Van Zandt outside Pastis. All this and more in today's extra juicy edition of Star Catcher./n
