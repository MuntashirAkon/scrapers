Inside, Gilles blasts Brown for accusations that she was teaming up with Belafonte to extort her by threatening to leak the couple's secret sex tapes. Brown blamed Gilles and Belafonte for hiding the tapes in a secret storage unit, under Gilles' name, in an effort to keep them out of Brown's reach while the divorce unfolds.Photo credit: AKM-GSI3 of 10But according to Gilles' court documents, which were obtained by Radar, the German beauty stated that she "is not in possession of any of the alleged sex tapes or compromising materials as described in Brown's declaration." Her explosive account goes on to reveal that she had opened the storage unit at Belafonte and Brown's request while employed.Photo credit: AKM-GSI4 of 10"The account was initially listed under Gilles' name, as neither Brown nor Belafonte were present when the account was opened and Public Storage policies required that persons opening new accounts be present and have photo identification," the document read on.

The search, however, ended empty-handed.
