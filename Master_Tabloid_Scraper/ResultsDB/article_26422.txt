Kim Kardashian Demands Pricey Push Present In Exchange For Baby!/n
Kim Kardashian hates being pregnant, but if there is any silver lining to the nine month ordeal (aside from a bouncing bundle of joy), it is that giving birth gives moms license to demand exorbitantly priced push presents from their baby daddies!
“I like the idea of a push present,” the 35-year-old admitted. “After nine months of pregnancy it’s a sweet and well-deserved thank you.”

As Radar has reported, Kardashian has complained at length about both of her painful pregnancies, which have given her back aches, swollen feet, and even forced her to wear diapers. “We women go through an entire pregnancy carrying a baby … of course it only makes sense that we get something amazing to show how amazing we are! LOL!”
The understated mom has already begun weighing the options. “One friend got a special diamond ring she always wanted, and another friend got a new car,” she pondered. “This pregnancy, I would love a Lorraine Schwartz diamond choker like the ones I’ve worn before to the Art + Film Gala,” she said. “Too much? LOL!” /n
