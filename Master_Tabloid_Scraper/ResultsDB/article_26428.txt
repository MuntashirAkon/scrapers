We hate to see her struggle like this!
According to The Mirror, after her costly split from ex-husband Stephen Belafonte, Mel B is reportedly asking friends for money in order to secure a $2 million house in Los Angeles.

Although the Spice Girls star has put down a six-figure deposit, she fears she will lose it if she can't come up with the rest of the amount.
According to a source: 

"It's well-known Mel's finances are not great, but if the house deal falls through she'll be in an even worse situation. She just can't afford to lose any more cash. So she's turned to pals in her hour of need and they're trying their best to help."
Reportedly, the musician has asked America's Got Talent co-creator Simon Cowell to make sure her gig is long-term, as she is only contracted to stay another year.
To make matters worse, she still hasn't sold the Hollywood Hills house she shared with Belafonte. Although it went on the market for $9 million in March, it was reduced by $1 million weeks later.
On Friday, when Mel and her ex squared off at the Los Angeles Superior Court, Stephen's lawyer Grace Jamra claimed "she wiped out all her Spice Girls money, approximately $50 million if not more" due to the couple's "extravagant and affluent" lifestyle.
According to The Sunday People, one of Mel's businesses Moneyspider Productions only has $1200 to its name.
This Wednesday, Judge Lawrence Riff will decide if Stephen will be granted $118,000 in spousal support, backdated to March.
Good luck, boo!
