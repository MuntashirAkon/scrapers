More than 200 guests were in attendance, including family and close friends, when the couple said their vows and did the deed â€” and afterwards, Hough told People about it: 

"I don't think I ever really necessarily dreamed about my wedding as a kid. But I know I will always cherish and remember it for the rest of my life."
Hough wore a custom Marchesa gown with Lorraine Schwartz jewelry for the ceremony, and was given away by her father, Bruce.
The wedding party included Hough's brother and fellow DWTS star Derek, who was a groomsman.
And as you can see in the picture (below), Julianne and Brooks couldn't go through the ceremony without their two Cavalier King Charles Spaniels, Lexi and Harley!!!

Awwww!!!!
That's too cute!
Love is in the air this summer over at Dancing With The Stars, apparently!!
