Those who want to mess with Kim Kardashian better think twice.

According to Kris Jenner, her daughter has hired armed security guards to protect her following last year’s robbery in Paris. In fact, Kim’s harrowing experience has changed how the entire Kardashian clan operates.
“It really changed all of our lives and the way that we live,” the momager tells The Hollywood Reporter.
“Not only do we now have an enormous amount of security — everyone is armed and licensed; it’s legit companies that protect all of us — but also the way that we deal with our lives on social media took a huge turn: what we show, what we don’t show,” she explains. “If we go to Disneyland, we’re not snapping pictures with Dumbo; we’ll wait until we leave and then share something we want to share. But it also gave us great pause about what to share.”
The Keeping Up with the Kardashians star adds her kids have cut back on what to share with their fans. Though Kris still doesn’t fault Kim for posting pictures of her 20-carat Lorraine Swartz diamond ring — which was stolen during the robbery — on Instagram, she does admit she’s hesitant on flaunting their wealth these days.

“There is nothing wrong with working hard and getting something wonderful for yourself if you want to or that’s what you’re into, but I think the way that we share it with other people really changed,” Kris says. “You think five times about what you’re going to put out there on social media.”
As previously reported, investigators suspected the robbers followed Kim on social media and learned she was alone at the time of the robbery through her Snapchat postings.
“I was Snapchatting that I was home and that everyone was going out,” Kim recalled on an episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians. “They had this window of opportunity and just went for it.”
