As it turns out, Scott Disick did have plans to marry Kourtney Kardashian when they were still together.

In a preview for an upcoming episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians, the father-of-three reveals he bought an engagement ring for his then-girlfriend. While chatting with Kim Kardashian and Khloé Kardashian about his relationship with his ex, Scott admits to actually proposing with the pricey piece of jewelry — though he says they were never officially engaged.
“This was a really nice, cool Lorraine Schwartz ring and then he returned it,” Kim tells Khloé.
“I don’t think we told anybody actually,” Scott says of the proposal. “It was somewhat cute and then we just got scared about like media and this and that and we were like, ‘Let’s just put the ring aside and we’ll talk about it another day.’ Never spoke about it again.”

However, that is the only time Scott has popped the question: As previously reported, the 33-year-old casually asked the mother of his children to marry him during a trip to Costa Rica earlier this year. “Scott proposed to Kourtney,” a source claimed. “Not with a ring. He just said, ‘Let’s get married.'”
“She told him no,” the insider added. “Scott was embarrassed, upset and angry.”
Oof. Maybe third time’s a charm.
