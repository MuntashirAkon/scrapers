Jennifer Aniston revealed that a Friends reunion probably wouldn’t work because of social media.
In an interview with Lorraine, the actress once again broke hearts by shooting down the possibility of a reunion.

That doesn’t mean Aniston isn’t grateful for the show. “Not only was it a gift for us, but it’s something people have been able to carry with them,” she said. “It’s comfort food and it makes them feel better when they are feeling down when they want to distract themselves.”
