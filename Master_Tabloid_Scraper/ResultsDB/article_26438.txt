Celebuzz is joining you in the kitchen as you tend to your Butterball for Thanksgiving dinner.

This week, two of our staff members demonstrated the simplicity of two recipes that were featured in our 5 Celebrity-Inspired Holiday Menus by cooking them on Celebuzz’s Facebook account, via Facebook Live, so press play to have some company as you prepare to feast.
First, Multimedia Content Producer Mia Lardiere made homemade Sweet Potato Gnocchi with Maple Cinnamon Sage Brown Butter from our Lady Gaga-inspired menu, which tasted and smelled like grown-up pancakes. Get the recipe here and watch the preparation in the video below.

Then, Staff Editor Jelani Addams-Rosa channeled Chrissy Teigen by making Teigen’s Roasted Cauliflower, Feta, & Orzo Salad from her first cookbook, Cravings. Purchase Cravings on Amazon and watch Jelani’s demonstration below.
