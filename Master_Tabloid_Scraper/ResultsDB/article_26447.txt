Usher Bids $80,000 on Photo at N.Y.C. Auction, Loses to Lorraine Schwartz/n
Usher isn’t afraid to cough up dough for charity.  
The singer bid $80,000 on a Richard Avedon photograph at the Gabrielle’s Angel Foundation Angel Ball in New York City on Tuesday night. But unfortunately for him, that wasn’t enough!   
Celebrity jeweler Lorraine Schwartz, who designed Kim Kardashian‘s engagement sparkler, outbid the hit maker and forked over $85,000 for the piece.   
And it was all for a good cause. Money from the auction will help fund cancer research, and celebs all came out to support the foundation. 
Pharrell Williams warmed up the crowd with a few songs including Robin Thicke’s hit "Blurred Lines." 
Hugh Jackman was front and center taking photos, while Williams’s new wife, Helen Lasichanh, danced across the room. Usher later joined Williams onstage, which prompted newlyweds Gabe Saporta and Erin Fetherston to hit the dance floor.   
Meanwhile, Beyoncé‘s mom, Tina Knowles, cut a rug with her date, actor Richard Lawson.   
“She looked amazing. They were like teenagers on the dance floor,” said an onlooker.   
The ball raised nearly $3 million.
