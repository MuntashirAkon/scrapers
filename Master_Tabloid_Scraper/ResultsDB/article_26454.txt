Orange Is the New Black's Vee (Lorraine Toussaint) will not be back. Repeat, you can stand down from your Vee red alert. Sources told E! News Toussaint will not be back for season three of the hit Netflix series, despite reports.When viewers last saw Vee on Orange Is the New Black, she had made her triumphant escape from Litchfield…only to get run down by Miss Rosa (Barbara Rosenblat) who had also escaped. At the 2014 Emmys, Toussaint told E!'s Marc Malkin that she thinks Vee is dead. She's moved on to ABC's Forever, but can death truly stop Vee?"I believe she's dead. She's dead. And she's such a survivor, it wouldn't surprise me—I wouldn't be surprised if she wasn't dead because I don't have much control over her…she's pretty dead…but it is Vee," Toussaint teased.

Next season of Orange Is the New Black will include some new and returning faces. Mary Steenburgen will play Pornstache's (Pablo Schreiber) mom, Mike Birbiglia and Fringe's Blair Brown will have new roles, and Lori Petty of A League of Their Own fame will reprise her role from the season-two premiere.Another person we won't be seeing? Pornstache himself. Schreiber has confirmed he'll be absent from the third season of the hit Netflix series. And despite pulling double duty on ABC's How to Get Away With Murder, we will see Matt McGorry's Bennett back in the prison."Generally speaking, I get to be present in both shows, which is sort of amazing," he told us this summer. "I am allowed to do both, which is incredible and I think ABC giving me permission to do that is really quite wonderful...It's too early to tell how it's going to work, but same way as Pablo Schreiber in season two, you can shoot things out of order. Thankfully, I get to do both."
