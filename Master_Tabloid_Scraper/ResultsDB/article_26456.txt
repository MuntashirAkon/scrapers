But stranger things have happened on Orange Is the New Black!

"We're not sure if Vee is dead," Toussaint told BuzzFeed in June. "She could be dead, she could not be dead. That's an open-ended question still. Isn't that a scary proposition? She might need to be dead. I don't know."Fellow Orange Is the New Black star Matt McGorry is pulling double duty, filming Orange Is the New Black season three and appearing on How to Get Away With Murder, ABC's new fall drama from Shonda Rhimes.TVLine first reported Toussaint's casting.Forever airs Tuesdays at 10 p.m. on ABC.
