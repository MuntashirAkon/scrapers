All hail the bling queen!Yes, Lorraine Schwartz certainly knows how to create a one-of-a-kind engagement ring as we've most recently been reminded thanks to Kim Kardashian's new 15-carat bling. But the E! Star isn't the only celeb to sport a special Schwartz sparkler on that finger.Other stars pals of the designer also turned to her when it came time to pick out an engagement ring.Most notably, Kanye West's bud Jay-Z. The rapper had an 18-carat flawless diamond created for his longtime love Beyoncé in 2008. The blinding bling is worth an estimated $5 million!

Then last year Ryan Reynolds scored a $2 million sparkler for Blake Lively. The pink diamond may not have been as pricey as the "Bow Down" singer's but it certainly was just as dazzling.Also opting for a bit of color in their diamond? Jerry O'Connell. The actor proposed to Rebecca Romijn in 2005 with a 6-carat yellow diamond created by the designer.The actress later changed the setting telling InStyle: "Since I had to get my ring resized when I was pregnant, I decided to change my settings with the help of my friend Lorraine Schwartz. There's something sexy about a diamond dangling from your finger."Well, who would argue with that?
