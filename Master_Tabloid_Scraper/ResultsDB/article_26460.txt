EXCLUSIVE! Jonathan Cheban Talks "Amazing" Kim Kardashian Engagement, Lorraine Schwartz Calls Kanye a "Genius"/n
Friends of Kim Kardashian and Kanye West are still gushing about the surprise proposal that went down last week.The E! star's bestie Jonathan Cheban experienced the engagement at AT&T Park in San Francisco firsthand, and tells E! News he was pretty much speechless when we caught up with him at the Gabrielle's Angel Ball to benefit blood cancer research."Gasp. And I don't gasp. I don't think I've ever gasped," Cheban said about the surprise proposal. "It was like the most amazing, surreal feeling so I'm happy that we all got to experience it and I'm happy that she got to experience it."

He also talked about that gorgeous 15-carat rock Yeezy gave to Kim, and compared it to the diamond Kris Humphries gave her in May 2011. "Well, it's quality over quantity. I mean, this ring is just crystal clear and spotless and nice. It's a royal ring, let's put it that way. You can't get quality like that."Speaking of the flawless ring, one of the main guest of honors at the event last night was Lorraine Schwartz, who designed the blingtastic sparkler on Kim's finger."They're just the most amazing people," she tells us of the newly engaged couple. "She's a really good person. She's beautiful, but as beautiful as she is on the outside, she's as beautiful on the inside. And Kanye, I mean, hey, he's a genius."â€”Reporting by James Chairman
