Lorraine Toussaint -- Is Vee on Season 3 of 'Orange Is the New Black'? I'm Here, Ain't I?/nLorraine Toussaint played it coy when we asked her if she was returning to  "Orange Is the New Black, " but as she pointed out ... we were talking to her right before SHE WENT ON SET!!!The woman who plays Vee wouldn't reveal details about her role for Season 3 as we talked to her outside Kaufman Astoria Studios in Queens. We're guessing there's a real fear she could be axed for real ... if she talks. Prison rules apply.A website reported today our story about Vee's return was bogus, but don't take our word for it ... just watch the video./n
