James Gandolfini Reflective As 'The Sopranos' Nears End/nBy DAVID BAUDER, AP TELEVISION WRITER Tony Soprano can be tough on James  Gandolfini, too.   "It's a dark, dark world and you're in it a lot, " the star of   "The Sopranos " said of his career-defining character.  "However,  if you're in a dark world, I can't think of any other to be in.  There are a lot of pluses. It just takes a heavy toll sometimes. "  Gandolfini was reflective on Friday talking about  "The  Sopranos, " which returns to HBO on March 12 after a hiatus three  months shy of two years. Fans are eager for something new, yet  Gandolfini is in the midst of filming the last several episodes.  Seated on a stage with co-stars Edie Falco, Lorraine Bracco and  Michael Imperioli, Gandolfini noted that only Bracco had much  success prior to the series and many of the show's actors went  through the whirlwind of sudden fame.   "It's been an incredible life lesson that a lot of us wouldn't  have had without this opportunity, " he said.  "It teaches you  about what's important. "  The actors, and series creator David Chase, did a delicate dance  with reporters in trying to say something but ultimately reveal  nothing about the final season. Twelve new episodes will start in  March, and a final eight in January 2007. Repercussions from the jailing of New York mob boss and rival  Johnny Sack will define the new season, along with Tony's  reconciliation with Carmella. Julianna Margulies, who plays a real  estate agent; Hal Holbrook, who plays a businessman ensnared by the  mob; and Ben Kingsley, who plays himself, are among this season's  guest stars.  Although there have been false alarms about  "The Sopranos "  ending in the past,  "it does feel like the end this time, "  Gandolfini said.   "It's made me think of how I approach work and make sure that  you work just as hard now as you did in the beginning, " he said./n
