Aniston, 48, “is encouraging them to get pre-marriage counseling but acting as a sympathetic ear in the meantime, helping with ideas for spontaneous date nights and recommending tricks that helped her and Justin through troubled times,” explained the insider.
As Radar reported, Cox, 53, and McDaid, 41, have been going back and forth on tying the knot for quite some time, disagreeing on everything from where they should hold the ceremony to where they should set up a home together.
