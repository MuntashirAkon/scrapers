Angelina Jolie's Cooking Lies! 'She Can't Even Fry An Egg'/n
Angelina Jolie may have claimed in her recent Vanity Fair interview to have taken up cooking as a hobby, but a source tells RadarOnline.com that it’s all a facade — and the super thin actress actually loathes the kitchen!
“She says she’s taking cooking lessons but the truth is she can’t cook and doesn’t want to. She fed people this line a few years ago. Angie can’t even fry an egg or cook pasta and she burns toast,” our snitch spills.
Jolie, 42, is said to be such a disaster of a cook that her 11-year-old daughter Shiloh has to step in from time to time.

The source says Shiloh will help her famous mother make something digestible for her brothers and sisters. “Angie often usually leaves the cooking to the housekeeper or does takeout. She really doesn’t even like food.”
The insider recalls, “Remember when Angie cooked and ate bugs in Cambodia for a news segment. She thought she was top chef but she should think again. People were grossed out. No one wants to dine at her house.”
