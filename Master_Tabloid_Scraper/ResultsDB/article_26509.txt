Jersey Shore: Where Are They Now?/n

America's favorite fist pumpers are back!!!
It's finally Sunday, and that means E! is reuniting the Jersey Shore cast for a special road trip reunion. While Snooki, Jwoww, Pauly D, The Situation, and Sammi Giancola have all mellowed out a ton, they're still the boardwalk dwellers we know and love!
Although, it's currently unclear if fellow Shore alums Ronnie Ortiz-Magro, Deena Cortese, Angelina Pivarnick, and Vinny Guadagnino will make an appearance on the special.
Nonetheless, be sure to discover what they've all been up to ahead of 9:30 pm ET premiere of Reunion Road Trip: Return To The Jersey Shore. You know you're curiousâ€¦
