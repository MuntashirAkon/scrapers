Sources connected to the couple tell TMZ that the divorce is forthcoming, as both sides are hashing out child custody and property settlements.
The insiders said the reconciliation rumors were completely fabricated — specifically the false claims that Brad cleaned up his drinking problem to impress Angie.
In actuality, it's reported the War Machine star made an effort to get clean so he could  get joint custody of his kids!
The image rehabilitation came after the Maleficent actress made damaging allegations against Brad, claiming he was abusive to their kids — another reason why the two aren't looking to reconcile.
R.I.P. forever, you beautiful power couple.
