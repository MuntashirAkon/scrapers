Maybe Amber Rose finally broke that dry spell.

Just days after admitting she hasn’t has sex with anyone in 2017, the How to Be a Bad B*tch author was spotted heading home with rapper 21 Savage. The couple looked awfully cozy as they left a concert in Los Angeles.
Via TMZ:
We got them Thursday night walking out of the Belasco Theater where there was a hip-hop showcase. They got into his red Ferrari, and since it only seats 2 … the math was looking good for a hookup.
See a video of them together over at TMZ…
