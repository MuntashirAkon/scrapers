Contrary to popular belief, Amber Rose doesn’t sleep around.

The How to Be a Bad B*tch author joked about her sex life — or lack there of — on Instagram this week. Sharing hilarious meme, Amber revealed she hasn’t gotten laid in a very, very long time.
“When it’s six months into 2017 and you still haven’t been f*cked yet,” the image read.

Amber, who broke up things off with Dancing with the Stars pro Val Chmerkovskiy in the beginning of this year, added in the comments that she’s not as sexually active as people would think. Though she was rumored to be dating Diddy’s adopted son, Quincy, the mother-of-one confessed to being too occupied with work for romance.
“When the world thinks you have Orgies all day and mad dudes because ur sexually confident and body positive but really you’re a full-time mom/ businesswoman and literally have no time for penis,” she wrote, before adding, “#hoeislife tho.”
Last year, Amber admitted she was even too busy to play with herself, telling Allure, “I wish I had the time to masturbate every day in reality, but I don’t.”
“I say a lot of those things on [The Amber Rose Show] because I am very sex-positive,” she added. “I do say those things in a way where I am very serious, but it’s also a joke.”
