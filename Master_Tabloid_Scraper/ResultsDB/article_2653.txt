 Moving On: Zendaya Rocks Sleek New Red Carpet Look After ‘Fashion Police’ Debacle.../n
Zendaya Coleman unveiled a sleek new hairstyle at the Nickelodeon Kids’ Choice Awards on Saturday in her first major red carpet appearance since the Fashion Police debacle over her dreadlocks.
The Disney star, 18, seemed to know her black bob resembled a combination of the Egyptian queen and a Pixar Incredibles character, captioning her photo on Instagram, “Giving Queen Cleopatra + Edna Mode + 70’s realness.”
Coleman, styled by Law Roach, stood out in her yellow striped DKNY top and pencil skirt, red Stuart Weitzman heels, and gold jewelry.
As RadarOnline.com readers know, it was a far cry from her Oscars look in which Coleman sported dreadlocks, causing Giuliana Rancic to joke on Fashion Police that her hair looked like it smelled of “patchouli oil” and “weed.”

After Coleman said the comments offended her, a racist controversy erupted around Rancic, who apologized (the teen star accepted). 
But the fallout was intense as Rancic’s Fashion Police co-stars Kelly Osbourne and Kathy Griffin quit the show.
Then E! announced that Fashion Police, with only Rancic and stylist co-host Brad Goreski remaining, was going on hiatus until September. 
For her part, Coleman wants to put the controversy behind her and recently shrugged to Entertainment Tonight, “I just like to change my hairstyle every time I walk on a red carpet.”

But was the former Dancing with the Stars competitor drawing attention to herself again with her drastically different Kids Choice Awards look?
