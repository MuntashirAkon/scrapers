Jon Voight's Mother's Day Wish for Angelina Jolie On Heels of Family Reunion Dinner/nJon Voight is patching things up with Angelina Jolie, and he took time to send her a warm Mother's Day greeting.    We got Jon Saturday night leaving Mastro's Steakhouse, when we asked about his Mother's Day plans he basically made a video greeting card for his daughter. Makes sense ... the longstanding tension between them's been cooling. Jon had a sushi dinner with Angelina and 4 of his grandkids last week in Bev Hills. They were seen leaving out a back door within moments of each other.    Whatever the reason for the reunion -- Jon says he just wants to keep the love train rolling./n
