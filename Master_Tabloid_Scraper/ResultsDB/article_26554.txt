Hayden Panettiere Childhood NY Home Hits The Market/nThe home Hayden Panettiere was living in when she was breaking into showbiz as a child star is now on the market for $1.75 million. The crib's in Palisades, New York ... a ritzy suburban enclave where Angelina Jolie grew up, and stars like Bill Murray, Diane Sawyer and Al Pacino have also lived. Hayden's folks bought the 4 bedroom, 3.5 bath home in 1995. It sits on a quaint suburban lot, surrounded by trees and it's just a short walk away from the Hudson River. Interesting timing on the sale ... Hayden's parents went through a nasty 8-year divorce that finally ended last April. It's unclear whether mom or dad gets the dough from the house. It's still registered in both their names.  Fun fact: When her folks bought this place, Hayden was playing Sarah Roberts on  "One Life to Live " ... at the age of 6!/n
