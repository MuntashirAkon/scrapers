Brad Pitt Attacker Vitalii Sediuk -- Bonkers for Bongos/nThere's one thing Brad Pitt's attacker Vitalii Sediuk goes crazy for -- even more than A-list celebs -- random guys playing bongos!Sediuk was spotted in Griffith Park ...  dancing and playing the maracas while performing his court-ordered community service ... we don't think this is what the judge had in mind.Sediuk pled no contest for his attack of Pitt on the red carpet last month. He was ordered to stay away from Pitt and Angelina Jolie and has to do 20 days of community service ... which we're pretty sure does not include dancing./n
