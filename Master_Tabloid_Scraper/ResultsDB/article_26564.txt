Jennifer Aniston & Angelina Jolie -- Together At Last  ... In the Same Photo/nWe're gonna need a bigger room ... is what Critics' Choice Awards planners must have been saying with Jennifer Aniston and Angelina JolieÂ showing up at the same event for the first time in years.The ex and current Mrs. Pitt were actually photographed together -- several dozens of feet apart -- in a wide shot of the room ... making it clear someone (who wants to remain employed) was careful to seat them as far away as possible from each other.We're told there were no chance run-ins between them during the show -- their first close encounter since the 2009 Oscars. For the record ... both women lost last night. Although Justin Theroux was with Jennifer ... Angie was riding solo. Brad's no dummy./n
