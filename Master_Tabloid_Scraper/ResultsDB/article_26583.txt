Janet Jackson Is Getting $200M From Her Split Thanks To THIS Genius Loophole/n
Janet Jackson tricked her husband into a mind-blowing $200 MILLION divorce payout — by giving birth!
Radar has exclusively learned the pop diva’s prenup with billionaire
Qatari businessman Wissam Al Mana guaranteed her $100 million if their marriage lasted five years.
But insiders dished the “Control” singer and Wissam agreed she’d pocket double that amount
if the couple had children!
In January, on the fifth anniversary of their secret marriage, Janet gave birth to a baby boy —
and on April 10, news broke that  they were splitting up! /n
