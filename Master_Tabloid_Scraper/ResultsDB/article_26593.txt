Twitter Reacts To Donald Trump Banning Transgender People From Serving In The Military!/n

UPDATE 1:36 P.M. EST: More celebs have reacted to POTUS' gross tweets. They've been added (below). Scroll to check them out!
Donald Trump wants to beef up our military at any cost‚Ä¶ except the cost of transgender troops, apparently.
On Wednesday, the president announced that after consultation with "Generals and military experts" ‚Äî aka Mike Pence and his buddies from gay conversion camp, probably ‚Äî trans service members would no longer be able to serve in the U.S. military.
POTUS cited the "tremendous medical costs and disruption" trans troops require as the reason behind his decision, which many responders pointed out was an utter load of bullshit.

Unsurprisingly, Trump's announcement launched missiles of outrage on Twitter. Critics pointed out that not only was the decision unnecessary and discriminatory, but it also completely undermined the readiness of the U.S. military.
Also, kicking out 15,000 service members willing to fight for their country is without a doubt the least patriotic thing we've ever heard. Then again, so is Trump's MAGA scam.

Banning transgender people from serving our country is simply wrong. We should be so grateful to anybody who wants to serve!

My heart breaks today for the bigotry this monster continues to put forward. Trans people are NOT a burden in ANY capacity.

I know transgender service members and vets who have done more to serve their country than @realdonaldtrump has in his entire life.

.@POTUS' short-sighted and discriminatory policy against transgender service members will make America less safe. https://t.co/NoVl94lDiE

This transphobia cannot be tolerated. They are human beings too and they deserve to represent their country just like anyone else

Mr. President, transgender soldiers have been fighting and dying for our country IN OUR MILITARY. You should thank them for their service.
‚Äî Rep. Ted Deutch (@RepTedDeutch) July 26, 2017


Transgender servicemembers aren't a distraction, they are dedicated patriots. We welcome their service & honor their love of country. #LGBT

I can't think of a less patriotic stance than telling people who are willing to fight and die for this country that they're not welcome

There are many ways to serve our communities/countries. Trans folk have done vital work, putting bodies on the line unlike @realDonaldTrump

What a difference a year makes. Trump's decision to ban #transgender service members is unpatriotic, cruel & disastrous to our security. pic.twitter.com/myVnR9xc7O

His admin. will stop at nothing to implement its anti-LGBTQ ideology - even if it means denying some of our bravest the right to serve.
‚Äî GLAAD (@glaad) July 26, 2017


Furthermore, this puts the careers of patriotic transgender Americans on the line who want nothing more than to serve their country.
‚Äî GLAAD (@glaad) July 26, 2017

We should be grateful to the people who wish to serve, not turn our backs on them. Banning transgender people is hurtful, baseless and wrong

ALL those who defend our right to live freely should be able to serve freely! There are THOUSANDS currently serving! #ProtectTransTroops
