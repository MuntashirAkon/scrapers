Janet Jackson is breaking her silence about her split with husband Wissam Al Mana.

In a video message shared on her Facebook Monday night (May 1, 2017), the singer gave fans an update about her life since welcoming her newborn son, Eissa, and the dissolution of her marriage that followed.
“Hey, you guys, it’s me, Jan — just in case you don’t recognize me, ’cause I have put on quite a few since I had the baby,” she began. “But I thank God. I thank God for him, you guys. He is so healthy, so beautiful, so sweet, so loving, such a happy baby.”
The 50-year-old went on to address her separation, confirming reports that she has parted ways with Al Mana after almost five years of marriage. She told viewers, “I just want to keep it real with you guys for a second. Yes, I separated from my husband. We are in court and the rest is in God’s hands.”

However, Jackson’s biggest news was that she’s resuming her tour after postponing it in 2016 due to her pregnancy. Rebranded as The State of the World Tour, it will kick off in September.
“I’m so excited, you guys, so excited. I decided to change the name of the tour — State of the World Tour,” she shared. “It’s not about politics, it’s about people, the world, relationships and just love.”
She added, “I cannot wait to see you on stage. September 7th.”
