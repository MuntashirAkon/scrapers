Kylie Jenner and Tyga are keeping their distance at Coachella following their split earlier in the month.

Jenner spent time with rapper Travis Scott at Jeremy Scott’s Moschino x Candy Crush party on Saturday, Apr. 15 in Indio, Calif.
According to People, Jenner and Travis arrived at the party at 2:45 a.m. and made a beeline straight for the VIP area. A source tells the magazine, “Kylie and Travis made their way to a private table, where they were joined by friends and enjoyed the deejay. After five minutes of being in a very crowded space, Travis got up and left the table, and Kylie followed him out with her friends following close behind her.”
Travis and Jenner have been spotted together frequently since Jenner broke up with Tyga at the beginning of April. One source says this might be her way of sparking Tyga’s jealousy.
“[Travis] and Kylie have also been friends for a while and they all hang out,” says the source. “When she and Tyga are having drama, she tries to make him jealous by hanging out with other guys.”
