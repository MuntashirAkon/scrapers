The break in Janet Jackson’s relationship with Wissam Al Mana was only thought to be a separation up until Tuesday (Apr. 11, 2017), when movers showed up to remove Al Mana’s belongings from their home in London.

TMZ reports:
Movers showed up at their London home and carted away boxes and suitcases.
As we reported, the couple separated in January, just a week or so after their baby was born.
Our sources say the split appears permanent, despite the statement only confirming a separation. The moving trucks seem to accentuate this is more than temporary.
