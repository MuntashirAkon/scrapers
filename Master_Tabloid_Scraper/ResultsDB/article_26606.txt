Naming the incorrect Best Picture winner wasn’t the only thing that went wrong during Sunday’s Academy Awards. This year, plenty of things slipped through the cracks, resulting in one disaster after another.

For instance, someone who is very much alive was accidentally featured in the ceremony’s In Memoriam segment. Still-living Australian producer Jan Chapman’s photo was mistakenly included in a tribute to late costume designer Janet Patterson.
“I was devastated by the use of my image in place of my great friend and long-time collaborator Janet Patterson. I had urged her agency to check any photograph which might be used and understand that they were told that the Academy had it covered. Janet was a great beauty and four-time Oscar nominee and it is very disappointing that the error was not picked up,” Chapman told Variety by email. “I am alive and well and an active producer.”

Chapman had previously worked with Patterson in The Piano. Patterson passed away in October 2016.
Others also noted that some celebrities who passed in 2016, including Florence Henderson and Garry Shandling, were not included in the tribute. Bill Paxton, who died over the weekend as a result of complications due to surgery, was only mentioned by presenter Jennifer Aniston.

Meanwhile, Moana star Auli’i Cravalho was hit in the head with a prop during her performance of the Oscar-nominated song, “How Far I’ll Go,” in the telecast.
“What is wrong with me?” Cravalho sang before a flag brushes with the side of her head. Like a true professional, the 16-year-old closed her eyes, brushed the gaffe off and continued singing.

A meme was born when the internet noticed the strange way Nicole Kidman was clapping throughout the night. Looking like someone who doesn’t want to mess up their freshly painted manicure, the Lion star was quickly roasted by Twitter.

Many spectators also observed the irony in Brie Larson, who won an Oscar in 2016 for her portrayal of a rape survivor in Room, presenting an award to Casey Affleck, a man who was accused of sexual harassment by two women in 2010. Though it is tradition for the previous year’s Best Actress winner to hand out the golden statuette to the current year’s Best Actor winner (and vice versa), many thought the situation was just awkward AF.
The tension was further exasperated when Larson, a known advocate for sexual assault victims, refused to clap for Affleck when he went on stage to accept his award. Needless to say, Twitter took notice.

It was also pointed that Larson had to do it twice — once at the Golden Globes and again on Sunday night — during this awards season.

lol proof that hollywood hates women: they made brie larson, an advocate for victims of sexual assault, give casey affleck an award…twice

Given the circumstances, it was then no wonder Chrissy Teigen decided to nap through Affleck’s acceptance speech.

I think my favorite part of the Oscars so far has been Chrissy Teigen sleeping on John. She is my spirit animal. pic.twitter.com/bgabC5fmqM
