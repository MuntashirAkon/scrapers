You want a hot body? Well, look no further than Britney Spears’ last performance.

The “Slumber Party” singer suffered a huge wardrobe malfunction during her Las Vegas show at Planet Hollywood on Wednesday night (Feb. 1, 2017). While performing “Work Bitch,” Spears’ cleavage-baring bodysuit shifted to the side, exposing her left boob as she bounced around on stage.
Like a true professional, Spears ignored her nip slip and continued on with the show—and fans were LIVING for it. [Warning: NSFW video below.]

This wasn’t the first time she had a slip-up with her outfit, too. Last year, while performing at the same show, Spears’ bra strap broke off during a dance number for “I Love Rock & Roll.” Days before that embarrassing gaff, Spears’ leotard unzipped itself and accidentally exposed the songstress’ thong.
It seems a Piece of Me is certainly living up to its name!
