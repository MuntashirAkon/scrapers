Janet Jackson’s family just got a little bigger!

The singer has welcomed her first child — a boy — with husband Wissam Al Mana. A rep for Jackon confirmed the happy news to People, releasing a statement reading, “Janet Jackson and husband Wissam Al Mana are thrilled to welcome their new son Eissa Al Mana into the world.”
“Janet had a stress-free healthy delivery and is resting comfortably,” the spokesperson added.
In October, Jackson confirmed her pregnancy by sharing a photo of her budding baby bump, saying in a statement, “We thank God for our blessing.” Months before, the 50-year-old announced that she was postponing her world tour indefinitely due to family planning.
Jackson and Al Mana got married in 2012 after dating for two years.
