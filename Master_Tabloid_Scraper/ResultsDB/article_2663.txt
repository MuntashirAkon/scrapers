Omarosa Isn't The ONLY Reality Star We Want To Return To TVâ€¦/n

Reality TV has churned out many a D-lister!
Still, some breakout stars remain with us more than others. So we can't help but wonder what our favorite MIA reality personalities have been up to these days!
We mean, earlier this summer it was revealed that Omarosa Manigault is now engaged to pastor John Allen Newman! Not to mention, The Apprentice alum is also working for Donald Trump again as she is the Director of African American Outreach for his presidential campaign.
Aren't you just DYING to have cameras follow her around as she juggles working for Trump and planning a wedding? It sounds like a marvelous train wreck to us!
Although, Omarosa isn't the only reality TV star we want back on the silver screen! Ch-ch-check out the full list for yourself (below)!
