Janet Jackson Announces New Tour Dates After Taking Time Off /nJanet Jackson is headed back on the road after taking nearly a year off ... during which she had a kid and separated from her husband. Janet acknowledged she gained some lbs during her pregnancy and confirmed what we already knew ... that she's separated shortly after the baby was born. She also said she's changed the name of the tour from Unbreakable to The State of the World Tour. Janet said the tour will resume Sept. 7th, but she didn't say where.
