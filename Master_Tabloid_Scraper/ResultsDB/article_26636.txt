Janet Jackson Takes Brother Randy to See Bruno Mars Concert/nJanet Jackson took a break from baby duty to treat one of her older brothers to a Bruno Mars concert. Janet and Randy Jackson were spotted at the show earlier this week in Birmingham, England. Janet tried to keep a low profile with a ball cap pulled down low -- of course, the giant bodyguard standing over her was a little conspicuous.  Just found another moment of the talented @JanetJackson enjoying the talented @BrunoMars concert last night....fantastic atmosphere. 😍 pic.twitter.com /kHIc08oILl — Sharon O'Malley (@SharonOMalley7) April 26, 2017  One concertgoer said Janet wasn't dancing around much, but still seemed to be enjoying the music. It's interesting, because her life is kinda drama-filled right now: divorcing Wissam Al Mana, raising 3-month-old Eissa, not to mention her mother Katherine Jackson's recent legal ordeal. Everyone needs a night off. We meant Janet ... not Randy./n
