Janet Jackson Separation Date May Have Prenup Implications/nJanet Jackson's split from husband #3 may have significant financial implications. Both Janet and Wissam Al Mana are wealthy, but he far more than she. He has an estimated net worth of $1 billion. She's worth an estimated $175 mil.  Janet, who had a prenup with husband #2 Rene Elizondo, almost certainly had a prenup with Al Mana. Such prenups are typically structured -- so the longer the marriage, the bigger the settlement. Prenups typically have 5 and 10 year marks, which trigger more money in the pot to be divided. Janet announced in February, 2013 that she had gotten married a year earlier.  Given the date of her reported separation from Al Mana, it seems to be almost exactly at the 5 year mark of marriage. The couple just had a baby in January, which may also have prenup implications./n
