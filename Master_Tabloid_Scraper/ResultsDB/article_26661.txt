A particularly painful incident that was captured on film was her split after 72 days from Kris Humphries.

“I think there’s always an evolution of, you know, what you want to do in life. It’s all about finding things that really excite you and motivate you and spark you all over again,” she explains. “I’m realizing that no matter what, if you go into something with all these expectations and plans, once you’re actually living it, it could be completely different.”
