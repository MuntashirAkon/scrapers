Kim Kardashian is working hard for that star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame that she has vowed to score one day!
The reality bombshell, who ironically made her big screen debut in Tyler Perry’s Temptation: Confessions of a Marriage Counselor, right after splitting from Kris Humphries her second husband after just 72 days of “wedded bliss,” is featured in a brand new trailer for the film – and RadarOnline.com has the video and details.

The 32-year-old, who not only has a speaking part but is also credited with a starring role in the film, plays Ava, a sexy, snarky matchmaker who wears skintight bandage dresses. The movie also stars Friday Night Lights star Jurnee Smollett, Vanessa Williams and Brandy Norwood.
As RadarOnline.com previously reported, Kardashian revealed in an interview earlier this year that she would like a star at the famous Hollywood landmark.

“I think there was a quote where somebody said that reality stars will never get a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame,” the reality star told V magazine. “So, of course I’m so competitive that I think that it would be a huge achievement and a goal that anyone would want. I would love to break that mold.”
