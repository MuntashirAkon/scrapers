Ashton Kutcher Spotted Out With New GF And They … OMG! What's Wrong With His Face?!/n

Ashton Kutcher has mutated! Quick! Call Professor X! Shield him from Magneto! Save the cheerleader actor, save the world!
Okay, now that we got that nerd moment of out the way…
Following a visit with Demi Moore before she left rehab, Ashton was spotted with a very different lady on Sunday afternoon. Laughing and chatting away, Ashton spent time with "friend" and screenwriter Lorene Scafaria, hitting up the popular game spot, Ultrazone with some friends. While they kept some distance from each other and there was no visible signs of PDA, sources are still claiming that Lorene is Ashton's new gal and that their fling is fully endorsed by their mutual friends.
But let's get down to what is really happening in this picture. What the hell is growing on Ashton's face? Has he stopped bathing? Is that one hell of a black eye?
Oh! We see it now! It's facepaint! He's recapturing his youth with a little finger painting on his face. How … adorable? Juvenile? Precocious? 
Any of those will do!
