Ashton Kutcher Brought Adam Brody's Ex To Madonna's Oscar Party!/n

It's becoming pret-ty clear that there's something going on between these two!
Back in December, we had heard that Ashton Kutcher and Adam Brody's ex-GF Lorene Scafaria spent the holidays in Italy together. We had ALSO heard that the two hooked up before the Ashton/Demi split!
Soon after that, Ashton and Lorene's reps said that the two are "just friends" and that they are "working on a potential project together." Ha!
Sure enough, we've just learned that Ashton brought his "friend" Lorene to Madonna's Oscar party, and it sounds like they were acting like more than just work buddies at the event!
We'll keep an eye out for more updates about Ashton and Adam's ex! Eventually, these two will have to admit that this is MORE than just a friend thing!
Stay tunedâ€¦
