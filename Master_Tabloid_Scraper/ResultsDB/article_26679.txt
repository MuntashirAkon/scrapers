Are Ashton Kutcher And Adam Brody's Ex JUST Working Together???/n

Even if this is true, romances are born out of work all the time! Just ask Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone!
Last week, we heard reports that Ashton Kutcher spent the holidays with Adam Brody's ex-GF Lorene Scafaria in Italy.
We had ALSO heard that the two hooked up BEFORE Ashton split with Demi!
At the time, both Ashton and Lorene's reps (of course) said the two were "just friends," and now Ashton's rep is saying that the two are working together:
"They are just friends. They are working on a potential project together about an Italian soccer team."
POTENTIAL project? Are they sure it's not a "potential project" about a newly single Two and Half Men star hooking up with Adam Brody's ex-girlfriend??? LOLz!
All jokes asideâ€¦do U think Ashton and Lorene are really just work buddies???
