R.I.P., Kate Moss.

Sweetie dahlings! Break out the Bollinger: the international trailer for Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie is finally here.
It’s been years since we last saw Edina Monsoon (Jennifer Saunders) and Patsy Stone (Joanna Lumley), the pair of aging social climbers who last debauched small screens in 2012 for a series of holiday and Olympics specials. But, babes, they’re back! The movie, set to hit theaters July 1, 2016, brings back together the entire core cast of the beloved show, including Saunders, Lumley, Julia Sawalha (as Edina’s long-suffering daughter, Saffron), Jane Horrocks (who played several characters throughout the run of the original series, but most famously Edina’s inept assistant, Bubble), and June Whitfield (Edina’s mother, also known, not-so-affectionately, as “Old Woman.”)

Also making appearances in the film: Kate Moss, Lily Cole, Jourdan Dunn, Suki Waterhouse, Rebel Wilson, Jon Hamm, Stella McCartney, Alexa Chung, Dame Edna, Joan Collins, and many, many more. The movie was written by Saunders, who wrote all episodes of the original series, and directed by Mandie Fletcher.
Plot-wise, we’re looking at a classic Eddie and Patsy scandal: the pair is forced to retreat to the French Riviera after an incident in which they may or may not have accidentally killed Kate Moss by knocking her into the Thames river. In their wake, predictably, follows a trail of sex, drugs, drinking, smoking, shouting, Stella McCartney harassment, and misusing the word “pariah.”
Again, Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie hits theaters July 1, which should provide you sufficient time to plan your spectacular premiere outfit.
