Ashton Kutcher Spent The Holidays In Italy With Adam Brody's Ex-GF!/n

Is Ashton Kutcher a three woman one-woman man once again???
Back in August 2010, Ashton was still with Demi Moore, and Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist screenwriter Lorene Scafaria was still with Adam Brody.
Oh, how times have changed!
We've just learned that Ashton spent the holiday weekend with Adam's ex-GF in Italyâ€¦AND we're hearing that Ashton hooked up with her BEFORE he split with Demi! Scandal! 
All drama aside, it sounds like the two had a nice weekend with each other, in which they did lots of sight-seeing and stayed at a "private pad" together.
We're also hearing that the two "held hands" while enjoying lunch at Pizzeria Trattoria Toscana in Pisa during their romantic Christmas Eve together.
Of course, both their reps are saying that they're "just friends," but it definitely seems like there's something more going on here! At the VERY least they're friends with some serious benefits! Ha!
What do U think? Do U approve of this potential new couple???
