Last week, Kunis and Kutcher enjoyed a formal dinner at Italian eatery Giorgio Baldi’s in Santa Monica, Calif.
Speculations of the two stars dating first emerged in April when Kunis and Kutcher reportedly spent a weekend together in Carpinteria, Calif. — an oceanside town, south of Santa Barbara.
“They have been close friends for years and there has always been a lot of chemistry,” a friend of the couple, who did not want to be identified, told Celebuzz earlier this year.
“Whenever they are in between relationships, or aren’t seriously dating anyone, they tend to spend more time together.”
However, the source say that neither is ready for a serious romance.
“But at the end of the day, they are great friends and have a lot of fun together,” the insider added.
