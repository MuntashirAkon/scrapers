 Out with the old, in with the new (Twitter name)!
Demi Moore, who has been a long-time user of the popular social network, was previously known as @mrskutcher but in light of her split from Ashton Kutcher, has been looking for a new Twitter handle. Well, after some thoughtful consideration, it looks like the 49-year-old actress has settled on a new name.
Any guess as to what it could be?

It’s @justdemi. Nice and simple. We approve!
She tweeted:
So hard finding a name that was fun somewhat playful and available. So for now it will be @justdemi It could grow on me!

Before their split in November of last year, the 33-year-old Two and a Half Men star and Demi were known for their numerous Twitter lovefests, gushing over how in love they were. However, after a number of infedility rumors on Ashton’s part, the two officially went their separate ways last year, after six years of marriage.
While Ashton has been off spending time with ladies such as screen writer Lorene Scafaria as well as his That 70’s Show co-star Mila Kunis, Demi checked herself into a treatment center earlier this year.

After checking into a facility to help with her health, Demi took a Twitter break that lasted about three months, but she is definitely back with a vengence.
