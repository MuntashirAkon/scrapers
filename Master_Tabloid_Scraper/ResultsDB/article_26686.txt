Asthon Kutcher Grabs Coffee With Mystery Blonde in L.A. (PHOTOS)/n
He’s been linked to Rihanna and Mila Kunis recently, but on Tuesday, Ashton Kutcher stepped out with a mystery blonde. The newly single Two and a Half Men star grabbed some iced coffee alongside a female friend in Los Angeles, Calif., and per usual, the romance rumors are starting. 
Dressed casual in a plaid shirt and jeans, Ashton, 34, looked quite platonic with his gal pal who stood arms length away from the actor as they headed out of the coffee shop. 
Celebuzz confirmed this week that Ashton was not dating his former That ’70s Show costar Kunis. 
On Sunday, April 15, Ashton and Mila were seen grabbing a sushi dinner together in Studio City, Calif. — which led some to declare a new couple alert. A spokesperson for the actress, 28, said of the relationship rumor: “They’ve been friends for years and they had dinner with a bunch of friends. They’re not dating.”
Earlier this year, the actor — who split from Demi Moore, 48, in 2011 — was rumored to be dating screenwriter Lorene Scafaria, who was with Ashton over the holidays in 2011, and was apparently more than “just friends” in March as the two were said to be openly affectionate during an outing, Us magazine reported.
What do you think? Is Ashton dating any of these women, or is he just good friends with these ladies? Let us know, below.
