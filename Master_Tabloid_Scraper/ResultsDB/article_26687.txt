 Looks like these two are (remaining) in the friend zone!
On Sunday, April 15, Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis, who starred together on That ’70s Show for seven seasons, were seen grabbing a sushi dinner together in Studio City, Calif. — which led some to declare a new couple alert.
While they played a cute couple on TV, that’s about it!
Mila’s rep confirmed to Celebuzz that the 28-year-old Friends With Benefits star is nothing more than a close friend of Ashton, 34.

The spokesperson said: “They’ve been friends for years and they had dinner with a bunch of friends. They’re not dating.”
So, there you have it!
Two and a Half Men star Ashton split from Demi Moore, his wife of six years, in November, 2011. Since, Ashton was rumored to be dating screenwriter Lorene Scafaria – and was even linked to pop star Rihanna.
In 2002, Mila started dating Macaulay Culkin but the couple parted ways in 2010.

Despite the romance denial, you’ll get to see this cute pair together again soon: on the small screen later this year, when they reunite with the cast of That ’70s Show, for FOX’s 25th anniversary broadcast.
Do you think they’d make a good couple in real life? Sound off in the comments!
