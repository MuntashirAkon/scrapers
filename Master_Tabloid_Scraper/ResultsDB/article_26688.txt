 Although Ashton Kutcher has been romantically linked to screenwriter Lorene Scafaria, the actor was riding solo as he attended the Los Angeles Lakers basketball game yesterday.

Since splitting with Demi Moore, Ashton has been linked to several women, including Rihanna. But he has been spending lots of quality time with Lorene. First spotted together in Italy over New Year’s Eve, the Two and a Half Men actor and the Hollywood writer, 33, were spotted heading to a party in Los Angeles, Calif. a few weeks ago.
Both done up with face paint, the two boarded a party bus and ended up at a laser tag facility, the London Daily Mail reports.
