 After taking some time to heal herself, Demi Moore is back at home and getting it together.
“Demi is in a much better place,” a source tells People. “She has been working on herself a lot.”
After reportedly seeking treatment at Utah’s Cirque Lodge the actress went on vacation to the Caribbean, where she was able to relax and find that better place. The source adds that “she is content,” now that she’s back. 
During her rehab stay, estranged husband Ashton Kutcher supposedly visited Demi, but according to a source for People “they are not getting back together.”
Allegedly, Ashton has moved on with screenwriter Lorene Scafaria,  who was with Ashton over the holidays, and the two appeared to be very  affectionate during a recent outing. The actor only went to visit the  Demi in Utah was because “he knew it was important to her daughters,”  says the source.
