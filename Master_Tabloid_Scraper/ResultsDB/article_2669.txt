This is going to be major.

Jennifer Hudson will star in NBC’s forthcoming televised adaptation of Hairspray Live!, as announced by the network on Monday Apr. 25. Hudson will take on the role of Motormouth Maybelle, the owner of a local record store, while Harvey Fierstein will reprise his spot as Edna Turnblad, the role that earned him an Tony Award in 2003 while the show was on Broadway. Fierstein will also be writing the teleplay.
“We are beyond thrilled with this incredibly talented duo of stars for Hairspray Live!” said NBC exec Robert Greenblatt. “Harvey Fierstein created the role of Edna Turnblad on Broadway in an indelible Tony-winning performance that demanded to be memorialized on film, and we’re happy he wanted to step into her shoes one last, unforgettable time.”

“We’re also so grateful that the incomparable Jennifer Hudson will play Motormouth Maybelle, and we know her rendition of ‘I Know Where I’ve Been’ will literally stop the show,” Greenblatt added.
Hudson will wrap up her current on-stage engagement in The Color Purple on Broadway on May 8.
