Demi Moore may be back in Los Angeles, but daughter Rumer Willis was hanging with Ashton Kutcher Tuesday night. 
After testing the waters the past few weeks at Jason Scoppa’s weekly Thursday night Sessions show at The Sayers Club, Rumer, 23, performed on her own Tuesday in Hollywood, impressing clubgoers with her voice. Rumer covered, “High Low Middle” by My Brightest Diamond, “I Cant Stand the Rain” by Ann Peebles, “Age” by Lianne La Havas and “Sitting on the Dock of the Bay” by Sara Bareilles.
While Demi steered clear of the club scene, the actress’ ex Ashton, 34, came and stayed for the entire performance.

Witnesses tell Celebuzz the two hung together in a booth before the 23-year-old got on stage, and that Ashton couldn’t have been more supportive.
“He looked really proud,” says the onlooker. “He was smiling the entire time, and he even sang along to parts.”
