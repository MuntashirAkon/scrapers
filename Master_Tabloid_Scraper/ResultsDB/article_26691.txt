 Following news that he had visited his estranged wife Demi Moore at a treatment facility, Ashton Kutcher, 33, stepped out with his alleged new leading lady. First spotted together in Italy over New Year’s Eve, the Two and a Half Men actor and Hollywood writer Lorene Scafaria, 33, were spotted heading to a party in Los Angeles, Calif. on Saturday. 
Both done up with face paint, the two boarded a party bus and ended up at a laser tag facility, the London Daily Mail reports. Matching Lorene’s hair, Ashton paired his orange shoes with a belt of the same color and a blue and orange baseball cap. 
So who is Lorene Scararia?
The writer is best known for working on Michael Cera and Kat Denning’s romcom Nick & Nora’s Infinite Playlist, and she’ll also embark on her directorial debut in the movie Seeking A Friend for the End of the World.
