 Although Demi Moore entered in Utah’s Cirque Lodge alone, her choice to seek treatment was widely supported by friends and family — including estranged husband Ashton Kutcher. The Two and a Half Men actor reportedly visited Demi during her time in rehab but, according to a source for People, “they are not getting back together.”
Allegedly, Ashton has moved on with screenwriter Lorene Scafaria, who was with Ashton over the holidays, and the two appeared to be very affectionate during a recent outing. The actor only went to visit the Demi in Utah was because “he knew it was important to her daughters,” says the source.

She is recuperating alone in a villa at Parrot Cay, which is heavily guarded by security and is only accessible by boat. Her two children, Rumer, 23, and Tallulah, 18, are staying with her ex-husband Bruce Willis while her other daughter Scout, 20, is away at Brown University.
