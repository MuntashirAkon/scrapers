 With his estranged wife out of rehab and on vacation in the Caribbean, Ashton Kutcher isn’t waiting for the ink to dry on their divorce papers before moving on. 
Screenwriter Lorene Scafaria, who was with Ashton over the holidays, is apparently more than “just friends” as first reported. The two were said to be openly affectionate during a recent outing, Us magazine reports.  
“They were affectionate,” a source at Norman Lear’s X Prize charity event says. “When they thought no one was watching, they held hands, and she rubbed his back and his neck.”
According to sources, Ashton hooked up with Lorene prior to splitting from wife Demi Moore.
