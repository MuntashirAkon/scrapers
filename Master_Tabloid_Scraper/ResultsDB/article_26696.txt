Ashton Kutcher: Has He Moved On from Demi Moore?/n
About a month after his split from Demi Moore, Ashton Kutcher spent the holidays with writer-director Lorene Scafaria in Italy.  
And one other person – Kutcher’s business partner, Matt Mazzant.  
The Two and Half Men star, 33, is making no secret of his time with Scafaria, whom online reports note bears a passing resemblance to Moore.
“Roman holiday with homies,” writes Kutcher on Twitter along with a photo of him and Scafaria, showing Mazzant squeezed in between.  
Scafaria wrote Nick and Nora’s Infinite Playlist and is the writer-director of the upcoming Steve Carell/Keira Knightly comedy Seeking a Friend for the End of the World.
Moore, meanwhile, spent Christmas Eve dancing at a poolside bar at the Parrot Cay resort in the Caribbean. The actress, 49, was vacationing with daughter Rumer Willis, according to the New York Post.
