Leighton Meester Is Dating Adam Brody  /n
It looks like Leighton Meester is getting a taste of Orange County, Calif.  
The former Gossip Girl star, 26, who has been an N.Y.C. staple, is dating former The O.C. star Adam Brody, 33, sources confirm to PEOPLE.  
Reps for the actors have not commented, and both have kept their private lives out of the spotlight over the years.   
In 2010, Meester briefly addressed her “really hard” split from Sebastian Stan, saying, “I was really sad when it ended, but that’s what taught me a lot about myself and love and life – and that’s good.”  
Brody most famously dated O.C. costar Rachel Bilson. They split in 2006, and the actor most recently publicly courted screenwriter Lorene Scafaria in 2011.  
Meester and Brody reportedly became close after costarring in the film The Oranges.
