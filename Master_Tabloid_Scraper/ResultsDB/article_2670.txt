Britney Spears may have a new man in her life.
The singer was spotted enjoying a date with restaurant mogul Harry Morton on Friday night (Sept. 11, 2015) in Studio City, Calif. In photos obtained by TMZ, Spears is sitting at the dinner table at Iroha Sushi with Morton.
The 33-year-old and her boyfriend of eight months, Charlie Ebersol, decided to call it quits on in June. Spears has no been linked to anyone since and considering Morton happens to do a lot of business in Las Vegas, where Spears just extended her residency contract, this relationship could work.

While we don’t know much more about the date than that, we do know that Morton has been linked to other celebrities, including Linday Lohan, Jennifer Aniston, and Hayden Panettiere. In fact, he even accused LiLo of flooding his condo out of revenge.
Meanwhile, Lohan sparked some concern because of her lengthy, incoherent rant on Instagram on Saturday night (Sept. 12, 2015). The actress called Michael Jackson her “real only private friend” in the post, while also asking Allah for forgiveness.



they always come back. I love you NYC 💋they always come back. I love you NYC 💋 #godblesstheworld #michaeljackson #rip miss you as my real only private friend. For you: god, for all hurts and wrongs, please let me forgive, Allah please let me be forgiven, and all forgive themselves. Please and thank you. (Someone I was with the night before several towers fell, it felt like not a curse, but more like a spell.. What we think in America is not always clear, we don’t have @peta commercials / you just kill deer….with this being said, I’m a girl with a reputation mislead… Like a diamond in the rough, you, now, for 25 years have seen me on TV and screen.. So i am programmed 🔺to stand tough. Black or white – in life, rather than love we create a fight of an ideal situation of an unexceptional, yet unacceptable future that @TMZ @Eonline @HarveylevinTMZ & #harveyweinstein ..couldn’t and wouldn’t even care to describe any thought of the people we forget to help when a franchise film comes out and, If money means more than freedom- than stay in California. If helping others is a passion, talk to angelina jolie… If you want to be a brilliant actress, work wth Meryl Streep …at the end of the day- republican or democrats — BE HERE NOW @oprah and live with integrity. Or go to sleep. The most beautiful life comes cheap. Stop fighting and using artists for distractions. It’s boring… 🙏 #UnitedNations
