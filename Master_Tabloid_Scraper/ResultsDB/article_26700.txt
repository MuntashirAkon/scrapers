He’s ready for the spotlight again.  
Ashton Kutcher has been added to the roster of presenters for the 47th Annual Academy of Country Music Awards. It’s one of the first award show appearances for the Two and a Half Men star since splitting from wife Demi Moore in November.

Marc Anthony, Jake Owen, Grace Potter, LeAnn Rimes and Eli Young Band (whose frontman, Eli Young, recently revealed he’s expecting his first daughter) have also been added as presenters, along with Liam Hemsworth, LL Cool J, Zac Brown and KISS.  
The ACM Awards will be broadcast live from Las Vegas on Sunday, April 1, on CBS at 8 p.m. ET., and PEOPLE.com will be live-blogging all the action!
