Ashton Kutcher Bound for Outer Space/n
Here’s one way of getting away from it all: sub-orbit the solar system. And Ashton Kutcher is all ready to don his astronaut suit.  
“Great news today from our Astronaut Relations team at Virgin Galactic: our 500th future astronaut customer has just signed up! Even better news is that number 500 is Ashton Kutcher,” Virgin Galactic’s founder, Richard Branson, trumpeted on his blog Monday.  
Added the entrepreneur, “I gave Ashton a quick call to congratulate and welcome him. He is as thrilled as we are at the prospect of being among the first to cross the final frontier (and back!) with us and to experience the magic of space for himself.”

Although no specific date has been set for the space trip, the price tag has been: $200,000 for a round trip.   
Virgin Galactic’s SpaceShipTwo rocket plane, which is being tested at the Mojave Air and Space Port now, could conceivably be in the air next year.  
Says Branson: “Ashton is joining a fast expanding group of true pioneers who are on their way to a life changing experience and a place in the history books. It’s great to have him on board.”
