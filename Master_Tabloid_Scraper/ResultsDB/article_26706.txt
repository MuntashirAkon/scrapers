Sophia Loren Hospitalized/n
This we know: Oscar-winning screen siren Sophia Loren is in a New York hospital. Her publicist confirmed as much to E! Online Friday.             But why she's there is another story--or stories, depending on who's talking.            If you believe New York Daily News gossipmongers Rush and Molloy, then the 63-year-old former pinup is in New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center recovering from a heart attack. The Daily News claims Loren suffered "shortness of breath" Thursday while visiting a plastic surgeon friend.            Meanwhile, Access Hollywood quotes an unnamed source as saying Loren is in the cardiac care unit in stable condition.            But a hospital spokesman tells Associated Press the heart attck story is just "a hot rumor."            And Loren's Los Angeles rep, Beebe Kline, insists the situation isn't so dire. Kline says Loren told her she was going into a New York hospital for a few days for "observation." (What kind of observation, we're not sure--Loren's a fiercely private person.)             As for a heart attack? "If something had happened, I would have heard," says Kline.
