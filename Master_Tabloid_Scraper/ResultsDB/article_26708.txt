Step 3: Contour cheeks with a liquid bronzer.Step 4: Highlight the high points of the face with a peach-colored liquid luminizer to create a soft glow.

For Eyes:Step 1: To start, paint the eye from brow bone to lid with a flesh-colored eye shadow as a base.Step 2: For eyeliner, map out the top and bottom lash lines with a black liner, like Lancôme Le Stylo Waterproof Long Lasting Eyeliner in Noir Intense.Step 3: Dot the inner corner of the water line with a kohl eyeliner in white.Step 4: Swipe the top lash line with a kohl eyeliner in a midnight blue shade, and then layer a swipe of navy cream shadow, like Giorgio Armani Eye Tint in #2, over that.Step 5: For a final layer, trace a shimmery, blue shadow, like Giorgio Armani Eyes to Kill Quad in #5, over the top, layered line.
