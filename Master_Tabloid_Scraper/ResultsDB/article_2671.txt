After three seasons, FOX pulls the plug on fan-favorite The Mindy Project and the devoted viewers aren’t shying away from their anger on social media.

Even though Hulu is in talks to acquire the show for two more seasons, the deal is uncertain leaving social media to react from GIFs to fans expressing their feelings including Mindy Kaling herself.
The 35 year-old comedian posted a video on Instagram of the scenic view of Montana and ends it with her smiling and winking. We’re hoping it’s a sign of hope that the show will continue and the viewers will get to see a Lahiri-Castellano baby.

The viewers are not playing, though, about being upset over the news.
