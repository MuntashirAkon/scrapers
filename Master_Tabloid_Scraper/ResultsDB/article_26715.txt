By Debbie Emery – Radar Reporter
Tootsie star Jessica Lange has made a big comeback on the small screen over the past year in American Horror Story, but the beautiful blonde looks very different to how fans of the Dustin Hoffman classic comedy remember her.
“Is Jessica Lange’s face an ‘American Horror Story’ of plastic surgery?” quipped tongue-in-cheek celebrity plastic surgeon Dr. Anthony Youn, who has not treated the actress, in an exclusive interview with RadarOnline.com.

“Not really, but I suspect that she’s had a good amount of work done over the years,” he explained, in response to the startling transformation of the 63-year-old actress who plays Constance Langdon on the creepy FX series.
“Her high and arched eyebrows cause me to believe she’s had a browlift. Her taut neckline is a possible sign of a well-done facelift,” Dr. Youn told Radar.
“I also believe she’s had her eyelids done, as they don’t appear to show any of the sagging skin or puffiness of typical woman her age.
“Although I think Jessica looks different, there’s no denying that she looks younger than her age!” concluded the expert.
