'Gossip Girl' Leighton Meester Buys New $1.5 Million Home/n
By Amber Goodhand – Radar Reporter
Gossip Girl star Leighton Meester has purchased a $1,457,500 home in Southern California and RadarOnline.com has all the photos of her new pad.
The modest 2,847 square-foot, four-bedroom house was built in 1948 and sits in the Encino area of the San Fernando Valley — the same place newlyweds Nick Lachey and Vanessa Minnillo just bought a home.
The outdoor space features a pool, cabana with a kitchenette and bathroom, and a built-in barbecue.

Leighton, 25, filed a lawsuit against her mother, Constance Meester, in July claiming she used money meant for her brother’s medical bills to get cosmetic surgeries for herself.
As RadarOnline.com was first to report, Leighton is very close to her younger brother, Alexander, and is determined to get him out of their mother’s home and live with her instead.

Leighton spends her time in New York City where she films her hit CW show, so a purchase in Los Angeles — where her mom and brother live — might be a way for her to keep a closer eye on her brother.
