By Amber Goodhand – Radar Reporter
Leighton Meester is suing her own mother, and it seems she’s not the only one in her family who’s had their day in court.
RadarOnline.com has exclusively uncovered numerous drug-related arrests and mug shots against her mother’s sister, Leighton’s aunt, Judy McNelis.
McNelis, 68, was arrested in Florida in 1998 on felony for possession of marijuana over 20 grams and possession of narcotic paraphernalia.

Leighton’s aunt pled not guilty and after 16 months of hearings and court appearances, prosecutors opted to discontinue the criminal charges with a trial.
Most recently, McNelis was arrested in Arizona on similar charges.
According to the court case papers obtained by RadarOnline.com, she was arrested on April 20, 2011 on charges of marijuana possession and drug paraphernalia possession.

Once again, McNelis — who was then going by the surname Haas — pled not guilty and once again, the case was dismissed without prejudice.
As RadarOnline.com previously reported, Leighton filed a lawsuit on July 22, 2011 against her mother, Constance Meester, claiming she’d used money the actress sent home to pay for her younger brother’s medical bills, on cosmetic surgeries for herself.

Drugs have always been prevalent in the Gossip Girl star’s life — her mother was in federal prison on charges of smuggling marijuana from Jamaica when she was given special release for three months to give birth to Leighton.
