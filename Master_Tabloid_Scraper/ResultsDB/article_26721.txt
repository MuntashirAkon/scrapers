“They’re all playing themselves. I can’t reveal too much. Bobby has something to do with mine and Ari’s story line, Denise has to do with Adrian’s storyline and Clay has something to do with Drama’s storyline.”
And now that plans for a film version are well on their way, Zimmer, says the cast have not had time to morn the fact that the longstanding show is almost over.
“It’s bitter sweet,” she said of the eighth and final season. “But I think there is such a sense of hope and knowing that we’re going to do a movie that I think once the movie is done, that’s going to be really sad.

“And you know all the guys are friends in real life, so they are all going to hang out and we’ll see each other.  But I’ll be just sad to see the characters go away once the movie is done.”
The final season is set to start on Sunday, July 24.
