Elizabeth Glaser was the wife of actor Paul Michael Glaser. She created the foundation after she contracted HIV during a blood transfusion and unknowingly passed the virus on to her daughter, Ariel, through her breast milk and to her son, Jake in utero.
Ariel died in 1988 and Elizabeth lost her battle in 1994. Amazingly, Jake is now 26 and healthy.  He’s also active in raising money to fight the disease that cost him his mother and sister.
