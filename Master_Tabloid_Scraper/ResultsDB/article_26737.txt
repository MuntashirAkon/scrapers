If You Hate Casey Affleck, Then You'll LOVE This Movie Where He's Covered In A Sheet Almost The Entire Time!/n

There's still a lot of controversy surrounding Casey Affleck.
Obviously, the man is talented as he just won the Best Actor award at the 2017 Oscars for his work in Manchester By The Sea. However, Ben Affleck's younger brother's sexual harassment scandal from 2010 resurfaced in late 2016 — which made many people angry that the 41-year-old is still booking jobs.

So, if you're feeling conflicted about where you stand in the anti-Affleck debate, we found a film which may appease both sides. A Ghost Story made waves at the Sundance Film Festival back in January, as Casey is under a white sheet for most of the film. No joke!
The film, directed by David Lowery, opens with a man (Affleck)'s death following a car accident and follows him as he watches over his former life… all while under a white sheet. Still don't believe us? Ch-ch-check out the inneresting trailer for yourself (below)!
