‘The Simpsons’ Says Goodbye to Edna Krabappel/n
Last night’s The Simpsons paid tribute to Marcia Wallace and her character Mrs. Krabappel. Wallace passed away in October and the show immediately announced it planned to retire her character. The episode started with Bart writing “We’ll really miss you Mrs. K” on the school chalkboard.
The episode then ended with Mrs. Krabappel on her desk, screaming her signature laugh one last time.
