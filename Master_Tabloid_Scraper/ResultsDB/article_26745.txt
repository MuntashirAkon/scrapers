All of Hollywood stopped by the glamorous event.

Oscar-winner Leonardo DiCaprio hosted the third annual Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation gala in St. Tropez, France to raise money for environmental research and awareness by holding a charity auction.
DiCaprio pulled out all the stops for the special night; Lana Del Rey, The Weeknd and Andrea Bocelli performed. Just a few items on the auction block were the actor’s own Rolex, diamond cufflinks that he wore the night we won his Academy Award, and a seven-night stay at his Palm Springs home.
This year, the charity event raised a whopping $45 million dollars, a serious step up from the $15 million raised last year.
All of DiCaprio’s pals attended the glitzy affair including Bradley Cooper, Jonah Hill, Edward Norton, Tobey Maguire, Chris Rock, Mariah Carey and Bono.
But we can’t forget about the models! Joan Smalls, Doutzen Kroes, Lily Donaldson, Naomi Campbell and Constance Jablonski all made an appearance.



Last night in St Tropez before the LDF gala. I was there on behalf of the @elephantcrisisfund and @savetheelephants and I hope we raised a lot of money and awareness for our beautiful planet❤️ #ldfgala2016 #leonardodicapriofoundation 📸@moalturki
