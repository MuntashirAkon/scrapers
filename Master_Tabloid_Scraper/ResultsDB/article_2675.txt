‘The Simpsons’ Will Retire Mrs. Krabappel/n
In the wake of Marcia Wallace’s tragic passing, The Simpsons’ showrunner Al Jean has decided to retire her iconic character, Mrs. Edna Krabappel. Wallace passed away last Friday at 70. Before she was Bart’s teacher on The Simpsons, she was the receptionist Carol Kester on The Bob Newhart Show.
In a statement released today, Al Jean announced that there will not be another voice for Mrs. Krabappel, but the character will be retired instead. In a bit of tragic timing, it was previously announced that one of the show’s major characters would be killed off this season, and in the statement, Jean explained that Wallace’s death and Mrs. Krabappel’s retirement are “unrelated” to that earlier plan.
Mrs. Krabappel has been a part of The Simpsons family since its second episode and both she and Marcia Wallace will be sorely missed.
