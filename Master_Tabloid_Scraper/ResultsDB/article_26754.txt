Constance Wu is fighting back against Hollywood's diversity issue. In response to The Great Wall, an upcoming Matt Damon-starring film that follows the actor as a warrior traversing the historic Chinese fortification, the Fresh Off the Boat actress penned an emotional statement on Twitter regarding her discontent over character stereotypes. "We have to stop perpetuating the racist myth that a only white man can save the world," Wu wrote, adding, "It's not based on actual fact. Our heroes don't look like Matt Damon. They look like Malala. Ghandi. Mandela. Your big sister when she stood up for you to those bullies that one time."
