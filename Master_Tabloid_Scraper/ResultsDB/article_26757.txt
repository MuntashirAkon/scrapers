Constance Zimmer is trading in her walkie talkie for something a little more lethal.E! News has confirmed that the UnReal villain we all love to hate just landed a role on Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Zimmer is set to recur on ABC's comic book series in the upcoming season three, first appearing in the season premiere which takes place after a time jump of a few months.And here's the best part: she might be a villain on this show too! Zimmer will play the mysterious head of a government organization...and she will be Coulson's (Clark Gregg) latest adversary. 

Now, as all S.H.I.E.L.D. fans know, if someone is Coulson's foe, that doesn't necessarily make them a bad guy. Remember the late Gonzales (Edward James Olmos)? Sure, he was Coulson's enemy (at first) last season, but he was ultimately working towards the same goal as the S.H.I.E.L.D. team we know and trust. He even thought he was leading the "real" S.H.I.E.L.D.!So Zimmer (who is currently causing some real hell as a manipulative, morally-questionable producer on Lifetime's scripted drama about a Bachelor-like reality show) might not be some Hydra-type on S.H.I.E.L.D. this season. But hey, we can dream, can't we?Zimmer's other TV credits include Entourage, House of Cards and Grey's Anatomy.Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. season three premieres Tuesday, Sept. 29 at 9 p.m. on ABC.EW first reported this casting news.
