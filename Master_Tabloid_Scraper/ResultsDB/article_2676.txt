 Though Daniel Radcliffe revealed he quit drinking a few months ago, it seems that his partying ways spilled over into his work life.
In an interview with British magazine, Heat, (via Reuters), the 22-year-old Harry Potter superstar said, “I have a very addictive personality. It was a problem. People with problems like that are very adept at hiding it. It was bad. I don’t want to go into details, but I drank a lot and it was daily – I mean nightly.”
The actor, who is currently starring in the thriller The Woman in Black, then admitted there are some scenes in the Potter franchise where he indeed had been drinking.

“I can honestly say I never drank at work on ‘Harry Potter.’ I went into work still drunk, but I never drank at work. I can point to many scenes where I’m just gone. Dead behind the eyes.”
Back in July, D-Rad admitted that his drinking had gotten out of control, and quit in order to lead a more relaxed lifestyle.
Daniel is currently happily dating Rosie Coker, and talked to Parade about his love life recently and said:
“When Rosie’s here, every day seems better….I’m not an easy person to love. There are lots of times when I’m a very good boyfriend, but there are times when I’m useless. I mean, I’m a mess around the house. I talk nonstop. I become obsessed with things. This year it’s fantasy football, which means Rosie has to listen to me talking 24 hours a day about this team. ‘Should I take this player out, do you think, darling?’ And she listens to it, and she loves me for my oddness, my awkwardness, all of those things that I hate about myself. She finds them cute. I guess that’s love.”
