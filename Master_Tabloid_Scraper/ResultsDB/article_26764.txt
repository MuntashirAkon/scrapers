It's the most wonderful time of the year for the TV geeks and award show buffs in your life. Yes, it's Emmy nominations time.The 2017 Emmy nominations will be announced on Thursday, July 13 (watch them right here with E! News at 11:30 a.m. ET) by Veep's Anna Chlumsky and S.W.A.T.'s Shemar Moore, but we're going to let you in on a little secret. Many of the names below in our predictions are sure to wake up to a barrage of calls and texts congratulating them on another well-deserved accolade.

Every once in a while, a show comes in and shakes things up and with Game of Thrones out of the way, there are big holes in several categories that should allow some newcomers into the race.Below, check out our predictions for who will get the special honor and who the wildcards are that could be making for very interesting races.
