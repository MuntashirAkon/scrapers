“It’s so relevant right now,” Baillio says of the body confidence message at the center of the 1960s-set musical. “I think this is a good time for Hairspray to be a thing.”
She adds that, by playing Tracy, “I want to be an inspiration to girls just like me. I want them to know: Don’t let anybody stop you from following your dreams. Don’t let anybody tell you you’re something that you’re not. Go for your dreams, and if you work hard enough, you can achieve them.”
Hairspray Live! airs Dec. 7 on NBC.
