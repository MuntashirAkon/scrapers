Teresa Giudice and Melissa Gorga skipped last year’s show after the epic cast trip to Vermont — but they made sure not to miss out on this year’s fundraiser honoring Aaron Anderson.3 of 12    What an amazing event for a great cause by @poschebykimd - not only to raise money but the endless amount of donations that came In like diapers, toys and clothing for the young babies of these 2 families who suffered a tremendous loss. NO PARENT SHOULD HAVE TO BURY A CHILD! I am honored to have met both family members of these wonderful boys who lost their lives so tragically and to be part of this event. The place was sold out & the icing on the cake was getting to walk down the runway with my bff @dolorescatania ♥️♥️♥️♥️ If you want to send unwrapped toys, diapers, or clothes for a 5 year old girl, a 18month old boy and a newborn baby, please send items to POSCHE 99 West Allendale  Ave. Allendale NJ 07401 A post shared by Siggy Flicker (@siggy.flicker) on May 4, 2017 at 7:31am PDT
