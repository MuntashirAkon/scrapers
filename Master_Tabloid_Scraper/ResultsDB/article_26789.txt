Only One Other Accuser Allowed To Testify In Cosby Sex Assault Trial, Judge Rules/n
A judge will allow only one additional accuser testify at Bill Cosby‘s sexual assault trial, RadarOnline.com has learned.
The ruling, on Friday morning, blocks prosecutors from calling upon 12 other women as “prior bad act” witnesses.
As Radar readers know, former Temple University employee Andrea Constand accused Cosby of drugging and molesting her near her Philadelphia home in 2004.

When the case was reopened in 2015, it was also revealed that Cosby confessed to giving women Quaaludes before having sexual encounters with them in depositions taken in 2005 and 2006, during Constand’s original lawsuit. At the time, DA Bruce Castor promised not to criminally prosecute Cosby.
“When you got the Quaaludes, was it in your mind that you were going to use these Quaaludes for young women that you wanted to have sex with?” Constand’s lawyer at the time, Dolores Troiani, asked Cosby during the 2005 trial.
“Yes,” Cosby answered.

Later in the deposition, the comic described putting his hands down Constand’s pants: “I don’t hear her say anything. And I don’t feel her say anything. And so I continue and I go into the area that is somewhere between permission and rejection. I am not stopped.”
Of course, Cosby maintains that all encounters were consensual, despite dozens of women coming forward to accuse him of drugging and raping them over the last several decades.
The trial is set to begin in June.
