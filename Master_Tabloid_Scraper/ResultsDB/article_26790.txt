Jac Axed?! Laurita's 'RHONJ' Fate In Limbo After Her Nastiest Season EVER/n
Jacqueline Laurita may not see another paycheck from The Real Housewives of New Jersey, RadarOnline.com can exclusively reveal.
As the Bravo show begins filming its next season, “Jacqueline has not been asked back yet!” an insider told Radar.
“The speculation is that Bravo is holding off because of all of her nasty infighting last season, which has continued behind the scenes even since they wrapped,” the source explained. “Of course, it could be that she would return later on in the series, if she’s not dropped altogether. Nobody ever knows with Bravo!”

Laurita returned to the show last season after bowing out to focus on caring for her autistic son, Nicholas, 7. Desperate to secure her spot, she began to pick fights with Dolores Catania, Melissa Gorga and Teresa Giudice.
She infamously called Giudice a “criminal” during their horrific trip to Vermont, for example, and a season-long feud ensued. Their friendship ended almost immediately, and the seasonconcluded with Giudice blaming Laurita for her problems with the IRS.
Laurita also resurfaced “Strippergate” to rile up Gorga, alleging she may have been an exotic dancer, which Gorga always denied. She even later accused Catania of making her look bad in one scene.

Now, Laurita is fighting with her ex-lawyers over $290,000 in legal fees and owes the State of New Jersey nearly $340,000 .
She documented her financial woes on the show — but it wasn’t enough to save her job.
