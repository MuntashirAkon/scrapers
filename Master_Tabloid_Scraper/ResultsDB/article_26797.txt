Out With The Old? 'RHONJ' Season 8 Cast Revealed!/n
The Real Housewives of New Jersey just wrapped the season 7 reunion, but RadarOnline.com can already reveal what’s to come for season 8!
A source close to the show told Radar exclusively that Bravo will resume filming the hit show this spring — with Teresa Giudice, Melissa Gorga, Siggy Flicker, Dolores Catania and Jacqueline Laurita in tow.
“I think they’re looking for two more,” the source said, noting the break in filming was scheduled for drama to brew.

The source added that Kim DePaola is in talks to receive a full-time contract this season after she exposed Joe Giudice for cheating at the Posche fashion show.
The insider claims that Bravo execs would want her to “pull the masks” off of Giudice and Gorga’s fake relationship as well.
“They [producers and DePaola] are going to be in talks this month,” the insider said.

Radar previously reported that DePaola was in talks to join the cast for season 7 as an added source of drama. She did not receive a contract, but Laurita brought her on anyway.
The insider also noted that “there are major shakeups at Bravo” behind the cameras.
“Some of the producers, they want to get rid of because they’re very political,” the insider said. “They play favorites and that’s really messed up.”
