Beyoncé‘s multiple miscarriages weren’t the only revelations found on Jay-Z’s new album. According to the song “Smile,” the rapper’s mother is a lesbian.

Gloria Carter came out as gay in 4:44 duet with her son, opening up about her sexuality and all the years she spent hiding her identity.
“Mama had four kids, but she’s a lesbian / Had to pretend so long that she’s a thespian / Had to hide in the closet, so she medicate / Society shame and the pain was too much to take / Cried tears of joy when you fell in love / Don’t matter to me if it’s a him or her / I just wanna see you smile through all the hate,” Jay-Z rapped.
Gloria jumped in with a spoken passage of her own as the track’s outro, saying, “Living in the shadow / Can you imagine what kind of life it is to live? / In the shadows people see you as happy and free / Because that’s what you want them to see / Living two lives, happy, but not free / You live in the shadows for fear of someone hurting your family or the person you love / The world is changing and they say it’s time to be free / But you live with the fear of just being me /Living in the shadow feels like the safe place to be / No harm for them, no harm for me.”

“But life is short, and it’s time to be free / Love who you love, because life isn’t guaranteed / Smile,” she added.
Gloria raised Jay-Z and his three siblings — Andrea Carter, Eric Carter, and Michelle Carter — as a single mother in Brooklyn. She’s since been praised by GLAAD President and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis for sharing her story.
“Lesbian women are all too often erased or excluded from narratives surrounding LGBTQ people,” she said in a statement. “By sharing her truth with the world, Gloria Carter is increasing visibility of lesbian women of color at a critical time and sending a powerful message of empowerment to the entire LGBTQ community that is perfectly timed with the end of Pride Month.”
