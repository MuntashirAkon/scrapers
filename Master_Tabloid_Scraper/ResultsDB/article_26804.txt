Jenni Rivera's Estate Sues Univision For Defamation Over TV Series/n

The late Jenni Rivera's life has been turned into TV show fodder â€” and her estate is not having it.
Jenni Rivera Enterprises has filed a lawsuit to the tune of $10 million against Univision over the TV series Su Nombre Era Dolores, La Jenn Que Yo Conoci ("Her Name Was Dolores, the Jenn That I Knew") which began airing last month.

The series is based on a tell-all book written by Pete Salgado, who was Rivera's on-again/off-again manager for several years.
However, according to court documents, Salgado had signed a non-disclosure agreement, and is now in breach of that contract due to his association with the show.
The estate further asserts that some scenes from the series are defamatory towards Jenni and her five children.
In case you missed it, Univision released a trailer (below) for the show back in December: 

Do YOU think it paints Jenni in a negative light??
