Danielle Staub Is Returning To New Jersey Next Season… But Only As A Friend Of The Real Housewives!/n

Make new friends, but keep the old — one is silver, and the other… is a prostitution whore!
Real Housewives of New Jersey infamously waited an entire year to film Season 7 in order to keep Teresa Giudice in the cast, but the results were still a little more boring than we would have liked.
Luckily for fans of all things Bravo, however, Season 8 already sounds twice as entertaining… because we're hearing Danielle Staub herself will officially be back on the show next time around!!!

Our casting suspicions were confirmed by Real Mr. Housewife on Wednesday, whose industry insiders claim the mother-of-two will be back for the first time since her devastating Season 2 departure, saying: 

"At this point, the show is not interested in bringing her on as a full-time Housewife. Rather, they see Danielle returning in a role of a friend of the Housewives."
We'll take whatever guaranteed drama we can get!
We're hoping Dani's demotion to "Friend of" will play out similarly to Claudia Jordan role's on RHOA – getting bumped up to main cast after proving herself within the first few episodes.
