Teresa Giudice Calls Jacqueline Laurita A 'F*cking Crazy B*tch' As Husband Chris Continues Fraud Drama At RHONJ Reunion!/n

Reunited and it feels so… f*cking crazy.
Teresa Giudice made the difficult decision to return to Real Housewives of New Jersey this year despite spending 11 months behind bars for fraud — and we're happy to say she survived the season… so far!
Sunday night marked Part 2 of the Season 7 reunion, and while Joe Giudice wasn't there to defend himself — he's currently on month nine of his own 41-month sentence — Andy Cohen invited the other House Husbands onto the show to get their sides of the story.

Unfortunately for Tre, that meant facing both Jacqueline Laurita AND Chris Laurita — two against one!
We already saw Teresa throw Jac and Caroline Manzo under the bus for alerting the feds to her husband's illegal dealings… but Chris made some serious allegations of his own against Joe during his moment in the spotlight.
It's just too bad for him that wasn't about to keep Teresa from calling his wife a "f*cking crazy b*tch" — with rabies, no less! LOLz!!
Sorry, Jac… Teresa will always be the star of the show.
Ch-ch-check out the highlight of Sunday night's RHONJ (below)!!!
