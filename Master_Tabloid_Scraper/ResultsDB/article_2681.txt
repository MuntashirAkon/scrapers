Warning: Dame Edna Is Coming/n
Calling her season on Broadway “a most poignant experience” — and even offering to spell “poignant” for some reporters at her press conference — Dame Edna Everage yesterday announced the closing of her successful one-woman show, “Dame Edna: The Royal Tour,” to take place on July 2. Not to worry: this fall, the hilariously edgy Australian-born TV star, monologist and egoist (whose alter ego is the very male Barry Humphries) will take her act on the road across her “new, adopted homeland,” though she admitted at the press gathering at Sardi’s that she has no idea where Seattle is. This Sunday, Edna will receive a special award at the Tonys. She’ll also present the costume award, which, given her outlandish costumes, only seems right.
