 Soccer superstar Cristiano Ronaldo and his model girlfriend of five years, Irina Shayk, have ended their relationship.
The pair began dating after meeting on the set of an Armani ad in 2010.
A rep for Irina Shayk confronted the rumors head on and said in a statement to Us Weekly:

We can confirm Irina Shayk has ended her relationship to Cristiano Ronaldo of five years. She has been close with his family throughout the course of their relationship. Any negative rumors with regards to Irina and the Ronaldo family are completely false, and have not been a factor in the cause of the spilt. Irina has no further comment at the time.

Now said to be untrue, some people were saying that Cristiano broke up with Irina because she chose not to attend his mother’s surprise 60th birthday party.
Cristiano and Irina, both 29, had recently posed nude together in a steamy photo shoot for Vogue Spain in June 2014.
However, the couple have been facing rumors of a break-up over the last couple of months after making several public appearances without one another. The Real Madrid player didn’t attend Shayk’s film premiere for Hercules in July, nor did they spend New Year’s Eve together.
This past week, Irina was absent from Cristiano’s annual FIFA Ballon d’Or in Zurich. He instead attended with his mother, Maria Dolores dos Santos Aveiro, and son, Cristiano Jr., whom he fathered with an unidentified woman.
