What The Real Housewives of New Jersey Has Taught Siggy and Dolores About Themselves/n
The Real Housewives of New Jersey went to Vermont and nothing will ever be the same. After Jacqueline Laurita and Teresa Giudice rebuilt their friendship, everything came crumbling down at a disastrous dinner of sushi and chicken wings (apparently that's a thing in Vermont?) where just about everybody screamed at one another. Jacqueline left and the next day Siggy Flicker and Dolores Catania also took their leave, leaving Melissa Gorga and Teresa to enjoy their snow bunny activities. What can viewers expect now?"Tension," Siggy told E! News.Yikes.

The Real Housewives of New Jersey newbies are still getting their feet wet with the drama, but Dolores said there's nothing she regrets saying on-camera. Siggy on the other hand…"I went into such a state that I don't remember what I said," Siggy said about last week's episode. "I broke down, it was like I had enough…"Dolores assured her she wouldn't regret anything and revealed the ladies don't say things just for drama. "We don't try to say things to be cool or corny, every single person on our cast for New Jersey…we're not trying to be funny, we just are," Dolores said. "We're not trying to be cool, we just are…"

Siggy chimed in that being on the show has taught her about herself."It's so authentic and so real that I have to say this experience has also taught us a lot about ourselves…I love the fact that I'm more relatable," she said. "I'm not perfect and if anybody tells you they're perfect, they're full of s—t."The Real Housewives of New Jersey airs Sundays, 8 p.m. on Bravo.(E! and Bravo are both part of the NBCUniversal family.)
