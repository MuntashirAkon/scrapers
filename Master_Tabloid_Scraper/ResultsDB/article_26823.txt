Meet The Real Housewives of New Jersey's New Breakout Stars Siggy Flicker and Dolores Catania/n
There are some new faces in the Garden State. Bravo's Real Housewives of New Jersey is returning after a nearly two-year hiatus following Teresa Giudice's prison sentence and along for the ride with Teresa are veterans Melissa Gorga and Jacqueline Laurita and newcomers Siggy Flicker and Dolores Catania. But don't expect any Real Housewives newbie awkwardness. "We're both a lot alike. I have history with every single person on the cast," Dolores told E! News."That's key," Jacqueline added.Dolores has known Teresa and Jacqueline for years. "She gets me and I get her," Teresa said of her friend she made in her 20s.Meanwhile, Siggy was a friend of Jacqueline's before being added, but whatever beef is happening between Jacqueline and Melissa and Teresa didn't stop them from embracing her.

"Siggy was Jacqueline's friend and she has a lot of energy. She owns the room when she walks in…She's got a lot to say," Melissa said. "She's actually one of the first Jewish ladies we've had intertwined with us, right? One of our first, which we love because it brings a whole other dynamic and point of view at some points."Siggy said the ladies all have one thing in common: "We believe old school is the only school," she said. "And we all are in love with our children—it's family. There's no normal. It's either high or low, you will never see us barely breathing."The Real Housewives of New Jersey returns Sunday, July 10 at 8 p.m. on Bravo.(E! and Bravo are both part of the NBCUniversal family.)
