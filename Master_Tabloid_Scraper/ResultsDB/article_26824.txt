"Every single person broke," Flicker warned teased.As their friends and co-stars Teresa Giudice, Melissa Gorga, and Jacqueline Laurita went to war with one another, Flicker and Catania say they tried their damnedest to keep the peace. Of course, this being the Real Housewives, they find themselves coming up short.

"It gets complicated because we hang out these people when the cameras are off," Flicker explained. "I go out to dinner with Kathy and Richie [Wakile], I go out to dinner with Jacqueline and Chrisâ€¦It's hard not to come on camera and not to want everybody to get along."As we'll see in Sunday's episode, however, even the show's resident peacemakers reached their boiling points. "It's gonna be explosive, and then you'll see, as neutral as we are, we still have our own opinion," Catania admitted. "Every question is going to be answered in this episode."

"It was one thing after another," Flicker added. "There was no period after any sentence."For more from the pair, including a peek into how Catania's past as a correction officer came into play when dealing with these ladies, be sure to check out the video above.The Real Housewives of New Jersey airs Sundays at 8 p.m. on Bravo.
