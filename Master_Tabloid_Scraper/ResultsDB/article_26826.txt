¿Y ellos, tambien?Gael García Bernal and wife Dolores Fonzi have reportedly separated after nearly five years of marriage.A source told E! News on Tuesday that Bernal, who attended the 2014 Telluride Film Festival this past weekend week, has been telling people that he and Fonzi had split up and that he was dividing his time between his native Mexico and Argentina, where she lives with their two children.An Argentine-born actress, Fonzi first met Bernal on the set of the 2001 film Vidas Privadas, though they reportedly didn't start a romantic relationship until 2008.

Son Lazaro was born in January 2009 and daughter Libertad followed in April 2011.The longtime couple's split was first confirmed by Bernal's mother, Patricia Bernal, who broke the news to People en Español. She told the magazine that the pair remain very good friends.Meanwhile, Bernal was just at Telluride on behalf of his latest film, Rosewater, which also marks Jon Stewart's feature directorial debut.

The 35-year-old actor stars in the based-on-a-true-story drama as Maziar Bahari, a London-based journalist who was imprisoned for 100 days in Iran and subjected to brutal interrogations after he was accused of being a spy.In a photo with Stewart and friend and frequent collaborator Alejandro González Iñárritu that was taken at Telluride on Saturday, Bernal was not wearing a wedding ring (though of course it's not immediately clear whether he was in the habit of wearing one prior to his split).
