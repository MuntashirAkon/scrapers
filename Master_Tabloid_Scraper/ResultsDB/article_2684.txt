Dame Edna Dogs Photogs/n
    She may be a dame, but she's no lady.        Dame Edna Everage's alter ego, Barry Humphries, lashed out at a Sydney paparazzo Wednesday, allegedly decking the snap-happy cameraman who got a little too close for comfort.        "He just punched me in the face," Aussie photographer Malcolm Ladd told the Daily Telegraph. "It knocked my glasses off. It was a good punch--it still hurts."        Ladd, 54, told the paper that Humphries, 72, who has gone around garbed as a purple-haired, rhinestone-spectacled housewife for more than five decades, slugged the shutterbug as Ladd attempted to get a "tight shot" of the entertainer outside a caf√©.         While Humphries has yet to officially comment on the scuffle, Dame Edna wasted no time in admonishing her alter ego's decidedly unladylike ways.         "Poor Barry, desperate for publicity as usual," Everage said in a statement released through publicist Suzie Howie. "Who does my manager think he is? Russell Crowe? Kate Moss?        "Luckily I wasn't there, but I'm told he didn't deliberately hit the poor photographer but was pushing the camera away and his knuckles accidentally grazed the poor chap's cheeks."        The stage and screen diva not only disapproved of Humphries' behavior, but offered a new target for the glare of the spotlight--herself.         "I've never pushed a camera away," she said. "The papps can invade my space whenever they like. I adore them, especially this little chap, because I've always had a weakness for ponytails. Call me old-fashioned."        As for the abhorrent Humphries: "I'm sending Barry off for counseling. He is a rageaholic and a tragic attention seeker."        Howie, meanwhile, confirmed the incident, but unlike Dame Edna, placed slightly more blame on the offending photographer than Humphries.         "I was stunned when I heard he had hit someone," she told the Telegraph. "He's had a very long career and there's never been anything like this, so obviously he was very upset. There must have been something more to it because I've never even heard Barry swear, let along throw a punch."        According to New South Wales police, no complaints have been filed from the altercation.
