Steve Mannina, in the San Francisco Chronicle.According to what appears to be an open Internet letter from Roisin's father, Chris Isner, the teen will  "most likely " lose her index finger, with her second and third fingers being  "permanently impaired and disfigured. " Isner sure isn't holding back his rage.  "I want this f**ker, " he writes.  "People know who did it and I'm offering $20,000 for a name. "/n
