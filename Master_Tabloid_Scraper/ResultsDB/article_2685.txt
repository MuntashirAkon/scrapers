Dame Edna Does Broadway/n
Guess what, Possums? Dame Edna's on Broadway.             The hilarious persona of Australian comic Barry Humphries has taken her mauve-haired, over-sequined drag show to New York's Booth Theater and is drawing raves for her stream-of-consciousness, full-audience-participation musical show, Dame Edna: The Royal Tour, which opened Sunday.            On this side of the pond, you might recognize the diva from her numerous appearances on the talk-show circuit (she's merrily reamed Joan Rivers and Roseanne, alike), as well as a 1991 NBC special called Dame Edna's Hollywood. Her Broadway debut, however, marks her biggest introduction to America.          "The humor operates on more channels than a TV satellite, with lots of droll, intelligent satire of celebrity culture, show biz and political correctness," raves USA Today.                Humphries created Edna nearly 40 years ago, and since then she's rocketed to fame as the host of her own British talk show. She now considers herself a "megastar." The unstoppable Australian housewife has interviewed hundreds of stars and traveled round the globe, but The Royal Tour is her first stop on Broadway. One would never know that, however, by the way she works the crowd.                The show begins with a barrage of video clips to familiarize the audience with England's favorite drag queen, followed by Edna's glittering, musical descent down a white staircase and onto stage--"a setting designed by Kenneth Foy that looks like a cross between a Las Vegas wedding chapel and Barbie's doll house," Associated Press reports.                The carefully coiffed, jewel-laden star proceeds to regale the audience with stories of her family (unmarried son Kenny and a lesbian daughter who lives with "a former tennis star of Eastern European descent"), her life and her thinly veiled barbs at just about anyone and anything she can think of, but meaning it "only in the nicest way." And she's not kidding about the play's subtitle, "The Show That Listens." Australia's First Lady holds a running dialogue with residents of the theater's front rows. She even gets 'em onstage for parts of the show.          The result? It's a smash, darlings.                         "Technicolor testimony to the fact that humor is based not just on what is said but on who is saying it." (The New York Times)         "She's camp, all right. Her voice is shrill, but cultured. And her attitude is--well--not inhibited. She does love talking about herself, and that's what the show is about (along with some barbed insults to her audience), which make for an evening of long and loud laughs." (New York Daily News)         "Besides having the best gams on Broadway since Dietrich, Edna is, she claims 'probably the most popular and gifted woman in the world today.' She'll get no quarrel from me. Her act...is by far the funniest and cleverest show in town." (New York Post)         "For all the supposed spontaneity of the evening, the show is carefully constructed. Humphries operates loosely with that structure, but he thinks fast and furously enough to insure the laughs don't stop. Dame Edna: The Royal Tour makes for mighty entertainment--but then, the woman, of course, is invincible." (Associated Press)                         Edna's descent on Broadway not only scored rave reviews, but made (infamous) theater history, as well. A week before the show opened, Newsweek ran with a review. While it was an upbeat notice, it violated the heretofore unbroken theater rule that says thou shalt not go public with your rants and/or raves before opening night. The League of American Theaters and Producers blasted the magazine, saying the review "disrespects a tacit agreement that has existed between the Bradway industry and the media for close to 100 years."                The hubbub didn't seem to affect Dame Edna too much. In a preview last week, she joked about the incident onstage, carried on with the show and managed to exit to a standing ovation. Even the most cynical audience member had a hard time not grabbing one of the many gladiolas the Dame tossed into the air and joining the chorus of Edna's final tune, "Come on, possums, wave your gladiolas."                To avoid any embarrassment, Edna-bound Broadway fans best start memorizing the words to her exit tune: "Put your gladdies in the air and thrust, thrust, thrust!"
