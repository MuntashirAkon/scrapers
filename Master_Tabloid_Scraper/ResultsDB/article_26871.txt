This is Bad Blood all over again!

After hesitating, the So What singer responded: 

"Taylor? Is that OK?â€¦ You can't win no matter what you say, anyway. Everyone wakes up offended."

Another victory for TayTay!
However, her response may be a surprise to many. Back in 2015, Carey Hart's wife criticized several musicians at the VMAs for delivering "gross and embarrassing" performances.
Many thought she was shading Miz Swift, Miley Cyrus, and Demi Lovato, though she later clarified on Twitter she had "no issue" with Lovato.
During a Rolling Stone interview in 2014, many believe Taylor was dissing Katy after she talked about a fellow pop star who "tried to sabotage an entire arena tour" by stealing backup dancers. 
In June 2017, Perry told Ariana Huffington during a live interview that she forgives the Blank Space singer and is "ready to let it go" and is "sorry for anything I ever did."
So much drama in the pop world!
