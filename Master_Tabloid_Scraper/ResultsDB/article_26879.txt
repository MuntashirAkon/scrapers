President Donald Trump doesn’t want transgender people serving in the military.

The 71-year-old politician announced his plans to ban all transgender people from the U.S. military early Wednesday, tweeting that enlisting them will allegedly burden the government with “tremendous medical costs.”
“After consultation with my Generals and military experts, please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow Transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military. Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail. Thank you,” he wrote on Twitter.
The ban will overturn a June 30, 2016 Pentagon ruling allowed transgender members of the military to serve openly and receive medical care.
