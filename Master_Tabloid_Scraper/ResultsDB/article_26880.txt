Things are really over for Pauly D and Aubrey O’Day.

The Jersey Shore alum and former Danity Kane singer have called it quits after two years of on-and-off dating, according to Entertainment Tonight. The couple previously split in 2016, but rekindled their romance a month later.
“Pauly and Aubrey have split, for good this time,” a source told the publication. “Pauly was the one to end things.”
Pauly, 37, and O’Day, 33, first started dating in 2015 after meeting on the set of Famously Single. They were reportedly still together this June when they were filming the after-show for the current season of the E! series.
Since the breakup, Pauly has removed all images of his ex-girlfriend from his social media account. Meanwhile, O’Bday’s Instagram still feature a video of the two of them posing in the photo booth at her birthday party in February.
