Kylie Jenner is parting ways with her very first house.

The 19-year-old just sold her starter home in Calabasas for $3.15 million. According to TMZ, Bellami Hair founder Nikki Eslami — whose company launched a hair extensions line based on the reality star’s signature tresses in 2014 — was the buyer.
Sitting at 5,100 square feet, the five-bedroom, seven-bathroom home is filled with custom details fitted to Jenner’s taste, including a hand-painted mural of the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star’s face, a gothic chic bathroom with a black toilet and skull wallpaper, and a massive closet specifically built for shoes.

The property also features a private gated entrance, a glam room formerly used by Jenner’s makeup team, a home theater, a covered loggia for outdoor dining, a swimming pool, an outdoor barbecue area, and dual fire pits.
Jenner, who purchased the estate in March 2015, listed the place for $3.9 million last June.
Since then, the lip kit queen made the move to the Hidden Hills, where she owns a newly-built $6 million mansion and a $12 million residence on the adjacent lot. Take a tour of her former home — below!
