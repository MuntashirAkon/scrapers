Cristiano Ronaldo’s family keeps getting bigger!

Weeks after welcoming twins via surrogate, the soccer star confirmed he’s expecting another bundle of joy with girlfriend Georgina Rodriguez. When El Mundo asked if the 32-year-old was  “happy” about having another baby on the way, Cristiano replied in Spanish, “Yes, very much.”
This will be the first child he shared with the 22-year-old model.
In June, he welcomed twins Matteo and Eva. The athlete is also the father of 7-year-old Cristiano Jr., whose mother has never been revealed to the public.
