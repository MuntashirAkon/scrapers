Shookus began working on SNL – which Affleck has hosted five times – back in 2002. She also worked on Tina Fey’s series 30 Rock.
She was previously married to fellow SNL colleague Kevin Miller, with whom she shares one child.
Affleck and his estranged wife Jennifer Garner officially filed for divorce three months ago after first separating in 2015 following 10 years of marriage. The former couple share three kids together: Violet, 11, Seraphina, 8, and Samuel, 5.
The news comes after a source told PEOPLE in April that Affleck had been dating again following the highly publicized split from Garner.
