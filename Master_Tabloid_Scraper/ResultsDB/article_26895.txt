While she has yet to find out if she's carrying a little guy or gal, Pumpkin does have an inkling. "If I had to bet, because of all the girls in our family, I'm probably having a girl," she explained. "Could you imagine another f--king little me running around? You guys are gonna be f--ked!"While she did not disclose the baby's father, she was reportedly engaged to boyfriend Joshua Efird in 2016. Meanwhile, her famous mom has Lauryn's stamp of approval. "I think mama will be an alright grandma," she added. "I mean, she can't really see, but she'll do good."

Congratulations to the mom-to-be! Season 2 of Mama June: From Not to Hot is set to premiere in early 2018.
