'Cash Me Outside' Girl Danielle Bregoli Sentenced to Five Years Probation on Multiple Charges /nThe  "Cash Me Outside " girl will NOT be going to jail after pleading guilty to multiple charges last month ... 'cause the kid struck a plea deal and got probation instead. Danielle Bregoli, who's 14, was sentenced to 5 years probation Tuesday in Delray Beach, FL after pleading guilty to 4 charges back in June -- including 2 counts of grand theft, possession of marijuana, and filing a false police report. Other charges were reportedly dropped as part of her deal. Danielle's legal trouble predates her appearance on  "Dr. Phil " last September -- which she got famous from after dropping her signature catchphrase. Unclear if she'll be facing charges for a separate incident ... where her pal allegedly chucked ice cream at a lady and set off a series of brawls in downtown Lake Worth, FL. A judge ruled that Danielle would be allowed to complete her probation in California, where she's now living with her mom./n
