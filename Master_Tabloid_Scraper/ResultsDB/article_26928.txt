Krenwinkel described her role in the Il Cielo Drive murders that took the life of actress Tate when she was eight months pregnant.
“Tex [Watson] had a rope and what he did is he threw it over a banister, over a piece of wood and brought it down and he started tying up Miss Tate and Miss [Abigail] Foster. He started tying them up and he said he was having difficulty with Miss Foster. She pulled away and she ran and he told me go after her and kill her,” she recalled in the transcript of her December 2016 hearing obtained exclusively by Radar.
She revealed how she took the life of the innocent victim. “I stabbed her and she pled for her life and I continued to stab.”

Krenwinkel described how Manson controlled her and the other killers during their murder trial in the 70s.
“Manson asked us to shave our heads because it meant that you were out of the norm,” she explained.
“The inmate has no remorse,” the state argued and the Board of Parole agreed, keeping Krenwinkel locked up in a California prison for at least five more year.
