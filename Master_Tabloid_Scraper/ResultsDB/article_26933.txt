Téa's Secret Heartbreak: Leoni Haunted By Missing Cousin/n
Actress Téa Leoni has been carrying a secret heartache for more than 20 years!
The Madame Secretary star’s dear cousin, 33-year-old Tim Pantaleoni, disappeared while hiking on the Hawaiian island of Oahu in 1995 — and has never been found!
“We put up posters everywhere and had volunteers walking the trails,” Tim’s mother, Patricia Pantaleoni, exclusively told RadarOnline.com.
“Téa raced to Hawaii (and) walked the trails and made posters like the rest of us.”

Leoni picked up the search AGAIN in 2000 while in Hawaii to film “Jurassic Park 3,” even offering a $100,000 reward.
But Tim remains missing.
“We hold out hope he’ll turn up, but it’s not likely,” explained his sister, Lucy Bernier.
