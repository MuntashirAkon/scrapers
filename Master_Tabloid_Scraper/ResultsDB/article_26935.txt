Death Certificate Revealed: Alexis Arquette Battled HIV For 29 Years/n
Radar told you first! Alexis Arquette died earlier this month at age 47 from a stroke caused by AIDS related complications — but her battle with HIV began well before her final days alive.
The star’s death certificate, obtained by the Los Angeles Times, confirms Radar’s recent report, revealing that Arquette had been diagnosed with HIV a whopping 29 years before her death on September 11.

Shortly after her passing, a close friend of the Arquette family — including famous siblings David and Patricia Arquette — told Radar, “Alexis was in so much pain at the end. Still, she was not ready to give up her fight.”
The LGBTQ activist, who would’ve been 18 when she was diagnosed with HIV, kept her illness hidden from the public for decades.
“Alexis was so sick for so long,” the close friend of the family continued. “She was holding on so hard at the end and was such a fighter.”

Arquette’s final public appearance was last April at RuPaul’s DragCon, an annual drag convention in L.A., where she promoted 1995’s Wigstock: The Movie, a documentary in which she makes an appearance. She dressed as a man for the event, looking gaunt, onlookers said.
As Radar previously reported, Arquette refused to take the necessary medication that could have saved her life.
