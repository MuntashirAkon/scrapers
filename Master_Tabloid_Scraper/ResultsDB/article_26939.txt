An Oklahoma mother and daughter were arrested this week after it was discovered that they had an incestuous marriage, RadarOnline.com has learned.
According to reports, Patricia Ann Spann, 43, and daughter Misty Velvet Dawn Spann, 25, tied the knot in March 2016 in Comanche County.
In a shocking twist, it was also revealed that Patricia had previously married one of her sons, Jody Calvin Spann, back in 2008.

In 2010, Jody annulled the marriage, citing “incest.”
Authorities became aware of Patricia’s marriage to Misty following a child welfare investigation of their Duncan home in August.
The 43-year-old told investigators that she “hit it off” with her daughter after they reunited two years ago, blaming their decision to get married on the hope of adopting a child together, KSOW reports.
Patricia insisted that she did not have a sexual relationship with her son, explaining that they were married to prevent him from being deployed to the military.

“I think she’s worthless, she put my sister into this. She forced my sister into this, there’s a lot of people that know it,” Misty and Jody’s brother, Cody Spann, told KSWO. “For you to want to put your own daughter through this, what kind of person are you? If that’s what you want that’s on you, but none of us kids want that, and now you got my sister behind bars because of your choices, why don’t you let that sit on you as a mom.”
Patricia and Misty pleaded not guilty to the crime. If convicted, they face up to ten years behind bars. /n
