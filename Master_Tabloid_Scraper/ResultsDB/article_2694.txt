We still don't have a Tracy Turnblad yet, but NBC's just announced the first few stars for Hairspray Live! and now we're really wishing it was December already.Jennifer Hudson has joined the cast of the live musical as Motormouth Maybelle, the owner of a local record store and mother of Seaweed, Tracy's friend from detention. She'll be joined by Harvey Fierstein, returning to the role of Edna Turnblad, Tracy's indomitable mother. "We are beyond thrilled with this incredibly talented duo of stars for Hairspray Live!," said Robert Greenblatt, Chairman, NBC Entertainment. "Harvey Fierstein created the role of Edna Turnblad on Broadway in an indelible Tony-winning performance that demanded to be memorialized on film, and we're happy he wanted to step into her shoes one last, unforgettable time. We're also so grateful that the incomparable Jennifer Hudson will play Motormouth Maybelle and we know her rendition of "I Know Where I've Been" will literally stop the show." 

Fierstein played Edna for the show's first two years out of its seven-year run on Broadway. The role was famously played by John Travolta in the 2007 movie adaptation. In the same film, Hudson's role was brought to life by Queen Latifah. The search for the right actress to step into the lead role's dancing shoes began April 24 with an open casting call in New York City, with producers going the same route of The Wiz Live! which cast then-unknown Shanice Williams in the lead role of Dorothy.Are you looking forward to Hudson and Fierstein in the show? Sound off in the comments below!Hairspray Live! will air Wednesday, Dec. 7 at 8 p.m(E! and NBC are both part of the NBCUniversal family.)
