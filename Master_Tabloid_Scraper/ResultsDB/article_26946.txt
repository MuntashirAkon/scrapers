Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck are setting aside their differences to help her parents and others face the devastating after effects of the flooding in West Virginia.

Besides Affleck, 43, the 44-year-old actress is teaming up with her childhood friend, Senator Corey Palumbo, to raise money to aid the stricken region.
Garner has talked about her love for her hometown in the past.
