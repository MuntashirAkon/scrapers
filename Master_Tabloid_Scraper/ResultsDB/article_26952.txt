An industry insider told People:
"Mindy is really motherly to the people she loves and cares about. She takes care of them."
Adding: 
"Being a mom is something she's always talked about, but never spoke of a set plan or anything in terms of a timeline of when she wanted it to happen."
No time like the present!
It's also been reported that the 38-year-old recently moved into a bigger, family-friendly house in El Lay so it sounds like she's off to a great start!
