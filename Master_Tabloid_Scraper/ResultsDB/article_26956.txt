Can the world handle five Heidi Klums?

The supermodel, who usually wins overall best costume every year, dressed up as none other than herself for her 17th annual Halloween party on Monday night (Oct. 31, 2016). Although there was no crazy makeup or prosthetics, it’s not every day that you see six Heidi Klums in one place.

The best part? She and her five clones — all dressed in identical outfits from Herve Leger by Max Azria — arrived in a giant wooden box with “Made in Germany” written on the outside.
