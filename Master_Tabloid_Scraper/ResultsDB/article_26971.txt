It's safe to say Patricia Arquette is no longer hung up on ex-hubby Thomas Jane.After attempting to reconcile following the Medium star's divorce filing in 2009, the couple has officially called it quits, per the finalization of their divorce Friday, according to Gossip Cop.

In spite of their many make ups and break ups, however, Arquette and the Hung star aren't ending their marriage on a bad note.When asked last year how they were doing in the wake of the breakup, Arquette told E! News, "We're both really good. I don't think people would even imagine that it could be so friendly and not weird."The ex-couple, who tied the knot in May 2006, has an eight-year-old daughter together, Harlow Olivia Calliope.This was the second marriage for Jane, as well as Arquette, who was previously married to Nicolas Cage.
