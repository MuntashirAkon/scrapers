Boyhood's Patricia Arquette has been nominated six times over her illustrious career, but tonight she won her very first Screen Actors Guild Award.The star took the stage to accept her Actor statue for Female Actor in a Supporting Role and was noticeably shaken upon hearing her name being called."I can't tell you what this means to me," she told the audience while taking out a folded-up piece of paper."I'm a fourth generation actor. My family has been committed to acting for over a century through feast or famine. My father Lewis Arquette taught me to approach work with compassion and gratitude and taught me also how hard it is to make a living as an actor."

She continued to thank her co-stars for their work on the film, which famously took 12 years to complete."Ethan Hawke, for your fierce commitment. Ellar Coltrane, for your purity. Lorelei Linklater, for your strength and your ability. And Richard Linklater, for showing me the beauty of this human experience and how we all matter."It's shaping up to be quite an exciting awards season for the now-SAG winner. You may recall that she won a Golden Globe Award for Boyhood just a few weeks ago.Well done, Patricia, and congratulations on your very big win!
