Bitter Ringo Won't Sign a Thingo/nFor a guy obsessed with the phrase peace and love, Ringo Starr seems to have a lot of pent up aggression! The guy from the Beatles who isn't John, Paul or George just posted an angry online rant warning his fans to stop polluting his damn mailbox with crap for him to sign. Ringo ain't got the damn time to please the people who helped fund his damn empire -- he's too busy getting ear piercings and getting his beard carefully manicured and stealing sun-glasses from Dame Edna, dammit./n
