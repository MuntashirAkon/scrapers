Gwyneth Paltrow: Mi Casa Es Baller!! Y Muy Grande Too/nGwyneth PaltrowÂ and her BF, TV producerÂ Brad FalchukÂ enjoyed a quiet Mexican vacation in a teeny tiny beachfront villa ... BUILT FOR 12! Okay, they've got Gwyneth's kids too, but they ain't that big. The 4-some rented the $20 million, 6-bedroom pad from Airbnb ... and likely chose it for its secluded vibe near the St. Regis Punta Mita. It ain't cheap ... $8k a night! It's a stone's throw from another celeb magnetÂ down in Mexico --Â Joe Francis' baller pad. Perks of Gwyneth's place include a private chef, yoga room, gym, and not just one, but 2 connecting infinity pools. So, yeah, not a bad place to watch sunsets.Â       La puesta del sol ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½ A video posted by Gwyneth Paltrow (@gwynethpaltrow) on Jan 18, 2016 at 9:26pm PST/n
