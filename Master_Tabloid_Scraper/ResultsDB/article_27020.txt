Gag Order: Judge Tells Charlie Sheen & Brooke Mueller To Quit Talking/n
A judge overseeing the custody battle for Charlie Sheen and ex-wife Brooke Mueller‘s twins issued a gag order Tuesday preventing them from discussing the case, RadarOnline.com has learned.
Lawyers for all sides were in Los Angeles Superior Court on Tuesday for an emergency hearing — Charlie and Denise Richards, the boys’ temporary guardian, showed up too — in the wake of Brooke, 35, being placed on an involuntary psychiatric hold and later checking into rehab to deal with her drug addiction.
The court reportedly maintained status quo, ordering that Bob and Max, 4, remain with Denise and her two daughters with the Anger Management star — Sam, 9, and Lola, 7 — as well as a third daughter she adopted on her own in 2011, Eloise, who is almost two years old.

But a source said: “The judge ordered no comment to anyone from everyone involved in the case.”
Late last week, Sheen went public with a statement declaring his support of the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services who removed Bob and Max from their mother’s home late on Thursday.
“Charlie supports the actions of the Department of Children and Family Services,” the star’s publicist said.

“He knows Max and Bob are safe and in a stable, loving environment with Denise and the boys’s sisters. Charlie will fully cooperate and fully participate in all proceedings.” /n
