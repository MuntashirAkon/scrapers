Charlie Sheen: It Was The Right Decision To Strip My Ex-Wife Of Custody Of Our Twins/n
Charlie Sheen says his twin boys are safe and in a “stable, loving environment” being cared for by his ex-wife Denise Richards — after the actor’s other ex-wife, Brooke Mueller, was stripped of custody.
In a statement exclusively to RadarOnline.com, Sheen, via his rep, said he supported the decision of the the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services’ to remove Bob and Max, 4, from their mother’s home late on Thursday.
“Charlie supports the actions of the Department of Children and Family Services,” Larry Solters, the Anger Management star’s publicist, said.

“He knows Max and Bob are safe and in a stable, loving environment with Denise and the boys’s sisters. Charlie will fully cooperate and fully participate in all proceedings.”
RadarOnline.com was first to report the secret reason behind the sudden move from DCFS: Mueller, 35, was this week placed on an involuntary psychiatric hold at the UCLA Medical Center.

Mueller was 5150′d under the Californian Welfare Institutions Code ― the same evaluation that Britney Spears went under in 2008 ― that allows for a qualified peace officer or clinician to involuntarily confine someone because it’s deemed they have a mental disorder that makes them a danger to themselves and/or others.
This is not the first time Wild Things star Richards has taken custody of Sheen’s youngest children; she has two daughters with Sheen, Sam, 9, and Lola, 7, as well as a third daughter she adopted on her own in 2011, Eloise, who is almost two years old. /n
