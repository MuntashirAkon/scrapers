Denise Richards Shares A Rare Family Photo With Charlie Sheen & Their Daughters Following A 'Colorful Year' Together/n

It's safe to say 2017 is off to a way different start than 2016 for Denise Richards and Charlie Sheen.
As you may remember, this time last year, the 45-year-old sued her ex-husband of ten years — who had also just revealed his HIV diagnosis — over custody support payments, which was settled later in the year.
Taking to Twitter on Tuesday, the actress shared a rare family photo of Charlie, their daughters Lola, 11, and Sam, 12, and Denise's adopted daughter Eloise, 5, all around the dinner table.
