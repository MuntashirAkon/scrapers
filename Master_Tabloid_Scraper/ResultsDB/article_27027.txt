Melrose Place's Bad Boy Is Now A Daddy! He And His Wife Welcome Baby Girl!/n

There's a new Hollywood baby!
Grant Show, who played Jake Hanson on Melrose Place and is now currently on Devious Maids as Spence Westmore, has a whole new project he's working on!
Being a dad!
The 52-year-old actor and his 47-year-old wife Katherine LaNasa welcomed a baby girl on March 25, weighing in at 6 lbs 3 oz.
This is Grant and Katherine's first child, so naturally they chose an elegant name for their new daughter, which is Eloise McCue Show.
So regal!
After getting married in August 2012, it seems like they were finally ready to expand their pretty little family!!
Congrats all around!
