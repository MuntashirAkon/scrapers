Denise Richards Out On A Shopping Quest With Her Family!/n

Things have been pretty rough lately for this momma. 
So what do you do when life gives you lemons? 
You go shopping obviously! 
Which is exactly what Denise Richards did this past Thursday with her two girls! 
Denise plus her little ones Eloise and Lola were spotted in Santa Monica shopping at the Fred Segal store, and the three seemed to LOVE their shopping adventure together! 
Nothing like a little bit of retail therapy to make you feel better! 
It always works for us at least. 
And apparently it works for these three, too!
