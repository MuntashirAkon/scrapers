Charlie Sheen’s Twin Boys Sound Like a Pleasure to be Around/n
They say the road to hell is paved with good intentions.  Unfortunately for Denise Richards, it’s also smeared with poo.
According to The Frisky, Richards – who had temporary guardianship of Charlie Sheen’s twins with his ex-wife, Brooke Mueller – would like to relinquish care of Max and Bob because they are very poorly behaved.
TMZ obtained a letter from Richards to the Department of Child and Family Services, in which the mom of three stated that she is no longer able to care for the four-year-old boys because “they have too many psychological problems.”

The boys are reportedly violent to Richards’ daughters and her pets, and are “badly in need of counseling.”
The girls – Sam and Lola, who are Richards’biological children with Sheen, and Eloise, whom Richards adopted – have been “strangled, kicked in the head and stomach, scratched, bit, slapped, punched in the face and head, and spit on,” according to the letter.
One of the boys threw a toy so hard at one of the girls that she had to seek medical attention.
They’ve also “thrown their feces into the bathroom of one of her daughters.”
Mueller, who has been battling addiction in recent months, tried to get a restraining order from Sheen, but was denied.
Sheen had this to say:
oh, by the way, nice try this morning Brooke. you are a chubby weirdo who will lose at every turn trying to get between me and my boys. c
