 It’s not that complicated: Denise Richards’ bod simply turns heads. 
The actress first launched into the scene when she appeared in a skimpy two-piece (which was then stripped down to just bottoms) in 1998’s Wild Things, before solidifying her sexy symbol image as a Bond girl in 1999’s The World Is Not Enough.

Since then, the Drop Dead Gorgeous star has been sizzling up both the silver and TV screen — even after becoming a mother to three daughters.

[inlinecmp pos=”left” id=”0″ type=”14369682:200″]Earlier this February, Richards’ frame caused concern when she was spotted in a black tank top, which exposed her super-slim arms.
However, the actress defended her skinny figure, telling Entertainment Tonight’s Nancy O’Dell in an off-air interview that she keeps up with a usual diet and practices Pilates four times a week to tone her figure.
The Hollywood mom added that she was plagued with the same rumors when her elder daughters — Sam and Lola — were born. With baby Eloise — who she adopted in 2011 — in the house, Richards said she’s getting plenty of chances to exercise her arms.
“I can vouch that the girl eats a lot,” O’Dell added in Richards’ defense. “She’s just naturally skinnier.”
Well, here’s to the yummy mommy!
