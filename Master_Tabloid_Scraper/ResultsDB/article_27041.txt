41-year-old Denise Richards’ bikini body has stayed enviable throughout the years, even after two children to wildman Charlie Sheen. The mother of three — she adopted a baby, Eloise, in 2011 — flaunted her killer figure in a red bikini poolside on Nov. 14.
Richards looked confident in the barely-there bikini, showing off her toned abs and muscular arms.
