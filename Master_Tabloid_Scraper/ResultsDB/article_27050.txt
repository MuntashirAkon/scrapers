Making mischief all over France is going to require some fierce reinforcements.Project Runway winner Christian Siriano is set to design a collection that will be showcased in the upcoming kid romp Eloise in Paris, starring newcomer Jordana Beatty as the Plaza-bred youngster and Uma Thurman as her ever-proper Nanny.While the bespectacled 22-year-old has already been cutting his Hollywood teeth on mannequins, er, muses like Victoria Beckham, he seems plenty psyched for his couture's big-screen cameo.

"I am honored to be a part of this amazing group of talent!” Siriano said. “It is a dream to work with legends such as [director] Charles Shyer, Uma Thurman and [costume designer] Milena Canonero on a wonderful story filled with creative inspirations. The film's climactic sequence takes place at Paris Fashion Week, during a show put on by Eloise and Nanny's friend, André la Frenais—and it's Siriano's clothes that the models will be flouncing down the runway in."Christian is a star. You meet him and instantly sense it. You look at his work and know it to be true. We’re thrilled that his next chapter begins with us," said Shyer, who's also behind such lighthearted fare as Father of the Bride and Baby Boom.Which, in PR speak, means, no hot tranny messes allowed.Principal photography on Eloise in Paris, inspired by the line of children's books written by Kay Thompson and illustrated by Hilary Knight, kicks off Sept. 8 in Paris, New York and the south of France.
