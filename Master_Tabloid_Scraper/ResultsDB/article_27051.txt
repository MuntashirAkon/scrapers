When you're a celeb kid, it's never too early to learn how to deal with the spotlight.Such was the case for Denise Richards' recently adopted baby girl, Eloise Joni, who experienced her first paparazzi frenzy Thursday. Photogs snapped shots of the Wild Things star toting the newest member of the family in an infant seat.Big sisters, Sam and Lola Sheen, were also on hand for Eloise's first public outing as the family ran errands in Calabasas.A rep for Richards confirmed news of Eloise's adoption to E! News just a day before, saying "Eloise Joni Richards is named after Denise's mom (Joni) and Denise and her daughters Sami   and Lola chose the name Eloise," the rep said. "Denise and Eloise's big   sisters couldn't be happier and feel incredibly blessed."
