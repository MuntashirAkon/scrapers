Just a few weeks ago, hot mom Denise Richards suprised us when she announced the adoption of her third daughter, Eloise Joni.And now we are happy to report that Richards' family and friends helped celebrate the new arrival this weekend with a pinked-out baby shower."Good morning! So excited for Eloise's shower today," Richards tweeted on Saturday. "Gonna be amazing!"Keep reading for all of the inside details...

Charlie Sheen's ex-wife appropriately themed the shower "Three's a Charm" and decorated with pink and black flowers in a nod to Eloise's literary namesake. An adorable pink-and-white cake by Cake Divas featured a topper of Eloise and her older sisters Sam, 7, and Lola, 6.Guests who attended the shower, at the Montage hotel in Beverly Hills, included famous (and all pregnant!) friends like Tori Spelling, Ali Landry and Spice Girl Mel B. Baskets of baby clothes and a pink Stokke stroller were among the gifts."Thank you my amazing friends for celebrating my baby daughter yesterday," Richards tweeted the following day. "I love you all and feel so blessed to have you in our lives."The Wild Things star brought Eloise into her family through a domestic adoption in June with Sam and Lola helping their mom pick out a name for their new little sis.Earlier today, Richards and her daughters jetted off to New York on a press tour for her new memoir, The Real Girl Next Door. Richards also plans to take Sam and Lola to see The Lion King on Broadway.
