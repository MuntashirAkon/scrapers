Mad Madge! Madonna Throws Daughter Mercy The Bday Bash From Hell/n
Sleepyhead Madonna went to bed during her daughter’s weekend-long birthday party — leaving angry guests on their own to feed themselves, an insider told RadarOnline.com.
The Material Girl, 58, invited friends to her Hamptons estate for a sleepover to celebrate adopted daughter Mercy turning 11, a guest told Radar.
But before long, the source said, Madonna disappeared into her bedroom — and let her guests go hungry while the children blasted “unruly” music!

Finally, at 9:45 p.m. on the second night of the sleepover, a guest stormed up to Madonna’s bedroom.
“My daughter’s starving! Those kid’s downstairs are starving! And the chef tells me he only takes orders from the lady of the house!” the guest shouted, according to our spy.

Within minutes, Madonna ordered up dinner — but her French Caribbean chef served a kosher meal that “was horrible,” the guest claimed.
In the end, several parents took their children to a local diner!
