“Sean knows what Rocco is going through, and he thinks he can help,” an insider said.
Although the 56-year-old Oscar winning actor has his own history of controversial behavior, Penn has “totally cleaned up his act and really wants to help Rocco,” said the source.
“With Rocco, it’s not just the pot,” the insider added. “He’s been drinking, too, and doing crazy things like jumping off roofs. Sean believes he should get help before it’s too late!”
After Rocco’s arrest on Sept. 28, the teen “was subsequently bailed [out] and dealt with by Camden borough’s Youth Offending Team,” a police spokesman said at the time.

But the drug bust is just the latest legal trouble for Rocco.
As Radar previously reported, earlier this year Rocco was at the center of an international custody dispute between his mom and dad Guy Ritchie, after he abandoned his mother’s Rebel Heart tour, and fled to his father’s home in England.
The couple eventually agreed Rocco would remain in London.
