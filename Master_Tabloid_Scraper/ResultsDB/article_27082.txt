Madonna's Son Rocco ARRESTED For Pot Possession/n
Nearly two months ago, Madonna‘s son Rocco Ritchie was arrested for possession of marijuana in London, Radar has learned.
On September 28, the 16-year-old was taken into custody in north London after a stop-and-search was performed by officers from the Camden police department, Entertainment Tonight confirmed with a statement from Metropolitan Police in London.
Rocco was bailed out soon after and passed off to Camden borough’s Youth Offending Team.

As Radar previously reported, Rocco has been caught in the middle of a bitter custody battle between Madge and film director father Guy Ritchie.
The drama first kicked off last year when Rocco refused to fly back from his dad’s London home to be with his mother in New York.

Though a settlement was reached in September, allowing the teen to complete school in London and stay with his father, it’s clear that Madonna hasn’t given up just yet.
