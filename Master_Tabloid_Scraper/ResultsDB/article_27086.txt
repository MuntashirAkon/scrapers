'Grandma' Madonna 'Sickens' Fans With Oral Sex Video/n
Madonna may have a rebel heart, but fans want the 57-year-old to start acting her age !
French Montana posted a video of Madge at a Met Gala after party at Up & Down Monday night, in which the singer provided a lewd display for the camera — and the rapper had a front row seat.
In the disturbing clip, also shared on The Shade Room’s Instagram, the “Like A Virgin” singer got up close and personal with her audience, sticking her own finger in her mouth and simulating oral sex, quite vigorously.

In response, Montana’s only defense was to let out his signature sound: “Haaann!”

Unsurprisingly, Instagram fans went nuts over the video, and not in a good way.
“She really does too much. I’d be embarrassed to be her kid,” one Instagram user wrote, while another commented, “This sickens me genuine[ly].”

“Honestly, what’s going on with all these grannies,” another fan wrote.
Others jabbed at Madonna’s public custody battle over rebellious son Rocco Ritchie , saying, “And this is why her son made that decision [to leave], so embarrassing.”
As Radar previously reported, Madge and her son, 15, became estranged after he refused to come home to the United States over Christmas, opting instead to stay with his father, Guy Ritchie, 47, across the pond.
The case has since been settled, with Rocco remaining in London to complete school. /n
