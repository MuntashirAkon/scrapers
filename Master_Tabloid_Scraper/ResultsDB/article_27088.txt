Madonna may be locked in a miserable custody battle with her ex, but she’s soothing her wounded spirit with a young new boyfriend!
The 57-year-old singer is getting all hot and bothered over her latest fling with 25-year-old Aboubakar Soumahoro, who was once a worker at the famed English department store Harrods before he began his career as a model.
“They were at a party together back in November when they got chatting, and hit it off straight away,” a friend told the Sunday Mirror, adding Soumahoro was also spotted on Madge’s Rebel Heart Tour when she headed to South America.

“Over the next few weeks, they got together a couple more times and she invited him over to her place, where they sat up all night talking,” said the pal of Madonna and Soumahoro, who originally hails from the Ivory Coast in Africa and is known as Brooklin to those close to him.
“The next thing we heard, he had quit his job and had gone out to meet her on tour,” continued the pal. “It’s obviously a very close friendship.”
The new “friendship” is in keeping with the star’s preference for sexy younger guys. Madonna has been linked to a string of lovers over the past few years, including dancers Brahim Zaibat, 29, and Timor Steffens, 28.
