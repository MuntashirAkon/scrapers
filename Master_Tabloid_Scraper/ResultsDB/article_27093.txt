The living legend got to sit next to Zac Efron at an MMA fight featuring Conor McGregor, and she tapped him on the chest! Swoon.
Zefron appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live! Wednesday night and explained how the night went down. He said:
"I see several famous people [labeled by name on the chairs] and 'Madonna' and then 'Zac Efron'…I was like, 'I'm next to Madonna for this entire fight?'"
Then Kimmel came in with the question on everyone's mind:
"Is it possible that she was trying have sex with you? Madonna is an irresistible person. When she sets her sights on someone, there's no escaping."
The 29-year-old replied:
"She is captivating in that way. I can't confirm or deny that."
Ha! Later Jimmy showed footage of Madge tapping the Baywatch star repeatedly on the chest at the game, to which Zac replied:
"I guess you can say she tapped me. She tapped this."
