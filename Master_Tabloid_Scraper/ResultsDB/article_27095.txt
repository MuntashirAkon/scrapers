Feud Alert! Patti LuPone Calls Madonna A 'Movie Killer' & Thinks Her Evita Performance Was 'A Piece Of Shit'!/n

Most of Andy Cohen's guests tip-toe around how they truly feel about other celebs — Patti LuPone, however, does not give a fuck!
The Broadway legend stopped by Watch What Happens Live! on Tuesday and admitted she can't sit through the big screen adaptations of musicals she starred in on stage.
But that might be a good thing, because the diva is NOT easily impressed by Hollywood interpretations of those hit musicals!

That especially goes for Madonna's portrayal of LuPone's iconic role in Andrew Lloyd Weber's Evita, a performance the Tony Awards winner thought was "a piece of shit."
The musical, for which LuPone won a Tony, was adapted into a hit film in 1996. Madge won a Golden Globe for her performance, but Patti wouldn't be able to tell you why — as she called the Like a Virgin singer a "movie killer" who is "dead behind the eyes." Ouch!
She sneered: 
"I thought it [the scene I saw] was a piece of shit. Madonna is a movie killer. She's dead behind the eyes. She couldn't act her way out of a paper bag. She should not be on film or on stage. She's a wonderful, you know, performer for what she does, but she is not an actress. Bing."
Bing, indeed!

We don't think the Queen of Pop would care too much what the OG Evita thinks. LuPone revealed the only thing Madonna has "ever" said to her was:
"I'm taller than you."
Bing!
Do U agree with Patti? Will Madonna respond? Is this the dawn of an epic feud between the two divas!? We have so many questions!
Check the clips (below) to hear Patti's harsh critique — and find out which modern musical earns her high praises!
