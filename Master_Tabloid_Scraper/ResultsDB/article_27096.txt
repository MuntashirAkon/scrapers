Madonna Soldiers On At The Met Gala/n

We love her Madgesty butâ€¦
This is just tragic!
Madonna chopped up some army fatigues and stitched them together to make a Moschino gown for the Met Gala tonight. Missed opportunity!
She could've done something amazing, and Jeremy Scott could've helped her! Sadly, this just falls flat!
Next!
