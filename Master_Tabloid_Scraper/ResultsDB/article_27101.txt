As we previously reported, Madonna is staging a lavish show at the Art Basel festival in Miami Beach next month, and according to the Miami Herald, the Material Girl is reprising the Tears of a Clown show she held in Melbourne, Australia in March. Interested? No problem. There are still tickets available for $5,000!

The intimate performance will be held on Dec. 2, 2016 at The Faena Forum, a brand-new geometric venue, and will include stand-up comedy from Chris Rock, conversations from Sean Penn and the event’s host James Corden, as well as music from Ariana Grande and Madge herself.
Wondering why the price is so astronomical? The proceeds are going to Madonna’s own nonprofit Raising Malawi, which brings care to those in need at The Mercy James Pediatric Surgery Hospital in Malawi.

And if you consider yourself a diehard Madonna stan, and five thousand clams doesn’t come close to putting a dent in your finances, the event also includes a VIP cocktail reception where attendees can meet the songstress in person for $150,000.
So… just how much do you love Madonna (dressed as a clown)?
