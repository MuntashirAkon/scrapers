Madonna gets to have all the fun.

Not only will the Queen of Pop host possibly the party to attend at Art Basel in Miami this year, but Madge is also slated to appear in James Corden’s wildly popular “Carpool Karaoke” segment on The Late Late Show. As evident in this selfie shared by Madge of the two of them together, things are about to go down.
“Riding around Manhattan with this Hunk of Burning Love,” she captions the shot.

However, Corden clearly isn’t the only man in Madonna’s life. The singer was also recently spotted hanging out with Zac Efron at the UFC 205 fight in New York City this week. Sitting ringside, the duo gladly took selfies with fans and chatted with other celebrity attendees.
Like a true gentleman, Efron was even snapped giving Madonna’s hand a kiss when she first arrived to the arena. How chivalrous!
Basically, Madonna is living her best life and there’s nothing you can do about it.
