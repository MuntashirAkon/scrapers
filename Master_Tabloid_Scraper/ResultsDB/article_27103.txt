Madonna just shared that she’ll be hosting a special concert at Art Basel this year offering “an evening of music, art, mischief and performance,” per Consequence of Sound.

The special show will feature appearances from Late Late Show host James Corden, Ariana Grande, Sean Penn and Chris Rock. The proceeds will go to Raising Malawi, Madonna’s own charity that works to provide pediatric surgery and intensive care to communities in the south eastern African country.

The festivities will be staged at Miami Beach’s Faena Forum and besides performances, attendees will be able to bid on artwork from established and rising artists from around the world.
The “Rebel Heart” singer has a knack for staging one-of-a-kind multimedia events. In March, she trotted out some beloved B-sides for fans at her Tears of a Clown show in Melbourne, Australia.
The benefit is scheduled for Friday, Dec. 2, 2016. To learn more and get your hands on some tickets, send an email to [email protected]
