Madonna can add another accolade to her trove. The original pop icon was named the 2016 “Woman of the Year” by Billboard. According to the publication, the songstress has risen from the pack over the decades with her influence as an artist and her ability to reinvent herself.

“Madonna is one of a minuscule number of super-artists whose influence and career transcend music,” Janice Min, president and chief creative officer of The Hollywood Reporter-Billboard Media Group, shared in a statement.
“With her creative vision, relentless innovation, and dedication to philanthropic causes, she is an inspiration to hundreds of millions of people around the world, all while shattering every career record out there. She is an important feminist on top of that, a one-of-a-kind artist who’s used her influence to change the conversation around women, sexuality and equal rights.”
The “Rebel Heart” singer will be honored at the 11th annual Women in Music event on Dec. 9. It will air on Lifetime on Dec. 12.
Congrats, Madge!
