Madonna may have allowed Guy Ritchie to get custody of their teenage son, Rocco, but she sure as hell isn’t going to stop seeing her child any time soon.

Just days after settling her nasty legal battle with her ex-husband, the singer flew to London to be with Rocco to see him off for his first week of school. A source told People that Madonna became “concerned” for the 16-year-old after Ritchie and his wife, Jacqui Ainsley, allegedly “left him alone” to take a trip to Los Angeles before Rocco started a new term.
“Her kids’ education is the most important thing to Madonna,” the insider said. “She takes their schooling very seriously.”
This week, Madge was seen having dinner with Rocco at Farmacy in London’s Notting Hill neighborhood. The mother-and-son duo were joined by pal Benjamin Khalili and were “smiling and laughing the whole evening,” according to an onlooker.

Earlier that day, Madonna also paid a visit to Rocco’s new school, where she reportedly stayed for nearly an hour to speak to the administrators.
“She was very friendly with the teachers and was very relaxed,” a source told People.
Madonna and Ritchie had been fighting for custody of their son for the last eight months after Rocco refused to return to the United States to visit this mother last December. In early September, the former couple settled on the agreement that their son would stay in London with Ritchie.
