Pia Mia just landed herself a huge gig.

The singer slash Kylie Jenner’s BFF has not only been named as the new face of Madonna’s exclusive Macy’s juniors clothing line Material Girl, but she’s now also the label’s first-ever “fashion director.” Aside from starring in the ad campaign, Pia will also select the photographer for the project, have a hand in designing the Spring 2017 collection, and appear in a mini docu-series created in partnership with StyleHaul.
“Her creativity, confidence and unique sense of style make her a perfect addition to the brand,” Madonna says in a statement to WWD.



So happy to work with @madonna & @materialgirl as the first-ever fashion director ♡ excited for you all to see the campaigns & for you to soon be able to pick up my designs! xx

Pia Mia, whose full name is Pia Mia Perez, first found fame when she was 11 after her YouTube videos became viral hits. She’s since collaborated with the likes of Chris Brown and Tyga. The songstress currently has 4 million followers on Instagram.
