As much as we're against Tyra Banks coining the word "ferocious," we must admit the term is pretty fitting when looking at Madonna's new campaign for Louis Vuitton. We're sure you've seen the sexy pics of Madge on the L.V. site, but we much prefer the behind-the-scenes vid with M and Marc Jacobs. Besides playing the game "spot the intermittent British accent" with Madonna, we like seeing her in what seems like a very real and—gasp—nondiva-like setting. Check it out above.
