Madonna Files Emergency Order to Stop Tupac Shakur Letter Auction (UPDATE)/n5:35 PM PT -- According to a report, a judge in NYC just ordered the auction site to remove the items. 4:07 PM PT -- A spokesperson for Gotta Have Rock and Roll website and Lutz tells TMZ,  "Madonna and her legal army have taken what we believe to be a completely baseless and meritless action to temporarily halt the sale of Ms. Lutz’s legal property. We believe that her intent is nothing more than to besmirch the good reputations of the auction house and Ms. Lutz. Madonna's allegations will be vigorously challenged and refuted in a court of law in due course. "Madonna isn't gonna sit back and watch her jailhouse letter from Tupac get sold in an auction ... because she says it was jacked from her home. Madge filed an emergency court order Tuesday in NYC to block the website gottahaverockandroll.com from hawking the letter and a ton of other personal memorabilia -- including personally worn panties. In docs, obtained by TMZ, Madonna says she was blindsided by the auction, and says she never knew some of these items were no longer in her possession. Madonna believes a former friend and art consultant, Darlene Lutz, betrayed her by taking the loot.  We broke the story ... Pac wrote an extremely revealing letter from prison explaining why he had to end his relationship with Madonna -- because she was white and continuing the relationship would hurt his image. According to the docs -- first reported by the Daily News -- the Tupac letter, a pair of her  "personally worn panties, " letters from her pal, Rosie O'Donnell, and several other handwritten notes to family members were never sold or gifted to anyone. Bottom line -- it's a material world, she's a material girl ... and she wants her stuff./n
