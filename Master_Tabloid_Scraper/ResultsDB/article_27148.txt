“The entire video is necessary to place in context the portions cited by the County,” Curtin’s lawyer fired in explosive court documents obtained by Radar.
Curtin’s lawyer also transcribed the video for the judge, noting that it took just two minutes for Caropino to drop off his partner, Deputy Chapple, and return to Curtin’s car to allegedly attack her.

The porn star previously begged the case’s judge to allow her to use the word “rape” during the trial, but wanted her X-rated videos banned from the case.
