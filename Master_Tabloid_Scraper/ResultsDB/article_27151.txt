READ THE BOMBSHELL FILING!
As readers know, the Real Housewives of Orange County star Lynne Curtin’s daughter filed a civil lawsuit accusing Orange County Sheriff, Deputy Nicholas Lee Caropino, of raping her last April, and it’s just about to go to trial. Curtin is demanding the defendant not be allowed to silence her over the alleged assault.
Curtin’s plea comes on the heels of a motion filed by the County of Orange asking the judge to ban any mention of the word “rape” during the trial on account that it could likely induce the jury to make a decision based off an “improper, emotional basis that would prejudice and confuse the jurors.”
The defendant argues Alexa was never detained, never under arrest and was not under investigation at the time of the alleged assault. Docs claim Caropino simply “entered plaintiff’s vehicle and sat in the passenger’s seat,” arguing there is no evidence of force on his part.

But Alexa isn’t backing down and is firing back at the motion, stating in court docs that the defendant “seeks to implement a rape victim’s ‘Code of Silence’ by preventing a rape victim from referring to her rape as a ‘rape’.”
The reality star claims the motion cannot be taken seriously, as she alleges she was raped by a police officer and has ever right to use the word during trial.
