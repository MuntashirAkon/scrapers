Mary Kay Letourneau’s Ex Speaks Out After Her Shocking Split From Student/n
Mary Kay Letourneau’s first husband Steve Letourneau is finally speaking out after the former teacher’s infamous split from onetime student Vili Fualauu.
“I’ve moved on,” Steve told People. “And I have nothing to say.”
As readers know, Mary Kay was convicted of having sex with 12-year-old Fualauu in 1996 — while still married to Steve.

The former pair shared kids Jacqueline, Mary Claire, Nicholas and Steven Jr., of whom Mary Kay lost custody of when she was sentenced to seven years in prison for child rape.
Neither Steve nor his kids have previously commented on Mary Kay and Fualaau’s surprising separation.
As Radar has reported, Vili told RadarOnline.com exclusively that he dumped Mary Kay because he wanted to have a clean slate when starting his own marijuana company.
Assuring fans that the pair was still in love despite their split, Fualaau explained, “When you want to get licensed, they do background checks on both parties. She has a past. She has a history.”

Since the fiasco, Mary Kay’s ex-husband Steve Letourneau has remarried and had more children. He has rarely spoken publicly about his notorious former spouse and in instead lives a quiet life with his family, in Alaska.
