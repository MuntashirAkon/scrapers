Maggie Gyllenhaal has fallen out with Scientology critic Leah Remini.

After leaving the church, Remini was an out-spoken critic and then went on to produce the hit A&E show Scientology and the Aftermath, which was nominated for the Best Informational Series Emmy.
An insider revealed: “Maggie and Leah used to be close but they’ve had an epic fall-out.
“The problem, is that Maggie grew up with a lot of people who were raised in the Church and is still friends with some of them like Michael Pena and Giovanni Ribisi.”
