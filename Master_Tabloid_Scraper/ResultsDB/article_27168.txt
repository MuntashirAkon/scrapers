Heartbroken Parents Respond After Video Surfaces Of School Bus Aide Slapping Their 6-Year-Old Autistic Daughter/n

This is so upsetting!
Video has surfaced of a six-year-old girl with autism screaming after being slapped twice by a bus aide on her way to school in New Lenox, Illinois, just outside of Chicago.
Understandably, distraught dad Nicholas Rushing is outraged that his "nonverbal" daughter Kayle had to go through that terrible experience â€” and he's worried this might not be the first time something like this has happened.

He told ABC7: 

"My blood boils. I think about it and it just makes me mad. She shouldn't have to go through that."
Adding:

"She's nonverbal, she can't come back and be like, 'Dad, this lady hit me, not just once, she hit me twice.'"
In response, the bus operator's executive director, Sarah Rexroad, said an investigation is ongoing:

"I cannot provide a specific comment at this time. There is an ongoing investigation regarding an incident that allegedly occurred on a school bus. Student safety is a number one priority for the cooperative."
