The Internet Explodes After DWTS's Most Shocking Elimination!/n

Sorry, spoilers!!
As you know, Dancing With The Stars faced a bit of backlash earlier this year when the ABC show announced Heather Morris would be one of the celebrity contestants due to her obvious advantage in the competition. We mean, not only was the Glee alum on So You Think You Can Dance, but the blonde beauty was also a backup dancer for BeyoncÃ© during the The BeyoncÃ© Experience Tour and the Single Ladies promotional tour.
On Monday night's episode, the 30-year-old was shockingly eliminated after receiving the season's first perfect score (40/40) with her partner Maksim Chmerkovskiy â€” which left the live audience and Twitter fans in an absolute frenzy.

It just doesn't make any sense why a professional dancer would be eliminated before four unqualified males AKA Nick Viall, Rashad Jennings, David Ross, and Bonner Bolton, but we digressâ€¦
Ch-ch-check out some of the responses (below)!

TRUMP'S AMERICA SUCKS.

I hope Heather realizes that she was eliminated because Dancing With The Stars values subpar male contestants over outstanding female ones.
