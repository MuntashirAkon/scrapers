Y'all, William Shatner Is Literally Campaigning To Get Nick Viall Kicked Off DWTS — You Have To See His Rant!/n

We don't know what Nick Viall ever did to William Shatner — but the Star Trek actor is VERY passionate about getting The Bachelor series junkie kicked off Dancing With The Stars!
In case you haven't been following the past few days, the 86-year-old (as of today! HBD William!) has been using Twitter to encourage fans to vote for ANYONE except Nick.
And when asked why he's so adamant about getting the newly-engaged reality star off the dancing series, the celeb responded by saying, "He lives up to the homonym of his last name," and, "Leopards don't change their spots."
