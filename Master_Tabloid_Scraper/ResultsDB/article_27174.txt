It finally happened! Fifteen years after the release of A Walk to Remember, the cast of the early 2000s romantic drama reunited for an epic get-together.

Just weeks after Mandy Moore expressed her desires to reconnect with co-star Shane West, the This Is Us actress made things work and caught up with her onscreen boyfriend. Joined by director Adam Shankman, the duo met up after the Super Bowl on Sunday (Feb. 5, 2017) and reminisced about old times.
“Welp. These 2 gentlemen are still some of the best around. Loved catching up with ya, @theshanewest and @adamshankman. My ❤ is full. #awalktoremember #reunion,” Moore captioned a photo of the three of them together.

Last month, Moore, 32, admitted to crushing on West, 38, while they were filming the Nicholas Sparks adaptation in North Carolina. At the time, the “Candy” singer was just kicking off her acting.
“Shane was so cool. Everything about him — the way he dressed, the little cigarettes that he smoked, and the music he listened to. He was the character to me and there was definitely a part of me that absolutely fell in love with him,” she told Entertainment Weekly. “I was just so caught up in the moment and the experience. Shane was so wonderful.”
“He had a lot of respect as an actor and I was just the total newbie,” she added. “I felt incredibly lucky right off the bat that I had someone who was as willing to work with me and who was patient and understanding. He was just the perfect partner for that.”
So sweet!
