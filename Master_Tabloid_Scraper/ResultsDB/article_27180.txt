The “Wrecking Ball” singer turns 24 today (Nov. 23, 2016)!
Miley Cyrus had an interesting transition into adulthood. From acting and singing as Hannah Montana in her tween days to going off on her own solo career, she has matured before the public eye — that is, if you define “maturing” as twerking on stage, letting her freak flag fly, and smoking weed. She evolved from sweet country girl to an edgy and controversial superstar seemingly overnight, and we admittedly loved everything about it.

She capitalized on her new eccentric, revealing style when she won the 2014 MTV VMA for Best Music Video for “Wrecking Ball.” Since then, she’s been a judge on The Voice and she’s also founded her own charity, The Happy Hippie Foundation, which “rallies young people to fight injustice facing homeless youth, LGBTQ youth, and other vulnerable populations.” Her fiancé (or secret husband?) Liam Hemsworth has been supportive of her since they first started dating in 2009. Although they’ve had minor breaks in their relationship, the couple recently made their official return to the public eye together, making all of our The Last Song dreams come true.
