Kanye West brought out all of Hollywood’s hottest couples on Tuesday (Nov. 1, 2016) when he performed at The Forum in Inglewood, Calif.

Showing support for her brother-in-law, Kylie Jenner was spotted in the crowd at the star-studded show. Joined by boyfriend Tyga, the reality star got cozy with her beau throughout the night and planted a kiss on his cheek as they left the arena hand-in-hand.

Meanwhile, fresh off their Halloween costume controversy, Hilary Duff and fitness trainer Jason Walsh were seen having their own Saint Pablo Tour date night. Leaving their Native American garb at home, the duo, who went public with their relationship earlier this fall, were all smiles as they picked up some shirts from the merchandise booth.

Jessica Alba and husband Cash Warren also showed up to the concert, which was West’s third in his six-show run. With their two daughters at home, the duo enjoyed a night out together in the VIP section alongside Pharrell Williams and his wife, Helen Lasichanh.
