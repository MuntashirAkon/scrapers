Jennifer Lawrence is rumored to be dating director Darren Aronofsky after the two worked on a film together.
Multiple sources report that the two, who are 21 years apart in age, were spotted out to lunch in New York City last month. “Jennifer and Darren have tried to keep things low-key and under wraps, but they are really into each other,” an insider told The Sun. “Recently Jennifer was working on a grueling project and she relied on Darren for support and they were in constant contact.”
