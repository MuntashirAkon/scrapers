Kristen Stewart and Nicholas Hoult Star in Mysteriously Sexy New Trailer for Equals Still, if you listen carefully, the pulsing lyrics "Everybody's got a secret to hide" from the Chromatics' "Kill For Love" ring.../n
Still, if you listen carefully, the pulsing lyrics "Everybody's got a secret to hide" from the Chromatics' "Kill For Love" ring out as a sign that this saga may end tragically. The movie's tagline, "Would you risk everything to feel something?" only further drives the notion that something is about to go horribly awry. Fortunately, the trailer does offer glimmers of happiness as K. Stew is shown laughing in bed and embracing with her lover in the shower. "Just remember what this feels like," her voice rings out at the close of the clip. We just can't wait to see what this movie looks like.
