E!

There doesn't seem to be any bad blood between these former lovebirds.Aside from getting all glam for the award shows (and possibly taking home a statue), there's another thing many stars have to look forward to with these shows—running into other celebs who you haven't seen in a long time. And that includes an ex-boyfriend. So awkward, right? Yeah, but not in this particular instance.Jennifer Lawrence and ex Nicholas Hoult reunited at the 2016 Golden Globes tonight at the Beverly Hilton Hotel, and while it'd be very juicy to tell you there were drinks thrown and yelling and a lot of drama, that definitely wasn't the case. The two simply chatted during commercial break and seemed perfectly fine.

The 25-year-old actress sat down with Diane Sawyer back in November to chat about the last installment of the Hunger Games franchises and how the combination of that following shortly after her breakup from Hoult,  her boyfriend of five years, really forced her to look at herself."These movies had been my life for so long and they had to come first in everything," she told Sawyer. "I was also in a relationship with somebody for five years and that was my life. So my life was this person and these movies and we broke up around the same time that I wrapped those movies."She continued, "Being 24 was this whole year of, ‘Who am I without these movies? Who am I without this man?'"Following her split, Lawrence was linked to Coldplay frontman Chris Martin. However, the young star was candid about her thought of marriage, and told Sawyer she's not sure she sees herself walking down the aisle."I don't know if I ever will get married and I'm OK with that," she stated. "I don't feel that I need anything to complete me. I love meeting people, men, women, whatever, I love people coming into your life and bringing something."
