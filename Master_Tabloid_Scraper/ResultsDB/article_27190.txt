Jennifer Lawrence is opening up in a way we haven't really seen before.The 25-year-old actress sat down with Diane Sawyer to chat about the last installment of the Hunger Games franchises and how the combination of that following shortly after her breakup from her boyfriend of five years, Nicholas Hoult, really forced her to look at herself."These movies had been my life for so long and they had to come first in everything," she told Sawyer. "I was also in a relationship with somebody for five years and that was my life. So my life was this person and these movies and we broke up around the same time that I wrapped those movies."

Meanwhile, Lawrence also addressed her much-talked about op-ed surrounding the gender wage gap after she discovered that both she and her American Hustle co-star Amy Adams were paid less than the males in the film."My question to myself was why am I not asking for it?" Lawrence told Sawyer. "And I think I know I have always kind of carried a habit of submissiveness with the idea that it makes me more likeable."She continues, "I felt like I had had to say something because we need to talk about it. On average women are paid 21 percent less than men... We can ask for the same exact thing that men do and we do face the reality that we do get judged more. IT's just something that is intrinsic, and I would love to see change."You can watch Sawyer's full interview with Lawrence tonight on "Nightline."
