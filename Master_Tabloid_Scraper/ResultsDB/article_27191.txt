Don't be looking for a wedding registry just yet, folks.Rumors have been running rampant that Jennifer Lawrence and boyfriend Nicholas Hoult are preparing to tie the knot ever since the Hunger Games: Catching Fire star was spotted with a ring on that finger.However, a source tells E! News that the two are "not engaged. The ring is not an engagement ring."The speculation appears to have started when the Oscar winner was posing for pictures with director David O. Russell at an event in Hollywood, Calif., on Friday, Nov. 8.

Eagle eyes couldn't help but notice the rock residing on her left hand.However, cut to Monday's U.K. premiere of Catching Fire, and the ring was noticeably absent as Lawrence walked the red carpet.But engagement or no engagement, Hoult is nevertheless still the ever-supportive boyfriend.After all, the actor has been accompanying his ladylove as she promotes Catching Fire, most recently joining her for the movie's London premiere afterparty.
