It looks like Jennifer Lawrence and Nicholas Hoult had a very Merry Christmas--together!The Hunger Games: Catching Fire star spent some time before the holidays in her hometown of Louisville, Kentucky (she also made a stop at a local children's hospital, much to the delight of the kids, their families and the staff), and then the 23-year-old actress flew across the pond to join her X-Men love in his native Hampshire, England!A photo popped up on Twitter of the twosome posing happily alongside two fans after reportedly hitting up a local pub. Nicholas, 24, didn't directly address Jen's U.K. visit, but he did seem filled with holiday cheer when he tweeted Dec. 30.

"Hope you all had a brilliant Christmas and Happy 2014 in advance," he wrote, "may it be filled with great things for you x."And of course, we're wishing Nicholas and Jen a Happy 2014 as well! Who knows? Ms. Lawrence might be taking home some big awards in the coming months for her role in American Hustle!In any case, she's already got an Oscar to her name, an amazing movie career and one supercute boyfriend. So basically, J.Law wins no matter what!
