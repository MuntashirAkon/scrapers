Reunited and it feels so...Obvious?Seemingly friendly exes Jennifer Lawrence and Nicholas Hoult were wrangled into a selfie with X-Men: Apocalypse director Bryan Singer today on the film's Montreal set—and you can almost see the wheels turning in Hoult's head as he thinks (you know, possibly), "Go ahead, write your headlines."But for real, it's great to see these two adorable actors together again under whatever circumstances. And if a whole new X-Men movie is going to come along with the sighting, all the better!

"Back with the #thekidsinthehall #jenniferlawrence #mystique #nicholashoult #beast #Xmen #XMenApocalypse," Singer captioned their cozy pic, his reference to the cult-classic sketch show The Kids in the Hall apparently an inside joke.Lawrence, meanwhile, has said that Apocalypse will mark her last time playing deadly blue shapeshifter Mystique, and Hoult told E! News the same thing about Beast, saying this was the last X-Men film he was signed up for.Since the pair's breakup last August, the British thesp has most recently been romantically linked to Glee's Dianna Agron, while Lawrence of course has been keeping company off and on with Coldplay frontman Chris Martin.X-Men: Apocalypse, the latest film in the prequel segment of the billion-dollar comic book franchise, is due in theaters May 27, 2016.
