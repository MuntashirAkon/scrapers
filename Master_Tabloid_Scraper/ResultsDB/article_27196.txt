Kristen Stewart and Nicholas Hoult make sure to find a little time for fun and adventure in-between shooting.The Equals co-stars have been busy filming their upcoming indie sci-fi drama, but recently decided to also participate in some daring fun by zip-lining in Singapore. A fansite posted multiple photos of K.Stew, who posed for pics with a number of fans, as she and Hoult prepared to, well, zip down a cable for some entertainment.The blog also posted a video (yay!) of their adventure, which proved that these young stars are quite the daredevils! Some went down the entire way upside-down!

While their latest shenanigan together is enjoyable to watch, we still think their "f--king real" ice bucket challenge video takes the cake.The duo opted not only to pour a bucket of freezing cold water over their heads, but also dunked their faces in the ice bucket for a solid 15 seconds. "Here's to the fight against ALS. Richard, I love you. Hathaway, get this—this is a f--king real challenge," K.Stew says to challenger Anne Hathaway in her signature expletive-filled fashion before she, Hoult and pal Scott Fahrendorf proceed to immerse themselves in the chilly H2O.At the end of the video, Stewart assures fans that the trio was eco-friendly while completing the challenge. "In good faith you must believe that all of this was done with dirty bath water. Please be considerate of California water conservation," the actress concludes before flashing a peace sign as Hoult lets out a small chuckle.Now if only they did the ice bucket challenge while zip-lining. That'd be something.
