Abigail Breslin is opening up about her sexual assault.

The Little Miss Sunshine star, who recently revealed she was raped by someone she knew, took to Instagram this weekend to speak more about the traumatic experience. Responding to trolls who claimed reported rapes are the only rapes that count,” the 20-year-old explained why she didn’t report her assailant to the police.
“I didn’t report my rape. I didn’t report it because many reasons,” she wrote in a note. “First off, I was in complete shock and total denial. I didn’t view myself as a ‘victim’ so I suppressed it and pretended it never happened.”
“Second of all, I was in a relationship with my rapist and feared not being believed,” she continued. “Thirdly, I knew how hurt my family and friends would be after finding out and I didn’t want to put them thru [sic] that.”

“I have made a lot of progress since the event occurred, but I won’t pretend it isn’t something I struggle with. I still have flashbacks, I still get nightmares, I still jump when somebody touches me unexpectedly, even if it’s my best friend tapping me on the shoulder,” she added. “To say that reported rapes are the only rapes that count contributes to the ideology that survivors of unreported rape don’t matter. It’s unfair, untrue, and unhelpful. It’s like if you got a black eye from getting punched in the face, but because you didn’t call the police, you didn’t really get a black eye. Unreported rapes count. Reported rapes count. End of story.”

As previously reported, Breslin first spoke about her sexual assault earlier this month by posting a statement reading, “You are not obligated to have sex with someone that you’re in a relationship with. Dating is not consent. Marriage is not consent.” The actress added in the caption, “I knew my assailant.”
While the Oscar nominee did not expand on her experience until now, many fans — including Sarah Hyland and Dirty Dancing co-star Debra Messing — responded with support and praise for Breslin for bravely speaking out about her experience.
“Proud of you Abs,” Hyland wrote. Meanwhile, Messing tweeted, “I love you, Abbie. Your strength and testimony means so much to too many. #voice.”
