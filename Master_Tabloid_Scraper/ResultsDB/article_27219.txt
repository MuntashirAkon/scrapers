'Homeland' Star Morena Baccarin -- Real Marriage Blows Up Too and It Could Cost Her $$$/nMorena Baccarin -- Nicholas Brody's estranged wife on ﻿ "Homeland " -- is headed for divorce off-screen too -- and all her success since the Showtime hit could work against her in the split. Baccarin’s writer /director husband, Austin Chick, filed the divorce docs, citing irreconcilable differences, after 3 and a half years of marriage -- a lifetime in Hollywood. According to the docs, Chick wants joint custody of their one-year-old son ... and he wants spousal support. It looks like Baccarin's been the breadwinner in the fam -- picking up roles on hits like  "Gotham " and  "The Flash " -- so, at least on paper, she'll likely end up forking over some amount of cash. Did we mention she's banging Det. Jim Gordon on  "Gotham? " 'Cause she is ... and she looks freakin' hot doing it. /n
