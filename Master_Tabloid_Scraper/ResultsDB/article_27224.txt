The Dance Moms cast had a scare yesterday afternoon when a deranged stranger attempted to enter the Abby Lee Dance Studio in Penn Hills, Pennsylvania— and then turned violent.
According to Pittsburgh’s Action News 4, suspect Joseph Irving McKinstry Jr. told a witness he wanted to read poetry to the class full of young students.
When cops arrived to the scene, the 34-year-old man reportedly became belligerent.

In a video of the incident, he can be seen screaming and attacking officers after they were forced to remove him and two suitcases out of the road.
The dance studio was filled with young students during the scary altercation.
“I was frightened when I found out what he was doing here and why he was here and his intentions,” Abby Lee Dance Company employee Kelly Meade told the local news station. “But with the studio we have and employees we have we felt very safe. None of the girls were threatened. The girls stayed in class.”
The Penn Hills Police Department confirmed to RadarOnline.com there was an incident at the famous studio.

‘This person is in a hospital getting a mental evaluation,” Sgt. Wilkinson told Radar.
Sources told Action News 4 that McKinstry will be charged with aggravated assault, resisting arrest and disorderly conduct.
The Lifetime show has repeatedly made headlines in recent months. As Radar exclusively reported, Kalani Hilliker’s mom Kira Girard, 34, was arrested in 2005 for four counts of felony theft in a $15,000 eBay fraud scheme.
And, of course, studio creator Abby Lee Miller, 49, pled not guilty to bankruptcy fraud last fall after she was accused of hiding $755,000 in reality TV income. /n
