Art imitates life; life imitates art – at least for Jake Gyllenhaal!
According to Star magazine, the Hollywood hunk took a break from the big screen to star on the Broadway stage, but things seem to be heating up off stage as well. Ruth Wilson, Jake’s Broadway costar, plays his lover in Constellations, and has reportedly caught his eye outside of the “office.”
While Jake opted to bring sister Maggie as his date to the Golden Globe Awards this year, witnesses say he made sure to meet up with Wilson – quietly of course – backstage.
