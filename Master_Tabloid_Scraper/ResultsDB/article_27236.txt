As RadarOnline.com has been reporting, because of her continuing drug use, Mueller has been stripped of custody of her kids.
With Sheen’s approval, they’ve been placed with Denise who has been given temporary guardianship at the very least until Mueller completes her treatment at the Betty Ford Center. /n
