Charlie Sheen Exes Denise And Brooke Play Happy Families With Their Kids/n
By Radar Staff
Proving that they might just be the most amicable exes in Hollywood, Denise Richards and Brooke Mueller spent an unconventional family day out together in Malibu on Sunday.
In a scene that wouldn’t be out of place on Sister Wives — and you may need a scorecard for this — Charlie Sheen‘s second wife Richards and third wife Mueller, along with Denise and Charlie’s daughters Sam and Lola, Mueller’s twin sons with the Anger Management star, Bob and Max, Denise’s adopted daughter, Eloise, and Denise’s dad, Irv, enjoyed an afternoon playing and shopping at the Malibu Country Mart and the Malibu Farmers Market.PHOTOS: Denise Richards & Brooke Mueller Shop Together With Their Kids
Richards and Mueller were even wearing matching black vests as they soaked up the sun.
And if they’d walked around the tomato vendor in the right direction, they might have even bumped into their former brother-in-law, Emilio Estevez, who was there shopping!
This isn’t the first time the women have had a family hook up.
