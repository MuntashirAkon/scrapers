PartyNextDoor Just Deleted All Traces Of Zayn Malik From Social Media Just Weeks After Their Collaboration — Shady Much?/n

We guess time ran out on PartyNextDoor's work relationship with Zayn Malik…
The Come And See Me rapper has ~unfollowed~ the former One Directioner on Twitter and Instagram — which you know, is basically like an actual slap in the face — just weeks after the release of their collaboration Still Got Time. If you take a look at the Canadian artist's page, all the promotional posts featuring the pop star are suspiciously deleted.
Additionally, remixes of the song have been removed from Spotify and PND's YouTube channel!
Gasp!

And we know you were wondering — yes, Gigi Hadid's beau still follows the 23-year-old on all the platforms (how embarrassing) and has kept all the promos featured on his pages.
So what gives??
Why wasn't the rapper in the song's music video? Is this a label issue? Is PND just being petty? Is he trolling all of us in order to bring more attention to the song??
QUESTIONS THAT NEED ANSWERS, people!
