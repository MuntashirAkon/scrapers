Huma Abedin Is Not Giving Up On Anthony Weiner!/n

The heart wants what it wants??
Back in August, Hillary Clinton-aide Huma Abedin announced she was separating from husband Anthony Weiner after the former congressman was caught in yet ANOTHER sexting scandal! In case you forgot, he sent a photo of his crotch while his toddler son was lying right next to him. 
According to recent reports, the political staffer wants to give her marriage another try.

An insider says: 

"Huma has been working hard on her relationship with Anthony… He has been spending 80 to 90 percent of his time at the [Irving Place apartment] they share… If there is a disagreement, he goes to his mother's apartment in Brooklyn."

Apparently, their families don't want the couple to throw in the towel either.

"Both [his and her] families are hoping they will reconcile."

In fact, a different source says the power twosome never really broke up; it was all a PR stunt for Miz Clinton's now-defunct campaign. The split was:

"more for optics for the campaign and [under] pressure from Hillary's camp."

Even though Weiner has sent explicit photos to countless woman, Miz Abedin takes comfort in the fact that he's never had a physical affair.

"A lot of [their] friends believe this is an illness, that he is sick… Huma takes it into consideration that there's been no affair, or physical contact that anybody is aware of. He never met [the women]."

These two can't quit each other!
