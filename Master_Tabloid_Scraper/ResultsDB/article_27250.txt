Gwen Stefani was forced to cancel a Las Vegas show after rupturing her eardrum.

The No Doubt frontwoman axed her 30-minute performance at the annual Power of Love gala at the MGM Grand Garden Arena on Thursday (Apr. 27, 2017) last minute. According to the Las Vegas Review-Journal, Stefani bowed out per doctor’s orders to not to fly or sing.
Guests were informed of the 47-year-old’s medical emergency right before dinner. To make up for her absence, the “Make Me Like You” singer filmed a short video and apologized for missing the charity event. “I am so sorry that I cannot attend tonight, but I wanted to send a message of congratulations to Andre Agassi and my dear friend Ronald Perelman,” she said in the clip.
Jennifer Hudson was brought in by entertainment manager Irving Azoff as the replacement.
Stefani reportedly checked into Cedars-Sinai Hospital earlier this week.
