 The Top 9 Bluetooth Speakers





The Bose SoundLink Mini Bluetooth Speaker II, is the small speaker with the big, big voice. The SoundLink Mini Bluetooth speaker II delivers full sound with dramatically deeper lows than you’d expect from a speaker that fits in the palm of your hand. And because it’s wireless and ultra-compact, it’s easy to take Bose sound anywhere. The SoundLink Mini II has a built-in speakerphone, so you can take calls out loud with clear sound. And voice prompts talk you through Bluetooth pairing, so connecting to your music is easy. The speaker’s lithium-ion battery provides up to 10 hours of unplugged play time, and it can be conveniently charged from most USB power sources. At home, the included cradle keeps the speaker charged while serving as a home base, so it’s always ready to grab and go. The SoundLink Mini II was engineered to stand up to everyday use and be placed almost anywhere. It connects wirelessly to your Bluetooth-enabled devices–up to two at a time.
