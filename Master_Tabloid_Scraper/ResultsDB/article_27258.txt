Shots fired sent concertgoers into a panic.
One man was killed and three others were wounded in NYC on Wednesday when gunfire broke out at a concert where the hip-hop artist T.I. was to perform.
Officials told CBS2 that the shooting took place around 10PM in the third-floor green room area at the Irving Plaza venue in Union Square.
Four people were hit by the gunfire. One man was shot in the chest and another was shot in the abdomen, officials said. One of the men was pronounced dead at Mount Sinai Beth Israel Hospital, while the other remained in critical condition. A woman was also shot in the leg, and a fourth injured person made his own way to the hospital.
T.I. reportedly was at the venue at the time of the shooting but had not yet taken the stage. Two other performers – Maino and Uncle Murda – were on the stage.
When the shots were fired, concertgoers panicked and ran for the exits. Someone tweeted a video showing the chaos.

One woman told CBS2, “It was about to go on. We saw, like, two people up on the VIP arguing, and then everybody started running because they heard the shots. It was terrifying. We just kept running with everybody else because they were running for their lives, so we just started running, and I fell, and I got stomped on a little bit. My shoe came off.”
This isn’t the first time a shooting has occurred at one of T.I.’s concerts. Back in 2006, shots were fired at another show he performed in Cincinnati. That shooting left his friend and personal assistant Philant Johnson dead.
