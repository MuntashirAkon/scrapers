So who exactly is PND? Well, you might also remember him when he made headlines back in March 2016 after he posted a photo of he and his ex, Kehlani, in bed together. If that hasn’t triggered your memory of him, then you might know him because of Drake.

Besides his famous friendships, the rapper is a pretty interesting guy. For starters, his real name is Jahron Anthony Brathwaite, he was born in Ontario, Canada, and he can play the piano. Oh, and he even co-wrote Rihanna’s mega hit “Work.”
Also, long before he and Jenner started hanging out, she made a cameo with sister Kendall in the 2014 music video for his hit single “Recognize.”
