The NBA star is taking the high road.
Days after singer Kehlani attempted to commit suicide after being subjected to cyberbullying, Kyrie Irving is finally speaking out about the rumors that fueled the attack on the singer. In a series of now-deleted tweets, Irving revealed that he and Kehlani were not dating when musician PartyNextDoor posted the picture of the singer in his bed.
While he did say that he didn’t approve of the picture that sparked “all of this nonsense,” he has nothing but “love and compassion,” for the singer.
