Thanks for the feedback, Chris.

Chris Brown made a bold claim on Twitter in the early hours of Mar. 30 that R&B singer Kehlani’s alleged suicide attempt was a P.R. stunt for personal gain.
Brown began,

Girls be mad at a nigga for fucking around wit bitches but her DMs got more names then the Declaration of Independence. #YEAHIMTHROWINGSHADE

“They look like they having stank sex!!!” he added.


There is no attempting suicide. Stop flexing for the gram. Doing shit for sympathy so them comments under your pics don’t look so bad

“The amount of followers I got and the amount of comments are the amounts of f**ks I give,” he concluded.
The rapper’s fire comes from his friendship with NBA star Kyrie Irving, who some people claim was cheated on by Kehlani with her ex, PartyNextDoor, prior to her attempt at self-harm.

Kehlani revealed in the caption of a photo on Instagram from her hospital bed that she tried to commit suicide. A subsequent photo of PartyNextDoor at her bedside sparked the cheating rumors, which she adamantly denied in a separate explanatory comment before deleting her social media accounts.
“No I’m not a CHEATER, a THOT, i’m a BELIEVER IN FOLLOWING YOUR HEART and not LYING TO YOURSELF,” she declared. “And in all aspects on everyone’s side, EVERYONE IS HAPPY AND HONEST AND MATURE.”
