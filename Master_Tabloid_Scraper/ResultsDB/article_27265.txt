R&B Singer Kehlani Reveals Suicide Attempt Amid Speculation She Cheated on NBA Star Kyrie Irving: 'I Wanted to Leave This Earth'/n

Kehlani was hospitalized after attempting to commit suicide, the R&B singer revealed in a now-deleted Instagram post.  
“Today I wanted to leave this earth,” Kehlani, 20 – whose last name is Parrish, though she goes by her first name professionally – captioned a photo of an IV in her arm as she rested in a hospital bed. “[I’m] being completely selfish for once.”  
The post followed up speculation Kehlani cheated on her boyfriend, Cleveland Cavaliers basketball player Kyrie Irving, 24.  
“Never thought I’d get to such a low point,” Kehlani penned. “But.. Don’t believe the blogs you read .. No one was cheated on and I’m not a bad person… Everyone is hurt and everyone is in a place of misunderstanding.”   
She added: “But as of today, I had no single wish to see tomorrow.. But God saved me for a reason, and for that… I must be grateful.. Cuz I’m not in heaven right now for a reason.”

Then the Grammy-nominated musician – who was once a member of singing group PopLyfe, a finalist on season 6 of America’s Got Talent – suggested she was taking a break from social media: she wrote, “On that note.. Bye Instagram.” (All posts have since been removed from her verified account, which has two million followers.)   

Irving has not yet publicly responded to the news.   
In the last post showing Irving and Kehlani on his Instagram account on March 11, the NBA star wrote, “Good ole fashioned partners @kehlani.”   
Kehlani’s rep isn’t commenting at this time. Reps for the Cleveland Cavaliers did not immediately respond to PEOPLE’s request for comment.
