Watch out, heads might roll over this news. When it returns for its third season, Sleepy Hollow will be down an integral member of its apocalypse-fighting team: Frank Irving.Orlando Jones, who has been with the drama since it premiered in 2013 on Fox, will not be returning for season three, Variety reports. A fan-favorite on-and-off-screen, Jones was known for hilariously live-tweeting episodes of the show (as well as other shows, like Supernatural), but has yet to address his departure on social media. Fox had no comment on Jones' reported exit.

However, Jones isn't the only one leaving Sleepy Hollow as showrunner Mark Goffman will not be returning for season three; set to take over is The Glades' Clifton Campbell.  "He is an excellent producer, and we can't wait to see what this team has in store for season three," Fox president David Madden said of Campbell in a statement. Also not returning ? (Spoiler alert!) Katia Winter, whose character Katrina was killed off in the season three finale. After spending most of its second season livin' on the bubble, Fox renewed Sleepy for a third season in March, saying, "Sleepy Hollow is truly inventive television."  And per Fox, the new season will "explore how the partnership between Crane and Mills will evolve and what challenges these two witnesses will now face."
