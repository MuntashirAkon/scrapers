LeBron James Laughs Off Haters in New Shirtless Workout Video/nHere's the latest installment of the LeBron James Challenge ... courtesy of LeBron James!! LBJ posted yet another shirtless workout vid Friday morning ... vibin' out to Meek Mill's new  "Wins & Losses " album. This time, the King raps, sings and even maniacally laughs at his haters. LeBron's been mocked by pretty much the entire Internet -- including Steph Curry -- for his first viral gym sesh, so it's only a matter of time before your timeline gets flooded with new challenge vids. At one point, LBJ makes sure to point out one of Meek's lyrics directed at the President --  "Trump ain't feelin' us " ... which makes sense, considering Bron's never hidden his feelings towards POTUS. As for LeBron's singing ... it's never too late for lessons, bro./n
