Abigail Breslin is opening up about her personal experience to raise awareness about sexual assault.  Taking to her Instagram, the former child star shared a simple but powerful message, posting a photo of a statement reading, “You are not obligated to have sex with someone that you’re in a relationship with. Dating is not consent. Marriage is not consent.” Breslin, 20, added in the caption, “I knew my assailant.”

 Though the Little Miss Sunshine actress had previously been a vocal advocate against domestic violence, this was the first time she revealed herself to be a sexual assault survivor. Breslin also used the hashtags “#SexualAssaultAwarenessMonth” and “#breakthesilence” in her confession, which is now a pinned tweet on her official Twitter account.
The Oscar nominee quickly received an outpour of support from fans and colleagues, including Sarah Hyland and Dirty Dancing co-star Debra Messing. “Proud of you Abs,” Hyland wrote. Meanwhile, Messing tweeted, “I love you, Abbie. Your strength and testimony means so much to too many. #voice.”
“So beyond thankful by the immense support regarding my IG post last night,” Breslin responded Tuesday night. “I am so lucky to have all of you kind souls in my corner.”
