Kyrie Irving Clowned By Governor John Kasich Over Flat Earth Comments/nYou'd think Kyrie Irving would get a pardon in Ohio over his whole  "The Earth is flat " comments -- but, nah ... that ain't happening. The latest person to roast the Cleveland Cavs star over his insanely misguided comments is Ohio governor John Kasich ... who happens to be a pretty big Kyrie fan! But even Kasich couldn't help himself from taking a shot at the NBA superstar over the weekend.Â  At least he went softer than notorious smart guy Neil deGrasse Tyson, who said all flat-Earthers should be launched into space!/n
