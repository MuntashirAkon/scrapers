NBA Star Kyrie Irving -- MY BAG GAME IS ILL ... Rocks $800 Man Purse/nNBA star Kyrie Irving's getting into the designer man bag game ... rocking an $800 high-end bag on his way to the team bus in Manhattan. All the big athletes are droppin' big money on man purses these days ... from Colin Kaepernick to DeMarcus Cousins to Floyd Mayweather ... and Anthony Davis. Irving's bag is particularly nice ... MCM's Stark Studded Large Backpack ... which usually between $800 and $900. Irvin had a sick game last night -- dropping 37 points and hitting a clutch shot at the end of the game. Remember what Deion Sanders said when it comes to fashion --  "If you look good, you feel good, If you feel good, you play good, If you play good, they pay good.
