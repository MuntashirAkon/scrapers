GoDaddy -- Pulls Super Bowl Spot ... Over Puppy Cruelty Backlash/nDanica Patrick loses again ... this time, GoDaddy.com is PULLING their Super Bowl ad featuring the NASCAR driver over OUTRAGE from animal lovers. The commercial -- called  "Lost Dog " -- shows a puppy that falls out of a truck ... and then overcomes all odds to find its way back home.  Problem is, when the little guy returns home ... he finds out the owner used GoDaddy to set up a website to sell the dog to a new owner.  Needless to say, people are PISSED -- with some animal rights groups saying the commercial supports puppy mills and other  "inhumane breeding " practices. PETA went nuts over it ... saying,  "anyone who sells a dog online is a callous jerk. "GoDaddy's CEO Blake Irving got the message loud and clear ... and tweeted,  "What should have been a fun and funny ad clearly missed the mark and we will not air it. "GoDaddy says it will still use it's 30 second Super Bowl slot (after all, they paid $4 mil for it) ... though so far, it's unclear what will run in its place./n
