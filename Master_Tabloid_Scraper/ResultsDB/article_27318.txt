Music icon Marc Anthony has moved on from girlfriend Mariana Downing and is now dating much younger model Raffaella Modugno, RadarOnline.com can reveal.
The 48-year-old singer, who was previously married to Jennifer Lopez for 10 years, has dated a string of gorgeous women, with Modugno, 29, being the latest bombshell spotted in his arms.
“Yes, we are a couple,” the brunette beauty confessed to Oggi. “Our relationship is new so we are getting to know each other.”

As Radar previously reported, Anthony was pictured with his former model girlfriend, Mariana Downing, 21, just this March. The short relationship came after the music legend divorced his wife of two years Shannon de Lima, 29.
He was previously attached to a myriad of stunning ladies, including, of course, the mother of his children, Jennifer Lopez – with whom he shares twins Max and Esme, 9.
Yet as has now been confirmed, Anthony has most recently moved on with Modugno, who was reportedly crowned Miss Curve d’Italia Lazio in 2011 and is on her way to becoming a Hollywood actress.
