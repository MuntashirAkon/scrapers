Patridge and Bohan tied the knot in a November Hawaiian ceremony attended by 130 family and friends. Of having a baby before marriage, she told PEOPLE in January that she hasn’t given naysayers the time of day.
“A lot of people gave me a hard time for having a baby before getting married, but who are they to judge?” she said. “You always have those few haters who are going to be negative in every situation. At the end of the day nobody is perfect. You have to do what’s good for you.”
Added Patridge of some negative feedback she received over having to undergo a cesarean section to deliver Kirra safely, “It’s really strange to me that people are so opinionated about how someone else gives birth.”
