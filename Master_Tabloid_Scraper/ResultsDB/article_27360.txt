It's the end of the will they/won't they for Schmidt and Cece on New Girl. It should be, considering the unlikely (but totally perfect for each other) couple is engaged."It's on like Donkey Kong! He proposed, she said yes," star Hannah Simone dished to E! News' Kristin Dos Santos during a ceremony celebrating the Fox sitcom's 100th episode. "Now it's kind of cool that we can just hang out and have a super fun time as this little power couple."While it's been a while since we've seen Cece—and Schmidt, Jess, Nick and Winston—but New Girl returns Tuesday at 8 p.m. after a super-long hiatus. In real life, the first few episodes of the new season were shot immediately after wrapping the previous one to accommodate star Zooey Deschanel's maternity leave.

The premiere focuses on Jess and Nick fulfilling their first official duties as Maid of Honor and Best Man as they plan Cece and Schmidt's engagement party, but naturally things go awry when Jess invites Cece's mom to the celebration."I may not have quite told her yet about him, so it's a bit of an awkward first meeting," Simone says, "but it kind of brings them together as a couple."It's a bumpy first step on the way to marriage, but most certainly not the first mishap for the couple as they prepare to head down the aisle."There's a wedding to plan, so you can imagine who's going to have some issues," teases Max Greenfield. That's right—get ready for groomzilla Schmidt is a groomzilla.New Girl airs Tuesdays at 8 p.m. on Fox.
