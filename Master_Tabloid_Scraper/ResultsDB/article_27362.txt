Max Greenfield is diving into fall.The New Girl star was spotted in a Speedo on the Los Angeles set of his show on Monday.And while we're not exactly sure what the scene involved, given the two pumpkins, we can only assume that maybe it has something to do with Halloween.

What's more, this also gives us a bit of a glimpse of what we could expect if Greenfield was to be cast in Fifty Shades of Grey.After all, he did express his willingness to show off his goods while chatting with E! News on the Emmy red carpet."Yeah, that's not a problem," he told Giuliana Rancic about doing full frontal.Well, this is certainly a pretty good warm-up!
