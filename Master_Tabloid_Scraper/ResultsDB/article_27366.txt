It's time to get Mad...again.It sounds like cameras are finally going to start rolling on Mad Max: Fury Road, the much-anticipated reboot of Mel Gibson's classic postapocalyptic franchise.Zoë Kravitz, who has long been set to join Charlize Theron, Tom Hardy, Nicholas Hoult and Riley Keough for the pic, tells me...

They have a tentative start time. "It's supposed to go in the new  year, in February," she told me the other day while promoting her new  indie flick, Beware the Gonzo. "They've made the costumes, the  vehicles...You know, they're halfway there. They just can't seem to make  it to, 'Action!'"Director George Miller has had to delay the  Australia-based shoot for more than a year now after bad weather forced  him to change locations.

One project Kravitz is definitely not  doing—voicing a character in  an upcoming animated Spider-Man television  series. "I don't know why it  says that on my IMDb," she said. "I don't  even know what it is."But she certainly knows another comic-book-based flick: X-Men: First  Class, the latest  installment of the superhero franchise in which she  played Angel  Salvadore. Kravitz is ready to make another. "Let's hope so,"  she said  when I asked about plans for a sequel. "It was really fun.  Everyone was  there to make a really great film, to do the work and to  bring some  depth to the story. We became all so incredibly close."
