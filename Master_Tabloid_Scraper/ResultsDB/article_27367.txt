Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to The Schmindy Project.Max Greenfield—aka New Girl's kimono-wearing douchebag that we all love, Schmidt—is showcasing his talents on our favorite TV comedy. On Tuesday night, Greenfield will be making a one-episode switch over to The Mindy Project as Lee, a hot player at a bar who hits it off with Mindy Kaling's currently heartbroken character, Mindy Lahiri.  Basically if you love Schmidt just as much as we do (with our entire heart and soul, obvi) then you'll love to see the actor's yet sure-to-be memorable appearance in Mindy's world—even though you, like us, might still be crying buckets over the demise of Mindy and Danny. To get you even more excited for this perfect inter-network crossover, we've got your exclusive first look at Greenfield on the set of The Mindy Project and how he'll be hopping into the sack with Danny's girl. (Yeah, we're still calling her that.)
