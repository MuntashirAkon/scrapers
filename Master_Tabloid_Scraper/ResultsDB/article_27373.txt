David Beckham Is a Doting Dad on Brooklyn's First Day of College/nDavid Beckham's still that dad snapping pics of his kid's first day of school as he sends his eldest, Brooklyn, off to college. Brooklyn won't be far from his namesake borough -- he's studying photography at NYC's prestigious Parsons School of Design. The kid already released his first book of photography,  "What I See " ... just this month. Based on how closely Becks is following, and documenting Brooklyn's every step -- we'd say someone's suffering a little separation anxiety. They grow up so fast.       Exciting times and hard work coming for this little man ... Proud of you bust ❤️ @brooklynbeckham @victoriabeckham A post shared by David Beckham (@davidbeckham) on Aug 23, 2017 at 5:58am PDT/n
