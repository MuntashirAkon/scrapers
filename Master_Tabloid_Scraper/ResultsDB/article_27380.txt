Alfonso Ribeiro Shoots Down 'Fresh Prince' Revival Rumors/nNowww this is a story all about how ... Alfonso Ribeiro just crushed the hopes and dreams of  "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air " fans. Carlton was at LAX when our guy asked him about DJ Jazzy Jeff hinting at a 'Fresh Prince' reunion of some kind 21 years after the show went off the air -- and he shot it down HARD. The current  "America's Funniest Home Videos " host seems like he's totally moved on from the hit '90s sitcom ... and has some advice for people who haven't yet. Looks like if you want a cast reunion ... you'll have to settle for Alfonso's Instagram pic.       Always amazing to spend an afternoon with my Fresh Prince family. Wishing that James Avery was still with us to make this complete. A post shared by Alfonso Ribeiro (@therealalfonsoribeiro) on Mar 27, 2017 at 5:27pm PDT/n
