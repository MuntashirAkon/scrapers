Neymar Signs $265 Million Contract with Paris Saint-Germain/nNeymarï»¿ has just become the highest paid soccer player in the world -- signing a deal with Paris Saint-Germain worth over $265 MILLION!! That's more than CristianoÂ Ronaldo. More than Messi. More than Pogba.Â  The 25-year-old Brazilian superstar will reportedly rake in around $657,000 per week with PSG over the course of 5 years ... totaling more than $265 mil in wages and bonuses. And that doesn't even include endorsements. PSG really, REALLY wanted him -- and paid a record $263 mil transfer fee to Barcelona just to buy him out of his contract with them.      A post shared by Nj ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· ðŸ‘» neymarjr (@neymarjr) on Aug 3, 2017 at 12:53pm PDT     It's the highest transfer fee ever -- smashing the previous record held by Manchester United, which paid a $117 million transfer fee for Pogba from Juventus. In total -- salary plus transfer fee -- PSG came out of pocket roughly $528 million to get Neymar.Â  FYI, Neymar is the only soccer athlete Michael Jordan has signed to his Jordan Brand label -- apparently, he knows what he's doing.Â  Congrats!/n
