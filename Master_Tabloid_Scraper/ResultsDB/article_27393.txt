Amber Rose Tells Philly What She Meant to Say Was ... 'I Thought I Was Ugly'/nAmber Rose is trying to smooth things over with her hometown by explaining her remark about no  "traditional beauty " in South Philly ... was really about herself. Amber was looking cute in a brunette wig -- traditionally speaking -- Saturday night on her way out of Playhouse nightclub, and she was anxious to set the record straight. She claims she never said anyone was ugly -- although it sure as hell sounds like it when you watch the video from the  "Drink Champs " podcast. Amber's clarification seems to be that she was referring to  "society's standards of beauty " -- and that even she didn't feel beautiful. Translation: The world thought South Philly had ugly people, and I was one of them?      #PressPlay: #AmberRose said she comes from a place where people  "aren't traditionally attractive " and it has some people feeling some kinda way.
