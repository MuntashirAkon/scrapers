AMAZING VIDEO: Minnesota's Metrodome Roof Caves In Under Heavy Snow/n

The damage to the structure caused the NFL’s Minnesota Vikings to push their Sunday game against the New York Giants to Detroit’s Ford Field on Monday, as the Metrodome is not expected to be back in working order until Wednesday.  
It’s the first time in almost 30 years the structure’s had serious problems when heavy snow meets the inflatable roof: an April 1983 baseball game pitting the then-home team Twins against the California Angels was postponed after a similar malfunction.
