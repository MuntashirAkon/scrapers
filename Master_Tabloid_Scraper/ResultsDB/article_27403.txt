Alfonso Ribeiro Says There's Basically ZERO Chance Of A Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air Revival — But Will Smith Has Reunion Plans!/n

There's good news…. and then there's bad news!!
But first, let's get the disappointing deets out of the way.
In a new interview with Digital Spy, Fresh Prince of Bel-Air star Alfonso Ribeiro decided to squash any rumors of a possible revival before they can even pick up steam. According to Carlton, it's not happening:

"The odds of a revival? I would say 0.01%. I can't say it would never happen, but I would say there are a lot of people that would revolt if it did, me being one of them!"
Dannng. You can't expect to take a cast reunion pic and NOT have fans wishing and dreaming they'd come back to TV screens!

He even continued, adding a remake wouldn't be the best idea either: 

"Look, I can't say that I would hate it or love it, because it would be about how well they did it. I just have trouble with, 'Something was great; let's try and do it again!' – more than likely, you'll never succeed. One, you can never replace James Avery [who played Uncle Phil], so why try? Sometimes, when something is special, why try to recreate it? Just let it be special."
Sigh.
Thankfully, Will Smith is giving fans a taste of what they're missing with news he'll be reuniting with DJ Jazzy Jeff this summer!
For those who don't remember, the two were a hip-hop duo, and Jazzy Jeff even appeared on episodes of The Fresh Prince (he was Will's friend who Uncle Phil liked to throw out the house).
This week, the A-lister revealed he and his old partner-in-crime would join together for concerts on August 26 and August 27 in Croatia and the U.K. through MTV's Summerblast and the Livewire Festival.
