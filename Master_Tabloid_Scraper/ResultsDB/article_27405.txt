The Original Aunt Viv, Janet Hubert, Has Something HARSH To Say About That Fresh Prince Reunion!/n

In true Janet Hubert form, the original Aunt Viv is bringing the sass!!!
As we told you yesterday, The Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air cast had an epic reunion at Nobu in Malibu on Monday — and Miz Hubert is here to not only slam Alfonso Ribeiro, but to announce her plans for a memoir to expose everything that happened behind the scenes before she left the sitcom in 1993.
Oh snap!

In response to seeing the picture of Will Smith and co., the 61-year-old took to an unverified Facebook page called "Blacktress Janet Hubert" with a vintage clip of her time as Vivian with the fiery message: 
"I know the media hoe Alphonso Ribero has posted his so called reunion photo. Folks keep telling me about it. He was always the ass wipe for Will. There will never be a true reunion of the Fresh Prince. I have no interest in seeing any of these people on that kind of level. I am not offended in the least, by this photo… it was an event for Karen's charity. It does however prompt me to take some meetings in Hollywood to pitch my memoir PERFECTION IS NOT A SITCOM MOM, and tell of the behind the scenes story before I leave this earth."

Wowowow.
Those are definitely fighting words!
What do U make of all this, Perezcious readers?? SOUND OFF in the comments!
