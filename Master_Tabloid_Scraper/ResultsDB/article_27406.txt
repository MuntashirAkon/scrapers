The Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air Cast Makes Your Reunion Dreams Come True!/n

Now this is a story all about how… the cast from The Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air reunited and made all of our '90s dreams come true!
The gang was chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool out at Nobu in Malibu for an afternoon together on Monday — and we've got the picture proof (above)!
In the photo, the fresh prince himself, Will Smith, posed alongside the rest of the Banks crew: Alfonso Ribeiro (Carlton), Tatyana Ali (Ashley), Karyn Parsons (Hilary), Daphne Maxwell Reid (Vivian no. 2), and Joseph Marcell (beloved butler Geoffrey).

The only person who was truly missed from the reunion was the late actor James Avery (Uncle Phil), who passed away at the age of 68 back in 2013 after complications during open heart surgery.
Ribeiro shared the moment on his Instagram, writing: 
"Always amazing to spend an afternoon with my Fresh Prince family. Wishing that James Avery was still with us to make this complete."
Tatyana added on her own page:
"A wonderful afternoon today with family. We miss you James ❤️."
AH-mazing!!
We guess OG mom Vivian, Janet Hubert, wasn't invited! LOLz!
