Darren Criss Will Kick Off The Hedwig & The Angry Inch National Tour For 2 Whole Months! Find Out Where!/n

If the heel fits, wear it!
Hedwig & The Angry Inch had some pretty stellar lead actors during its 2014-2015 run, but our personal favorite of the impressive bunch will always be Darren Criss.
That's why we're extra excited to report the Glee alum will be reprising his role as Hedwig for the Broadway show's upcoming national tour!

Hedwig will be hitting 14 cities starting this Fall, and musical fans in California will be lucky enough to catch Darren take over from October 4-30 in San Francisco and November 1-27 in El Lay.
Darren confirmed the AH-Mazing news in a statement on Monday, saying: 

"When I found out that the tour would be kicking off in my hometown of San Francisco — the city where I was introduced to Hedwig & The Angry Inch — I could think of no better excuse to get back into the heels of a character I loved and missed so very much. And since Los Angeles has become a second home for me, I relished the idea of seeing what kind of fun Hedwig would bring to the heart of Hollywood. Getting to share this fantastic Broadway production with the two great Californian cities of my own life story will hopefully be as much of a joy for me as it will be for audiences who will experience Hedwig's life story on the West Coast!"
We honestly don't know if we'll be able to wait five more months before getting to see this!
There's no word yet on any other casting decisions, but maybe this means Neil Patrick Harris, Andrew Rannells, John Cameron Mitchell, Michael C. Hall, or Taye Diggs could be coming back as well…
