1. Cravings: Recipes for All the Food You Want to Eat by Chrissy Teigen
If Teigen’s food-filled Instagram hasn’t tipped you off already, let it be known that the model really loves to eat. Naturally, her debut cookbook is filled with delicious dishes she’d eat again and again. “I didn’t want it to be a celebrity cookbook where you’re not sure if they really cook or if they just put their name on something. I wanted people to know that these are really the recipes that we love at home,” she tells Eater. Rightly so, recipes in the cookery guide include things her family loves, including husband John Legend’s Fried Chicken Wings with Spicy Honey Butter and her mother’s own Jok Moo, a Thai pork and rice porridge.

2. The Portlandia Cookbook: Cook Like a Local by Fred Armisen, Carrie Brownstein and Jonathan Krisel
Fans of Portlandia will know that creators Fred Armisen, Carrie Brownstein and Jonathan Krisel are huge fans of supporting their local community. (After all, their hit IFC series is based and filmed on-location in Portland, Ore.) Their cookbook based off their show is no different. Mixing comedy with serious cooking chops, the three create recipes for dishes inspired by their characters while encouraging readers think globally and eat locally. From a paella worldly travelers Nance and Dave would approve of to the marionberry pancakes that has Sunday brunchers lining out the door, these dishes are like a delicious in-joke you share with a friend. And yes, like true hipsters, the gang also provides tons of vegetarian options.

Breakfast at Tiffany’s? More like dinner at the Hepburns’! Written by Audrey Hepburn’s son, this cookbook is a collection of family recipes loved by the Hollywood icon.

Fans of the Roman Holiday actress can now make everything from Penne alla Vodka, — her favorite home-away-from-home dish — to a Boeuf à la Cuillère that fashion designer Hubert de Givenchy has every time he visits his muse.

4. #Meal Time by 2 Chainz
Any mashed potatoes recipe that starts off with “if wearing a four-finger ring, carefully place it on a side table before starting to cook” deserves a read-through. Needless to say, 2 Chainz’s surprise cookbook, which was released as a part of the deluxe version of 2013’s B.O.A.T.S. II: Me Time, is a treasure trove of baller one-liners. Aptly titled #Meal Time, the 28-pager teaches one how to make meals such as shrimp scampi with absurdly amazing steps like “call Fergie, invite her to watch a movie on Netflix. Once she accepts, start making green beans” and “position yourself in a room surrounded by a handful of TVs playing Sportscenter with the sound off.”

Actress Amy Sedaris takes the stress out of entertaining with her funny guide to being a hostess. Packed with party tips, the book also features recipes for fried chicken and sweet treats as well as hilarious cooking advice. “If the texture of the food you are serving is creamy, flatter it with crispy.

8. Recipes for the Good Life by Patti LaBelle
With so many people flipping out over Patti LaBelle’s delicious sweet potato pies, we have no doubt you will fall head-over-heels for the singer’s other dishes as well. “Food can bring people together, to laugh, to eat, and to simply celebrate life,” she writes in her third cookbook. “Most people know me for my voice, and that is truly a gift from God. But food and the ability to share it with others is also a gift—a gift that you can give to those you love.” Recipes in this book include Poached Salmon with Basil Cream Sauce and Fried Apple Pie.

9. In the Kitchen with Kris: A Kollection of Kardashian-Jenner Family Favorites by Kris Jenner
Sure, Kris Jenner’s recipe for a Velveeta-filled mac n’ cheese isn’t to everyone’s taste, but the outrageous things the famous momager says in her cookbook is worthy of a read in of itself. “I am notorious for my table settings and my dishes. If I’m cooking an Italian meal, I will grab my red Hermès china to go with the red sauce” is one of the gems she writes in her so-called culinary opus. If you’re really looking for something cringe-worthily bad that it’s so good, take a peek at Jenner’s rehashed recipe of her late friend Nicole Brown Simpson’s nachos. “Her chicken nachos were so fabulous, they had a cult following,” Jenner gushes. Yes. She actually included a recipe for nachos taken from her dead friend. Take that how you will.

Her cookbook is filled with things that’ll impress that bougie friend of yours who’s always pestering you to “eat clean” or something like that. Dishes from Paltrow’s “restorative diet” include Banana “Ice Cream” — please note the quotation marks — and a Hummus Tartine with Scallion-Mint Pesto. This how-to guide on healthy living has been so popular that its follow-up, It’s All Easy: Delicious Weekday Recipes for the Super-Busy Home Cook, is slated to be released in April 2016.
