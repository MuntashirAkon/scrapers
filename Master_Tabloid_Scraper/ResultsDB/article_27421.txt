Janet Hubert Explains Her Decades-Old Beef With ‘Fresh Prince’ Costar Will Smith/n
Now this is (still) the story all about how … Fresh Prince of Bel-Air actress Janet Hubert, who played the original Aunt Vivian on the beloved sitcom, explained her decades-old feud with costar Will Smith, on the Thursday, February 4, episode of The Real.

Hubert recently made headlines for her scathing comments about Jada Pinkett Smith’s Oscars boycott in a viral video posted to YouTube. In it, Hubert attacked her former colleague — the star of the show and now a bonafide Hollywood A-lister — for not helping her and other Fresh Prince castmates during salary negotiations. In her video post last month, she said, “I seem to remember at option time, coming to you and saying … ‘With you, maybe we can get a little raise.’ [We thought] your influence would help us greatly, like they did on Friends.” Instead, she said that he supposedly replied, “My deal is my deal, and y’alls deal is y’alls deal.” Watch the video and read more at Us Weekly…
