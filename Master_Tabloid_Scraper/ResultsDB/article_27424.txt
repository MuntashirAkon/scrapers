Fresh Prince Star Janet Hubert Slams Stacey Dash: 'She's Making a Check'/n
Former Fresh Prince of Bel-Air star Janet Hubert is fed up with Stacey Dash‘s recent comments on Fox News.  
Responding to Dash’s criticism of BET and Black History Month for being extensions of segregation, Hubert spoke out in a new HuffPost Live interview, saying that the actress Fox News talking head needed to get her story straight, saying Dash “has worked on BET more than most actresses have.”
Hubert also expressed suspicion over Dash’s intentions.   
“I think she’s just saying this kind of bull because she wants sensationalism and she’s working for Fox and she needs a job and she’s making a check,” said Hubert, 60, who also recently leveled criticism at Jada Pinkett Smith for planning to skip the Oscars over this year’s lack of diversity among nominees.  
In a blog post on Thursday, Dash tried to expound on her controversial remarks, suggesting that black people need to “quit settling for scraps.”  
“It’s hard to cut through the hysterical reactions to my comments the other day about Black History Month,” Dash wrote on Patheos. “I feel like many of your reactions – saying that I’ve sold out to white people, that I’m ‘coonin” etc – show you aren’t hearing me.”  
Dash, 49, suggested that black people shouldn’t settle for just one month devoted to black history.  
“Black History should be apart of social studies and history curriculum EVERYDAY OF EVERY MONTH OF EVERY YEAR. not just 28 days out of 365!!!” she wrote. “In a hundred years, do you really want the legacy of Martin Luther King, Jr, Frederick Douglass, and even Barack Obama to be discussed only in the month of February?”
