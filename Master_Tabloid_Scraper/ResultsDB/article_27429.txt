Will Smith Slammed by Former Fresh Prince Costar/n
Don’t expect Will Smith and his former Fresh Prince of Bel-Air costar Janet Hubert to exchange Christmas presents any time soon. She wouldn’t even come to the recent reunion!  
Hubert, who played the series’ Aunt Vivian Banks from 1990 through 1993, was noticeably absent from the cast photo released last week because of her longtime ill will toward Smith.  
“There will never be a reunion,” she told TMZ, “as I will never do anything with an a–hole like Will Smith.”  
Apparently, Hubert holds Smith responsible for her being replaced in her role by actress Daphne Reid for the final three years of the run. 
“This constant reunion thing will never ever happen in my lifetime unless there is an apology, which he doesn’t know the word,” Hubert is quoted as saying.  
Smith has no comment on this latest outburst.
