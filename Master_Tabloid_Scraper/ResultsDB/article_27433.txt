Stacey Dash has received lots of harsh feedback after making some controversial comments regarding the all-white Oscars, Black History Month and BET. However, her latest critic might leave a little bit of a sting.Former Fresh Prince of Bel-Air actress, Janet Hubert, did not hold back when it came to her feelings regarding Dash, slamming her during an interview with The Huffington Post on Friday."Somebody needs to slap the little bit of black she got on her off of her, okay?" Hubert said. "Because girlfriend has worked on BET more than most actresses have. I think she's just saying this kind of bull because she wants sensationalism."

Meanwhile, this isn't the first time Hubert has shared her strong opinion recently. After Jada Pinkett-Smith said she would be boycotting the Oscars this year, Hubert gave her some serious sass."First of all, Miss Thing," she began a 4-minute long YouTube video, "Does your man not have a mouth of his own with which to speak?"She continued, "The second thing, girlfriend, there's a lot of s--t going on in the world that you all don't seem to recognize. People are dying. Our boys are being shot left and right. People are starving. People are trying to pay bills. And you're talking about some [expletive] actors and Oscars. It just ain't that deep."Hubert eventually went on and said, "I find it ironic that somebody who has made their living, made their living and made millions and millions of dollars from the very people you're talking about boycotting just because you didn't get a nomination, just because you didn't win."Ouch!
