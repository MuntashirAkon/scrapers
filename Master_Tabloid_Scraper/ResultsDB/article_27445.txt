Jett Travolta Autopsy May Never Be Public /nThe Ministry of Health in the Bahamas tells TMZ the autopsy findings in the death of John Travolta's son may never be public.Dr. Hubert Minnis says a pathologist at Rand Memorial Hospital (where Jett Travolta was pronounced dead) is currently performing the autopsy, which should take several hours. Dr. Minnis says he personally decided, because of the high profile nature of the case, to bring in a second pathologist from Nassau, Dr. Karen Sands. Dr. Minnis made a point to us that Dr. Sands is an American.The doctor says once the pathologists complete a preliminary report, it's forwarded on to a coroner. The coroner then forwards the completed report to the Travolta /Preston family. Dr. Minnis says only the family has authority to release the findings to the public. No word if that will happen./n
