'Fresh Prince of Bel-Air' Aunt Viv Rips Jada Pinkett Smith ... 'Shut Up and Let Will Speak for Himself'/nWill Smith's old 'Fresh Prince' co-star is on the attack ... saying he and Jada Pinkett Smith are NOT the Obamas, and black Hollywood isn't gonna sing  "we shall overcome " with them.  Janet Hubert, the original Aunt Viv, blasted Jada's anti-Oscars stance with a rambling video post that started ...  "First of all, Miss Thang, does your man not have a mouth of his own with which to speak? " Hubert goes on to accuse the Smiths of being sore losers, and says there are way more important things going on in the world --  "Our boys are being shot left and right, people are hungry, people are trying to pay bills and you talking about some motherf***ing actors and Oscars. " Aunt Viv clearly has some old beef with Will over her 'Fresh Prince' salary -- still, her rant about  "blactresses " and karma is entertaining ... if nothing else. /n
