Today we are featuring the Maggie Wallet by JEMMA ($158.00)!
This versatile Maggie Wallet by JEMMA can be worn three different ways – wallet by day, a clutch or hands-free cross-body by night — just add the adjustable chain-adorned strap.





The wallets, a first for JEMMA, are made with scratch-resistant Italian Saffiano leather detailed with plenty of card slots inside and out, a phone slot and zip compartment to keep everyday essentials organized. The wallet comes in three colors (Black, Ivory and Cherry Red). Katherine Schwarzenegger is a known fan of the work x life bag brand.
