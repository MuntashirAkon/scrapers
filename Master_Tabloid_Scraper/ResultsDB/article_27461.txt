Book Rips Lid Off Dolly Parton's Steamy Lesbian Romance/n
Dolly Parton is hitched to her husband of 50-plus years, Carl Dean, but her heart reportedly belongs to a woman she’s known since childhood!
Robert Randolph claimed in his book Doctors to the Stars that Parton has been involved in a steamy romance with Judy Ogle and the 71-year-old singer will do anything to hide her sexuality.
According to Randolph, before passing away in 2015, Michael Jackson‘s dermatologist Dr. Arnold Klein told him that the women “made no bones about being in love with each other,” when they once paid him a visit together.

Despite their alleged closeness, continued Klein, he believed the two would never come out as a couple.
“Dolly is open with her friends about being gay — just not with her fans,” Randolph wrote Klein revealed. “She loves her career more than her girlfriend, and coming out is just not an option Dolly sees for herself.”
Parton has always denied that she’s a lesbian, but she does admit to her close relationship with Ogle, who she has often shared a bed with over the years.

“I am closer to Judy than I am to Carl,” she once said. “We have slept together since we were kids.”
