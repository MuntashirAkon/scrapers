TV Reporter Couple Charged With Child Abuse After Baby Ingests Cocaine/n
Popular Tucson TV reporter couple, Som Lisaius and Krystin Sorich, have been charged for three counts of child abuse, RadarOnline.com has learned.
Prosecutors on the case say Sorich had taken cocaine on May 14 during a gathering with friends, and breastfed their 4-month-old daughter the following day.
When the baby went limp, the couple, who have been married for two years, rushed her to a local hospital. Later, blood tests revealed that the child had cocaine in her system.

After obtaining a search warrant, police discovered 1.59 grams of coke, along with a scale, in the Lisaius’ home.
Their daughter is now in the custody of the Department of Child Safety.
Meanwhile, Nick Ulmer, Vice President and General Manager of Lisaius’ station KOLD, said that the shamed reporter no longer works for their company.
Sorich’s stretch in TV reporting had ended more than a year prior to the incident, when she left KGUN, V.P. Jim Arnold confirmed in a statement. /n
