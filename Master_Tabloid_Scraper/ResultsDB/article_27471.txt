Renee’s son was born four weeks premature and is currently recovering in the NICU, but is expected to be okay.
“She’s just anxious to hold him again,” the rep adds.
The Lifetime reality star had a very rough pregnancy, physically and emotionally.
At just six months pregnant, Renee went into premature labor and was rushed to the hospital. In an exclusive interview with Radar, her father accused Grundhoffer, 39, of keeping him away from his ailing daughter, which Renee later denied.
