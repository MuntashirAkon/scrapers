Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson Wants To Run For President/n
Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson could be following in Arnold Schwarzenegger’s footsteps!
In a new interview with GQ, the 44-year-old shared his desire to move his career from Hollywood stardom to political platforms in the future — even admitting that he’d like to be president.
“I’ll be honest, I haven’t ruled politics out. I’m not being coy when I say that, but at the moment I am not sure,” he said when asked about a potential political move.

“I can’t deny that the thought of being governor, the thought of being president, is alluring,” the action movie star continued. “And beyond that, it would be an opportunity to make a real impact on people’s lives on a global scale. But there are a lot of other things I want to do first.”

Later, the Hercules actor weighed in on what it means to be “The Rock.”
“‘The Rock’ was — still is in fact — the best role I will ever get to play,” he told GQ. “I was being me, but me turned all the way up to ten. I could say anything, do anything and I would wink and everyone was in on the joke. They got it, I was connecting, it was perfect.”

“But I couldn’t help feeling like I had achieved everything I had wanted to in wrestling. By the end of 1998 I was the youngest world champion and making a lot of money, but I wanted to know what was next,” he added.
