No foul play is suspected as it is believed "Big Country" choked on his food and was not intentionally trying to harm himself.
McCarver was the boyfriend of WWE star Dana Brooke. She says she spoke with him on the phone not too long before the incident, with his last words to her being, "I love you. Goodbye."
The 28-year-old wrestler took to Twitter after the news broke to encourage fans to stay strong, writing: 

Thank you Natti ! All we can do is be strong for him and pray like he would like https://t.co/mesgLUDNtE

He was 6'1 and 300 lbs. Always entering competitions, he came out in 8th place in the 2016 Mr. Olympia championship. He did endure a health scare when he collapsed during the 2017 Arnold Classic Australia, but those around him believed he was doing much better these days.
Rest in peace, Dallas.
