Meanwhile, Schwarzenegger also revealed why he can’t look at himself in the mirror. “When I look in the mirror, I throw up,” he admitted in February’s issue of Cigar Aficionado. “And I was already so critical of myself, even when I was in top physical shape. I’d look in the mirror after I won one Mr. Olympia after another and think, ‘How did this pile of shit win?’ I never saw perfection. There was always something lack­ing.”
As for how he feels about replacing Trump: “I did the show for two reasons,” he said. “I loved watching it. It was a great show that always sucked me in. I thought Trump did a great job with it. When I heard he’d been discontinued, I thought, ‘There’s an interesting show I could host.’ I had never done a reality show and I thought it would be interesting to try.”
