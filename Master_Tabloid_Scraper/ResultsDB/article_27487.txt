Tom Arnold Claims to Have Racist Tapes of Donald Trump/n
There reportedly exists video of president-elect Donald Trump using racist, offensive language during the filming of The Apprentice. Tom Arnold claims he has it, according to MyNorthwest.com.

During an appearance on Dori Monson’s KIRO radio show in Seattle, Arnold said he has unreleased outtakes from Trump’s time on The Apprentice. Arnold describes the president-elect as saying “every bad thing ever, every racist, offensive thing ever.”
“It was him sitting in that chair saying the N-word, saying the C-word, calling his son a retard, just being so mean to his own children,” Arnold said.
Arnold also revealed how he got the tape in the first place responded to the question of why he didn’t release it before the election. He describes the tape as a Christmas video for people who worked on the show: a funny outtake reel that would never be seen by the general public. As for why Arnold didn’t release the tapes before the election, he says he was protecting the editors.
“The Sunday before the election, I get a call from Arnold [Schwarzenegger]‘s CAA agent, sitting next to Hillary Clinton. They said, ‘I need you to release him saying the N-word,'” Arnold said. “I said, ‘Well, now these people – two editors and an associate producer — are scared to death. They’re scared of his people, they’re scared of they’ll never work again, there’s a $5 million confidentiality agreement.'”

Arnold says he doubts the tape would have had any effect on the outcome of the election, however. “I think if the people that like him saw him saying the N-word… I think they would have liked him more, the people. For being politically incorrect.”
