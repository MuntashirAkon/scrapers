Despite his impending role as President of the United States, Donald Trump won’t be forced to give up his old title as Executive Producer of Celebrity Apprentice. 

NBC’s Celebrity Apprentice is returning after a two-year hiatus on Jan. 2, 2017, with new host Arnold Schwarzenegger. MGM confirmed to Variety that Trump, who is slated to be sworn in as President on Jan. 20, 2017, will be allowed to keep his EP credit on the reality show that made him a household name.
Trump, who is likely to be paid in the low five figures per episode, is set to hold a press conference on Dec. 15, 2016, to discuss how he plans to separate himself and his various businesses from his role as President.

When asked if remaining EP on the show is a conflict of interest, Trump’s campaign manager Kellyanne Conway insisted the President-elect will tend to the show in his “spare time.” “Were we so concerned about the hours and hours and hours spent on the golf course of the current president? I mean presidents have a right to do things in their spare time, in their leisure time,” she told CNN in defense of Trump.
