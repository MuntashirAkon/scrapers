Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson says he could possibly run for president in 2020.
Speaking with Vanity Fair (via Us Weekly) while promoting his upcoming Disney animated film Moana, Johnson said quite frankly, “I wouldn’t rule it out. It would be a great opportunity to help people, so it’s possible. This past election shows that anything can happen.”
The former wrestler, who reportedly will be People magazine’s Sexiest Man Alive for 2016, has hinted in the past he’d consider entering politics. “I can’t deny that the thought of being governor, the thought of being president, is alluring,” he told British GQ in June. “And beyond that, it would be an opportunity to make a real impact on people’s lives on a global scale.”

The hard-working actor also retweeted an Independent Journal Review article urging him to run for president, writing, “Maybe one day. Surely the White House has a spot for my pick-up truck.”
If he did decide to run for public office, Johnson would be join a small list of actors and pro-wrestlers who have done the same thing, including Arnold Schwarzenegger, who was governor of California; Jesse Ventura, who elected governor of Minnesota; and of course, the former President Ronald Reagan.
