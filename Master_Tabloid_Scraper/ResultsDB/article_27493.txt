Michael Fassbender and Alicia Vikander are notoriously private when it comes to their two-year relationship. However, the couple are finding they can no longer dodge questions about their love life now that their movie, The Light Between Oceans, is coming out.

“It’s not really difficult,” he told Good Morning Britain’s Richard Arnold on Wednesday (Oct. 26, 2016), when asked if he gets annoyed by questions about Vikander during the press tour. “I just answer what I choose to answer and don’t answer other things.”
For Fassbender, who plays his girlfriend’s husband in the romantic drama, he didn’t plan on falling in love with his co-star during the production.
“It just happened,” he said.

“It’s good that it happened,” he added. “It is what it is.”
The couple first met in 2014 while playing spouses in the Derek Cianfrance-helmed movie. They went public with their relationship this January at the Golden Globe Awards.
“I think we’ve made a clear statement that we keep certain things just between us,” Vikander previously told Entertainment Weekly of their courtship. “It was very easy to unite, but that’s quite personal.”
