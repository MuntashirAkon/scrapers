Bill and Jen also face new parenting challenges when it comes to discipline, difficult conversations and managing “potty-talk” with their kids.
“They’ve both become more independent,” says Jen in an exclusive sneak peek at the premiere, adding with a smile: “It’s definitely hard being a parent, but that’s expected.”
The ninth season of The Little Couple premieres Sept. 19 at 9 p.m. ET on TLC.
