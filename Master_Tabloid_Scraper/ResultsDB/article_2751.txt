Rizer and husband, Alexander Mehran, welcomed their fourth child, Edward Thomas Masud Mehran, on June 8.
The Staten Island native, 39, posted an endearing photo announcing the birth of her third son, which shows the new mom affectionately holding her new baby.
“Last night we proudly welcomed our son, Edward Thomas Masud Mehran to the world. He is as sweet and soulful as his siblings, who are already over the moon about him,” wrote Rizer. “Edward is named after his very loved and very missed Grandfathers Edward McGowan, Thomas Watson and Masud Mehran. We are incredibly blessed to be his parents and have him in our lives and hearts.”

FROM PEN: What Do I Need to Know About Becoming a Pet Parent?

Rizer and her husband tragically lost their golden retriever, 2-year-old Beatrice, on their flight from New York City to San Francisco, in 2012. The model had booked two reservations on the United Airline’s PetSafe program for her two golden retrievers — Albert, who was seven at the time and Beatrice — otherwise known as Bea. By the time they arrived in California, Bea had died. A necropsy revealed that the dog had died of heatstroke.
“I don’t think dogs should be treated like bags,” Rizer said at the time. “They’re living, breathing creatures and parts of people’s families.”
