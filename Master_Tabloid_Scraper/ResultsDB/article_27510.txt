At first, it seemed like the Kindergarten Cop actor might have gotten lucky by being wrong, as the elephant starts to walk away from the car. But it would turn out the actor-turned-politician's prediction was correct. The driver of their vehicle was forced to put to the pedal to the metal because the elephant starts to chase them down. Fortunately, no one was hurt and they were able to get away.Despite leaving everyone shaken, the elephant still received praise from Schwarzenegger."I couldn't have written this safari encounter better if it was a movie," Schwarzenegger wrote in the caption of his video. "I'm absolutely in awe of these beautiful, strong animals, even though some of us had to change our pants after this."He also shared a strong message in favor of conservation. "We need to stop killing themâ€”take a photo, not a shot," he added.
