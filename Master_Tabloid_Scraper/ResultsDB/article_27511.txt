Rest assured, Arnold Schwarzenegger will be first in line for...Hmm.The movie star and former governor of California poked a little fun at himself today while in Columbus, Ohio, pretending (we assume) to take a snooze next to the big bronze statue of his bodybuilder self that lives outside the Greater Columbus Convention Center."How times have changed," Schwarzenegger captioned a photo on Instagram in which the scruff-sporting star bundled up in a sleeping bag in front of the statue, which was installed permanently in the capital city, sight of the annual Arnold Fitness Festival, in 2014.
