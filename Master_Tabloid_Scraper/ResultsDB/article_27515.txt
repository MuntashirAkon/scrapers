Tom Arnold, Wife Still Irreconcilable/n
The third time was definitelyÂ not the charm for Tom Arnold. Even with a do-over.The comedian filed for divorce on Monday from Shelby Roos, his wife of nearly five years, blaming the go-to marriage scuttler, irreconcilable differences.This marks the third trip to divorce court for Arnold, and it comes four months after he attempted to patch things up with Roos following their legal separation last summer.In the new documents filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, Arnold failed to cite a specific date for their separation, saying it was still "to be determined."The 48-year-old Best Damn Sports Show alum first filed for separation from the 35-year-old political consultant last August. At the time, Arnold made no mention of divorce and simply sought to divide the couple's assets. His publicist, Staci Wolfe, even said there was a possibility that the couple may still attempt to make it work.Indeed, in January, Arnold filed a request for dismissal of his previous petition for a legal separation. Though it seems the reconciliation didn't take.The TV personality met the pretty politico at the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles in 2000; two years later, they tied the knot in a small ceremony at the Four Seasons in Beverly Hills. They have no children together.Arnold was famously married to Roseanne Barr for four years, from 1990 to 1994, before the couple spectacularly flamed out in a very public, very costly and very acrimonious split.A year later, Arnold rebounded with makeup artist-actress Julie Champnella, a union that lasted four years, from 1995 to 1999.To help keep his mind off the latest marital mess, Arnold has a handful of projects in the works, including the star-studded dramedy Rockett, in which he appears alongside Jimmy Fallon, Sharon Stone, Lucy Liu and Tony Hale. The flick, in which Arnold plays Fallon's estranged father, is due out in November.
