Sonny Landham Dead: 'Predator' and '48 Hours' Actor Was 76./nSonny Landham -- who played Billy the self-knifing military badass in  "Predator " -- has passed away in a Kentucky hospital at the age of 76 from congestive heart failure.  Landham was part of Arnold Schwarzenegger's band of special forces soldiers in the 1987 flick -- and starred in the famous scene where he tried to go one-on-one with the alien armed only with a knife.  He lost ... but he went down in a frickin' blaze of glory.   Landham also appeared in  "48 Hours " -- in which he also played a guy named Billy.  Before going mainstream, Landham starred in a bunch of low-grade porn flicks -- including  "Slippery When Wet " -- but regretted it and said he needed the money at the time. He later got into politics -- running for several offices in Kentucky, but never got elected.  RIP. /n
