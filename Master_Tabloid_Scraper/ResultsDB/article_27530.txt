Arnold posted a video in which he calls out the prez for low performance ratings ... in the 30s. After Arnold gets his licks in, he gives Trump some advice about protecting after-school programs ... even offering a guided tour of a school a few miles from the White House. If only Nicki Minaj's comeback against Remy Ma was this good./n
