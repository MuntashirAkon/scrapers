We're guessing Sugar is not as interested -- if yesterday's Poodle attack was any indication. Uncle P says he'd only be interested if H.B.B. is allowed to make guest appearances ... he doesn't want the girl punished because of her mom's misdeeds.Poodle says he and his fiance already have a pitch for producers -- they'll move to New York City in kind of a reverse  "Green Acres. "This time around we know who could play Arnold Ziffel.11:25 A.M.
