Maggie Grace is officially taken!
The Taken actress, 33, married her boyfriend Brent Bushnell in Ojai, California, on Sunday, PEOPLE has confirmed.
It was an intimate, outdoor ceremony with close family and friends, a source tells PEOPLE.
For the wedding, Grace opted to keep her look classic and elegant. “Her choice of wedding earring was inspired by her Edwardian lace veil,” jeweler Neil Lane tells PEOPLE. “They are vintage with delicate swirls of circular diamonds set in platinum. Her pearl-and-diamond hair combs are also of the Edwardian era.”
