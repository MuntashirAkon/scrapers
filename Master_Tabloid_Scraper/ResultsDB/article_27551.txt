Sarah Jessica Parker Declares She's Not A Feminst — Wait, What?/n

Hmm, we wonder what Carrie Bradshaw would have to say about this!
In an interview with Marie Claire, Sarah Jessica Parker opened up on her feelings on feminism, a hot-button topic for a lot of people given the rampant misogyny floating around these days (we're looking at you, Donald Trump!).

While Sarah played an independent and "woke" woman on Sex and The City, she gave a very confused answer about feminism when asked whether or not she's a feminist.
Similarly to Evangeline Lilly, S.J.P. feels like the term "feminist" doesn't apply to her: 
"I am not a feminist. I don't think I qualify. I believe in women and I believe in equality, but I think there is so much that needs to be done that I don't even want to separate it anymore."
Well… if you believe in women AND equality, it seems like you'd be a feminist, no? Maybe the actress is just confused on the word's meaning — it has been misconstrued many times before.
What's especially interesting about the beauty's perspective is her feelings on the gender pay gap, an issue she definitely wants rectified.
Speaking on the feminist movement, Ms. Parker explained:
"I would like all of that nonsense to end. I would like women to get paid for the value of their contributions, not by old-fashioned ideas about gender. Listen, Jennifer Lawrence deserves every bit as much as her male counterpart. It's indisputable. Emma Watson is an amazing young woman, and it's important for her to talk about women's issues. She isn't concerned about herself. Women are paying the bills, getting it done, getting the kids here and there. The more we address that, we are all going to be better."
We could say a lot about the contradictory nature of the momma's statements, but we'll let Kim Catrall speak for us instead:

So, how do YOU feel about this interview?
