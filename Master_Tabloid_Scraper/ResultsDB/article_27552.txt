Evangeline Lilly Reportedly Pulled A Carey Mulligan & Quietly Gave Birth Without The World Knowingâ€¦Until NOW!/n

Congratulations!
On Thursday, it was reported that Evangeline Lilly has welcomed her second child with her longtime love Norman Kali.
The starlet was recently spotted in Hawaii rocking a floral purple bikini on what appears to be her post baby body! Way to pull a Carey Mulligan and not tell anyone about the birth LOLz!
The Lost actress has yet to confirm the latest addition to her family but we feel it should only be a matter of time. In fact, it was just last June that the Ant-Man star even confirmed she was expecting while walking the red carpet for the Marvel movie.

We can only imagine she's a total pro at the whole mom thing by now, since she welcomed her first child Kahekili back in 2011. Not to mention, it seems being pregnant this time around was a BREEZE for the brunette beauty.
Previously, she gushed:
"This is my second time around, and I find I've been pretty lucky. It's pretty straightforward, and I just love it. I feel good, I feel blissful."
Aww!
We couldn't be happier for Miz Lilly and her man on their baby news. Stay tuned for more details as we await confirmation about the little one's birth.
