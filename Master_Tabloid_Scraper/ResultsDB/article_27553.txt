Attention, Marvel fans — this is not a drill!

The biggest part of the announcement is the upcoming Ant-Man sequel, slated for a July 6, 2018 release with Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly set to reprise their roles!
Even BETTER, the flick will be titled  Ant-Man and the Wasp, with Lilly's character Hope Van Dyne set to FINALLY suit up as the founding Avenger!

The superhero sequel, which wasn't included in Marvel's original Phase Three announcement, will shift the release dates for some other highly anticipated films — Black Panther is moving to February 16, 2018 and Captain Marvel will be pushed back to March 8, 2019!
Black Panther was originally slated for a November 2017 release, but was recently pushed back to July of 2018 when the studio finally scored a deal with Sony to bring Spider-Man to the Marvel Cinematic Universe!

But that's not all! We're also getting THREE MORE untitled Marvel movies, set to premiere on May 1, 2020, July 10, 2020, and November 6, 2020!
This marvelous bundle of previously unplanned films comes on the heels on a structural shift of Marvel Studios head Kevin Feige now reporting directly to Disney Studios' chairman Alan Horn!
And if we know anything about Disney, it's their love of sequels, spinoffs, and remakes!
We can't wait to be struck with the tidal wave of superhero movies that is Marvel's Phase Three in the next few years!
