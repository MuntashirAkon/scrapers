Lilly, who plays the the lead female, Hope Van Dyne, in Marvel's latest superhero flick, already has a 4-year-old son, Kahekili Kali, with her longtime partner Norman Kali — who was actually a PA on the set of Lost!
No word yet on the sex of the next kid, but in a previous interview, Lilly did talk a bit about her family and how many kids she would ultimately like when she said: 

"What I wanted originally was six kids. I frickin' love being pregnant. I'm one of the lucky women who just had a blissful pregnancy, but I wanted to adopt four. My partner and I have really been through the wringer in the adoption world and it's hard, so we'll see what happens."
We couldn't be happier for Evangeline and Norman! With how AH-Mazing she always looks, we have no doubt baby number two will be adorable!
