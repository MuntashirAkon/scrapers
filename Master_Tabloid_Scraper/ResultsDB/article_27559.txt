Next, everyone’s thoughts turned to Jennifer Aniston. Because even though she probably doesn’t care, you can’t help but think she may be just a little tickled by the news.

I still remember the first time I watched Mr. and Mrs. Smith and then found out they were a couple in real life

Does #Brangelina splitting mean we never get Mr. and Mrs. Smith 2, or that we do and it'll be way better? pic.twitter.com/lrRw2MvZpq

Can we all watch Mr and Mrs Smith tonight, together at the same time, for the culture?
— Chuck Bass (@TweetsOfIsaac) September 20, 2016



We'll always have Mr. And Mrs. Smith. #Brangelina

And just so you don’t feel weird about caring so much about other people’s lives, don’t worry, fellow celebs are equally as distraught.


Brad and Angelina. How am I supposed to go to work today ?
