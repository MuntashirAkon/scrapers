Cheers to the expecting parents!

Kelsey Grammer and his wife of five years, Kayte Walsh, are reportedly expecting their third child — a boy — together!
E! News reports:
A source tells E! News the actor’s wife, Kayte Walsh, is pregnant with a baby boy. Speculation that Walsh was expecting the couple’s third child sparked when she was spotted rocking quite a large baby bump while flying out of LAX Tuesday morning (Sept. 13, 2016).
Though it’s unclear just when the mama-to-be is due, the insider tells us she’s at least six months along.
For Grammer, 61, this marks Baby No. 3 with his Walsh 35, and child No. 7 in total. Grammer and Walsh, who tied the knot in 2011, are parents to 4-year-old daughter Faith Evangeline Elisa and 2-year-old son Kelsey Gabriel Elias.
