Just in case you were too busy enjoying your summer (by catching waves with your own surfboard), we’d like to remind you that the 2015 Teen Choice Awards happened last night.


Teen Choice Awards 2015: Red Carpet Arrivals

Nina Dobrev, Fifth Harmony, Chloe Grace Moretz, Skylar Astin, and the folks from Empire were just some of the big winners of the night.
Furious 7 and the late Paul Walker were also honored with the surfboard for Choice Movie: Action/Adventure and Choice Movie Actor: Action/Adventure, respectively.
Vin Diesel, who spoke onstage with his Furious 7 family Jordana Brewster, Ludacris and Michelle Rodriguez, gave a special shout out to Walker’s daughter during his acceptance speech.
“I can’t stand here and be rewarded like this without talking about somebody very, very, very important to us… one of the best blessings in our lives is the fact that we had the opportunity to call Pablo our brother. Paul Walker is here in spirit with us.
And since this is a Teen Choice Award, you beautiful teens, there is one teen in the audience that is a part of the family and kept us going. It’s Paul Walker’s family, his brothers, his parents, that kept us encouraged when were filming Furious 7. But there’s one very, very, very special teen here. And her name is Meadow Walker.”
