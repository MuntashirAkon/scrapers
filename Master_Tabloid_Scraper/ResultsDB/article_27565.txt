The 28th annual Kids’ Choice Awards, hosted by the crazy hot Nick Jonas, was an A-list, slimetastic affair this year.

 
From appearances by Angelina Jolie (and her adorable kids Zahara and Shiloh), Iggy Azalea, 5 Seconds of Summer, the Beckham boys and Fifth Harmony, the KCA’s brought the laughs, the green slime, and the nostalgia for our childhood and the days spent watching Spongebob Squarepants (which is still a fan favorite all these years later!).
