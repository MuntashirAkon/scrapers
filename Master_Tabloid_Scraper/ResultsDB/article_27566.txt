‘Ant-Man’ Trailer: Paul Rudd Has a Six Pack/n
After toying with our emotions and eyeballs with a teeny tiny “ant-sized” teaser, Marvel has finally unleashed the first official trailer for Ant-Man.
The nearly two-minute clip, which premiered during last night’s Agent Carter (itself a premiere), finds Paul Rudd as our would-be hero: lost, confused and shirtless.

Michael Douglas, Evangeline Lily, Corey Stoll, Michael Pena, Bobby Cannavale and T.I. also star in the Marvel/Disney film.
Warning: if you only have time for Paul Rudd’s abs, just skip ahead to the 1:28 mark and watch the trailer on your coffee break.
Ant-Man, directed by Peyton Reed, opens July 17.
