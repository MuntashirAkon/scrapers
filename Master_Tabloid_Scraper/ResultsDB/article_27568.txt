Evangeline Lilly Dresses Up Baby Bump in Yellow Dress – and Spills the Beans on Paul Rudd's Ant-Man Abs!/n
Yes, Paul Rudd‘s rock-solid six-pack in his latest movie is 100 percent real. And his costar Evangeline Lilly can confirm it!  
The 35-year-old actress made a very pregnant appearance Monday night on Conan to talk about the comic-book adventure movie Ant-Man, and she assured the late-night host that Rudd’s shirtless moment on-screen was as real as it gets.  
“I have to ask you a question, because I’ve known Paul Rudd a long time, and there’s one scene in the movie where he doesn’t have his shirt on,” Conan O’Brien, 52, said in the clip.  
“Yes, he’s straight,” quipped the Lost alum.  
“Are those real abs? Or are those CGI-injected abs?” O’Brien wondered as the audience roared at a torso-baring screenshot of the actor from the Marvel movie, out July 17.

Lilly went on to poll the audience about whether they believed Rudd’s physique to be au naturel, receiving a very divided response.  
“They’re real,” Lilly then confirmed. “[Paul] jokingly tells people he didn’t eat for a year for five seconds on camera, but they’re real.”  
Looking radiant in a yellow maxi dress, the expectant mom, who is seven months along, also updated the comedian about baby number two, assuring that he or she will be full of surprises.  
“It’s a surprise. We don’t know this time; we didn’t know last time,” Lilly said of her baby’s sex.  
This is the second child for the very private actress and her longtime partner Norman Kali, who are parents to 4-year-old Kahekili. She debuted her baby belly in a black-and-white one-shoulder gown on the red carpet at the Los Angeles premiere of Ant-Man on Monday.
