One Last Thing Evangeline Lilly/n
Last time I was recognized
It’s been better since Lost finished. I still always get “Kate!” and “Freckles!” I used to go, “Oh, no, I just look like her,” but I’ve sort of given up on that. It’s too much work.
Last thing I took from a set
On Ant-Man, I took a rubber stamp from the office of Hank Pym, who’s played by Michael Douglas. I’m a bit of a pickpocket on-set. If something is small enough to go in my pocket and it will be neat memorabilia, it’s gone.
Last time I danced
Oh, about a month ago at my cousin’s wedding, I danced up a storm until they were kicking us out of the building. I love to dance. Don’t get me started, because you will never get me to stop.
Last time my son Kahekili made me laugh
He’s 3 and he loves to talk. We were at a polo match, and he saddled up to this older boy and said, “Hey, I like your boots. Where’d you get those? From a horse? ” His conversation starters can be a bit awkward.
Last moment of bliss
I opted out of the afterparty for The Hobbit premiere, and my partner [Norman Kali] and I went back and ordered room service. Everyone was at this crazy party, and I was tucked away in my hotel room, quietly cuddling with the man I love, and that was blissful.
