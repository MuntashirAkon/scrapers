What Did The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies Star Evangeline Lilly Steal From a Set?/n
Evangeline Lilly stars as an elf warrior in The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies but the 35-year-old actor still shies away from the spotlight. She admits she’s a pick-pocket on set, loves to hear her 3-year-old son talk, and a few other things when he chatted with PEOPLE this week about “one last thing”…
Last time I was recognizedIt’s been better since Lost finished. I still always get “Kate!” and “Freckles!” I used to go, “Oh, no, I just look like her,” but I’ve sort of given up on that. It’s too much work.  
Last thing I took from a setOn Ant-Man, I took a rubber stamp from the office of Hank Pym, who’s played by Michael Douglas. I’m a bit of a pick-pocket on-set. If something is small enough to go in my pocket and it will be neat memorabilia, it’s gone.  
Last time I dancedOh, about a month ago at my cousin’s wedding, I danced up a storm until they were kicking us out of the building. I love to dance. Don’t get me started, because you will never get me to stop.  
Last time my son Kahekili made me laughHe’s 3 and he loves to talk. We were at a polo match, and he saddled up to this older boy and said, “Hey, I like your boots. Where’d you get those? From a horse?” His conversation starters can be a bit awkward.
