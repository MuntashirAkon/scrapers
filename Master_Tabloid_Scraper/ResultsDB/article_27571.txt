Evangeline Lilly Cuts Her Hair Into Her Ant-Man Character's Bob/n
She looks Marvel-ous! Evangeline Lilly showed off her sweet short cut on Instagram recently, and it’s raising speculation among comic book fans that the star, who is playing Hope Van Dyne in the upcoming Ant-Man film, may be doing double duty as Ant-Man’s fellow superhero The Wasp.

“How’s my new do?” Lilly asked on Instagram, showing off the side view of her new, chin-length crop. It’s not much different than her previous haircut — she already had thick bangs and a long bob — but it’s shorter and more shaped than her previous laid-back cut. It’s got a vibe that’s a mix of a 1920s flapper and a 1960s swinging Londoner.
The Wasp, seen in a Marvel illustration by John Buscema from the 1960s, has a similarly mod vibe and cute cut, feeding speculation that she may wearing spandex alongside Paul Rudd’s masked crusader, Ant-Man. But the only thing Lilly’s leaked so far is that she loves working with Paul Rudd. And really, who wouldn’t?
