Kenan Thompson Welcomes Daughter Georgia Marie/n
Kenan Thompson has many more late nights ahead of him – he’s officially a daddy!  
The Saturday Night Live star, 36, welcomed daughter Georgia Marie Thompson with wife Christina Evangeline on Friday morning in New York City, reports TMZ. Their little one weighed in at 6 lbs.  
It’s the first child for the couple, who married in November 2011.
Evangeline took to Instagram to show off their new addition. “We’re just really sleepy,” she captioned an aww-out-loud selfie.  
“I’m about to be a daddy. Papa Kenan! I am terrified,” Thompson joked during a March visit to the Late Night with Seth Meyers studio. “I don’t know what to do with babies. I plan to be at the casino when she’s giving birth, like old schoolin’ it.”
