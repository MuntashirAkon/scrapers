Evangeline Lilly Calls Angelina Jolie Her Ideal 'Ice Queen'/n
Lost star Evangeline Lilly doesn’t want mega-stardom, but if she had to become a Hollywood A-lister, she’d want to do it like – who else? – Angelina Jolie, she says.  
“No one knows that woman; she’s a complete ice queen, which is perfect,” the intensely private Lilly tells Women’s Health in the June issue. “Why should she be any more? She doesn’t owe us anything.”  
Lilly, who says she’s frequently berated by a colleague on ABC’s island drama for forgoing chances at becoming Hollywood’s next big thing, says if she had to have Jolie’s life, she’d choose only one half of it: the charity work.  
“Sure, I’d love to be her, but just the [humanitarian] side,” Lilly says.
Even now, she’s not entirely happy with the attention she sometimes gets, saying that she get angry when people take her photograph, and that she doesn’t understand why people keep asking her if she and former costar Dominic Monaghan are dating.  
“If I were to tell you that Sandra Miggum and Henry Pickett are dating, would you ever care? They’re completely fictional, so you don’t know them,” she says. “Well, people don’t know us. So why should they care?”  
But Lilly says she’s confident she’ll eventually find a path away from the cameras – and that she knows how to deal with it in the meantime.  
“Right now, I’m happy doing a job that’s not my ultimate dream,” she says. “Even if you’re unhappy, just pretend that you’re happy. Eventually, your smile will be contagious to yourself. I had to learn that – I used to think, ‘I’m being fake,’ but you know what?  Better to be fake and happy than real and miserable.”
