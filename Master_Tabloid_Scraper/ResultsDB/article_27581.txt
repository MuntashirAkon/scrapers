Angeline Jolie's pop is at it again, blabbing to Fox & Friends about his daughter and her growing brood."You know, she wasn't the kind that played with dolls, and then all of the sudden she has all of these children," Jon Voight said Thursday on the Fox News Channel."She loves kids though," he added. "She's very playful. It's wonderful."It's not like Voight's giving away any big secrets. He confirms the twins, Knox and Vivienne, are "healthy" and "doing well" and says Brad and Angie "are really happy and over the moon."But given that he and his daughter have feuded over his loose-lipped ways before, do you think this is one grandfather who should just stop bragging?
