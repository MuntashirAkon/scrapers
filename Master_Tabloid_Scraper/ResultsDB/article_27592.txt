'Creep!' 'Pervert!' 'A**!' Insults Fly Like Never Before At The 'RHOBH' Reunion/n
The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills Season 7 reunion just might be the nastiest yet! A new preview clip proves that the women are not holding back, as they slam each other for being “sick,” “big mouth” and worse!
The finale left off with Lisa Vanderpump‘s diamonds and rosé themed party taking a turn for the worse, and a new preview of the reunion proves the ladies aren’t ready to mend fences.
“That’s a flat out lie Lisa!” Dorit Kemsley slammed in a sneak peek clip, possibly referencing the allegations that she was using cocaine.

“No it’s not Dorit,” Lisa Rinna smirked.
Kemsley followed up with an insult about her “big mouth,” and Rinna told her to “shut up” in return.
Then, Erika Girardi confessed she thought her costars enjoyed humiliating her, and Kyle Richards began a fight with Vanderpump. When Eden Sassoon appeared on the couch, Kyle attacked her as well.

“I’ve learned a lot from this season,” Kemsley’s husband Paul quipped when he took his turn on the couch.
“That you’re an a**!” Erika Girardi spat back.
Paul also attempted to defend himself from being called a “pervert” and “creep” as the incredulous ladies looked on.
