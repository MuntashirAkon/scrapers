Brandi Glanville Calls Lisa Rinna Out For Her Eating Disorder & Bad Wig In Failed Twitter Feud Attempt!/n

When Brandi Glanville comes for you, she means business!
On Wednesday, Brandi took to Twitter to express her frustrations over the most recent episode of Real Housewives of Beverly Hills… because she apparently still feels the need to comment despite not being on the show for two seasons now.
In the Drinking and Tweeting author's attempt at a Twitter feud, she calls out Lisa Rinna specifically — even going as far as critiquing her alleged "eating disorder" and "bad wig"!

But to be fair, the outspoken gal did slam Harry Hamlin's wife for having the "same hairdo for twenty years" at her final RHOBH reunion.
As for what spurred the mother-of-two's vehement venom?? Well, it probably had to do with the fact that Lisa brought up Brandi's past comments about her hair during Tuesday night's RHOBH, basically insinuating she's a bully!
Well, Brandi did NOT take too kindly to the jabs… ch-ch-check out her angry social media response (below)!!! 

@lisarinna I do not think of u or refer to u & trust me when I leave this world I will be known for more than an eating disorder & a BAD wig

The one-time Real Housewife really went there! Although, we can't say we're too surprised given her history of controversy.
As for Lisa, she decided to ignore the latest drama entirely — We guess she's too blessed to be stressed at the moment!
Do YOU think Brandi's comments were out of line??
