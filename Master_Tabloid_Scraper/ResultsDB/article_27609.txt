Real Housewives Of ISIS Spoof Causes Controversy, Obviously/n

And we thought New Jersey was a dangerous place…
A BBC comedy show is under fire after joking about the Islamic State in a sketch called The Real Housewives of ISIS.
The spoof, which was posted online Tuesday to promote the show Revolting, features four British women in hijabs who discuss their unglamorous lives as Jihadi brides.

Like the various RH parodies online these days, the four women try to emulate the Bravo divas themselves while living in an unsafe environment of decay — making light of the real women who allegedly offer themselves as sex wives to men fighting for ISIS.
In fact, one of the scenes even shows a character showing off her new outfit — a suicide vest — while her friends gossip about how it makes her look "massive"!
To no one's surprise, the sketch sparked some serious backlash on social media, with many saying it was "distasteful" when there are reports of British girls under the age of 18 who have been groomed and lured to the Islamic State.

However, not every Twitic took offense to the sketch — several viewers pointed out the idea of satire is to use humor to criticize topical issues, even controversial ones like this.
The show's writers Heydon Prowse and Jolyon Rubinstein even defended the sketch, telling the i newspaper they were using comedy to tackle extremism, with the former explaining:

"It's important not to pull your punches in satire. You have to be fearless or it undermines your credibility. You can't go after [former U.K. Prime Minister] David Cameron for five years like we did and not go after Islamic State."
Very fair.
Do YOU think this piece of satire crossed the line??
