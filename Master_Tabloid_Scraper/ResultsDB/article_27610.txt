Real Housewives Newbie Dorit Kemsley Makes ANOTHER Enemy As Eden Sassoon Officially Moves Into Beverly Hills! Get The Recap!/n

We're conflicted: One of them is wrong… but the other one is boring.
As is the case with every season of Real Housewives, the first few episodes are all about introducing us to the new players — and Season Seven of Beverly Hills is no different.
Unfortunately for Dorit Kemsley, however, it usually takes new additions more than just five episodes to make one mortal enemy… let alone TWO!!!

We've already seen Boy George's BFF feud with Erika Girardi over her (lack of) underwear etiquette, but Dorit and husband PK continued to cause drama with both Eileen Davidson and Lisa Rinna during Tuesday night's all-new episode!
Basically, the couple — who lives in Jennifer Lopez's old house, just so you know — invited the RHOBH cast over for their first party… only to insult the way Lisa R. is handling her father's death.
Luckily for the soap opera actress, Eileen has been itching to get out of her Lisa Vanderpump storyline, so she promptly called Dorit out for it over a casual picnic lunch in Malibu the very next day — and Dorit straight up denied even remembering the conversation!

What a beautiful trainwreck of a casting decision.
Elsewhere, Eden Sassoon finally made her "Friend Of" debut… but we were mostly just focused on the fact that Queen Camille Grammer got a talking head — so this episode was definitely a win!
Ch-ch-check out Eileen and Dorit's RHOBH row (below)!!!
