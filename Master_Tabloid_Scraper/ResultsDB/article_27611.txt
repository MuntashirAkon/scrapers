Erika Girardi & Dorit Kemsley Keep The #Pantygate Drama Going With One Awkward RHOBH Lunch! Watch!/n

She's over all the underwear talk!
Erika Girardi may have come out the gates swinging this season on Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, but her drama with the other ladies is already getting intimate.
That's because after last week's RHOBH where Erika decided to go commando in front of Dorit Kemsley and her husband PK, the Bravo newbie actually had the audacity to bring up #Pantygate again during Tuesday night's all-new episode!

In case you missed it, Dorit from Connecticut not only kept the private parts talk public at lunch with Lisa Vanderpump, Kyle Richards, Eileen Davidson, and Lisa Rinna… but she even bought Erika a pair of underwear so she'd never be without!
Yeah, that definitely got Erika's panties in a bunch.
But if they're already taking low blows and they're not even enemies yet… over/under on time until they officially start feuding??
Ch-ch-check out the highlight of Tuesday night's RHOBH (below)!!!
