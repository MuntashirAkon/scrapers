Vanderpump Rules' Kristen Doute Has A Heartwarming Reunion With Her Missing Dog — Watch!/n

What a relief!
Earlier this week, Vanderpump Rules star Kristen Doute was in quite a panic when her dog Bowie went missing from a sitter's West Hollywood pad. Thankfully, the precious pup has since been found — but not before Miz Doute enlisted the help of her many Twitter followers!

Initially, Kristen took to the social media site and wrote:

In fact, the Bravolebrity's castmates — including Tom Schwartz, Scheana Shay, and Pandora Vanderpump – also spread the word to their fans about Bowie's MIA status. It was a happy ending for Kristen and Bowie though, as on Thursday, the TV personality and her beloved dog were reunited after 20 hours.

AH-Mazing. And little Bowie is clearly happy to be home as Kristen shared a sweet pic of her pup snuggled up under a blanket (below).
