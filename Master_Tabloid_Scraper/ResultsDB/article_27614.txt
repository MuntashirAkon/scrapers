Spotlight Deal: 20% on SkinActive Moisture Rescue Refreshing Gel-Cream





CREDIT: Amazon


“Oh I love thee!!! I have a very serious combination skin, african-american. Highly acne prone and hyper-pigmented. With all I’ve tried, Its either the lotion is too drying or when it actually moisturizes well, I break out! I have actually tried garnier’s dark spot remover with vit-C but it didn’t work. This is just right. A cool lovely burst of moisture. My face feels hydrated from the very first night I used it and now I’ve started going lower to my neck and chest. This is priceless for me. Thank you Garnier!!!” — Dee

Spotlight Deal: 20% off Dove Body Wash, Sensitive Skin





CREDIT: Amazon


“Smells GREAT!! You do not need much to get an abundance of suds. Leaves skin feeling great and when drying off there is none of that soap reside like so many others leave. This Dove for Sensitive Skin is very simular to the Deep Moisture, this one is a little better for anyone who has issues with really sensitive skin. I like it just as much as the deep moisture.” — Karen
