“It looks good, light in weight, very powerful, makes my hair shine. These new tourmaline ceramic dryers are not always what they advertise to be, but this dryer is everything it says it is and more. It cost a little more, but it is worth every penny.” — Eileen Case

“THIS IS LITERALLY THE BEST BABY PRODUCT WE HAVE EVER BOUGHT! I was a little skeptical when it came to spending so much money on ONE baby item, and it took months of pleading with my husband to purchase such a high end stroller… but WOW! It is worth EVERY penny!” — dwilliams89

Spotlight Deal: Buy 2 Fire Tablets, save 10% with code FIRE2PACK. Add 2 Amazon Fire Cases and receive 15% off your order with code CASE2PACK





CREDIT: Amazon


“Almost a week of getting to know the new Fire, and I’m really enjoying it. There’s certainly a learning curve for someone like me coming from an exclusively Apple device history. However, with my iPad aging, and new ones not getting any cheaper, I started looking at alternatives. This Fire came along at just the right time and at better than the right price. I considered getting the HD6 for $99, and for under $50, I immediately preordered the Fire as soon as it was announced.” — Jake-OutsideTheEnvironment

Spotlight Deal: 46% off Wahl Elite Pro High Performance Haircut Kit





CREDIT: Amazon


“I’m a barber and I totally recommend the Wahl Pro kit if you buzz your hair or cut your kid/husband’s hair. I bought this set a few days ago strictly for the clipper guards. They’re the new “Elite” line of guards that have a metal clip on them and sturdier teeth. They’re miles better than the guards you’ll get in any other set. They also have a smoother ground tip on the teeth, so less poking. The set of guards alone would run you $35.” — Lucas P.

Spotlight Deal: 20% off Dove Body Wash, Sensitive Skin





CREDIT: Amazon


“Smells GREAT!! You do not need much to get an abundance of suds. Leaves skin feeling great and when drying off there is none of that soap reside like so many others leave. This Dove for Sensitive Skin is very simular to the Deep Moisture, this one is a little better for anyone who has issues with really sensitive skin. I like it just as much as the deep moisture.” — Karen

Spotlight Deal: 15% off select Waterpik flossers





CREDIT: Amazon


“I suffer from periodontal disease and going to the dentist was always a hassle and painful for me. I brush twice a day and floss at least once a day and I was still getting disappointing results at the dentist. I bought this product thinking it couldn’t hurt and let me tell you it has made a world of difference in my dental hygiene. I used it after flossing and brushing and couldn’t believe the remnants of food that this dislodged and washed away. Now I see that brushing and flossing isn’t enough to do the job proficiently. I recently bought another one for my wife because she kept hogging mine’s. Great buy for everyone.” — AL

Spotlight Deal: 34% off Purell 1450-D1 Everywhere System Starter Kit





CREDIT: Amazon


“I really like the size of this dispenser. I wanted one of these in my office but not the large size you see mounted in doctors offices. This is the perfect size for what I need. With the bottle of sanitizer installed it is about 8 inches tall by 3 inches wide. It mounts with the 3 included Command Strips, no drilling or screws. I was a little concerned as to how well these would hold at first. Well no worries, the Command Strips hold it perfectly. I like that this dispenser keeps your hand sanitizer off your desk or countertop. No more looking for the hand sanitizer anymore.” — Big Al

“This is very convenient body wash. The bottle is shaped in such a way that it is not very prone to tipping-over and the pump is convenient.” — Kevin A.
