The feds are getting involved now.
Mark Salling’s legal issues have taken a turn for the worst. TMZ reports that he will face federal indictment for charges related to child pornography. “Young victims are harmed every time an image is generated, every time it is distributed and every time it is viewed,” U.S. Attorney Eileen Decker said.
The former Glee star was arrested in December after police found hundreds of images on his computer, with some even involving girls under 10 engaging in sexual activities.

He was later bailed out of jail with the help of his family and has since then kept a very low profile. The allegations against him may even cost him a job if he’s convicted. Adi Shankar, director of Gods and Secrets, revealed he’ll cut the actor for his film if he’s found guilty.
If convicted, Salling reportedly faces a minimum sentence of 5 years and a maximum of 20 years in prison. On the charge of possessing child porn, he could receive 20 years.
