In case you didn’t know, now you know: James Franco is in a band called Daddy and his next big TV role is the lead in a period porn drama called The Deuce, which was just given a series pickup from HBO.

The Hollywood Reporter announced yesterday (Jan. 19) that HBO picked up the David Simon-created drama (of The Wire fame), starring Franco, Emily Meade and Maggie Gyllenhaal.

As described by THR, The Deuce “follows the legalization and subsequent rise of the porn industry in New York’s Times Square from the early 1970s through the mid-1980s. It explores the rough-and-tumble world that existed there until the rise of HIV, the violence of the cocaine epidemic and the renewed real estate market all ended the bawdy turbulence.”
Named for 42nd Street, The Deuce is inspired in part by the careers of twin brothers who were players in the Times Square world and became fronts for Mob control of the volatile and lucrative sex industry from its origins. Franco will play both twins, Vincent and Frankie Martino. Gyllenhaal is set as Eileen Merrell — or “Candy” on the street — a Times Square hooker and veteran with an entrepreneurial bent who is drawn into the fledgling porn industry.
In addition to starring, Franco is acting as an executive producer while Gyllenhaal also will be credited as a producer.

In other Franco-career news, the modern-day Renaissance man’s band Daddy (made up of Franco and his former schoolmate Tim O’Keefe) recently released their new song, “Lime Green Dress.”
Check it out below:





This is what Franco had to say about the song:

We loved the sound of the English New Wave, especially The Smiths. The album was meant to reflect that, but with our own twists. The experiences of youth play so well into this sound. “Lime Green Dress” is about the terror and frisson of losing one’s innocence to the bad boy.

Daddy’s new album Let me Get What I Want, a 10 track LP, is expected for a March 18 release and is currently available for pre-order on Amazon.
