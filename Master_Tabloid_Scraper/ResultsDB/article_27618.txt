A Fun Game We Can All Play to Celebrate Rihanna’s Birthday/n
One fun game to make you feel bad about yourself is the one where you realize that someone like Rihanna, who has like 13 #1 songs, is only 26. If you’re like me, you’re older than 26. Not by much. But by enough that you still have to ask yourself, “What the hell am I doing with my life oh my god oh my god ohmygoddddddd.” Thanks for the birthday feels, Bad Gal. And thank you, dear readers, for today’s winning captions.
