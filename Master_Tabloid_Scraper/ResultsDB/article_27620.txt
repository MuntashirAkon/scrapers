Everybody Loves Everybody: A Courtney Stodden and Doug Hutchison Caption Contest/n
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHRRAAWWEEEYYNNNNYYYAAAAAAA!!!!!!
Nope! Wrong song. Ahem. Let’s try that again. I said, CAN YOU FEEEEELLLLL THE LOOOOOVVVEEE TONIIIIIGHT?
I sure can! I can feel Doug Hutchison’s love for the paparazzi, Courtney Stodden’s love for Doug, my love for everyone who ever lived, because I am lovely and loving like that. Ah, how beautiful it is to love!
I also feel great love for today’s winning captions, which I will now share with you:
“thats how small it is…” – Cindy
“What’s wrinkled and smells like Skank? Doug Hutchinson’s middle finger!” – Ronald
“Doug: ‘I couldn’t find the sunroof button using my index finger, so, hopefully i can find it using my middle finger.’ Courtney: ‘my back hurts.'” – Jonathan
“Yeah, here you go in case your not a mind reader!” – Johnny
“Stop looking at my daughter” - Eileen
“Hey buddy! Paper or plastic?” – Cortney
Congrats to our winners! Visit our Facebook page for a new Caption Contest each and every weekday.
