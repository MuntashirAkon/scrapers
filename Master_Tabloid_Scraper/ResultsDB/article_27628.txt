High drama in Hong Kong for The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. Everything came back to what Dorit Kemsley dubbed "pantygate"¬—you know, that time Erika Girardi showed up to a party without any underwear and Dorit's husband couldn't stop looking.Erika and Dorit squared off on the junk boat and then again at a dinner disaster, second only to the infamous dinner party from hell (never forget Allison DuBois), and somehow Erika unleashed it all at Eileen Davidson. Eileen tried to make a "hyperbolic statement" to help Erika try and listen to Dorit's apology, but Erika wasn't having it.

"Last week, I said that we as a group don't do well on boats. Let's add restaurants to that list. It got heated. It got ugly. I felt like I needed to step in only when I saw Dorit was genuinely trying to apologize. Erika was not in the place to hear that. I didn't feel it was right at that point not to try to help to find a resolution," Eileen wrote. "When will I learn?"

"What I said was a hyperbolic statement intended to mean, ‘It's not as big of a deal as it could be.' This was for some perspective when Erika said nothing Dorit could do would make it right. I never, ever, EVER considered that Erika would take it as me disrespecting her or her son," Eileen wrote. "Nothing could be further from the truth. I felt absolutely awful. After the initial shock, I realized that there were some more things going on to lead Erika to that reaction. She was absolutely right, I don't know how that must feel, but I have tremendous respect for the sacrifices her son makes and the sacrifices of her whole family."The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills airs Tuesdays, 9 p.m. on Bravo.(E! and Bravo are both part of the NBCUniversal family.)
