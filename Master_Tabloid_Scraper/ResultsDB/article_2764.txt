Well, that was fairly fast!It was only back in April that actress Maggie Gyllenhaal dyed her brunette pixie a bright shade of baby blond, but now she's back to her natural hue.The 36-year-old actress showed off her back-to-brunette look over the weekend while out and about in NYC.While many lighten up their tresses in the summer, Maggie is bucking beauty trends and going darker. Which makes sense, because she always marches to the beat of her own drum, style-wise.Since Maggie only kept her blond locks for a very short stint, we're guessing it was for a role—or she just wasn't feeling it and decided to go back to brunette.Either way, she's clearly loving her pixie haircut, which she has had for over a year now. We think the shorter, cropped cut works perfectly with her personality. And while we liked her blond hair, we're even bigger fans of her natural shade.Which look do you prefer: Maggie as a blonde or a brunette?
