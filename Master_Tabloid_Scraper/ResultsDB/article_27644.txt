Hillary Clinton Halloween House Under Attack!/nThe New York woman who's got Hillary Clinton's head on a stake in her front yard says people are threatening to burn her house down. Eileen Fuscaldo of Bellmore, NY tells us she's getting hammered by passersby who are threatening to turn her house into a pile of ashes ... because they're offended by her Hillary-themed haunted house. You gotta see the place -- it's strewn with Halloween decor and Hillary's face plastered all over. Watch -- Eileen's pad has already fallen victim to a paintball drive-by. She vows not to back down. #BenghaziGraveyard/n
