Maggie Gyllenhaal is a study in contrasts: She's Hollywood royalty with a totally private personal life. She's completely feminine despite her love of pixie cuts and menswear. And in this Kate Young for Target gown, she's a city hipster with a touch of southern romance.The puffed sleeve and star-shaped pattern on this asymmetrical stunner have so much charm and whimsy, but the dark color and fitted waist keep it all grounded in the style of this Academy Award nominees' Brooklyn turf.Now please excuse us while we go wait outside our local Target for this look to hit stores.
