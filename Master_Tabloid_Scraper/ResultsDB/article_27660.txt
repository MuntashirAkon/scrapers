Awesome Stylus For iPhone/n
If you’re as obsessed with your iPhone as we are, you’ll love the Pogo Stylus by Ten One ($14.95). Keep your phone free from screen scratches and smudges. The stylus allowed me to do everything I needed to do on my iPhone while being in nearly artic temperatures. Before the creation of this techie tool, I had to take off my gloves or use my nose to answer calls, send texts, or check emails in frigid temps. Don’t laugh – we’ve all been there. The stylus definitely beats a finger on frosty days or if you have Elvira length acrylic nails. It comes in 4 colors (black, gunmetal, silver & cranberry) and includes a clip to help you store your stylish stylus on your phone (pic below).
