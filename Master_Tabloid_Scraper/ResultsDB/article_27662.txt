Heidi Elnora, bridal designer, Project Runway alum and star of the new TLC show Bride by Design: One of my favorite items — that I always carry with me — is the Prada tote that my husband, Jeff, purchased for me when I got picked up for Season 1 of Bride By Design. It’s great because it is created out of a sustainable, linen/canvas fabric, so neither my 4-year-old, 2-year-old, nor I can destroy it. It has handmade, red satin flowers with black stitch detailing, which I just love. It’s a great weekend traveling tote for business or  vacation, and perfect for when I feel I just need to add a pop of color to my everyday outfit.”
