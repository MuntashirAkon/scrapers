Country Star Reba Slams Madonna For Starting Concert 3 Hours Late — On A MONDAY!/n
Madonna is back to her diva ways!
For her first-ever concert in Nashville, Tenn. on Monday, Madge managed to ruffle some feathers in the audience when she arrived nearly three hours late for the performance.
But it wasn’t just fans who were complaining about the “Living For Love” singer, even country star Reba McEntire — who attended the show — slammed Madonna’s bad behavior.
The famed redhead took to Instagram to bash her pop star peer, showing no mercy when it came to her tardiness.

“At the Madonna concert,” she wrote alongside a photo of the venue. “She’s not on yet…really???”

The “Going Out Like That” hit-maker kept followers updated on Madonna’s show faux pas, adding another photo later, captioned: “We’re here! Where is she???”
“She came on at 10:31,” Reba huffed on her final post.
To be fair, Madonna has had a difficult year thus far, thanks to an ongoing custody battle over rebellious son Rocco Ritchie, 15.

As Radar previously reported, trouble in paradise first occurred when the teen refused to return to the U.S. (and his mother) over the holidays, after he had accompanied her for the first half of the Rebel Heart Tour.
Reportedly angry over his disobedience, Madonna sought a court order shortly thereafter, forcing Rocco to come home.
So far, Madge has not been successful in getting her son home, as he remains in London with his father, film director Guy Ritchie.
Is Rocco the reason behind Madonna’s bad etiquette? Will she apologize to her fans? Let us know what you think in the comments below! /n
