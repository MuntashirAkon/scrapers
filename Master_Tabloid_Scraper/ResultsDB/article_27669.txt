Far from being a rebound relationship, Blackstock and Stroud reportedly have plans to build a future together. “They are very serious,” a source said. “It’s unclear when they started dating. The word on the street is that they’re getting married.”
Reps for the new duo did not respond to requests for comments on the budding relationship. As for McEntire, she has reportedly thrown herself into her work, and is staying positive, with an insider reporting, “If she seems upset, I certainly haven’t seen it show.” /n
