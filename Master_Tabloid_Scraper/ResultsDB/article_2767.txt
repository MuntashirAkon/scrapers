The Queen has spoken.Helen Mirren recently shared her thoughts about ageism against women in Hollywood when asked about comments Maggie Gyllenhaal, 37, had made, in which she said she was denied a movie role because Hollywood execs deemed her "too old to play the lover of a man who was 55." And Mirren, an Oscar winner who continues to slay the silver screen and the red carpet at age 69, gave a very Helen Mirren answer."F--king outrageous," she told The Wrap at the website's Power Woman Breakfast in New York City on Tuesday in front of dozens of people. "F--king outrageous! It's ridiculous. Honestly. So annoying. So annoying and 'twas ever thus.""We all sat there watching, you know, James Bond...as James Bond got more and more geriatric and his girlfriends got younger and younger," she said, dancing in her seat and waving her hands. "It's so annoying."

Gyllenhaal, an Oscar nominee, has often played a female lead and love interest of the main character onscreen, such as the 2008 blockbuster The Dark Knight  and the 2011 R-rated British sex comedy Hysteria.She had revealed her ageist role rejection in an interview with The Wrap in May, without naming names of execs or identifying the project."It was astonishing to me," she said. "It made me feel bad, and then it made me feel angry, and then it made me laugh."
