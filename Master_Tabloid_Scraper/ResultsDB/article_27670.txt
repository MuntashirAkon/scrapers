The southern singer, 60, and her long time spouse and manager, 58, revealed the sad news Monday.
“In a joint statement, Narvel Blackstock and Reba McEntire have announced that they have been separated for the past few months, after 26 years of marriage,” she wrote on her website.
“Despite this being the end of their marriage, they continue to support each other. They have worked together for 35 years and will continue to do so.”
