Gretchen Rossi’s co-stars have called her a liar for her tall tale about booking an appearance on Malibu Country and one of the stars of the show weighed in and defended Heather Dubrow’s version of the situation.
The Real Housewives of Orange County ladies have been battling over Gretchen’s claims that she was asked to film a part on Reba McEntire’s sitcom, and there have been tears and name calling about the story.
Vicky Gunvalson called Gretchen a “liar face” after she said she was going to be on Malibu Country and used that as an excuse to get Alexis Bellino uninvited to Tamra Barney’s dress shopping trip and Heather went on Good Day LA to say that Gretchen was not offered the role, but she herself was and she appeared on an episode.

Sara Rue stars on the sitcom as Reba’s ditsy neighbor and she Tweeted about the situation, backing up Heather’s story.
“So my 2 cents is this: @HeatherDubrow had it all correct as far as I know… But small fun fact, I did base my character mostly on Gretchen,” Sara wrote, clearly trying to be funny but slamming Gretchen in the process!.
Ouch!
Malibu Country was a topic again on the reunion show and Sara appears to have deleted her initial Tweet but sent a friendlier one to Andy Cohen, writing: “BravoAndy is there anyway you will do this much free press for the next show I’m on… Ya know, before its cancelled? #malibucountry #RHOC?”
