Kim Kardashian Moves Quickly To SLAM Cocaine Rumors — But The Internet Isn't Buying Her Explanation!/n

Kim Kardashian West sees all!
You might not think an A-lister like the KUWTK starlet would actually see some some gossip you sent out on Twitter, but if Kanye West's wife thinks you're damaging her name, she'll come for you. Just ask this internet user who accused Keeks of using cocaine!

Unsurprisingly, this allegation made Kris Jenner's daughter VVV upset as she quickly clapped back: 

I do not play with rumors like this so I'm gonna shut it down real quick. That's sugar from our candy mess from dylan's candy shop https://t.co/oICdPQVi8d

Snap! Snap! Although, it appears as though the internet isn't necessarily buying Kimmie's "candy" explanation. Be sure to ch-ch-check out the best reactions to the clap back (below)!

We're sure Kim's team is working tirelessly to shut this down before it becomes a scandal. We mean, we think the KarJenners have had enough controversies for one month, right??
