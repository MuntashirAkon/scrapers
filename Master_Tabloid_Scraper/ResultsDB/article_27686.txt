Pepsi's New Flavor Is More Tasteless Than Their Kendall Jenner Ad — See What Twitter Is Saying/n

We don't think Kendall Jenner can help Pepsi put out this fire.
It seems the soda company was trying to distract you from their terrible PR by infusing their cola with cinnamon — but the early reviews are in, and it seems Pepsi is striking out again!
According to the brand, Pepsi Fire will be stocked in stores for eight weeks beginning May 22 and is supposed to be "an unexpected and spicy twist to our classic cola taste." It will be sold in cans, 20-ounce bottles, and as a Slurpee flavor at 7-Eleven. Oh boy.

People who have gotten their hands on the beverage have already called the drink "disgusting" and "unequivocal bad," and seem to be getting unwelcome flashbacks to having too many Fireball Cinnamon Whisky shots in college!
Ch-ch-check out some of the displeased responses (below)!

I just tried @Pepsi Fire. I had a sip. It’s like someone was like "Let’s mix Pepsi & Fireball, but take out the fun of Fireball." #ifeelsick

Why does Japan get refreshing, delicious flavors like @pepsi Sakura but we get this cinnamon Pepsi Fire trash?

Well, that's not very promising… Pepsi just can't win these days!
