Dolly Parton’s telethon, Smoky Mountains Rise, has raised over $9 million for Tennessee wildfire victims.
After fires in Tennessee killed 14 people and destroyed more than 2,400 the homes, the singer decided she wanted to help out. Parton organized a benefit telethon in Nashville, Tenn, on Tuesday night (Dec. 13, 2016), which featured performances by Cyndi Lauper, Reba McEntire, and Kenny Rogers.

“I am overwhelmed by the generosity of the people who have donated from all over the country and to my friends who donated their time, their talent, and money for My People. The response has been so overwhelming that we haven’t been able to count all of the donations yet,” Parton, 70, said in a statement. “Right now, in total, we have raised about $9 million for the folks who lost everything in Sevier County.”
The Country Music Association, Taylor Swift, and Paul Simon were among the donors, each contributing $100,000 to the Dollywood Foundation My People Fund.
