It wasn’t on a boat.

Leonardo DiCaprio visited The Ellen DeGeneres Show to remind everyone that he is the ultimate daredevil. He shares fond memories of the first and only time that he went skydiving, which did not quite go according to plan. DiCaprio reveals to Ellen DeGeneres that neither his parachute nor that of his diving partner decided to open as they freefell at breakneck speeds through the air.
“My first shoot didn’t open. They cut it’s tandem so somebodies on your back they cut that line,” he recalls. “And that’s when you get the 8×10 glossies of your whole life flashing before your eyes. And then the second one was tangled as well and I saw all of my friends sort of popping off with, ya know, their parachutes and I’m still plummeting toward planet earth.”
His instructor then whispered this sweet nothing in his ear, “Oh you’re probably going to break your legs now because this we’re going too fast.”

The Revenant actor also describes the time when he was aboard a plane and the engine “turned into a fireball”. “It was all Russian passengers and I kind of felt like I had already died and gone to Heaven because no one said anything,” he says. “And I was screaming at the top of my lungs saying, ‘What the hell is going on here?’, and people just kind of looked back at me and the stewardess came out and said, ‘We seem to have a slight problem here.'”
Moral of the story? Don’t board a flight with Leonardo DiCaprio. Watch him explain it all in the video at the top of the page.
