Reba Retires Kanye, Fiddy/n
Talk about a short graduation party.A week after Kanye West's Graduation topped 50 Cent's Curtis in one of the biggest battles in chart history, Reba McEntire knocked both artists down a peg. For the week ended Sunday, Reba Duets rocketed to number one, selling nearly 301,000 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan numbers released today.Though she has topped the country album charts several times, Reba Duets is the country queen's first chart-topper on the Billboard 200.With 60 million career copies sold, McEntire clearly had the country clout to craft an all-star guest list for her duets disc. Among her collaborators: Rascal Flatts, Faith Hill, Kenny Chesney and other country stars, as well as non-Nashville types like Don Henley, Kelly Clarkson and Justin Timberlake."I am beyond thrilled to have my biggest sales week ever with my 31st album," McEntire said in a press release. "To get to share it with all my friends on this duets project is icing on the cake!"In the aftermath of last week's loss to West, 50 Cent speculated that label-generated manipulations drove perceived sales of West's Graduation and to watch for a big second-week drop-off. In the battle of the drop-offs, however, West bested Fiddy again even as both rappers' sales plummeted. Graduation experienced a 76 percent drop, selling 226,000 copies, while Curtis slipped nearly 80 percent on 143,000 copies.Among the week's six Top 10 debuts, Barry Manilow opened at number four, moving 113,000 copies of The Greatest Songs of the Seventies. Apparently not lacking in self-esteem, Manilow included acoustic versions of his own hits, including "Mandy" and "Copacabana (At the Copa)."James Blunt scored the next best bow with his sophomore effort, All the Lost Souls, selling 92,000 copies at number seven. The new album leads at radio with "1973." The singer previously topped the Hot 100 singles chart with last year's "You're Beautiful," making him the first Brit to do so this side of Y2K.Chamillionaire, one of the top acts to break from the Houston scene, sold 79,000 copies of his latest, Ultimate Victory, for a number eight bow. Having previously topped the Hot 100 with his Grammy- and MTV Moon Man-winning hit "Ridin'," Cham returns with an acclaimed mini-opera that combines "Hip-Hop Police" and "Evening News" into an epic nine-minute music video in which the rapper plays various characters.KT Tunstall also cracked the Top 10 at nine with her latest, Drastic Fantastic, registering sales of 50,000 copies. This marks a new career-high for the Scottish singer, who previously peaked at 33 with Eye to the Telescope. Tongue-twisting rapper Twista followed in the 10 spot, with 41,000 copies of Adrenaline Rush 2007. Â Kenny Chesney's Just Who I Am: Poets & Pirates and the High School Musical 2 soundtrack were the week's only other holdovers, respectively claiming the five and six spots. Meanwhile, several Top 10 mainstays slipped out, including Hannah Montana 2: Meet Miley Cyrus to 13, Fergie's The Dutchess to 14 and Nickelback's All the Right Reasons to 15.Just missing the Top 10, Eddie Vedder's Music for the Motion Picture Into the Wild sold 39,000 copies at 11, while H.I.M. (the only Finnish band to score a gold record in the U.S.) sold 38,000 copies of Venus Doom at 12.Motion City Soundtrack opened strongly, moving 33,000 copies of Even If It Kills Me at 16. The Very Best of Diana Krall followed at 19 with 30,000 copies, topping the Dropkick Murphys' The Meanest of Times, which sold 28,000 copies at 20.Other notable debuts included Gloria Estefan's 90 Millas at 25, Mark Knopfler's Kill to Get Crimson at 26, Paul Potts' One Chance at 30, New Found Glory's From the Screen to Your Stereo Part II at 42, Kenny "Babyface" Edmonds' Playlist at 48, Between the Buried and Me's Colors at 57, Thousand Foot Krutch's The Flame in All of Us at 58 and Rick Ross' Rise to Power at 62. Overall, sales were down almost 10 percent from last week and nearly 14 percent compared to the same week in '06.To recap, the week's Top 10 albums were as follows:1. Reba Duets, Reba McEntire2.
