CW Lets Reba Go/n
Sometimes being at the top can still feel pretty low.  The CW has confirmed that Reba will end its six-season run next month, despite its status as the freshman network's highest-rated comedy.  The sitcom returned to the airwaves Sunday, Nov. 19 after an extended limbo period in which the CW couldn't ensure that the popular series would appear on its lineup at all.   After realizing that the network needed as much help as it could get from the old standby, it ordered up 13 fresh episodes last May and added an hour of Reba (new episodes at 7:30 p.m.) to its Sunday-night lineup, where it has provided a strong lead-in to fellow WB refugee 7th Heaven, aka the most-watched show on the CW.  When 7th Heaven moved from its decade-old Monday timeslot over to Sundays to air after Reba, it scored its highest viewership of the season (4.5 million). Meanwhile, Reba's sixth-season premiere attracted more than 4 million pairs of eyes.  The family comedy, starring country music star Reba McEntire as a wise-cracking single mom whose entire brood is crowded under one roof, has been averaging 3.7 million viewers in its Sunday slot after being a Friday show for most of its life.  A two-part series finale is scheduled for Feb. 18. "It's one of those things that doesn't really make sense. We're doing so well for the CW we can't quite figure it out. It's kind of sad," Melissa Peterman, who plays Reba's ex-husband's ditzy new wife Barbra Jean, told Tennessee's Chattanooga Free Times Press on Monday, before the cancellation was made official. "We still have new episodes that are coming up, and there is always the possibility that next year could happen, but right now it seems like it's not going to happen."
