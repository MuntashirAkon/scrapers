Reba's AWOL Rumors/n
         Normally, it wouldn't be news that Reba McEntire was on the set to attend the Wednesday table read for her eponymous sitcom.                   After all, that's been her job for the past three years.                   But, with rumors flying that the country singer turned sitcom star was planning to pull a Brad Garrett-type move (being MIA from the show in a bid for a bigger contract), suddenly McEntire's every move is under scrutiny.                  McEntire has been a last-minute no-show twice in the last four weeks, citing a "family emergency" back home in Oklahoma. The Hollywood Reporter posited that the absence had less to do with a family problem than with a contract problem, namely that McEntire wants her salary upped.          Reba, starring McEntire as a divorced Texas soccer mom, is produced by 20th Century Fox Television and airs on the WB on Fridays. The half-hour dramedy, one of the WB's top shows, is now in its third season.                   The Fox and the Frog and McEntire's representatives declined to comment in response to the Reporter speculation.                  On Wednesday, a WB spokesperson said that what happened isn't anything more than the aforementioned "family emergency" and that McEntire was indeed on the set, working on an episode titled "The Big Six-Up," in which son-in-law Van (Steve Howey) buys a car, and Reba has a chance to go on a blind date set up by her ex-husband Brock's (Christopher Rich) wife, Barbra Jean (Melissa Peterman). Ah, sitcoms.                  McEntire's representatives have made "no formal overtures" about renegotiating her contract, according to the Reporter. However, it is not unusual for stars who feel they are being undercompensated for hit shows to resort to everything from headaches to family crises to trying to prove how much they might be missed. If that doesn't work, they've been known to take the more drastic step of going totally AWOL if demands for a bigger slice of the pie aren't met.                  Think not just Garrett, whose MIA stunt last year on Everybody Loves Raymond eventually shifted the pay scales, but also--to name just a few--Jane Kaczmarek and her headaches on Malcolm in the Middle, and the hardball holdout of the supporting cast of The West Wing, including Jane's hubby, Bradley Whitford, which eventually earned all the missing Wing-ers more cash.
