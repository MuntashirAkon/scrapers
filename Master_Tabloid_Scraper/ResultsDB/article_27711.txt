Reba McEntire "Thrilled to Death" to Have Kelly Clarkson as Daughter-in-Law/n
Two very powerful voices are about to become family members!Country singer Reba McEntire can't wait to welcome Kelly Clarkson in the family—Clarkson is engaged to McEntire's stepson, Brandon Blackstock—and expressed her excitement during an appearance on Katie (airing tomorrow). Katie Couric asked Reba, "You're pretty tickled though to have her as a daughter-in-law, aren't you?"

"Thrilled to death, thrilled to death," she replied, and added, "To have my buddy as my daughter-in-law, I mean, who could ask for more?"McEntire continued gushing about her soon-to-be daughter-in-law, commenting on how Kelly is "a big-hearted, very good person. Very talented," and also speaking about her performance at President Barack Obama's inauguration."Ah, yeah! She's great at that and she's also great at arranging and writing, and she's very creative!"We think it's safe to say Clarkson's got stepmom's stamp of approval.
