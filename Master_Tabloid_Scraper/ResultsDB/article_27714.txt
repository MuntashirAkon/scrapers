Reba McEntire -- Doubles Her Pleasure with Down Low Real Estate Deal/nReba McEntire's Bev Hills mansion is so sweet the thing sold itself -- 'cause she just got 8-figures for it without even putting one of those ugly  "For Sale " signs out front.  According to our sources, McEntire pocket listed the 13,000 sq. foot home because she was in no rush to move, but was open to sell now if the right buyer came along. Y'know someone with say, umm ... $22.5 MILLION! That's how much Reba got for the place she bought for just $9 mil in 2003. Fancy! The swanky crib -- sold by  "Million Dollar Listing " real estate guru Josh Altman -- has sweet amenities like a tennis court, pool, spa, and awesome city views. More importantly, it comes with famous neighbors like Mark Wahlberg, Sylvester Stallone, and Samuel L. Jackson. However, we're told the new owner is NOT a celeb ... but he /she is clearly mega-rich./n
