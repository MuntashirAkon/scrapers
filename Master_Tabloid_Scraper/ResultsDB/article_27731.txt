Clarkson to Manager: Thank You, You're Fired!/nOn her much maligned new album, Kelly Clarkson expressed nothing but love for her former manager -- then she fired his ass! While the feud, er, creative differences between Kelly and music mogul Clive Davis haven't been a secret, her recent firing of The Firm's Jeff Kwatinetz -- on top of scrapping her tour -- proved there was trouble in Clarksonland!But in the liner notes of  "My December, " Clarkson sings a different tune by writing,  "Thank you to my manager Jeff Kwatinetz for arguing with me and fighting for me! I hate 'yes' people, and you are far from that, always wanting the best out of me and for me. Sometimes I want to punch you, but most of the time you inspire me and make me laugh, because you are one of the most passionate and driven people I have ever worked with. Thank you for believing in me! I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE WE GOT THIS RECORD OUT, HA HA!! " Neither can Clive Davis!Despite the pleasantries, Kelly fired Kwatinetz, who was once engaged to Brittany Murphy, and hired Reba McEntire's manager /husband Narvel Blackstock. Let's hope Blackstock can save our little Miss Independent from self-destructing. "My December " debuted this week at #2 on the Billboard charts selling over 290,000 copies. Yeah, yeah. Since u been gone!Rock on, Team Kelly!/n
