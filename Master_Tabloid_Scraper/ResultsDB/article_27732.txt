Donald Trump's Muslim Ban Throws TV Shows into Chaos /nPresident Trump's immigration order has Hollywood execs and actors freaking out ... because Muslim and Middle Eastern roles are pivotal for a bunch of TV shows. Casting sources tell us ... the 2 networks hit the hardest by Trump's order are NBC and Netflix.  "For God and Country " -- produced by the  "Homeland " folks -- have a pilot order from NBC which calls for a number of Middle Eastern actors. We're told Netflix has a show in the works which also features numerous Middle Eastern characters. Marc Cherry has an untitled pilot for ABC as well that’s set to star a late 20's Middle Eastern man ... alongside Reba McEntire. Here's the prob -- casting agents rely heavily on people from the 7 countries on Trump's ban list. One big casting agent says it's always been difficult to cast these roles, but now it's  "super f***** up. " /n
