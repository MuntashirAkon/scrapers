Rob & Chyna's Family Feud Explodes On Camera/n
Rob Kardashian is locked in an all-out war with his sisters and mother over their unprecedented move to block his wife from trademarking her soon-to-be-name, Angela Kardashian, but the beginning of their drama was all caught on video.
Blac Chyna’s efforts to lock down her married name were blocked by a nasty legal rebuke from Kim, Khloe and Kourtney Kardashian‘s lawyers, incurring the wrath of Rob who was furious with his sisters for their actions against his fiancée.
A new sneak peek of the Rob & Chyna Baby Special shows his monster momager in the delivery room, just days before she orchestrated the dastardly legal filing, happily watching the first Kardashian named child being born.

But as Radar exclusively reported, Kris Jenner was the mastermind behind the legal maneuver, and her son is now threatening to quit the family business in the wake of the betrayal.
“Kris went over to Rob and Blac’s house to try and make everything right, but Rob blew up on her when she got there because he believes that she was responsible for this,” a source close to the family told Radar. “Rob is certain that Kris was actually behind the whole entire thing.”
“After Rob went off on his sisters, they told him that the whole thing had been Kris’ idea and that they really had nothing to do with it. Kris was the one that directed the lawyers to take action.”
