Kardashians Declare War! Sisters Accuse Blac Chyna Of 'Damaging' Their Famous Name/n
Looks like Christmas could get awkward at Kris Jenner‘s house!
The Kardashians have had enough of their future sister-in-law Blac Chyna‘s scheming and money-grubbing ways, RadarOnline.com can reveal.
Kim, Kourtney, Khloe and their many brands have filed an opposition to the Instagram model and new mom’s official request to trademark and profit off the name “Angela Renee Kardashian” — and Radar has the exclusive documents!
According to United States Patent and Trademark Office papers, the Keeping Up With the Kardashians sisters claim Chyna’s use of the Kardashian name would confuse fans.
THE PROOF! READ THE OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS
Kardashian devotees would be “likely to mistakenly believe Applicant is affiliated with or endorsed by Opposers…which it is not,” the sisters’ lawyers stated.
And even worse, the former stripper’s coveted new name would destroy the reality stars’ hard-earned credibility.
The sisters “will suffer damage including irreparable injury to their reputation and goodwill if the Opposed Mark is allowed to register,” the attorneys continued.
As Radar previously reported, Rob‘s baby mama Chyna, 28, filed paperwork in May to make money off her married name.
