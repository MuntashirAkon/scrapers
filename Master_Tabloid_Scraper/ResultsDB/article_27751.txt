But his lawyer Angela Agrusa revealed to RadarOnline.com that the 79-year-old creep thinks he’ll win his courtroom battles and “expects to resume his career.”
Industry insiders are baffled by the claim, noting Cosby Show reruns have been yanked and concert appearances were cancelled.
“He’s out of his mind!” one source told Radar. “He’s been saying he’s too weak and blind to identify his accusers — but he’ll be healthy enough to work in TV or film? That’s not gonna fly with studio execs!”
