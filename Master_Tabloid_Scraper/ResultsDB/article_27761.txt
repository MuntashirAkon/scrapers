Mama June Shannon stepped out in public for the first time after her weight-loss transformation was revealed on Friday’s episode of Mama June: From Not to Hot.

Shannon was photographed in Georgia on Sunday (Apr. 2, 2017) wearing leggings, Keds sneakers, and a burgundy sweater as she returned home. Shannon previously weighed 460 pounds before she underwent several weight-loss procedures, including gastric sleeve surgery, a breast lift, a tummy tuck and skin removal surgery on the arms and neck. Now, she is reportedly a size four and had to stay in hiding until her dramatic weight loss was revealed on her WE show.
