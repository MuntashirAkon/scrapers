It’s hard to believe that Rob Kardashian and Blac Chyna — the couple affectionately know by some as “Blob” — have made it to their one-year anniversary. Between screaming matches and a post-pregnancy split, many thought they wouldn’t make it. Yet, here we are.

To celebrate momentous milestone, Kardashian took to Instagram to share a lengthy video montage of his relationship with his fiancée on Thursday (Jan. 26, 2017). “1 year down lol woohoooooo happy anniversary babbbbbbiiiiiiiieeeeeee,” he captioned the clip.
Naturally, the cheating accusations, breakup drama, trouble with the family and Kris Jenner’s crying face were not featured. Oh well, that just means we’ll just have watch Rob & Chyna for all those “classic” moments.
