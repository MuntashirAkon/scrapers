Keke Palmer got real about her experiences as a sexual abuse survivor.

In a recent Facebook Live video, the Scream Queeens actress opened up about growing up in poverty, candidly speaking about living in Section 8 housing and experiencing sexual abuse at a young age. According to Palmer, her faith was the one thing that kept her going and helped her overcome her struggles.
“God is real. And that’s why I’m so thankful for my parents because one of the things they taught me is faith. Faith! I have so much faith in myself and the Lord for what my parents did for me,” she said. “At the end of the day, it wasn’t handed to me. At the end of the day, the cards were against me. At the end of the day, I did grow up on Section 8. At the end of the day, I have experienced sexual abuse.”
“I have experienced turmoil in my family,” she continued. “The point is not to hide those things because when we hide those things, we prevent other people from envisioning that life for themselves.”
