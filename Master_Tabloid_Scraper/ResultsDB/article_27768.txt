Like the Kardashian sisters these days, Adidas wants nothing to do with Blac Chyna.

Amid rumors that the Rob & Chyna star is in talks to get her own shoe deal with the sportswear company, Adidas denies claims that they’ve ever engaged in a conversation about a collaboration. Though Chyna’s lawyer Walter Mosley is telling the press that the label is trying to shortchange the reality star by only offering her $250,000 for a two-shoe contract, Adidas is refuting the allegations outright by stating that they have absolutely no interest in working with her.
“This is 1 trillion percent false at level. She has never been on our radar,” an insider with ties to the brand tells TMZ. The source adds that there hasn’t been any discussion either internally or with Chyna’s camp about the matter.
Previous celebrities who’ve worked with Adidas include Selena Gomez, Pharrell Williams and, of course, Kanye West. Guess having one Kardashian is already enough for them.
