The holidays bring all families together, including famous ones. Kylie Jenner visited her brother Rob Kardashian and his fiancée, Blac Chyna Saturday afternoon (Dec. 10, 2016). While there, she spent some quality time with her new baby niece, Dream Kardashian.

In a video posted to Jenner’s Instagram, she holds a content-looking baby Dream in her arms while “Santa Clause is Coming to Town” plays in the background.

Dream smiles and lightly squirms as her proud auntie says, “Hey! Hey, Dream.” It’s an almost unbearably cute moment. Dream turned one month old on Saturday, so it’s likely Kylie stopped by to wish Dream a happy birthday.
Us Weekly reports that the video comes while Chyna is involved in a legal battle with Jenner’s sisters, Kourtney, Kim and Khloé Kardashian, who have sued to stop Chyna from trademarking what will become her married name, Angela Renée Kardashian. Sources tell the magazine that the suit is strictly a business matter, which the family hopes to settle amicably.

In any case, legal matters didn’t stop Jenner and Chyna from celebrating little Dream’s birthday together.
