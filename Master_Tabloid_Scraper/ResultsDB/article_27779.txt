Romeo Miller is hit with yet another bombshell on tonight's episode of Growing Up Hip Hop.Shortly after finding out about Angela Simmons' surprise engagement, the rapper is equally as speechless when he's told his close friend might also have a baby on the way. E! News has the exclusive first look into the moment Romeo's dad Master P broke the rumored news, and his shocked expression says it all. "This is crazy. I can't even speak," Romeo tells the camera, further explaining, "I'm still getting hit up by everybody about this Angela stuff, and I'm in the dark. I tried reaching out to Ang about her engagement but she never replied."Ouch. 

As for Angela, who ultimately announced her pregnancy in May, a separate sneak peek reveals she's grappling with her own drama surrounding the public's perception of then-fiancé Sutton Tennyson. "Media scrutiny is something that everyone in the spotlight goes through," the reality star admits, adding, "I can't say that there aren't times where it's a little bothersome that you hear someone talking really negatively about you or someone in your family. It's something that could really cause a mental breakdown for someone. So you focus on the positive and you keep it moving; there's nothing else you can do."Simmons goes on to say, "[The media doesn't] really know [my fiancé.] They know what they think they know or they know what they quote-unquote ‘dug up'. That's probably the most annoying part; people judging before they know what's really happening."

Things take an interesting turn when Angela's interest is piqued upon hearing her gal pal was pregnant during her own wedding ceremony. Watch both clips above to see the drama unfold!Don't miss Growing Up Hip Hop tonight at 9/8 c on WeTV.
