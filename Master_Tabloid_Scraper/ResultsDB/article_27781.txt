Angela Simmons Opens Up About Life as a New Mom and Her Wedding Plans/n
Angela Simmons seems to have figured out this whole mom thing already!The reality TV star caught up with E! News at the Brooklyn Rocks Fashion Show at City Point Wednesday and opened up about her life with her newborn baby boy and fiancé Sutton Tennyson. "I feel like I still have a lot of work to do," she said of getting back into pre-baby shape, "but I worked out my whole pregnancy and then as soon as my doctor gave me the greenlight I was like, 'I'm back in the gym.'"But Angela was given strict orders not to "go hard" in the gym because it had been only two weeks since giving birth, so she turned to yoga stretching. 

Now that her baby is at home with her, Angela finds herself wanting to stay home with him."He's so good," she dished, adding, "and when I leave the house I'm like I miss him immediately. I wish I didn't leave the house."But it's those moments that she gets to take a quick break from her new routine, which includes nightly feedings, changings and more. "At nighttime he's up every two-and-a-half to three hours," she explained. "The feedings, the nursing, it's just an adjustment but it's a beautiful adjustment."Despite his premature arrival, Angela said her son came out "screaming" and was "eating on his own," which was great news for the couple. Unfortunately, it meant that her son would require formula and breastfeeding, which disappointed Rev Run's daughter. "You can't predict it," she said.

Angela and Sutton announced their engagement over the summer, and now that their baby is here they're planning the big day."We're working on it for the summer," she dished. But will it be televised?"Perhaps. I like sharing so much on social media," she admitted. "I try to share as much as I can with film maintaining some sort of privacy, but my wedding day that's like a fairytale day to me. I would definitely want to share some aspects of that."
