EXCLUSIVE! Angela Simmons Has a Confession to Make About Her Pregnancy on Growing Up Hip Hop/n
Angela Simmons may now be a mom, but on tonight's Growing Up Hip Hop, she has yet to even tell her sister that she's pregnant. In the exclusive clip above, you can see Simmons break the news to her sister Vanessa, and even spill a surprising detail of baby Sutton's conception. "What are the odds? First time, boom, you're pregnant," Angela says casually after the two go through a few online comments referencing her famous virginity. As casual as the admission is, it doesn't get past Vanessa. "First time?!" the older sister repeats.

Simmons, who is the daughter of Rev Run, gave birth to a son at the end of September with fiance Sutton Tennyson, and all of these big changes in her life have already caused drama this season of Growing Up Hip Hop. In the season premiere, we learned that she had neglected to inform her BFF Romeo Miller about her engagement, and he had to find out from her Instagram. Let's hope she didn't wait very long to tell him she was pregnant! 

Growing Up Hip Hop airs Thursdays at 9 p.m. on We TV.
