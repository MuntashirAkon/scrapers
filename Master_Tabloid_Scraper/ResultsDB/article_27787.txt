EXCLUSIVE! Exclusive First Look: Romeo Blindsided by Best Friend Angela Simmons' Engagement on Growing Up Hip Hop The WeTV star then calls upon a friend for advice, explaining, "What would you do in this situation? Your good friend.../n
Uh-oh! Looks like Angela Simmons failed to keep one close pal in the loop about her engagement news.  E! News has the exclusive first look at the season two premiere of Growing Up Hip Hop, and from the looks of it, Romeo Miller was completely shocked when he found out she'll soon be walking down the aisle. As it turns out, the rapper only found out after Simmons made the announcement on Instagram back in April. "It's on the gram?" Romeo asks in the clip, "I didn't even know she was in a serious relationship to be honest. That's kind of off guard right there. Engagement? That's kind of f--ked up."He continues, "Me and Angela, we've been very close for a long time, and I had to find out about her engagement on Instagram just like the rest of the world. Cold world, man."

The WeTV star then calls upon a friend for advice, explaining, "What would you do in this situation? Your good friend is engaged supposedly; you don't know to who... I still can't believe this is real. It's a big deal."Romeo wasn't the only one surprised by Simmons' major relationship change. Fans and followers of Rev Run's famous daughter were equally as taken aback by the announcement, considering she kept her relationship completely hidden from the public.A month later, E! News confirmed Simmons was pregnant with her first child, a baby boy she's since welcomed in September with fiancé and Atlanta businessman Sutton Tennyson.

To find out how Romeo confronted Angela about the miscommunication, watch the entire clip above! Don't miss Growing Up Hip Hop when it premieres tonight 9/8 c on WeTV.
