"We are not a joke! Trans people are not a joke! "  The outrage began building last week when comedian Lil Duval was on  "The Breakfast Club " ... and said if he ever discovered he'd unknowingly slept with a transgender woman, that woman would be  "dying. "   After Duval made the remark, Charlamagne, DJ Envy and Angela Yee seemed to condemn it, saying that would be a hate crime. Nonetheless, some folks wanted a strong reaction ... rebuking Duvall's violent hypothetical notion. Now there's a push on social media for a boycott of  "The Breakfast Club. " /n
