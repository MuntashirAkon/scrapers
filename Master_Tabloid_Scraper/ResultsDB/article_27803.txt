Nick Jonas ... May I Uncork Your Pinot Grigio?/nNick Jonas is pulling double duty ... hosting The Kids Choice Awards and, maybe more importantly, delivering booze to thirsty chicks. TMZ spoke with Angela Mayhew who says that Jonas came to her West Hollywood apartment with a bottle of pinot grigio for her and her friends. But he didn't stop there ... she tells us Jonas joined in on the fun, having a glass himself and playing two songs. Don't worry, Nick's not pulling a Zayn Malik ... he merely teamed up with Saucey -- an app that delivers alcohol straight to homes -- for a one night promotion. He might want some of that booze to handle those kids tonight. Just sayin' .../n
