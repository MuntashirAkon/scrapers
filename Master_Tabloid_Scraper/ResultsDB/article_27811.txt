Carolina Panthers -- Stadium Invaders Revealed ... Mug Shots & Charges All Around!/nHere they are ... the team of protesters who invaded Bank of America Stadium last night and rappelled from the upper deck ... in the middle of  "Monday Night Football. "  The protesters have said they wanted to make a public statement about Bank of America -- upset that the bank is financing a liquefied natural gas plant in Maryland.  So, they brought gear to Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte, NC and made a spectacle in the middle of the Panthers vs. Colts game -- dropping a banner that read,  "BoA: Dump Dominion " (which included a link to their website).    Cops eventually busted the rappellers -- along with the two other people suspected of aiding them -- and all 4 people were arrested for 2nd degree trespassing and resisting arrest.  The two women -- Angela Vogel and Erica Madrid -- have since been released from custody. The two men -- John Nicholson and David Baghdadi -- are still behind bars. /n
