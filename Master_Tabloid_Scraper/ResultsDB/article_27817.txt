Soap Star Eric Braeden Plans To Reveal New Secrets In Tell-All Book/n
Eric Braeden sat down with Soap Opera Digest this week to discuss his legendary 37 years as Victor Newman on The Young and the Restless, as well as his upcoming autobiography, I’ll Be Damned.
The memoir, cowritten with Lindsay Harrison, has allowed the actor to revisit numerous chapters of his life — both riveting and heart-wrenching.
“It was an emotional ride,” Braeden shared of the writing process. “One inevitably lives life on a daily basis and sometimes you don’t take the time to reflect, and when you do look back upon periods of your life and discover deeply buried emotions.”

“Let’s just say it’s a good thing there was someone to edit it,” he added with a laugh.
The soap star also revealed his favorite actors to work with, including Marlon Brando, Betty White, Mary Tyler Moore and most of all Jeanne Cooper.
“I had such a deep admiration for her,” he gushed. “I know how tough it is to maintain a career in this business and I have a great respect for her for that. She and I always laughed together. We have many great times.”

As for the future, Braeden revealed his hopes to appear in a few more movies, as well as maintaining his role on The Young and the Restless.
“It’s so easy to get jaded in this business. If you stay in Hollywood, you don’t realize that what you do matters to so many people. What a beautiful thing to know that you can directly affect people’s lives,” he said.
