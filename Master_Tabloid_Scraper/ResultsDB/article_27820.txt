 Katie Holmes & Jeanne Yang End Fashion Line; How Did Tom Cruise Figure Into The Split? .../n
Katie Holmes and business parter Jeanne Yang — who Tom Cruise‘s camp claimed was the source in detail leaks in the celebrity couple’s 2012 divorce — are shuttering their high-end fashion line, Holmes & Yang.
Holmes’ rep Leslie Sloane-Zelnick said Thursday that the stunning Holmes and Yang “always knew [the fashion line] was going to end,” and “still remain good friends.
“The timing was due to the fact that they have other projects in their lives right now and they live on separate coasts. And this is what they always planned.”

As we previously reported, the first hints of a rift between the longtime friends came in late-2013, when a rep for the Top Gun A-lister said in court docs that Yang had leaked out pertinent info in their divorce.
The revelations were made in the subsequently-settled libel lawsuit Cruise waged against the publisher of two tabloid magazines.
Whispers of a parting came about a month prior to Tuesday’s announcement, and the nascent split seemed all but a given after the line had no presence at New York’s Fashion Week in February, despite Holmes’ appearance at a Donna Karan show.

Moving forward, Sloane-Zelnick said that Holmes will be focusing her efforts toward the small screen with an ABC drama in the works, while Yang will ply her craft“styling major people in LA.” /n
