The winner wasn’t one of the attractive women at the bash, but an acclaimed chef.  Frank Ostini, owner of the Hitching Post II restaurant in Santa Barbara’s Santa Ynez Valley — made famous as the setting for the movie Sideways  — bought the “date” and has invited Rumer to come along with Blair for dinner at his hugely popular eatery.
The fundraiser, held at the Santa Monica home of top entertainment lawyer Jeanne Newman and her husband, 20th Century Fox Television Chairman Gary Newman, raised a stunning $250,000 for Direct Relief  which provides medicine and medical equipment to the needy around the world.
