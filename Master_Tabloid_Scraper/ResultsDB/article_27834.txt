The Oscar winner just finished filming her latest project, Devil’s Knot, and she spoke about the role recently, saying it “is about a crime that occurred in 1993. It happened in Arkansas, and it’s what I’d say is a very American story.”
She said she doesn’t have any other work plans currently on her plate.
