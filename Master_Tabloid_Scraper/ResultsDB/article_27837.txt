One Florida Rep., Lois Frankel, told The Hill: 
"We considered a lot of different options, but our feeling is that there is so much mischief going on in this Congress that we cannot turn our backs. We think it would actually be sort of the opposite of what we're trying to accomplish."
She also explained to ThinkProgress:
"We feel like we cannot turn our back for one second. We are really here safeguarding the rights of women and girls and their families and we need to be here to do that."
Instead, some of Congress' women representatives have planned to symbolically walk out at noon EST when the chamber convenes! And in addition to giving speeches on the House floor, they'll also be wearing read to signify "revolutionary love and sacrifice."
Echoing Lois' sentiments, Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire told ThinkProgress on Tuesday night:
"Women are already underrepresented in the Senate and with President Trump and Republicans in Congress pushing an agenda that's harmful to women, we can take nothing for granted. So I'll be at work in the Senate tomorrow."
Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York voiced:
"I will be coming to work because our country can't afford a day in the Senate where women's voices are not heard."
And in case you're wondering, the House is voting on a spending bill for the Defense Department on Wednesday.
