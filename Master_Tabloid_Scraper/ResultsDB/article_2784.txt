Supermodel Maggie Rizer -- United Airlines Killed My Dog/nSupermodel Maggie Rizer says United Airlines killed her dog -- and then lied about it. Maggie says she was flying from NYC to San Fran two weeks ago and brought her 2-year-old Golden Retriever along. Maggie says Bea and her other dog were crated in the underbelly of the plane.  According to Maggie, the plane was delayed for two hours and the plane got so hot the pilot told the passengers to open their air vents.  She believes the cargo area wasn't ventilated and the hot air caused her dog to die of heat stroke.And it gets worse.  Maggie says United coldly told her after the plane landed that one of her dogs was dead and then lied to her -- saying they sent the dog to the vet for a necropsy (to determine cause of death) but that never happened. The dead dog was just sitting in the crate.Maggie says,  "I am so saddened by the complete lack of competence, honesty and compassion that United has shown. "  Nevertheless, she is not planning to sue.  FYI, the liability limitations would not make a lawsuit worth her time.A rep for United said the company is sorry for Maggie's loss, but said they found no mechanical or operational issues with Bea’s flight and the investigation is ongoing./n
