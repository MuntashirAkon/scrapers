Some people are saying Madonna and her ex-husband Sean Penn are maybe back together.

Sources told Page Six that Penn and Madonna “were seen hanging out at Shutters on the Beach in Santa Monica, Ca. this week.” The source said:
They were both at the hotel, hanging at the bar area. They were just kicking it.

Penn was recently engaged to Charlize Theron, until she broke off their engagement in June. Since then, he was spotted attending Madonna’s Madison Square Garden Rebel Heart concert in September and even introduced her to his daughter Dylan Penn post-concert.
Madonna later told the audience at another concert, “…after the show he wrote me a letter and said he finally appreciates my art…And that is what I have to say about marriage, okay!? Thirty f–king years later.”
Penn, alongside Amy Schumer and Jeanne Tripplehorn, was spotted attending her concert in Vancouver in October.
In addition, in August, Madonna took to social media to share a sexy throwback photo of her and her ex-hubby in honor of their birthdays (which they celebrate on Aug. 16 on Aug. 17):

Another source told Page Six, “He is the love of her life.”
And a third source claimed of their latest LA rendezvous, “It’s much ado about nothing. They’re friends. Who knows how close they really are after all these years?”
Penn and Madonna were married over 25 years ago, from 1985 – 1989. He allegedly physically assaulted Madonna (including tying her to a chair and abusing her for 9 hours until she escaped to a police station) in 1998, but she didn’t press charges.

The 55-year-old actor/humanitarian recently became engaged in a defamation lawsuit against Empire creator Lee Daniels, who compared Penn to alleged abuser Terrence Howard. Penn’s lawsuit claimed:
“Daniels has falsely asserted and/or implied that Penn is guilty of ongoing, continuous violence against women,” and that “Penn (unlike Howard) has never been arrested, much less convicted, for domestic violence, as his ex-wives (including Madonna) would confirm and attest.”
After the pair split, Madonna was married to Guy Ritchie from 2000 – 2008 and Penn was married to Robin Wright from 1996 – 2010.
