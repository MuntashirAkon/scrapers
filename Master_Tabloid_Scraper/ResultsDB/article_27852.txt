Tom Cruise is Stronger Than an Olympian, Damn it/n
Shut up, please.  Tom Cruise is very busy and important.
In legal docs obtained by Celebuzz as part of the $50 million defamation lawsuit he filed against Bauer Publishing, the actor’s deposition revealed no shortage of high self-esteem.
When asked whether or not he’s able to leave during production of a film for personal matters, Cruise answered yes, adding that plans are “organized ahead of time.”
Cruise could have stopped there and the answer would have been sufficient.  Instead, he wanted to drive home the point of just how integral he is to movie-making.

“Listen, there is — I know a lot of people feel that — and I get questions, you know, ‘isn’t memorizing the hardest thing about making movies?'” Cruise said.
“I have to watch specifically what I eat for inflammation and different things that you have to do physically, to prepare for a film, and that’s for some people, you know, it’s — I train, you know, I’ve studied, you know, professional athletes, Olympians in order to, you know — a sprinter for the Olympics, they have only have to run two races a day.  When I’m shooting I could potentially have to run 30, 40 races a day, day after day.”
Cruise also confirmed his counsel’s comment that his job and schedule are as grueling as that of a soldier’s.
“That’s what it feels like,” Cruise said when asked if his “absence from Suri for extended periods of time” was comparable to “someone fighting in Afghanistan,” according to Cruise’s lawyers.
“It was brutal. It was brutal,” Cruise said about working on his last movie.
Cruise is suing Bauer for defamation, refuting claims from one tabloid that he “abandoned” his 7-year-old daughter, Suri.
