Bob Geldof Throws Star-Studded Wedding Party  5 Months After Marrying Longtime Girlfriend Jeanne Marine/n
Five months after marrying longtime companion Jeanne Marine, Live Aid founder Bob Geldof threw a two-day wedding celebration in the South of France over the weekend.  
Guests included Richard Branson, Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, and boyfriend Manuel Fernandez and actress Demi Moore, who arrived on a friend’s yacht.  
Gelfof, 63, and Marine, 49, had “a family celebration with friends, a very private party,” in Rayol Canadel Sur Mer, a source tells PEOPLE. The bride, a French actress who has been Geldof’s companion for 19 years, has a family connection to the small village.  
The Geldof family, reportedly including daughters Fifi, 32, and Pixie, who turned 25 on Sept. 17, arrived on Friday, according to sources.   
Additional guests – including actor Richard E. Grant, Genesis musician Mike Rutherford, designer Ozwald Boateng, model Jerry Hall and British TV presenter Mariella Frostrup – turned up late Saturday afternoon. Many arrived barefoot off yachts for “a 5 p.m. garden-styled party” featuring a casual and wildly colorful dress code, a source says.   
Attendees were also seen gathering for a party on the village’s Tropicana beach club on Sunday afternoon.  
Geldof’s rep had no comment.  

Geldof lost his daughter Peaches to a heroin overdose in April 2014. Less than one month later, reports of his engagement to Marine emerged. The private couple were formally wed in Rayol Canadel Sur Mer this past April.
