Bob Geldof Marries Jeanne Marine/n
Bob Geldof and longtime love Jeanne Marine have finally made it official.  
The Live Aid founder, 63, has reportedly wed the actress in Rayol Canadel Sur Mer in the South of France.  
The couple have been together for two decades, according to reports.  
Geldof’s eldest daughter, Fifi, hinted at the union on her private Instagram account in recent days, including on Sunday when she posted a pic of herself in a formal dress “for an event later.”   
The happy news comes after a period of deep grief for the Irish rocker, who lost daughter Peaches Geldof at age 25 to a heroin overdose last April.  
“You blame yourself. You’re the father who’s responsible and clearly failed,” Geldof said in an interview. (His first wife and mother to their three daughters, Paula Yates, died of a heroin overdose in 2000.)   
News of Geldof and Marine’s engagement circulated less than a month after Peaches’s death.  
According to the Irish Independent, the pair met in late 1994 at a dinner in Paris, shortly after Yates left Geldof for musician Michael Hutchence.   
“She hadn’t a clue who I was and didn’t care,” he told the outlet of the woman who later became his muse. “She found me attractive, as opposed to ‘Live Aid’ Bob or ‘The Wall’ Bob or ‘Boomtown’ Bob or whatever the hell. I don’t know how – because I was just numb.”  
Marine, who has appeared in films including Braveheart, has said she was instantly smitten.  
“I liked his elegance and his Irishness,” she reportedly said. “Bob is exactly the kind of man I’ve always been waiting for. He’s compassionate, charming, intelligent and, on top of that, good-looking. He’s the most handsome man in the world and I adore him.”
