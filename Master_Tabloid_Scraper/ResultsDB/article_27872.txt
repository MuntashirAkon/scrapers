Disney World -- Hurricane Matthew Wins ... We're Closing!/nMatthew - 1Mickey - 0 Disney World is making the monumental decision to shut its doors as Hurricane Matthew barrels into Florida ... TMZ has learned. We're told the Orlando park will close down at 5 PM Thursday, but expects to open again Saturday morning. That's the plan ... but you gotta think that all depends on the damage. Matthew's category 4 winds are expected to start tearing through South and Central Florida Thursday afternoon. Disney World has closed 3 previous times for hurricanes: once in 1999 (Floyd) and twice in 2004 (Frances and Jeanne). Universal Orlando is also shutting down today, and also expects to find a way to open by Saturday.
