Rihanna and Diplo seem like a match made in musical heaven, so why haven’t the two powerhouses ever teamed up on a track?

According to Diplo, he’s actually been turned down multiple times by the singer — including a request to collaborate on Major Lazer’s 2015 smash single, “Lean On.” In a new interview, the producer-slash-DJ recalls a hilarious incident in which our favorite Bad Gal outright rejected him because — get this — his music apparently sounded “like a reggae song at an airport.”
Via Revolt TV:
In this session, Future was there, along with the producer and Rihanna. As the story goes, Future was playing the singer about “700 songs” before Diplo asked to play her a song of his own. “So I played her a song. And she was like, ‘This sounds like a reggae song at an airport.’ [Laughs] I was like, ‘I’m gonna kill myself.'” The story has since taken a life of its own, producing hilarious reactions online and even earning a response from RiRi herself.
