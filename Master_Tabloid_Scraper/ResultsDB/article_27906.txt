Hillary Clinton shot her upcoming appearance on Broad City back in December but the show's stars are still feeling the buzz from the unlikely cameo."We've had some amazing guests stars, but this is a whole other level," Abbi Jacobson told me at Marie Claire's SXSW party for her and Ilana Glazer."She's like an A-list historical figure," Glazer said. "Meeting her? It was a trip. It was wild."The presidential hopeful was on set for about 45 minutes. "We were like, 'Thank God,' because she shouldn't be on our show for too long," Jacobson said with a laugh. "There are probably more important things for her to be doing."They did get to talk to Clinton in between takes.

"We were shooting and then we had to reset the camera for a different take and we were just chatting, just three girls chatting," Jacobson said.What did they chat about?!"We talked about Cynthia Nixon and Sex and the City," Glazer said.What?!"Cynthia is on the same episode," Glazer said. "[Clinton] was like, 'I like her.'"Glazer doesn't think they'll be campaigning for Clinton anytime soonâ€”not because they don't support her."I don't know if that's helpful," she said. "We're these pot smoking characters."But Glazer is happy to to say, "Now she knows Broad City. I think maybe if someone mentions it, she may be like, 'I think I was on that show.'"
