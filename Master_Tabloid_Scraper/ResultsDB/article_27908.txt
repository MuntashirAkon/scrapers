Best. BFF. Battle. Ever.Before we say goodbye to Abbi and Ilana in tonight's season finale of Broad City (Boo! Hiss!), we're sharing a special treat (no, not weed brownies, though that would make the duo proud!) with y'all: an exclusive first look at the show's co-creators and stars Abbi Jacobson and Ilana Glazer facing off and lip-syncing for their lives on Spike's new game show Lip Sync Battle, premiering April 2.While Abbi takes on Digital Underground's "Humpty Dance," rapping about how she "once got busy in a Burger King bathroom," a line which could easily make for a great Broad City storyline, Ilana decides to go with "It's Raining Men" by The Weather Girls. Oh, and she brought back-up. And a raincoat. Gotta respect the commitment.Press play on the exclusive video above to watch the epic battle go down.

So which funny friend comes out on top? Neither...because the real winner here is us. And we think we can speak on behalf of everyone when we say...
