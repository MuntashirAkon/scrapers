'Cops' Creator's Wife:  "What's She Gonna Do?"  Divorce Him/nThe creator of  "Cops " is getting divorced after 40 years of marriage.John Langley's wife, Maggie, filed divorce docs, citing  "irreconcilable differences. " "Cops " went on the air in 1989 and is still running. As for how much Langley is worth -- we're guessing a gazillion dollars.There is no evidence of a prenup from the documents, so both John and Maggie would split their fortune 50 /50.But Maggie wants more. She's asking for spousal support and she wants John to foot the bill for her attorney.They were married in 1971. They have no minor children.John, who is 68, and Maggie bought an epic beachfront property in Manhattan Beach, CA not too long ago -- a double lot on the sand. It's worth way more than you can afford./n
