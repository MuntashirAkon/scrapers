The 89th annual Academy Awards ceremony on Sunday (Feb. 26, 2017) was peppered with political commentary and highlighted the best theater snack delivery system we should’ve patented.

That’s right. All of the sudden host Jimmy Kimmel was like, “Hey, let’s have some snacks!” and little parachutes full of candy fell out of the sky. It was magical and made us really hungry, but let’s focus on the awards, shall we?

La La Land took Best Picture… until it didn’t. Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway misread the envelope and Moonlight actually won. More on that below. Take a look at the full list of winners over on Variety or keep scrolling to see videos of the biggest moments of the night.
Justin Timberlake opened the show with an electric performance of “Can’t Stop the Feeling” Trolls:


Kimmel “buried the hatchet” with Matt Damon, prodded President Donald Trump, and made Meryl Streep hide in her chair by jokingly citing all of the “overrated” moments in her outstanding career history:


Mahershala Ali became the first Muslim actor to win an Academy Award. He thanked his wife, who gave birth to their daughter just four days earlier, in his acceptance speech for Best Supporting Actor in Moonlight:

Finally, Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway announced that La La Land won Best Picture. Once the entire cast of La La Land was on stage, it was revealed that Moonlight actually took the category. “I opened the envelope and it said Emma Stone, La La Land,” said Beatty in a quick apology. “I wasn’t trying to be funny.”
