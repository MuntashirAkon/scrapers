Last night (Dec. 8, 2016), GQ held their annual Men of the Year party at the legendary Chateau Marmont in West Hollywood, and all of Tinseltown dressed to the nines to rub shoulders with their industry pals!

Although it was a decidedly stylish night, Ryan Reynolds still managed to stand out in a blue plaid suit and cardigan. Meanwhile Mr. Robot star Rami Malek sported all black under an eye-popping silver jacket. As for Nick Jonas, he went all white with a black trim and a black silk tie, evoking Golden Age Hollywood.

And despite this being the Men of the Year party, there’s no denying that the female attendees were the ones who turned heads at the glitzy gathering. They included Kelly Rowland, Christina Milian, Kelly Rohrbach and KeKe Palmer,who was adorable in a pink leopard-print skirt and frilly tube top.
This year’s cover stars are Reynolds, famed actor/director Warren Beatty and U.S. Olympian Usain Bolt, who set the red carpet on fire in a smart light-pink jacket.
Check out the who’s-who guests in the gallery above!
