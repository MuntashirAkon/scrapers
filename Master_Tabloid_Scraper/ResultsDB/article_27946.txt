The fire that broke out on Friday night (Dec. 2, 2016) during a dance party at a warehouse in Oakland, CA is already considered one of the deadliest in the city’s history. Of the 33 reported dead, only eight have been identified so far; among them was Cash Askew, a musician and founding member of the dream-pop group Them Are Us Too, according to Billboard. She was just 22 years old.

Just last year, Askew’s group released their debut album Remain on Dais Records, a local indie label that memorialized the lost artist on Instagram.
“We will never be the same,” they captioned a black-and-white photo of Askew. “Completely devastated by the loss of Cash Askew. She was one of the most talented and loving people we’ve ever known. Please keep her and her family in your thoughts, along with all those lost in the Oakland tragedy.”

According to Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf, the cause of the fire is currently under investigation. The blaze broke out at a residential and commercial building called “the Ghost Ship” by locals; it has been described as “maze-like warren of artist studios.”
The Gray Area Foundation for the Arts, a local nonprofit, has set up a fund for the victims of the fire. Head here to learn more and donate.
