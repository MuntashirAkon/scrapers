Singer-Songwriter Emily Warren Reveals How Tish Cyrus Weighed in on Daughter Noah’s New Single: ‘Tish Is on the Song!’/n

Mom knows best — and in Noah Cyrus‘ case, particularly when it comes to making hit singles.
The 17-year-old singer enlisted the help of her mom Tish to create her latest track, “Stay Together,” which was co-written by singer-songwriter and Chainsmokers collaborator Emily Warren.
“[Tish] was always like, ‘It’s the best,'” Warren tells PEOPLE Now of the tune, adding, “Thank you, Tish!”

Though Noah has a family full of entertainers to look to for advice as she follows in her father Billy Ray and sister Miley Cyrus’ footsteps, Warren calls Tish, 50, the “huge reason” that Noah first decided to make “Stay Together” her single — and her involvement doesn’t stop there.
“Tish is actually on the song,” Warren says. “If I remember correctly, we all went into the booth and did gang vocals and she was there.”

The laid-back tune is the second to be released off of Noah’s upcoming debut album, NC-17, expected later this year. It is a follow-up to her debut single, “Make Me (Cry),” a collaboration with British singer Labrinth.
“I so intensely believe in [Noah],” Warren says. “Her voice just has so much raw emotion. I really think she could sing anything.”
She adds: “She’s just the coolest girl.”
