Oscar Props for Warren Beatty/n
Well, it's not "Hail to the Chief," but it's pretty damn good.        Would-be presidential candidate and multihyphenate movie auteur Warren Beatty has been tapped to receive the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award for career achievement in film at the 72nd annual Academy Awards.        The award, named after the legendary MGM production chief, was established in 1937 to recognize outstanding film producers. Previous recipients include Darryl Zanuck, Walt Disney, Samuel Goldwyn, Cecil B. DeMille, Alfred Hitchcock, Jack Warner, Clint Eastwood, Billy Wilder, Ingmar Bergman and George Lucas.        "In discussing this award for Warren, our governors stressed his passion for film, for getting it right," Academy president Robert Rehme said today. "And his courage in producing pictures that many other producers might consider too dangerous to try."        The reformed lothario, most recently seen in the 1998 political satire Bullworth, has a storied film history. In all, he's produced nine films and received four Best Picture nominations for Bonnie and Clyde, Heaven Can Wait, Reds and Bugsy.         Annette Bening's 62-year-old hubby has also scored 10 Oscar nominations in other categories. In 1967, he was nominated as an actor for Bonnie and Clyde. In 1975, he earned a best screenplay nomination for Shampoo, which he also produced.         Three years later Beatty received four nominations--as producer, director, actor and writer--for Heaven Can Wait and duplicated that feat in 1981 with Reds, for which he received the Oscar for directing. In 1991, in addition to his Best Picture nod, he was nominated for actor in a leading role for Bugsy, and in 1998, the Academy once again recognized him with a writing nomination for Bulworth.        The Oscars will be presented at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles March 26 and will be telecast on ABC.
