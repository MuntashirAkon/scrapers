Warren G: This Is Dedicated to You, Dogg/n
"A true artist indeed, you made your own lane All these albums we drop will never be the same. I'm thinkin' that's the key. Choked up, smoked out, riding to these melodies," rhymes the MC.Warren G (real name Warren Griffin) and Nate Dogg (aka Nathaniel Hale) met straight out of high school in Long Beach, Calif., and teamed up with Nate's cousin, Snoop Dogg, to form the rap trio 213 in 1990. Nate and Snoop wound up signing with Dr. Dre and Suge Knight's Death Row Records, while Warren ended up pursuing a solo careerâ€”but he joined forces with Nate on a number of hits, the biggest of which was 1994's "Regulate."Proceeds from "Dedicated," which features soul singer LaToiya Williams and is available at all digital retailers, will go to the late hip-hopster's family.Take a listen.
