Michael Jackson's Son -- I'M ON THE MONEY TEAM ... With Floyd Mayweather/nThere's only been ONE person who spent his fortune more recklessly than Floyd Mayweather ... and now that person's son is an official member of Floyd's  "Money Team. "Prince Michael Jackson was rollin' through Calabasas this weekend -- with  "The Money Team " decals plastered all over his tricked out GMC truck ... joining other TMT members like Warren Buffett, Justin Bieber and Lil Wayne. Prince is a HUUUGE fight fan -- and has been training in jiu-jitsu at the renowned Gracie Academy in Beverly Hills. Clearly, he's into boxing as well. For the record, Floyd's spending sprees DON'T HOLD A CANDLE to MJ's shopping habits ... especially in Vegas, where Michael would spend MILLIONS of dollars in a matter of minutes. /n
