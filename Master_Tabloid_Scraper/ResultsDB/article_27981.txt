Warren Sapp -- Flirting with Rolls-Royce ... After Bankruptcy Case/nWarren Sapp was test driving a $300K Rolls-Royce Wraith this morning ... but don't worry, the ex-bankrupt, ex-NFL star did NOT drive it off the lot.Everyone knows Sapp had major financial problems -- in fact, his money problems were so bad, his SHOE COLLECTION was auctioned off to pay off his multi-million dollar debt.That's why it was so shocking to see Sapp flirting with a Rolls-Royce today -- especially after completing a court-ordered financial management class just 2 years ago ... where he was taught about reckless spending.So why was he there? We're told Warren was personally invited to the Rolls-Royce driving event in Palm Beach, FL because he was a past client.We're told attendees were welcome to purchase a car at the event -- but Warren wisely passed on the offer.His debt school teachers would be proud./n
