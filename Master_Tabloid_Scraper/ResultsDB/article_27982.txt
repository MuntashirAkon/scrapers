Warren Sapp -- YES, I STIFFED WAITRESS ... 'Cause She Sucked! /nWarren Sapp admits he stiffed a waitress at a Florida sports bar yesterday ... saying the reason he left her NO TIP was because she was terrible at her job.The waitress at Upper Deck Ale & Sports Grill in the Miami area struck first yesterday -- posting a copy of Warren's credit card receipt where he specifically wrote a big, fat ZERO in the tip spot. He also wrote a note,  "Boys don't tip. "For the record, Warren had ordered a soup, chicken wings, a sandwich and a bucket of Heineken, totaling $69.39. Now, Warren is DEFENDING his non-tipping action -- saying the waitress kept calling Warren and his crew  "boys "  -- a term that pissed him off -- so  "the tip fit. "Sapp also says he went to the bar to watch the U.S. in World Cup -- but LEFT before it started because  "it was horrible and the service was the worst. " In a related note, Sapp filed for bankruptcy in 2012 and his Nike shoe collection was auctioned off in 2013 ... AND he never paid Rick Ross after losing a $100k bet he made on the Super Bowl. So, is he REALLY taking a moral stand ... or is he just too broke to tip?/n
