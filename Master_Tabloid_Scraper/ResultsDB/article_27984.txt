Warren Sapp Waitress -- I DIDN'T INSULT SAPP ... He Wayyyyy Overreacted/nThe waitress who got stiffed by Warren Sapp says she never tried to INSULT the ex-NFL star ... claiming he simply OVERREACTED when she approached the table and said,  "Hey boys. "The waitress -- who goes by Corey -- called in to the Andy Slater Show on WINZ in Miami and said she went up to Warren's table and said,  "Hey boys what can I get you to drink? "Corey said Warren stopped her in her tracks and said,  "We're not boys. I'm a man! "Corey says she then used other names like  "sugar " and  "honey " to address Sapp. The waitress also says she was NOT the one who posted Sapp's receipt to the Internet -- but she did throw a family member under the bus. /n
