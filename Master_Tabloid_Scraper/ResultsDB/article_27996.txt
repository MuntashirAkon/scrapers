Fashion designer Victoria is growing increasingly concerned about the predicament.
An Insider told Now Magazine: “There are meetings and appearances that cannot be missed. Neither of them like being apart but Victoria really feels it.
“He’s trying to reassure her and tells her they’ve worked hard for these opportunities, but she doesn’t want to look back in 10 years and regret not spending this time together.’

“At this point in life, Victoria thought she’d be spending more time with David, not less.”
The famous couple has four children together. Brooklyn,18, Romeo, 14, Cruz, 12, and their daughter Harper, 5.
In April she was invited to Buckingham Palace to receive an OBE for her contribution to fashion from the Duke of Cambridge – the former Spice Girl received the award 13 years after her husband was granted the same title for his services to football.
Their reps have declined to comment on the story but it looks like they might have to carve out more time for one another in the future.
