 Gordon Ramsay’s Hacker Father-In-Law Thrown Behind Bars For Spilling Chef's Secrets.../n
Chris Hutcheson, the father of celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay’s wife Tana, has been sentenced to six months in prison for hacking the star’s company computers!
“The whole episode of five months amounts to an unattractive and unedifying example of dirty linen being washed in public,” Judge John Bevan QC said during the sentencing.
As RadarOnline.com reported, the crime stems from a decades-long feud between Ramsay and Hutcheson that has cost the Chef more than $2.5 million in damages and legal costs.

With the help of his sons, Adam and Chris, Hutcheson accessed Ramsay’s financial details and other private information.
Adam and Chris were both sentenced to four months in jail.
Sources say the hacking occurred almost 2,000 times between October 23, 2010 and March 31, 2011.
Information stolen from Ramsay’s computers included tips on the celebrity’s hair transplant and a fishing trip, which was later leaked to News of the World.
