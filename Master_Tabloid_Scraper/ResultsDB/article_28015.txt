Congratulations, boy! It's a boy!
It's only been about two months since we found out Joseph Gordon-Levitt and his wife Tasha McCauley were expecting their second child.
And we just learned today that their second son has already been born â€” in June!

A rep for the very private couple confirmed the birth to People, though the boy's name has not been released.
What we do know is he has a two-year-old big brother and that he has some incredibly smart, talented parents.
So happy for them!
