A 42-year-old man who posed as Justin Bieber online has been charged with over 900 incidents of child abuse.

NBC News reports that Gordon Douglas Chalmers, a 42-year-old law lecturer at the Queensland University of Technology, has been accused of soliciting explicit images from children by posing as Bieber via Facebook and Skype after being tipped off by U.S. and German authorities. Chalmers was charged with “using a carriage service to procure and groom children for sex and to access child pornography” and possessing child porn.
This week, the lecturer was charged with 931 child sex offenses–including rape and producing child exploitation material—that date back a decade.

“The fact that so many children could believe that they were communicating with this particular celebrity highlights the need for a serious rethink about the way that we as a society educate our children about online safety,” Police Detective Inspector Jon Rouse said in a statement. “The breadth of offenses committed in this instance is frankly horrendous.”
Warrants to search Chalmer’s social media, messaging accounts, and cloud servers were issued in November. He is due to appear in the Brisbane magistrates court on Apr. 6, 2017.
