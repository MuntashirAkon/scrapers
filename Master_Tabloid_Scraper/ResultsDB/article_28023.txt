Deadline reports:
“‘Gordon was a master of reinvention — a journeyman artist,’ Helen Hunt said in a statement. ‘He knew and taught that the work doesn’t always find you. You need to create and re-create the work every day.'”
Among the elder Hunt’s credit are directing more than 30 episodes of Mad About You, the long-running NBC sitcom that starred his daughter. He also helmed multiple episodes of Frasier, Coach and Caroline in the City, along with such comedies as Ladies Man, Suddenly Susan and Two Guys, a Girl and a Pizza Place.”
