The new Twin Peaks teaser consists of David Lynch eating a glazed donut in silence, and nothing else.
The short clip sees the show’s writer-director back in the role of detective Gordon Cole followed by a flash of that familiar sign post and text that simply reads: “The Return.”
Lynch is one of many original cast members making their return to the show. Kyle MacLachlan, Mädchen Amick, Michael Horse, and David Duchovny are all part of the revival cast. New additions include Michael Cera, Laura Dern, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Amanda Seyfried, Naomi Watts and more.
The Twin Peaks reboot is set for release in early 2017. Watch the trailer above!
