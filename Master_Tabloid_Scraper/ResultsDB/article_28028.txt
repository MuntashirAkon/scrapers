Although Nick Gordon was found “legally responsible” for his ex-girlfriend Bobbi Kristina Brown’s tragic death in September and ordered to pay $36,250,000, he has apparently decided to stay (perhaps inappropriately) positive, posting a throwback photo of himself alongside Brown’s world-famous mother, Whitney Houston.

“Learned so much from this amazing woman. Miss you so much!!” Gordon captioned the image of himself and the R&B icon during happier times.

The daughter of music royalty was found unresponsive in a bathtub in her Georgia home in January 2015. She was then put in a medically induced coma for six months before passing in July 2015. The Fulton County Medical Examiner’s office found marijuana, alcohol, benzoylecgonine (a cocaine-related substance), prescribed anti-anxiety medication and morphine in Brown’s system when she was first discovered and treated.
Gordon has not been criminally charged for his part in Brown’s death.
