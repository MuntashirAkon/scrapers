Joseph Gordon-Levitt Wants You to Be in His Subway-Performing Rock Band/n
According to the website for the Gordon-Levitt-launched production company HitRecord, the 35-year-old's latest social venture aims to create a massive, collaborative piece of art through fan submissions. Joseph shares different challenges for those who want a piece of the performance puzzle, and voilà! anyone can be the star's bandmate. But if you're surprised by the Snowden actor's hidden talent, think again. JGL is actually a self-taught drummer, telling James Corden last year, "The cool thing about drums is that you can practice without a drum set."  Musically-inclined and major acting chops? As if we needed another reason to love Joseph!
