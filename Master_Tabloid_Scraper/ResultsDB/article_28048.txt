Gordon Ramsay Expecting His Fifth Child With Wife Tana/n
Tana is due to give birth in September, he added. Gordon hinted that he would prefer to have another boy, but added, "Obviously, I'm happy with a girl." The biggest problem with having four daughters, he explained, is that there will be "four weddings, four Sweet Sixteens, four boyfriends"â€”all things he'd rather not think about. As for Tana, he told James, "She's all good."James and Tana have been married since 1996.The Late Late Show With James Corden airs weeknights at 12:35 a.m.
