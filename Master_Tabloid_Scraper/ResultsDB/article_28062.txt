Tom Brady, Cam Newton Swag Out at Met Gala/nThe Met Gala ain't just for the Kardashians ... a bunch of athletes were there too -- from Tom Brady to Cam Newton ... even a huge NASCAR driver!  The New England Patriots were well represented with Tom, Julian Edelman and Danny Amendola -- and Alex Rodriguez and Jennifer Lopez killed it.  Cam Newton wasn't much of a talker -- but his outfit was loud as usual. La La Anthony made a solo statement ... and keep a lookout for Jeff Gordon and Roger Federer. Not too shabby ... /n
