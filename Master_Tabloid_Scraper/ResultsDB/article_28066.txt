Kris Jenner -- Smooth Operator/nKris Jenner is way more bush league than we thought ... if you want to make yourself look younger by photoshopping, don't do it AFTER someone else posts the pic of you looking older than you want.Kris is hawking her new cookbook and Gordon Ramsey gave it his stamp of approval. Â But check out Gordon's Instagram and then compare it to Kris's. Clearly she doesn't believe cookbooks get better with age.There's a Latin legal phrase: res ipsa loquitur ... Translation: the thing speaks for itself./n
