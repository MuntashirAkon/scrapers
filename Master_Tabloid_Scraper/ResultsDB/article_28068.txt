Michael Waltrip -- NASCAR Fight Was Real ... Not Scripted For Ratings/nThe trackside brawl between Jeff Gordon and Brad Keselowski was 100% AUTHENTIC ... and not a scripted stunt to get ratings ... so says fellow driver Michael Waltrip. Waltrip was at LAX on his way out of Hollywood after being eliminated from  "Dancing with the Stars " -- when we asked about the bloody altercation at Texas Motor Speedway. Of course, there's talk NASCAR put the drivers up to the fight to get a boost in ratings ... which are reportedly down 6% from last year. But Michael ain't buyin' it -- telling us the rage couldn't be more real. Check out  the clip. /n
