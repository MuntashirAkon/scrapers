Selma Blair Nails Kris Jenner In O.J. Simpson TV Show Trailer/n
The first trailer has been released for the O.J. Simpson series American Crime Story, and the sneak peek video of Kris Jenner being played by Selma Blair is so spot on it’s scary!
American Crime Story: The People v. O.J. Simpson shows the full cast in character for the trial of the century, including David Schwimmer crying as Robert Kardashian, Sarah Paulson as prosecutor Marcia Clark and John Travolta as legal eagle Robert Shapiro.
In a chilling clip, Blair, 43, lashes out at Schwimmer, berating her husband for defending Simpson, who was eventually acquitted of killing his wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and a waiter, Ron Goldman.
“He’s my friend, I don’t turn my back on people,” Schwimmer, as Kardashian, tells his pearl-clad wife.
“You’re turning your back on Nicole!” she screams.
Clearly a central figure in the biopic, Blair is a carbon copy of the 60-year-old Keeping Up with the Kardashians matriarch. During a funeral scene she’s shown gossiping with her friend, asking, “Do you think he did it?”
Check out the clip above and tune into the series on FX in February 2016. /n
