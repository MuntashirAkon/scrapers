Rihanna has no time for haters.

The singer was pretty in pink at the world premiere of Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets premiere in Los Angeles Monday night (July 17th). Clad in blush Giambattista Valli couture gown with its own train, the 29-year-old stopped traffic — literally — as she sashayed down the red carpet.
She accessorized her look with a matching clutch, lace-up heels, and rosy jewelry.

But in case you had negative things to say about the internet’s favorite Bad Gal, Rihanna recently let a fan know she won’t be disrespected by blocking her on Twitter. When one woman commented, “Rihanna would look so much more beautiful if she was white,” alongside photos that were digitally altered to lighten Rih’s skin color, the songstress shut her TF down with one simple click.

“RIHANNA BLOCKED ME IDHDJLS,” the user captioned a screenshot showing that she’s been blocked by Rihanna.
And that, ladies and gentlemen, is why you don’t mess with with Rihanna.
