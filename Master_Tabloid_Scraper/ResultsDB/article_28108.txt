The 20-year-old model bared her boobs while walking the Alexandre Vauthier show Tuesday (July 4, 2017) during Paris Haute Couture Fashion Week. Bella strutted her stuff in a see-through turtleneck and oversized skirt paired with a pair of pink boots and a hat with a netted veil.

“Opening @alexandrevauthier tonight,” she gushed on Instagram alongside a picture of the racy look. “Thank you my love for having me …Another beautiful and powerful show…an incredible designer and friend so much fun.”
Over the weekend, Bella also shared a topless photo of herself before hitting the runway. Clad in only a nude-colored thong, she captioned the sultry shot, “In Eutopia.”
