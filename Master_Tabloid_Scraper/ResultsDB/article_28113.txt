Colton Haynes batted for both sides when he lost his v-card.

According to the 28-year-old actor, he lost his virginity to a guy and a girl when he was a teenager. What’s more, he claimed the encounter was an “exciting” experience in which “everyone participated.”
“I lost my virginity at 13 to a girl and a guy,” the Arrow star told SiriusXM host Andy Cohen this week. “I’ve never said that before. The girl was two years older than me, and the guy was, I would say, around 16.”
“It was a real first time,” he added.

Colton, who came out in May 2016 before getting engaged to Jeff Leatham, also revealed he had slept with both sexes throughout high school, though he had only been with a total of four women in his life. When asked if he had ever participated in a threesome, he teased, “We’ve all had them, but it wasn’t that time.”
“I was literally told from the day that I moved to Los Angeles that I could not be gay because I wouldn’t get work,” he recalled, explaining how his management team at the time would set him up with women to make him seem straight. “I dated every young person, which of course I didn’t date.”
“They knew the whole time,” Colton said of his rumored female flings. “It was horrible.”
