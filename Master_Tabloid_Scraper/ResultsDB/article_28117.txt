Who better to test out the equipment at Alex Rodriguez‘s new gym than the fitness queen herself, Jennifer Lopez?
The singer got a personal tour of Rodriguez’s new UFC gym in Miami after missing the opening on Aug. 10 for work. Lopez tried out the dumbbells and a few machines before hitting the boxing ring to show off her skills.
The Shades of Blue star said that she picked up the sport to prepare for the show.
“I always liked it,” Lopez said. “It’s always been a tough workout.”
Rodriguez talked about how excited he was to show Lopez the new gym during the opening event.
“Jennifer and I work out together, and I can’t wait to bring her here to my new gym,” he told PEOPLE. “She is a great jock, a former track star in school, and I enjoy working out with her.”

“Jennifer and I mix it up,” Rodriguez said. “We like to lift, and we enjoy bike riding. She is a talented jock.”
