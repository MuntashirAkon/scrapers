'Big Brother' Houseguests Furious Over Unwanted Butt Poking/nSeveral  "Big Brother " competitors are claiming their butts are being violated by a fellow houseguest for weeks -- who's been captured on video jamming her fingers into various dumpers without consent. The anal invader is Jessica Graf -- whose schtick is to approach unsuspecting houseguests from behind and surprise them with a deep oil check. Graf has been recorded pulling the move on Paul and Matt -- who were upset about it and confronted Jessica. Problem is, she laughed it off as a joke. Another female houseguest, Alex, claims Jessica pulled the same move on her -- poking her in the butt and the vagina. During a live feed from the house, Alex got emotional when describing the incidents to houseguest Josh -- and said it affected her because a family member had been raped and killed.  Paul and Kevin have discussed Jessica's actions in the house -- and said if she was a man poking women, she would be in jail for sexual assault. We reached out to CBS for comment. So far, no word back./n
