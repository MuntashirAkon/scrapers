Boston 'Free Speech Rally' Overtaken by Thousands of Counterprotesters/nThe  "Free Speech Rally " in Boston Saturday has turned into a massive demonstration by counterprotesters -- thousands and thousands of them -- condemning the alt-right, white nationalists, racists, fascists and neo-nazis. Exactly one week after the Charlottesville attack, a rally by conservative activists -- who attempted to distance themselves from white nationalists -- has been dwarfed by a diverse group of counterprotesters who believe the  "free speech " rally is a guise for hate speech.

As we reported ... James Alex Fields Jr. plowed his car into a group of counterprotesters last Saturday in Charlottesville after a day filled with violence. He was charged with second-degree murder./n
