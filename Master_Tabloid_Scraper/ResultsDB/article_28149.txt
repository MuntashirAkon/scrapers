Jesse Williams Sits for National Anthem at BIG3 Game After Charlottesville Attack/nJesse Williams refused to stand for the National Anthem while attending a BIG3 game this weekend ... and it appears to be in direct response to the Charlottesville attack. Jesse was at the Staples Center in L.A. Sunday, sitting in for a round of games between 8 teams for Ice Cube's basketball tournament ... but during the anthem, the  "Grey's Anatomy " star parked it.  While sitting court side, Jesse posted a video during the song with a caption that said  "We'll stand when you do... " -- which seems to be aimed at President Trump. The Prez was criticized Saturday for not directly calling out white nationalists who were at the center of the violence.  #CharlottesvilleVA #WhateverWhereverWhenever #TheWhiteWaltz https: / /t.co /7VCA5QgxIX — jesse Williams.

The suspect -- James Alex Fields Jr. -- has been charged with murder.  Marshawn Lynch also sat out the National Anthem this weekend during a pre-season game with the Oakland Raiders ... although it's unclear if his sitting was in response to Charlottesville./n
