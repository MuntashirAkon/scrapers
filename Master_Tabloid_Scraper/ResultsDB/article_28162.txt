Man Arrested For Allegedly Trying To Kidnap A Four-Year-Old Girl In CA! WATCH!/n

This is every parent's nightmare!
Earlier this month, security footage shows Terry Ransom trying to abduct a four-year-old girl from Macias Cellular & Computers in Victorville, CA!
It all started when the girl's mother noticed a strange man in the parking lot prior to the crime.
She told the store's owner:

"She had said that the guy was looking at her from when she got out of her car, but she didn't think he would follow her."

As seen in the video, the man yanks the girl by her arm as she was playing near a candy machine. The mother — who was also holding an infant — and another customer (seen in the tank top above) ran after the suspect.
Luckily, the girl was able to break free from the man. According to Craig Battles, a barber next door:

"She was crying. She wasn't screaming. She was really terrified… So when he ran… me, my clients. I was cutting hair. A couple of people was waiting. We all ran around there to see what was going on."

Eventually, bystanders tackled the man until authorities arrived. He was arrested on charges of kidnapping and child cruelty, and is being held on $250,000 bail.
