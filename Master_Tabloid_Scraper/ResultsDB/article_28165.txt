Miley Cyrus Parties Like A Rockstar While Fiancé Liam Hemsworth Slaves Away At Work!/n

So she put her hands up, they're playing her song!
Liam Hemsworth's gone away!
Yeah-ahhh-eeeeeah, it's a party in the… wait, where is her fiancé?
Gale Hawthorne is off earning serious cheddar working his quiver off on Catching Fire but, as any man of hers should already know, Miley Cyrus just can't be tamed!
She and her entourage nabbed a front row table at Beacher's Madhouse in the Roosevelt Hotel on Wednesday and their party popped harder than Orville Redenbacher!
Mileybird reportedly busted several moves on the dance floor! She and the crew grooved to Dr. Dre's Nuthin' but a 'G' Thang and that Simple Minds staple from The Breakfast Club, Don't You (Forget About Me)!
Though we seriously doubt anything topped the evening's main attraction:
A triple-cray performance by a mini-Nicki Minaj!
What the hizzle!? We aren't even sure we want to know!
Ok, yes we do! Tell us!
