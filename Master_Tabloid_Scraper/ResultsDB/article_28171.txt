Katie Couric hasn’t always been America’s sweetheart.
Long before the newswoman graced the small screen in living rooms across the nation, Couric was a young aspiring journalist. Born the daughter of a newspaperman in Arlington, Virginia, she first got her foot in the door as a desk assistant at ABC.
A decade later, Couric joined NBC News as a correspondent for the Pentagon. And before long, she was climbing the ranks, serving as a fill-in co-anchor alongside Bryant Gumbel on the network’s morning news show, Today.
The pair proved to be a winning combination. Within months, Couric was hired to replace former co-host Deborah Norville on Today. She was an instant hit among viewers, with Americans relating to her cheery and charming disposition.
During her tenure at NBC, Couric nabbed many high-profile interviews — from then-First Lady Hillary Clinton to President George Bush to former Secretary of State Colin Powell.

But after 15 years at the news network, Couric decided to close that illustrative chapter of her career. In May 2006, she announced she would be moving to CBS, where she would become the first solo female anchor of an evening news show. Now her latest venture sees her take on the softer side of news, as the host of her very own ABC daytime talker, Katie.
So as Couric celebrates her 56th birthday on Jan. 7th, Celebuzz looks back at her credentials. What job do you think best suited Couric during her career? Explain why in the comments below.
