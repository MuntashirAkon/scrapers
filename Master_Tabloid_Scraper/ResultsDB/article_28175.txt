Deborah Norville's Affair/n
“Inside Edition” anchor Deborah Norville relishes her homelife, she tells the ParentTime Website, and that is influencing her plans for New Year’s Eve. “I will be home with my husband, our children and his parents having champagne, pate and caviar before a roaring fire. I have no intention of going out that evening and leaving the comforts of home. I think holidays should be a family affair.” For more on what Norville had to say, go to http://www.pathfinder.com/ParentTime/celeb/norville.html
