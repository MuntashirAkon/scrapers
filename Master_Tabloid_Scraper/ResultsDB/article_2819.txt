Visiting the V&A museum for an exhibit, the momma of two showed off her tweed frock accented by pearl buttons and contrast ribbing, all for a different look than we've almost ever seen her in!
Kate also accessorized the look with a red clutch and block heels to top off her chic ensem.
So interesting! We wonder if we'll be seeing more looks like this from her in the futureâ€¦
