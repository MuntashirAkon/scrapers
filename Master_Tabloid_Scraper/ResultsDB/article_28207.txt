Muhammad Ali's Family Gears Up For Bitter Fight Over Reading Of Late Boxer's Will/n
RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned Muhammad Ali‘s loved ones are gearing up for the reading of his will — and insiders say the event could lead to an explosive family fight!
“The will is going to be read next month to everyone,” revealed an insider, who predicted major drama if Ali’s last will and testament is the same one his wife Lonnie, who had been a major part of the champion boxer’s life for over thirty years, prepared in 2006.
“That will left out some family members,” noted the insider. “She has kept everyone who was close to Muhammad before she married him away from him as much as she could.”

According to the insider, some of the late Ali’s closest friends, favorite cousins and other loved ones may be in for a nasty surprise even though many largely kept quiet about their distaste for Lonnie while Ali was alive.
“Muhammad had no control with what she was doing, and, they knew how upset he got when he would hear how bad she was treating everyone,” explained the insider. “They didn’t want to give him anymore stress.”

“Lonnie has told the family that anyone speaking negatively about her will be cut out of the will,” added the source. “She has always been money hungry.”
As Radar reported, Ali’s widow is expected to inherit the bulk of the late Olympian’s wealth following his June 3 death at age 74.
