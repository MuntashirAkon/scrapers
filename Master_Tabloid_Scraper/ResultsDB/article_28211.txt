The Jenazah funeral service for Muhammad Ali is currently taking place in Louisville, Kentucky and is set to last 30 minutes, family spokesman, Bob Gunnell, confirmed Wednesday morning.
According to WDRB.com, the procession for the service includes a police-escorted hearse along the route from the local funeral home.
“About 16,000 are expected to take part,” the website reported. “Muslims and people from all over the world traveled to Louisville this week to say goodbye to their beloved champ.”

As Radar previously reported, Ali was admitted to a Phoenix-area hospital for what Gunnell called a “respiratory issue.”
When doctors told Ali’s wife, Lonnie, that “his condition wasn’t going to improve,” the family rushed to be by his side.

Later, Gunnell announced that Ali died at 9:10 MT, due to septic shock from natural causes, saying, “He did not suffer.” Ali’s funeral will be held on Friday at the KFC Yum! Center in his hometown of Louisville.
However, as Radar exclusively revealed, sources allege the late sports star was treated like a prisoner in his own home, where he lived with Lonnie as he struggled through his final days, the boxing legend’s heartbroken brother Rahman.
Ali’s official obituary is expected to be released this afternoon. /n
