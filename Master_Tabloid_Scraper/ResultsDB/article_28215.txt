Does anyone know what that Stacey Dash thing was all about???

The Stacey Dash thing was a little strange. #wegetitalready
— Shawn Smith (@shawnsjournie) February 29, 2016


This really happened people. Stacey Dash literally walked out and said, "Happy Black History Month" and laughed while walking off stage.

That Stacey Dash thing might be the most random and bizarre moment I've ever seen on live television. #Oscars2016
