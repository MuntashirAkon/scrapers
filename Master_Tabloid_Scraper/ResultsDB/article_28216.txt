Lucas Peterson is a reporter for the New York Times who makes his living covering travel ‚Äî especially the kind of travel you can get on the cheap, hence his Twitter handle @FrugalTraveler.
So when he boarded a Megabus to go from Chicago to Milwaukee on Sunday ‚Äî not even a hundred mile drive ‚Äî it should have been no problem, right?! Just another trip?!
Well, things started off badly (below):

An hour into trip, turning around to "switch buses." Currently learning that on @megabus, you get what you pay for. pic.twitter.com/6JagtWZEow

Summary: we left Chicago, immediately there seemed to be something wrong bc we stopped on shoulder of highway couple times, driver got out.

Then driver said we have to turn around and go back to Chicago to switch buses. About five min later tire blows and we pull over on hwy 41
‚Äî The Frugal Traveler (@frugaltraveler) February 21, 2016


Driver says it's just a flat tire, that there's no need to panic, and goes outside. Minutes later smoke starts pouring out of the bus.

Someone on the top deck eventually says: "we should get off of this bus." So we all get out. People trying to get their luggage. Small fire.
‚Äî The Frugal Traveler (@frugaltraveler) February 21, 2016


Small fire over wheel becomes big; people abandon luggage and get away. Entire thing goes up in flames, series of loud booms.

passengers are looking up Megabus TOC which limits liability to $250; some very unhappy people. pic.twitter.com/8p5QDVIgS5

Good news: according to police no one was hurt. I asked about our (passengers) status since its cold waiting outside here (30s/ windy)
‚Äî The Frugal Traveler (@frugaltraveler) February 21, 2016

The kicker: officer says "they're sending another Megabus to pick you guys up." üòê

FIVE. HOURS. LATER.
Milwaukee is 92 miles from Chicago, roughly a drive of less than two hours under normal circumstances.
