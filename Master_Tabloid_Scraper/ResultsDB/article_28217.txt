Kalamazoo's Department of Public Safety Chief, Jeff Hadley, was as shocked and confused as you'd expect him to be during a talk with reporters after the fact: 

"It's totally unprovoked, random acts of violence. We're still trying to figure out the motives."

Ugh.
The shooting spree, which began at 6 p.m. local time, lasted nearly six hours as the shooter moved from location to location, eluding police and finding victims completely at random. 
The suspect, Jason B. Dalton, was apprehended without incident after midnight, with Kalamazoo County Prosecutor Jeff Getting at the very least thanking his officers they caught the alleged gunman when they did:

"There's just no question more people would have died if they hadn't found him when they did. I have every belief that he would have continued to shoot if he was not apprehended. I couldn't be prouder of the men and women who top to bottom dealt with that situation."

So scary. 
Still, it leaves more questions than answers for Getting, who continued:

"They appear to have been chosen at random because they were available."

So awful.
Our thoughts are with the victim's of this needless, senseless tragedy.
