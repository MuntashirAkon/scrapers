Worst Husband Of The Decade Charged With Trying To Shoot His Wife — While She Was Breastfeeding Their Baby!/n

This is just disgusting.
A Minnesota man was charged on February 8 for allegedly trying to shoot his wife while she was breastfeeding their baby — because he was jealous she was spending more time with the infant than him!
According to reports, Nicholas Lehmeier's wife told police that he loaded a 12-gauge shotgun and pointed it at her while she was breastfeeding their 4-month-old child.
She claims the 28-year-old cocked the gun and pulled the trigger, but the gun didn't go off. Afterwards, he allegedly threatened to shoot her with a handgun, but instead shot out a window.

Lehmeier's wife says the July 2015 incident was not unprecedented, accusing him of abuse and rape going back 10 years. She told police she had not come forward sooner because her husband threatened to kill her or the children.
The alleged attacker has previously been convicted of assaulting their 7-year-old child, which led to the removal of five children from the home. 
Lehmeier is also accused of raping his wife, using the excuse that she had to have sex with him because they were married.
She also said Lehmeier controlled all of their finances.
If convicted, Lehmeier could face up to seven years in prison. We applaud his wife for going to the authorities and speaking out on the domestic abuse.
