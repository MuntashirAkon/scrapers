Kate Beckinsale has found herself a hot new man.

The Underworld star is reportedly dating Matt Rife, a 21-year-old stand-up comedian and actor. According to Entertainment Tonight, the two are “officially boyfriend and girlfriend.”
“They quickly started flirting, went on their first date and it’s continued since,” a source close to the 43-year-old actress tells the publication. (For those of you who are trying to do the math: It means he was about 5 when Pearl Harbor came out.)
The couple were spotted making out at West Hollywood’s Villa Lounge on Tuesday (June 21, 2017). While waiting for their car at the valet, Matt caressed Kate’s cheek before planting a passionate kiss on her lips.

“He is very mature for his age and is a great guy,” the source adds.
Matt’s past body of work include appearances on TV shows like Nick Cannon Presents: Wild ‘N Out and Disney XD’s Gamer’s Guide to Pretty Much Everything.
