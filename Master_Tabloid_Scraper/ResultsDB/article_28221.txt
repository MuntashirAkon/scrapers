Russell Brand is on the set of Rock of Ages where he dares to ask the question: “Does reality even matter?”
That question was tweeted out and included a pic of the funnyman and his new costar Alec Baldwin. The new pics show Russell heading onto set in Miami, Florida. Russell is to play the role of Lonnie in the ’80s rock musical! When he’s not filming alongside the likes of Alec, Julianne Hough and Tom Cruise, we’ve seen Russell hitting the beach and the waves!
This past May, the Arthur star was spotted wearing skimpy tighty-whities at a pool in Miami. The British funnyman strutted his stuff around the water with a gray towel elegantly draped over one shoulder. Check out the pics below!

But the shenanigans didn’t stop there! Katy Perry’s hubby was also snapped riding a tortoise! Russell visited Jungle Island while on his trip to Miami, hitting up the Miami Wildlife Park and having a grand old time with a lemur, a giant tortoise, a snake and a penguin.
