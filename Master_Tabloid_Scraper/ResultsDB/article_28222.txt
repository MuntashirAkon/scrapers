 We’ve seen Julianne Hough and Diego Boneta doing their thing while filming the upcoming Broadway showed turned feature film Rock of Ages, but now we’ve got a sneak peek at two more stars on set!
In this just released photo (via director Adam Shankman’s Twitter) Russell Brand and Alec Baldwin channel their inner 80s rock Gods and we have to admit, they look pretty awesome.
Shankman tweeted this photo and said:
“First look! World premiere! Russell and Alec making my life heaven on #rockofagesmovie.”
Looks like Alec has been looking forward to filming this, too, as the Twitter newbie tweeted:
“On the set with the one and only Russell Brand….”
We can only imagine the hilarity that is ensuing between these two! Alec will be playing Dennis, the owner of The Bourbon Room, a bar that is trying to be saved and Russell plays Lonnie.
Fore more Rock of Ages sneak peeks, check out some photos of Julianne on set below!
