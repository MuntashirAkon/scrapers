Chavis has melted hearts playing young Randall, Mandy Moore and Milo Ventimiglia‘s adopted son on NBC’s hit drama.
On the show, grown-up Randall (Sterling K. Brown) is currently contending with emotional and physical problems, but in real life, Chavis posed with Brown at the NAACP Image Awards, tweeting congratulations for Brown’s award and including a heart emoji.
This Is Us airs Tuesdays (9 p.m. ET) on NBC, and The Thundermans is slated to air this summer on Nickelodeon.
