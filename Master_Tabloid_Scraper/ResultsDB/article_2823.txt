Here’s the “tooth” about Demi Moore’s pearly whites.

During her latest appearance on Jimmy Fallon’s late night talk show, the actress revealed she’s actually missing her two front teeth. Armed with photographic evidence, the 54-year-old said her chompers fell out due to stress and she’s been wearing fake teeth during public appearances.

“I sheared off my front teeth. I’d love to say it was skateboarding or something really kind of cool, but I think I think it’s something that’s important to share, because I think it’s literally, probably after heart disease, one of the biggest killers in in America, which is stress. Stress sheared off my front teeth,” she shared. “But, in an effort to get ready for you, I wanted to make sure my teeth were in.”
Demi added her daughters — Scout, Tallulah, and Rumer Willis — find it refreshing to see her toothless. “They love seeing me without my teeth,” she joked, “because they think it makes me look more vulnerable and more human.”

Previously, the Rough Night star opened up about her missing tooth during a 2010 appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show.
“Thank God for modern dentistry. I had a bad bite and knocked my own front tooth out, which basically fell out into my hand, and I just thought my warranty was up. That was it,” she remembered. “I was sitting at my desk and I felt something drop and I caught it and looked down, and there was my tooth.”
