Britney's Bodyguards Sue/nThree of Britney Spears' former bodyguards have sued Britney Brands, Inc. and Britney Touring, Inc., claiming they worked long hours and never received overtime pay. The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in Los Angeles Superior Court, claims the guards worked between 12 and 16 hours a day and were often on call 24 hours a day, but never got anything but a straight salary. The plaintiffs, Lonnie Jones, Randy Jones and Silas Dukes, say they were terminated last November and did not get their final paycheck. The suit asks for compensation for unpaid wages and benefits, as well as penalties.
