The steamy video comes two days after Portwood and Glennon made their red carpet debut at the MTV Music Awards on August 27.
RadarOnline.com broke the news that Portwood is in a new relationship when they were caught on camera holding each other and kissing on a marina in Indianapolis on August 7.
It was later revealed that the mystery man is Glennon, who she met while filming Marriage Boot Camp Reality Stars: Family Edition. She joined the reality show to save her relationship with ex-fianc√© Matt Baier, but they split when filming ended.

‚ÄúAndrew worked in production on the show, and spent a lot of time with Amber,‚Äù a source told Radar. ‚ÄúHe worked on all her confessional scenes. Andrew quickly developed feelings for Amber, and made the first move.‚Äù
The couple has moved fast, as he already met her daughter Leah with ex-fianc√© Gary Shirley. The 8-year-old was in the background of a photo Glennon posted on Instagram.
Although the couple appears to be happy, should she be worried about his past?
