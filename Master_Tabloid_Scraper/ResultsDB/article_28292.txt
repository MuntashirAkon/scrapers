Kim Kardashian almost suffered a wardrobe malfunction when she went to dinner with friends Monday (July 10, 2017).

Clad in a barely-there Gucci bra with only a black blazer covering up her chest, the 36-year-old risked a nip slip as she enjoyed a night out with pals Jonathan Cheban, Simon Huck, and Stephanie Shepherd. Showing off major cleavage, Kim paired her revealing top with a pair of velvet leggings, lucite heels, and a black Prada purse.

Kim’s outing came hot on the heels of news that her brother, Rob Kardashian, was slapped with a temporary restraining order by Blac Chyna. Though the family has stayed silent on the matter, sources close to the clan claimed Rob’s siblings are “ashamed” of his actions — especially when he leaked Chyna’s nudes online.
