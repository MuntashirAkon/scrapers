Kim Kardashian is ditching her bra for the day.

The Keeping Up with the Kardashians was spotted going braless as she grabbed some grub at Los Angeles hotspot Chin Chin on Monday (My 8, 2017). Clad in an black top and skintight leather mini skirt, the 36-year-old almost had a nip slip as her shirt slowly started to slip off her shoulder during her lunch date with BFF Jonathan Cheban.

The day before, Kardashian bared her bod in a Snapchat video, wearing nothing but pink underwear and a large fur coat. Looking almost unrecognizable in a long magenta wig, Kardashian captioned the sexy short clip, “Set vibez.” Could this mean she’s already filming her new beauty competition, Glam Masters?

As previously reported, the mom-of-two is executive producing a Lifetime series all about finding the newest member of her glam squad. According to Kardashian, contestants will compete for a spot in her elite beauty entourage and the title of “Beauty Director for Kardashian Apps.”
In other words, you’ll be seeing a lot more of Kardashian in the near future.
