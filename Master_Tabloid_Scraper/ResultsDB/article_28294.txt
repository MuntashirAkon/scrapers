Khloé Kardashian just went all out for Tristan Thompson’s birthday, throwing her boyfriend one epic, gold-themed party to ring in his big 2-6.

On Monday (March 13, 2017), the reality star took over her man’s Cleveland, Ohio home and decorated every inch of the bachelor pad with flowers, candles, metallic streamers and giant balloons reading “HAPPY BIRTHDAY TT.” (Also, is that a giant painting of KoKo in the background?)

Documenting the lavish bash on her Snapchat, Kardashian also stocked the party personalized napkins and matching golden dishes.
“She’s being shy,” a friend said in one video as the 32-year-old hostess playfully covered her face. “This is who put this whole thing together. Shoutout to Khlo Money!”

As for desert, Kardashian served up a variety of gold-tinted sweet treats, including doughnuts, Kit Kat bars, and customized cookies with edible photos from their recent Jamaican vacation. She capped off the night by presenting Thompson a massive birthday cake — complete with a basketball-shaped top tier — befitting of the NBA star.

“I’m just happy that she’s having a good time and starting a new relationship,” big sister Kim Kardashian said of the relationship on Sunday’s season premiere of Keeping Up with the Kardashians. “He’s a little young, but I’m excited to tell Jonathan [Cheban] and like, a couple of my friends!”
