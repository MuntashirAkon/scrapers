Almost a year after giving birth to her first child, Anne Hathaway is finally ready to let the world meet her son.

The Academy Award winner took to her Instagram on Thursday (March 9, 2017) to share the first photo of her baby boy with husband Adam Shulman. In the sweet picture, Hathaway’s son — named Jonathan Rosebanks Shulman — is seen watching his mother’s speech at the United Nations on a tablet.
“JRS watching Mommy give her speech at the UN yesterday #forourboys #forourgirls #forthefuture #loveislove #parentsareparents #paidparental #iwd #ppl @unwomen,” the 34-year-old captioned the shot.

The day before, Hathaway visited the U.N. to give deliver a speech in support of paid parental leave. Wearing a red dress to commemorate International Women’s Day, the actress emphasized the need for companies and businesses to rethink their policies to include men.
“[We need to] redefine and destigmatize men’s roles as caregivers,” Hathaway, who serves as a U.N. global goodwill ambassador, said. “Why do we continue to undervalue fathers and overburden mothers?”
“Maternity leave, or any workplace policy based on gender, can — at this moment in history — only ever be a gilded cage,” she added. “We now know it creates a perception of women as being inconvenient to the workplace. We now know it chains men to an emotionally limited path.”
