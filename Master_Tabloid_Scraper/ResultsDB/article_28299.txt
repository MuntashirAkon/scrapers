Jonathan Cheban stopped by Kim Kardashian and Kanye West’s home to check out their gorgeous Christmas tree and took a Snapchat of the occasion.
While Kardashian doesn’t make an appearance on camera, you can clearly hear in the background narrating the tree tour. “Isn’t it insane?” she asks off camera. “Just lights, no ornaments.” The tree is indeed huge and glorious, covered with white branches and lights.

A source told E! News earlier this week that Kim and Kanye would be spending the holidays at their home together and appeared to be very happy. “They were very sweet together and were very much together. They are going through a lot but from what it seems like they are doing it together and getting through it.”
