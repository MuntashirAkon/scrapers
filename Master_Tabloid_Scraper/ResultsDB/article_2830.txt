Last night (Dec. 7, 2016), literally all of Hollywood showed up for the premiere of Office Christmas Party in L.A. Among the attendees were Katy Perry and Jennifer Aniston, who, the most devoted will remember, have one big thing in common: they both once dated John Mayer. However, that didn’t stop them from posing for a few friendly photos together!

Aniston, who attempts to shut down the most outrageous office Christmas party known to man as the film’s villain, was her usual laid-back self on the red carpet in a boho-chic Roberto Cavalli frock. Meanwhile, Perry kept it simple and elegant in a sleeveless black gown off set by a pearl choker.

Although neither Perry nor Aniston’s relationship with Mayer was a casual romance (the Friends alum was linked to him from 2008-2009 while the singer dated him off-and-on between 2012 and 2015 ), it appears these two are more than happy to let bygones be bygones!
Other attendees at the premiere included Jimmy Kimmel, Kelly Rowland, Olivia Munn, T.J. Miller, Randall Park and tons more.
