Keira Knightley revealed that her daughter, Edie, dropped the F-bomb after Donald Trump won the election.
During an upcoming appearance on The Jonathan Ross Show, the actress recalled her 19-month-old’s reaction to the outcome of the U.S. presidential election. Like many people around the world, Knightley told the audience how she and husband James Righton stayed up to watch the results.

“She is talking a lot, she’s running, she’s literally repeating everything we say so we’re having to be really careful and we are being really careful but we had this really weird thing the night of the American Election,” Knightley, 31, explained
“Edie didn’t wake up until about eight in the morning at which point I think he was giving his victory speech,” she continued. “I brought her into bed and she’s like this watching the television completely silently and totally still for about four minutes and she rolls over onto her back and she closes her eyes and she goes ‘F–k!'”
But rather than being surprised at her daughter’s foul language, Knightley said she is “very proud” of her hilarious reaction.
