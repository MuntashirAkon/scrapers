On Wednesday (Dec. 7, 2016), Time named President-elect Donald Trump 2016’s Person of the Year and people have, um, mixed feelings about it.

While Trump technically meets the criteria for being the person who had the greatest influence, for better or worse, on the incredibly polarizing presidential election, we think there are a whole host of people who deserve more recognition than the perpetually orange businessman turned politician. So in no particular order, we’ve rounded up 20 people (and things) we think deserved the prestigious title over the President-to-be.
1. Harambe
Harambe did what Trump has yet to do: unite a country.





2. Lady Gaga’s dead aunt Joanne
She inspired Lady Gaga’s best work to date; she deserves all of the posthumous awards.
3. Baby Luna Legend
Baby Luna is the reason we’ve all be blessed with all of the swoon-worthy pictures and videos of John Legend being the best dad in Hollywood. Also, she wore this hot dog costume. That in itself deserves an award.



have you ever seen a more “why me?” face 😭

4. Ken Bone
Honestly, Ken Bone has a better approval rating than the President-elect.

5. Demi Lovato
If saying things you don’t mean get you in the running for Person of the Year, Demi Lovato deserves a nod. It took less than a day for her to renege on her promise to take a break from social media.

Fuck this.. I’m back bitches. And I’m coming back more honest than ever

6. Little Drake
The only thing better than Drake’s album Views is the little Drake that blessed his album cover.





7. Kermit the Frog
Because Evil Kermit is the true voice of the American people.

8. DJ Khaled
DJ Khaled taught everyone the importance of staying away from “them” and “they.” Unfortunately, it seems as though we didn’t listen…

11. The Ghosts of Prince, David Bowie and Leonard Cohen
Even from beyond the grave, these legends are thrice the man Trump will ever be.
12. Billy Bush
In the spirit of keeping things positive, Billy Bush did us a YUGE favor. He showed us Trump’s true colors.
13. Joe Biden
Never has there been and never will there be an American Vice President that has captured the hearts and social media accounts of America. We’ll miss you, Joe.

Trump: Can I get past
 Biden: What’s the password
 Trump: I don’t know
 Biden: Losers says what
 Trump: What
 Obama: JOE pic.twitter.com/TB713TMsES
