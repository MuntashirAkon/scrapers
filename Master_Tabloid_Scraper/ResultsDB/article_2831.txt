Capture the magic of winter with the sparkly jewelry below!

Sparkle along with the snowflakes by owning these winter jewelry pieces we’ve selected. During the winter time, we cover up with layers of comfy clothing, but we can stand out with a bit of sparkle. Snowflake-inspired jewelry is popular around this time of year, as are silver, classic crystals, stars and more. Bejewel your neck, wrists, ears, and hands with the pieces below!
Necklaces
Enhance your neckline with these delicate necklaces. They are not all statement pieces, but they definitely add a hint of sparkle to your outfit. These necklaces vary in length, color and types of pendants. There are pearls, rubies and sapphire along with the ongoing theme of snowflakes and stars. Here are nine necklaces to consider.

Rings
After the gloves and mittens come off, the sparkle and shine begins! Rings are a great accessory to wear because you do everything with your hands. With these rings, you will be constantly reminded of the twinkle on your fingers as you carry out your everyday activities. Typing, writing, shaking hands, and more — all mundane activities, instantly glamorized. Check out the eight rings below!

Watches and Bracelets
Just like rings, you can actually watch your sparkly wrists in motion with bracelets and watches. Charm bracelets can showcase wintery symbols like christmas trees and snowflakes more blatantly, while the rest of the bracelets and watches we’ve selected more subtly shimmer and shine with crystals.

Earrings
Earrings are the most playful jewelry pieces because they can be big or small, simple or quirky. These earrings keep the shimmer that most winter jewelry has but also feature some symbols from the upcoming holidays. There is a pair of earrings for anyone’s style: sparkly studs or candy canes and reindeers. Check out these stunning options!
