Geeks of the world, prepare for an awesome fandom collision!Nathan Fillion is set to guest star on an upcoming episode of The Big Bang Theory, E! News has confirmed. Go on, nerd out. We'll wait. The geek God is set to make a cameo as—wait for it—himself when he stops by CBS' hit sitcom in the Feb. 19 episode. As first reported by EW.com, Leonard (Johnny Galecki) and Raj (Kunal Nayyar) will just so happen to see the Castle star at a restaurant, with a debate soon following as to whether or not it's really him and if they should snag a selfie. Typical fan problems, right?

Thanks to his work on Firefly, Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog ('Sup, Joss Whedon?!), Fillion is one of the most beloved actors in the geekdom, with The Big Bang Theory's Sheldon (Jim Parsons) being a huge fan of the canceled-too-soon Firefly. How pissed do we think he's going to be that he missed his chance to meet Mal Reynolds aka Captain Tight Pants? Ever so sarcastic, Fillion retweeted a fan's posting about the cameo, feigning ignorance, saying, "Is this for real?" Fillion isn't the first Firefly star to guest on TBBT: Summer Glau also appeared as herself in a season two episode.The Big Bang Theory airs Thursdays on CBS.
