Last week, London’s elite stepped out for Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott’s photographic exhibition at Phillips Auction House. Unfortunately, a week later, it’s not the art that everyone is talking about. Rather, it’s Madonna’s drunken antics that unfolded after she hit the open bar a little too hard.

In a video obtained by the Daily Mail, Madonna can be seen rolling around on the floor of the event space, all while clutching a glass of rosé. The singer, who was dressed in ripped black jeans, black and white striped shoes, a pearl bedazzled leather coat and matching cap, spent a significant amount of time on the floor, giggling and kicking her legs up in the air.

It is unclear whether or not Madonna’s antics were appreciated, but she seemed really pleased with herself, even joking about having the best seat in the house on Instagram.
