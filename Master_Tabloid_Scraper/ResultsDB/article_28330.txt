Doc to Jiffy Lube: Sorry, I'm Not Hiring!/nDaniel Serrano -- aka Dr. Jiffy Lube -- will work for food! Last week, Dr. Lube assured a judge he had a job lined up should he be released from jail. TMZ did a little diggin' and ... you guessed it -- Serrano should be in the unemployment line.Serrano told the judge cosmetic surgeon Dr. Nathan Newman had offered him a gig at his Beverly Hills office. Dr. Newman tells TMZ that's not true -- he's not hiring anyone.In addition, Dr. Nathan says the supposed  "job offer letter " from 2005 Serrano produced in court last week was simply a letter of recommendation for a medical internship.Without a job, Serrano's chances of staying in the U.S. are slimming down. Argentina, don't cry for him.  See Also      Did Dr. Jiffy Lube Tune Up Shaun Sand?     Judge to Doc Jiffy: You Can Stay ... Almost/n
