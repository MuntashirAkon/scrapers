TMZ Music: Nathan Asher and The Infantry/nThe times -- yes, they are a-changin'. Deals like the one announced last week with MySpace and SnoCap which allows bands to sell their songs prove that the music business is evolving.The one thing that doesn't change is the value of true talent and a true artist like Nathan Asher. Some of the most influential artists in the history of music have the rare ability to paint a landscape of life with a song and when Nathan sings,  "It's a portrait of the young artist /As another target market /Playing dumb in the club /And using liquor as a tourniquet / Let's succumb to our desires /Or we'll become just like our fathers, " you understand why Asher draws comparisons to some of the great American songwriters.Nathan Asher and The Infantry will bring their music to the towns of eastern America over the next two months starting where a tour should start, their home state of North Carolina. The opportunity to see them live will be the chance to not only see a true artist, but to get a glimpse of music's future.Turn up your faders./n
