Proving his deft showmanship, LS didn’t skip a beat when his guitar string broke halfway through his set. Rather than pausing, he soldiered on, jumping into the air, hitting high notes, and taking his mic even deeper into the crowd to pump up the atmosphere.

With an upright bass, drums, and banjo providing support to his pleading, soulful voice, LS moved from bluegrass romps to soulful acoustic guitar-led songs of love and heartbreak.

The lounge, open to all Chase Freedom customers, was a treat for concertgoers that got a musical experience away from the packed outdoor stages. Parking themselves on the white banquettes dotting the tent, the audience got to sit back and relax in style as one of the hottest rising stars on the line-up gave an extended, up close set. Here, it was all about the music in a more personal venue.

For the last song “Hello Sunshine,” Langhorne Slim brought the show to an end by getting the crowd on it’s feet, clapping and swaying as they rocked out for the last final minutes before hopping back in a car and heading to Los Angeles for the last shows of their tour.
