Linkin Park Releases App With New Song!/n
Linkin Park Monday announced the launch of their new app for the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad, Linkin Park 8-Bit Rebellion.
Linkin Park 8-Bit Rebellion provides a heightened app experience for music fans and gamers alike, with multi-player features in an epic adventure taking them through six unique levels in the game, each featuring the unique style of a band member.
There’s An App For That 
The goal is to retrieve the band’s stolen music track called Blackbirds (which happens to be a brand new, unreleased Linkin Park song made exclusively for the game). Once all missions inside the game are completed, Blackbirds is unlocked.
Rufus Wainwright, Stripped Down:
“As opposed to putting together an app featuring just our songs and name, we wanted to make this an exciting gaming and music experience and the folks at Artificial Life shared that vision,” band member Mike Shinoda said. “They were able to turn my sketches and our creative ideas into a living, breathing world that we think gamers and fans will thoroughly enjoy.”
Witty Kitty App
