Bart Simpson has been 10 years old for 22 years now, and Nancy Cartwright is the woman behind the voice that keeps him forever young. The voice over artist showed off her amazing vocal ability with RadarOnline.com.
In an exclusive interview Nancy says “Bart is the easiest one to do,” but her favorite voice is that of Nelson Muntz, the bully. “Of all the characters in Springfield, he’s one of the most evolved characters,” she says. “He’s now a bit of a philosopher.”

“I kind of wanted to get her autograph, but I didn’t want to put myself in a weird position,” she says of the Oscar-winning Streep. “The next thing I know she’s taping me on the shoulder and says ‘You know my kids are fans of the show, could I have your autograph?’”

Cartwright who also does the voice of Chuckie from The Rugrats, Todd Daring from The Replacements and Rufus from Kim Possible, originally auditioned for the role of Lisa, not Bart—but soon discovered a “10-year-old underachiever” would be more fun to play. 
Besides being the master of many voices, Nancy is a humanitarian. Her annual Monte Carlo Nights helps raise funds toward Los Angeles Police Department’s Devonshire PALS (Police Activities League Supporters). The Monte Carlo night is held at her Northridge home. It attracts many celebrities such as Kirstie Alley, Jose Canseco and Camryn Manheim , along with World Series Poker pros. /n
