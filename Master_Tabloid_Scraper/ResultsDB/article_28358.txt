TV: Monday Hot List/n
So, as One Tree Hill starts to wrap up for the season—and no clear word yet on whether or not they’re back next year—we’re thinking that maybe this show has lost its luster just a tad. First of all, there’s Clay and Katie who’s masquerading as his dead wife. The creepiness isn’t working and tonight Clay realizes that this crazy girl has got to go. And while we totally understand why Hayley is so sad and depressed over her mother’s death—her slip into such a deep depression came from nowhere and gets even worse tonight.
Then on Gossip Girl, Serena is in such awe of her father (we just want to scream at the TV and knock some sense into her) that she makes her loyalties crystal clear and makes poor Rufus feel like an outsider. Meanwhile, Chuck refuses to give up on winning back Blair. Next week is their finale for the season (and GG is definitely back for more in the fall) and we can’t wait!
