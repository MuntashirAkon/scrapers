Music Countdown: Who's On The Artist’s Lists?/n
As 2009 comes to an end, RadarOnline.com asked some of this year’s most prolific artists who was on their iPod this year…
Thomas Mars of Phoenix:
Dirty Projectors, a new band from Brooklyn. I saw them live and it’s amazing. They had an album that was a fantasy of a Black Flag record the guy had when he was a kid, and it’s very virtuoso, it’s really clever.
 
Faris Badwan of The Horrors:
HTRK from Australia, they just moved to London best thing I’ve heard in years.
 
Neil Tennant of the Pet Shop Boys:
I feel a kinship with Rufus Wainwright because he’s like us, kind of fearless.
 
Colbie Caillat:
David Ryan Harris, John Mayer’s guitarist. He has a soulful, gorgeous voice.
 
Check out Colbie’s style over the year.
 
David Gray:
Pride by Phosphorescent

Courtney Taylor-Taylor of The Dandy Warhols:
The CDs in my car right now are Blitzentrapper, Band of Horses, The Bravery and Fleet Foxes.
 
Brett Anderson of  The Donnas:
Maria Taylor’s LadyLuck

Landon Pigg:
I’m just ever fiddling with Nat King Cole or Frank Sinatra. It could be the new Sufjan Stevens record, or I guess I could say the Whip It! soundtrack.
 
Evan Dando of the Lemonheads:
I like some stuff around the turn of the century but since then I haven’t liked anything. I hate Arcade Fire. I just hate anything that sounds like U2 and most things sound like U2 again now. What’s that stupid band, Kings Of Leon? They sound like U2 now. I just don’t like music—I only like old music.
