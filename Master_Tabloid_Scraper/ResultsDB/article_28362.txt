"Hallelujah" For Leonard Cohen/n
The brand-new biography on legend Leonard Cohen makes the perfect holiday gift for the music snob, er, music aficionado on your list!  Named after what’s easily Cohen’s most covered song, Hallelujah– which has been recreated by the likes of Jeff Buckley, Rufus Wainwright and even Fall Out Boy-Tim Footman’s tome couldn’t be more well-timed with Cohen’s recent resurgence and appeal to younger audiences, marked by sold-out concerts in the US and Europe over the past two years. The book follows Cohen’s journey from growing up in a middle class Jewish family in Quebec to his years as a poet and author and his foray into the world of rock and folk later in life, at 37 years old, and touches upon his recent recordings, which are scheduled for release in 2010.
