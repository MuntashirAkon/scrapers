After a break last week, One Tree Hill and Gossip Girl are back with brand new episodes. On One Tree Hill, Brooke and Julian’s relationship continues to be strained by Julian’s relationship with Alex. Tonight, he confides to Alex that Brooke is unable to get pregnant—and needless to say, Brooke is not happy that he shared that secret. Meanwhile, Millicent deals with her addiction to dieting and cocaine—and finds that she actually has an ally in Victoria! 
 On Gossip Girl, Thanksgiving comes a week late but it’s worth the wait! Oh it wouldn’t be the holidays without some major Upper East Side drama! Serena’s family dinner is just a tad uncomfortable when Lily invites Trip and his wife! It also turns out that Lilly has been lying to Rufus about CeCe’s health and Blair thinks her mother is hiding something from her.
 If you’re looking for some more heart-warming family fare, then look to ABC and check out the premiere of Find My Family. Tonight, hosts Tim Green and Lisa Joyner help a 24-year-old aspiring teacher from Arizona find her long lost brother and try to reunite an adopted woman from Arizona with her biological mother.
