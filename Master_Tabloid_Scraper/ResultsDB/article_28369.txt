Willow Smith Joins Cher As Marc Jacob's Newest Face, But She Won't Be The Last! Get The Deets HERE!/n

Woah! This Marc Jacobs campaign is way beyond than what we thought!
It was first revealed that Cher would be the new face of MJ, but now it seems that 14-year-old Willow Smith is also starring in the ads!

The designer unveiled the latest star and her official campaign pic to his Instagram on Thursday, along with the caption:
"Ever since our first Juergen Teller ad in 1998 which featured Kim Gordon on stage wearing my dress, I have always preferred collaborating with the people who inspire me to give new life to the clothes we show on our runway. Over the years we have photographed an incredibly diverse and exceptional group of talented friends and individuals who I greatly admire: Victoria Beckham, Jamie Bochert, Jarvis Cocker, Sofia Coppola, Miley Cyrus, Dakota Fanning, William Eggleston, Jessica Lange, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Stephen Malkmus, Samantha Morton, Kate Moss, Charlotte Rampling, Winona Ryder, Stephanie Seymour, Cindy Sherman, Michael Stipe, and Rufus Wainwright, just to name a few. Beauty, style and talent know no age. It is those individuals whose creativity, unique vision, and voice inspire all of us here to create and express ourselves through our medium: fashion. Photographed by David Sims, this season's ads feature friends, each of whom evoke a sense of intrigue and inspiration and collectively provoke a true consideration for individuality. Here today I would like to share (not CHER) with you first, the talented, stylish and charming Willow Smith@gweelos Stay tuned over the coming weeks for moreâ€¦"
So if that was too overwhelming to read, what Marc is basically saying is that there are more stars to come!
But who could it be?? Maybe Adriana Lima since she wore his design to the Met Gala, just like Cher did.
Gah. Give us a hint!
