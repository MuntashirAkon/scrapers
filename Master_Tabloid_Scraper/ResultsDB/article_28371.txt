Kelly Rutherford — who played Blake Lively's mom — shared a pic of her, Chace Crawford, Michelle Trachtenberg, and Jessica Szohr on her Instagram!
The caption read: 
"So happy to see these beautiful people (inside and out) last night. Chase, Michelle and Jessica #GG#PostOscars"
It must've been a long time since they've seen each other because Kelly totally misspelled Chace's name!
According to sources, Miz Rutherford showed the gang pictures of her children — Hermes and Helena — and they were totally blown away by their cuteness!
Also to join in on this nostalgic affair was Willa Holland, who had a recurring story arc in the series as Agnes Andrews!
This isn't the first time actors from the teen drama have gotten together.
As we reported, Kelly and Matthew Settle — who played Rufus Humphrey — are rumored to be dating!
Somewhere, Leighton Meester is totally jealous she didn't get the invite!
