 Here comes one hot mama!
Just two months after giving birth to her daughter Rose, a ***flawless-looking Scarlett Johansson stepped out to host a screening of The Theory of Everything at the Crosby Hotel in New York. The new mom, who welcomed her first child with fiancé Romain Dauriac in September, was joined by the film’s leading man — and her 2008’s The Other Boleyn Girl co-star — Eddie Redmayne.
