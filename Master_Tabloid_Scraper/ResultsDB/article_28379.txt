 Here is your first look at Ouija, a movie based on the ancient board game of the same name.
If it reminds you of Paranormal Activity, Insidious, The Purge and other scary films, that’s because some of the producers have those titles in their resume.
Hasbro is listed as one of the production companies, along with Universal Pictures, because the actual game is used in the film.

Ouija stars Olivia Cooke, Daren Kagasoff, Bianca A. Santos, Douglas Smith and Rufus Humprhey himself Matthew Settle. (But wait there’s another Gossip Girl connection: Blake Lively’s half sister Robyn is also in the film). 
The scarefest is pretty straightforward: a group of teenagers (played by mostly 20-somethings, as Hollywood likes to do sometimes) are faced with evil spirits when they play the ancient spirit board otherwise known as Ouija.
Ouija, directed by Stiles White, opens in theaters Oct. 24, just in time for Halloween.
Watch the trailer, above.
