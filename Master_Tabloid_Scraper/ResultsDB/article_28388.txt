Get ready for sleepless nights, poopy diapers and one helluva journey.Rufus Wainwright and his longtime partner, Jorn Weisbrodt, just jumped on the ride of parenthood!The Canadian American singer-songwriter announced on his website Friday the birth of his daughter, Viva Katherine Wainwright Cohen, on Feb. 2.

The proud dad had nothing but kind words to say on his daughters arrival, "Darling daughter Viva Katherine Wainwright Cohen was born on February 2,  2011 in Los Angeles, California to proud parents Lorca Cohen, Rufus  Wainwright and Deputy Dad Jorn Weisbrodt. The little  angel is evidently healthy, presumably happy and certainly very very  beautiful."The child's mother, Lorca Cohen, is the daughter of famed singer-songwriter Leonard Cohen. Can you imagine the plethora of musical genes this little girl is going to have?!And it was only appropriate that Wainwright encouraged the readers of his website to also welcome his new baby girl the best way he knows how."Daddy #1 would like to offer everyone a digital cigar and welcome the  little lady  in with a French phrase from his favorite folk song, A La  Claire Fontaine : 'Il y a longtemps que je t'aime, jamais je ne  t'oublierai.'"The french lyric translation: "So long I've been loving you, I will never forget you."Awwww, congrats to the new parents!
