What kind of Gossip Girl scene is this? Where are the tears and recriminations? Are Lily Rhodes van der Woodsen Bass (Kelly Rutherford) and Rufus Humphrey (Matthew Settle) really having a genuine and heartwarming reunion with their long-lost son, Scott (Chris Riggi)? Or is Scott actually a lying grifter out to break Rufus' heart and make off with Lily's money?We've got the exclusive dish on what Rufus and Lily's love child really wants from our favorite Upper East Side adults...

Believe it or not, the joyous reunion scene is genuine! Sources tell us that the kiddos (Dan, Serena, Little J and Eric) learn about their half brother earlier in the season, but in episode five of Gossip Girl season three, Rufus and Lily finally meet their long-lost spawn, Scott, and he's up to nothing more nefarious than trying to find his birth parents. He's a good guy, after all! Awww...Scott's main arc is the first five episodes of the season, and he departs again after the big reunion, but more likely than not, the character will recur again for the remainder of the season.
