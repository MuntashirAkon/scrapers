Justice For Kim? Inside Zolciak’s Court Date In Holiday Decorator Lawsuit/n
Kim Zolciak and Kroy Biermann were Tardy for their court date, RadarOnline.com can exclusively reveal!
The reality stars were scheduled to appear in a Fulton County, Ga. magistrate court on July 31, but failed to show up!
“They cancelled the first mediation,” the owner of Seasonal Designs LLC told Radar. “I just got a notice that it is rescheduled for the 22nd.”
Seasonal Designs LLC filed a suit against Zolciak, 39, and Biermann, 31, in March after they failed to pay their $6,000 bill by February. The Fulton County Sheriff’s Office served Biermann in May – just days after their son Kash was attacked by a dog.

The couple filed paperwork to “dispute the total amount charged” in response.
The RHOA star was previously sued for failing to pay a party planner after Brielle Biermann’s 11th birthday, and Biermann was accused of stiffing one of their babysitters. They were both listed in a suit filed by their former housekeeper over unpaid wages as well.
