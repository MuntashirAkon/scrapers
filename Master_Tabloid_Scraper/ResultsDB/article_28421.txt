The well-known Philadelphia criminal lawyer will not represent Cosby, 80, during the upcoming retrial, which is scheduled to begin on November 6 in Norristown.

Cosby is now said to be desperately searching for a new attorney after McMonagle’s sudden registration, as Radar previously reported. According to a source, crazed Cosby has already contacted Michael Jackson’s former attorney Tom Meserau, as well as O.J. Simpson’s ex attorney Robert Shapiro and Lindsay Lohan’s former lawyer Shawn Chapman-Holley.
Sources told us Cosby was furious after McMonagle announced his withdrawal from the case.
“Brian cares, but he’s not going to continue to put his stellar reputation on the line if there’s no cooperation from his client and his client’s publicist,” a source said. The Cosby Show star even demanded everyone in his inner circle “shut up” and not speak to the press any longer.
