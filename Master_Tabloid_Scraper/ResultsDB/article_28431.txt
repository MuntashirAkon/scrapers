Kendall Jenner has beef with a bar in Brooklyn.

The 21-year-old model fired back at Baby’s All Alright after the Williamsburg hotspot publicly called her out for allegedly not leaving a tip on a $24 bill by sharing a signed receipt from on “Kendall N. Jenner” that purposefully left out gratuity for servers. Kendall responded to the accusation and wrote in a shady subtweet, “Damn, I guess next time we won’t tip in cash.”
The saga continued when the bar stood by its initial claim, writing on Instagram alongside a now-deleted screenshot of Kendall’s tweet, “‘I’m not upset that you lied to me, I’m upset that from now on I can’t believe you.’ -Nietzsche #nocashtip.”

Though Kendall may not be welcomed to the east coast establishment any longer, she’s certainly a VIP at Los Angeles’ hottest hangouts. After attending Kendrick Lamar’s sold out show at the Staples Center on Tuesday night, the reality star was seen partying it up with Blake Griffin and other A-listers at Avenue in Hollywood.
Let’s just hope someone tipped this time.
