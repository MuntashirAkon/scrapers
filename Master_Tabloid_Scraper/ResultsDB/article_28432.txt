Kylie Jenner is on her way to become a billionaire.

The 19-year-old — who founded her own makeup company, Kylie Cosmetics, in 2016 — has reportedly made over $400 million in sales since launching her hugely successful lip kit line. According to Kris Jenner, the beauty brand is well on its way to become a billion dollar company.
Via TMZ:
Since officially launching her famous Kylie Cosmetics lip kit line in 2016, inquiring minds wanted to know how well the brand was doing. Well, hold your horses because Mama Bear told Women’s Wear Daily the brand, in just 18 months, has done $420 million in retail sales.
Kris — in an interviewwith the website last week in her Hidden Hills crib — provided the figure and reportedly provided the site with documentation. The site reports Kylie’s line projects $386 million in sales in 2017 … putting it on track to become a billion dollar company by 2022.
