We’ll never let go!

Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, and Billy Zane had a Titanic reunion Wednesday night, partying together at a fundraising gala hosted by the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation in St. Tropez, France. The epic get-together happened so DiCaprio, 42, and Winslet, 41 — who has been friends since the release of 1997 movie — could auction off the chance for one lucky fan to have dinner with the two co-stars this fall.
Zane, who played the villainous Cal in the Oscar-winning drama, shared a photo of the trio posing together on his Instagram. “Gangs back together. Now we’re saving icebergs. Go figure.. @katewinsletofficial @leonardodicaprio @leonardodicapriofdn,” he joked.

“He’s a solid, loyal person,” Winslet told People of DiCaprio last year. “He’s a great friend, he always has been, and not just to me, but to everyone around him. He still has friends he had when we made Titanic.”
She added, “He’s quite centered and calm, and that’s different to the way he was 20 years ago.”
