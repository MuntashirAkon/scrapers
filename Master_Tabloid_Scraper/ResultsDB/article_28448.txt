The Mooch is loose on Weekend Update!
On Thursday’s debut edition of SNL’s Weekend Update: Summer Edition, SNL alum Bill Hader made a surprise appearance as Anthony Scaramucci, the recently hired, then, quickly fired White House communications director.
FaceTiming in during an unrelated segment, Hader as Scaramucci said, “When I hear my name three times, I appear like a Goombah Beetlejuice.”

FROM PEN: Melissa McCarthy’s Sean Spicer Impression Was the Week’s Finest Performance

Scaramucci was ousted 10 days into his tenure in the President Trump’s administration following his profanity-laced The New Yorker interview.
“Everybody loves the Mooch,” declared Hader. “I’m like human cocaine. You got a little bump of me, I made you feel excited, but I was out of your system too quick. And now that I’m gone, you’re all depressed and edgy and you’re trying to figure out how to score some more Scaramooch!”
