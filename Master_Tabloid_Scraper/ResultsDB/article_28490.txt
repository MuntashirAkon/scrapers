Hollywood’s newest couple — looking very matchy-matchy in similiar black leather jackets and black jeans — sat in the audience to cheer on the remaining four finalists and a spy tells us the pair were very affectionate, holding hands and kissing.
Afterwards, they attended the Prince concert at the The Troubadour in West Hollywood.
As RadarOnline.com previously reported, McDonald confirmed last month that he and Reed were indeed an item.

At that time, McDonald gushed about his new lady love, saying:  “She’s super cool, she’s super smart and a really cool girl. 
“I’m happy with it. We’ve been hanging out here and there, we’re both pretty busy, but it’s been fun so far.”
McDonald, a 26-year-old Nashville native, is still relatively new to the fame game, having made it into the top ten of American Idol before being eliminated in mid-April.
