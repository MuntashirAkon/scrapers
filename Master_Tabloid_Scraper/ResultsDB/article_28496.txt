Video: Nikki Reed Says Bryce Dallas Howard Is Great!/n
Taylor Lautner and Nikki Reed surprised some happy fans on Thursday by signing autographs while out and about, clearly having a good time being back in Vancouver. Newly buff Lautner took a second to talk about his non-vampire happenings, grinning from ear to ear when asked about working with Taylor Swift. 
“It was very nice,” he said of their time filming Garry Marshall’s Valentine’s Day. The two were spotted making out on set for a kissing scene.
Reed, who plays the vampire beauty Rosalie, isn’t holding a grudge against the newest addition to the movie, Bryce Dallas Howard, “She’s great,” she said, even adding the tidbit that she and Howard have already spent some quality time together. “Actually she’s my gym buddy.”  
The third installment in the Twilight series Eclipse has all the cast members working out to get in shape for the epic fight scenes that fans are eagerly anticipating.  Taylor said that production starts “NOW!”  so we’re waiting with baited breath for when Rob Pattinson and Kristen Stewart arrive.  The second movie New Moon will be in theaters November 20. /n
