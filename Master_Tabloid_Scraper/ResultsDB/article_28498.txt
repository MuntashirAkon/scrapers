Is Justin Bieber Under The Influence Of Weed Bad Friends?!/n

Roger Ebert may not particularly care if Justin Bieber is stoney bologna all day long, but obviously, there are many who very much do!
And given some of the hard-pAArtying shenanigans in which he's been involved over the past few weeks, friends and indivduals close to the pop sensation are apparently very concerned about his behavior…and have already singled out the cause of it as his new partner-in-crime: the rapper Lil' Twist!
According to sources close to the Biebs, his team of handlers has already noticed that the protege of Lil' Wayne has not only encouraged the excessive greenery indulgence we've all noticed lately, but also his under-age New Year's pAArtying in Mexico!
And as we all know, he was ALSO the one behind the wheel of his pal's speeding Ferrari that ultimately lead to the death of a paparazzo on the 405!
Insiders are claiming that the only way they think Justin will clean up his act is if these two make a clean break…and are apparently very fearful of what will happen if they cannot do so successfully!
Goodness gracious!  This all sounds alarmingly like that old Evan Rachel Wood/Rosalie-from-Twilight Thirteen movie, doesn't it?!
Regardless, they're both still young kids and experimenting with this sort of stuff is definitely just a part of growing up, but given some the recent tragic circumstances, we sincerely hope that they both can reflect on their behavior and encourage positive decision-making each other before things can even more out of their control!
We've seen how slippery this slope can get in no time at all, so nip the bullshiz in the bud, you two!
