Nikki Reed Is Versace’s Vampire!/n

And what a beautiful vampire she is!
Nikki Reed took one of her final strolls down the vampy black carpet Monday night for the El Lay premiere of Twilight: Breaking Dawn - Part 2.
Rosalie Hale wowed in a light gray Versace corset gown with flashy metallic detailing.
Strappy Giuseppe Zanotti heels kept the look very girly and elegant, as did her Judith Leiber clutch and Amrapali jewels. 
It’s the end of the saga, so why not pull out all the fashion stops, right?!
Miz Reed gets an A+ for this look!
