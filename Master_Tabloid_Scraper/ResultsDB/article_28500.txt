Twilight's Secret Ending Revealed! Star Spoils The Surprise!/n

Rosalie Nikki Reed has spilled the bloody beans! 
We WERE VERY curious about this "surprise ending" ever since Kellan Lutz's luscious lips let slip something about a bonus scene after Breaking Dawn - Part 2's credits.
Now, thanks to his loose lipped Twilight co-star we know the secret surprise ending is…  [SPOILER ALERT!]
…. all 150 cast members performing a choreographed dance number!!
Yep! Kristen Stewart, Robert Pattinson, Taylor Lautner and 147 of their Twilight co-stars will preform a dance number! 
Nikki blabbed:
“If it’s what I think it is, it’s really awesome. It was a surprise moment on set that was pretty incredible. That day, there were about 150 of us, and we all came together and surprised Bill [Condon], so I hope it's that thing.”
She also added: 
”It took a couple of practice runs [for us to learn it], and we had one drill sergeant who was in charge of gathering everyone. I got really into it. I was so into it that I wanted to be in the front row.”
Forks meets Bollywood! We LOVE this idea! 
One mystery still remains: what song do they dance too??
Will it be U2's Sunday, Bloody Sunday? Killing Me Softly by Lauryn Hill? Or perhaps T.I.'s Dead and Gone?
Guess we'll have to wait until Breaking Dawn is released in theaters this November to find out… that is, if Nikki doesn't spoil that surprise too! LOLz!
