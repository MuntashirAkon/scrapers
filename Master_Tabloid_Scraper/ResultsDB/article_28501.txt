Breaking Dawn 2 Trading Cards! Check Out The Cullens!!/n


Gotta catch 'em all, Pokemon Twilight vampers!
Feast you eyes upon the Comic-Con's latest gift to Twigh-Hards: Cullen Trading Cards! 
Each card features either Alice (Ashley Greene), Emmett (Kellan Lutz), Rosalie (Nikki Reed), Jasper (Jackson Rathbone), Carlisle (Peter Facinelli) OR Esme (Elizabeth Reaser). The WHOLE Cullen covenâ€¦ minus Edward, Bella and Renesmee (because they get enough attention already)! 
They all look fierce as hell!
If we were the Volturi, we'd be scared of dem Cullens! 
CANNOT WAIT FOR BREAKING DAWN PART 2!!/n
