Nikki Reed Doesn't Miss Wigging Out For Twilight/n

Just like her cast mate Taylor Lautner, Nikki Reed is glad her days of wearing a wig are over.
For the first Twilight flick Nikki, who plays a Rosalie Hale, had to dye her hair blonde which turned out to be a disaster.
She explained at last week's premiere:
"Most of my hair fell out, which is why they wigged me.  It’s hard on the hair.  I don’t miss being a blonde.  I do miss Rosalie."
We think she looks better as a brunette anyway.
