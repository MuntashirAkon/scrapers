We've got chills!!!
We imagine that most of you Twi-hards are having a hard time concentrating today. You're probably all antsy and spaced out, focused completely on the hands of your clock stroking midnight, so you can finally see for yourself all the wonders of The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part One. 
Well, we can't stand the wait either, so how's about we all enjoy these two new clips from the movie, featuring some real sweetness and some real action!
Check out the videos (above) to watch Rosalie and Alice prep Bella for her big day, and then, watch Edward and his siblings get into a real nasty scuffle with the werewolves over his newborn child.
At least, we think that's the problem. Edward's eyes are black and his shirt is all messy, so we're assuming this is after Bella has given birth and the pack has come to destroy the Cullens for creating a hybrid.
Wait till they find out what ELSE is, shall we say, unique with this baby! LOL!
