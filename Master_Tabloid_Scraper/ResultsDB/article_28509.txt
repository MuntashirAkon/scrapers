 Welcome to the world of social media Kristen Stewart! Or so we were hoping.
Earlier this morning (Jan. 22, 2015), someone posing as Kristen Stewart posted her first photo to Instagram with the caption: “Hello Instagram.”





 Hello Instagram

The account is under the name k.j. stewart, but at the time of writing this, the account had not been verified. As of 8:00 AM PST the account had close to 14,000 followers.
She’s following Ryan Seacrest, Dakota Fanning, Chloe Moretz, Naomi Campbell and some of her former Twilight cast members, Peter Fancinelli (who played Carlyle Cullen), Nikki Reed (Rosalie), Kellan Lutz (Emmet), Ashley Greene (Alice) and Jackson Rathbone (Jasper).
Gossip Cop has confirmed that the account is indeed a fake. We thought that it would be fun to analyze the photos posted as if this were Kristen Stewart’s official Instagram account.
