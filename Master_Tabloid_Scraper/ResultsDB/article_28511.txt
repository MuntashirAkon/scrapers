 The end of Twilight has been bittersweet for Nikki Reed.
Celebuzz spoke with the 24-year-old actress, who plays Rosalie in the popular vampire film franchise, at the The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part II VIP Comic-Con celebration in San Diego, Calif. on Wednesday, where she had mixed feelings about attending her final Comic-Con with her Twilight family.
“It is bittersweet. I think we’ve all been putting it off for a long time [the movie coming to and end] and we’ve been hearing that [since] we shot the last movie,” she said. “This November will be the last premiere, and I think we’re all kind of sad.”
When it comes to seeing her co-stars Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson playing on-screen parents, her mood changed:

She gushed:
“I think it’s great. We’ve all been so excited to see our characters unfold and I think we all feel just as invested in our characters as we do in all the other characters. I think it was just really great to see all of it brought to life.”
