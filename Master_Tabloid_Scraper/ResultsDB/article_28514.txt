Nikki Reed was a vision in green-and-gold at Los Angeles’ Breaking Dawn premiere on Monday night.
Sporting a one-shoulder, floor-length gown, Nikki looked like a Grecian goddess as she smiled for photographers. The brunette beauty was spotted signing autographs and taking photos with fans as she made her way down the red carpet.
Nikki, who will reprise her role of Rosalie Hale in the film, recently debuted a song she penned for Breaking Dawn. With the melodies written by hubby Paul McDonald, the song is featured in the movie’s soundtrack. Check it out HERE!
