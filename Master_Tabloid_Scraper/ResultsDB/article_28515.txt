Who is ‘Winter’s Bone’ Star Jennifer Lawrence?/n
So who exactly is this 20-year-old actress named Jennifer Lawrence who’s already swiping up accolades for the lead role in the independent film Winter’s Bone?
She’s a young lady with just a few major actings jobs to her credit, who broke through as a main cast member on The Bill Engvall Show at age 16. In 2008, she debuted on the big screen for Guillermo Arriaga’s The Burning Plain alongside Oscar winners Kim Basinger and Charlize Theron. That gig earned her the Marcello Mastroianni Award for best emerging actor or actress.
Lawrence also auditioned to be either Bella Swan or Rosalie Hale for The Twilight Saga, but she wasn’t selected. Mel Gibson’s The Beaver presently resides on the shelf, but she’s in that too as the girlfriend of Mel’s son (played by Anton Yelchin). Audiences will get to see her shapeshift as the villain Mystique when Fox’s reboot of their mutant series, X-Men: First Class, hits theaters on June 3, 2011.
But currently, the fuss is all about Winter’s Bone, a grim tale of a girl (played by Lawrence) who must locate her drug-dealing father in order to hold her family together.
Watch the trailer here:





Since its release at the Sundance Film Festival on January 21, 2010, Lawrence has racked up a slew of breakthrough artist awards (Hollywood Film Festival, Palm Springs International Film Festival and the National Board of Review), best actress nominations (Independent Spirit Awards, Satellite Awards) and a best actress win from the Seattle International Film Festival. The film itself, which she carries, has also gotten numerous awards and nominations across the board for best film, best director (Debra Granik) and best adapted screenplay.
