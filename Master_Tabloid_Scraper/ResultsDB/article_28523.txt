Nikki Reed Goes Blonde/n

MEKA/INF; Patron/Broadimage

Breakover alert? A few days after filing for divorce from husband of two years Paul McDonald, actress Nikki Reed stepped out in West Hollywood, Calif. debuting a much-blonder look. But don’t add her to the “best breakovers ever” gallery just yet — the new hairdo is for a role in her upcoming film The Sunday Horse.

“Finishing touches. Less than a week away from filming #TheSundayHorse,” Reed captioned the below pic of her newly-tinted tresses on WhoSay. She snapped the photo from a seat in the Andy LeCompte salon (sound familiar? The hair color gurus are responsible for Nicole Richie’s recent purple transformation as well). The PEOPLE StyleWatch Celebrity Style Council member accented her lighter locks with a chic look of striped tee, blazer, jeans and red heels.

Her new locks are on the ombré side of blonde — much lighter than her standard chestnut color, but not quite Rosalie-in-Twilight blonde, which is probably for the best. After dyeing her hair for the first film, it began to fall out, leaving Reed to resort to wigs for the rest of the movies. Check out more photos of her newly-dyed hair in action:

What do you think of Reed’s new do? Would you like to see her even blonder?
