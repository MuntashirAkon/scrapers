A day prior, Messer offered a clue about her daughter’s medical condition.
“Ali wants to cancel her sleep test study and be the audio gal,” she joked in a photo of the little girl playing with filming equipment, likely related to the MTV reality show. “What do you guys think?”

As Radar has extensively reported, Ali often relies on a wheelchair to get around. She often falls down while walking, and struggles to keep up with twin Aleeah “Gracie” and little sister Addie, 4.
Last season, Messer and Ali’s father, ex-husband Corey Simms, 27, discovered she had dropped weight after refusing to eat.
