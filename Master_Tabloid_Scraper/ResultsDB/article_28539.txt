Fears For Leah's Girl Gracie! Teen Mom's Daughter Gets Genetic Testing Results/n
On the last episode of Teen Mom 2, Leah Messer and ex-husband Corey Simms were terrified when their daughter Aleeah Grace underwent genetic testing to discover if she could suffer from special needs like her twin sister.
While onscreen the co-parenting exes are awaiting some potentially scary answers, in real time, Messer, 24, and Simms, 27, have already received the results.
Fortunately, the 7-year-old, known as Gracie, does not have the gene for muscular dystrophy, RadarOnline.com can exclusively reveal.
“Gracie is fine,” a source close to the little girl’s father told Radar. “She’s doing great.”
Meanwhile, her twin, who suffers from a rare form of the degenerative disease, is still walking years after doctors feared she would need a wheelchair by kindergarten.
“Ali isn’t in her chair full time,” the source continued. “She only uses it as needed.”
In other good news, the girls’ parents are still getting along after years of vicious feuding. (Simms even accused Messer of doing drugs in 2015.)
‘Everything is running smoothly,” the insider summed up. “Corey couldn’t be happier with their arrangement.”
