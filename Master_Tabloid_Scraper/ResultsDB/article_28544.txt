 Monster Mom? Leah Messer Spanks Daughter Aleeah Grace For Throwing A Temper Tantrum –.../n
With three children to take care of and ex-husband drama, Leah Messer has more than enough to deal with. But in a new sneak peek of Teen Mom 2, the 23-year-old loses it altogether .
When her older twin daughters return from a weekend at their dad’s (Corey Simms) house, tensions – and tantrums – run high.
“I just feel stressed out now,” Leah tells her friend. “I forgot today’s the first day they’ve been back. Maybe it’s the transition from his house to my house. Ali does good, it’s more Gracie.”

Soon after, Aleeah Grace sets off in a screaming fit.
“Gracie! Get that right now,” Leah shouts. “I’m not playing. You’re going to pick that up! You’re not going to act like this in front of people.”
As she leads her daughter to another room, Leah continues: “Do you understand? I’ve had enough. I don’t know why you’re acting like this.”
