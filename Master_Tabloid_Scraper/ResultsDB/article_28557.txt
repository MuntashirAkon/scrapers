Gorgeously Gowned Gracie Girls/n
It was a swanky evening at the 35th Annual Gracie Awards Gala in Beverly Hills on Tuesday night, where the hottest television stars (and Jessica Simpson) stepped out in graciously glam fashion. Jessica fabulously flaunted her curves in a navy blue, one-shoulder gown, having a much better fashion day than her Victoria Beckham faux pas on Monday night! Pairing the embellished dress with a nude, box clutch, chunky bangles, pave diamond leaf-shaped earrings and a cocktail ring, the blonde babe was in high style.

Kelly Rutherford stunned in an impeccably designed, high-necked black gown, which featured an asymmetrical back. Adding stunning gold and bejeweled necklaces and a sapphire blue clutch, the Gossip mom looked flawless.

AnnaLynne McCord looked sophisticated in an ivory halter gown, which featured a tiered skirt and form-fitting bodice, though we weren’t crazy about her slicked bad hairdo! Her costar Shenae Grimes looked beyond babelicious in a lowcut, black gown, which featured a gold, embellished belt.
