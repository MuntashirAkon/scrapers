Chris Cornell Music Soars on iTunes Charts and Amazon After Death/nChris Cornell's music is spiking in sales on iTunes and Amazon. The leap was, of course, expected after his death -- but it's interesting to see what fans are connecting with most. The 20th anniversary reissue of Soundgarden's  "Superunknown " is the #1 album on iTunes -- and his other band, Audioslave, has the #2 spot. His recordings are scattered all over Amazon's  "Movers & Shakers " chart as well. In an odd coincidence ... some rare Cornell recordings will be out Friday when a deluxe reissue of the  "Singles " soundtrack is released. It will include previously unreleased songs Chris wrote for the film's score./n
