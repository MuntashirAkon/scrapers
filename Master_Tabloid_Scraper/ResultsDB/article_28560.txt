Ryan Lochte Is Off The Hook For Lying About Rio Robbery!/n

Ryan Lochte can breathe a sigh of reliefâ€¦
As we reported, during the Rio Olympics last summer, the swimmer lied to authorities when he said he was robbed at gunpoint by men pretending to be cops. In actuality, the "robbers" were gas station security guards who stopped Lochte and teammates Gunnar Bentz, Jack Conger, and Jimmy Feigen for vandalizing property.

The gold medalist was charged with falsely reporting a crime.
Fast forward to Friday, the 32-year-old has been cleared of all charges.
According to the judge, Lochte told the fabricated story AFTER cops approached him for questioning. Thus, he never set out to lie.
Since the incident, the athlete got engaged to model Kayla Rae Reid in October 2016, and they had their first child Caiden Zane Lochte in June of this year.
