Single Mother Sweetly Dressed As 'Dad' For Father-Daughter Dance — But The School Turned Them Away!/n

Being a single parent is hard.
But Amy Peterson wouldn't let the fact that she's a single mother prevent her daughter Gracie from attending her school's annual father-daughter dance.
The Georgia resident knew the bouncers at the Locust Grove Elementary school event wouldn't let her inside the dance since she wasn't a man.

So Peterson got creative, dressing up like a dad to escort her 6-year-old daughter!
Amy rocked a mascara beard, baggy clothes, a bow tie, and a dress hat to complete her paternal alter ego — but school leaders still turned the duo away because Amy wasn't a man.
Peterson said she and Gracie were devastated they weren't allowed to go, telling WXIA: 

"I was trying to comply with the rules. I knew if I showed up as her mom, they probably wouldn't have let me in."
A school spokesperson claimed officials contacted Peterson hours before the dance to warn her they would be turned away, explaining:

"An hour before the school principal called, saying she caught rumor that her (Gracie's) mother was bringing her and she forbid us to come, and if we showed up we would be turned away."
The school apologized and offered a refund, which Peterson says doesn't make up for Gracie's disappointment for not being allowed into the dance.

She added:

"[Gracie] screamed, ‘No, why? Why do I have to be the one missing a dad.' She was just excited that we were doing this together."
Peterson is now calling for changes to the way this kind of dance is handled, and is willing "to fight tooth and nail to make sure this doesn't happen to another child."
Our hearts are breaking over this!
The tradition of a father-daughter dance is cute, but is it worth being so strict if you're ostracizing children of single parents in the process??
