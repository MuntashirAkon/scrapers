Faith Hill captured a really cute mother-daughter moment, proving both she and daughter Maggie, 18, can carpool karaoke with the best of them, especially if it’s a Taylor Swift song.
The country singer posted a video on Instagram of her singing “Bad Blood” with Maggie as they were driving to drop Maggie off at college. Hill captioned it, “Day 1: #BadBlood singalong w/ Maggie on the way to college! @taylorswift.”

Clearly, Maggie thinks her mom is too cute and check out all her college stuff in the back!
Hill and husband Tim McGraw haven’t disclosed which college Maggie is attending, but McGraw told a magazine recently that Maggie will be studying marine biology.
