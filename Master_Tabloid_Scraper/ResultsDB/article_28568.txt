Sneaky, sneaky Usher Raymond IV.

“U Got It Bad” if you dreamed of getting with Usher because he’s officially off the market. He reveals to Ellen DeGeneres on (Friday, Dec. 4, 2015) that he definitely wed his fiancée Grace Miguel after he was spotted wearing a wedding ring back in September. The couple tied the vows quietly while on a visit to Cuba.
Usher explains the Instagram photo that caused all of the clamor:
“You know what’s funny? We put this picture up and we were actually just in Cuba on a cultural exchange and people were like, ‘Hey, they got married.’ But you know, the ring is on the other finger, you guys.”
