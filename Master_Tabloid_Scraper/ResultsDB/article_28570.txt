Join the crowd, Tim.
Tim McGraw’s Wildest Dreams include seeing Taylor Swift’s 1989 World Tour. The musician stopped by to chat with E! News about the fellow country star, and surprisingly he hasn’t joined her onstage since her 2013 tour rolled through town.
“I sang with her onstage a few years ago when she came through Nashville, but we’ve been missing each other all year,” he said.

“We want to see her show— I want to see her show, my wife [Faith Hill] wants to see her show. It’s running out of time— we gotta go check it out. We’re big fans of her at our house,” McGraw said. He has daughters Gracie, 18, Maggie, 17, and Audrey, 13, at home.
Actually, we’re kinda surprised the 48-year-old hasn’t joined Taylor at some point during her 1989 World Tour, because it seems like everybody else in the music industry has already. Last night (Oct. 21) Miranda Lambert joined T. Swift onstage to perform “Little Red Wagon” while in Greensboro, N.C. and other guests over the past few months have included Nelly, The Weeknd, Lorde, Julia Roberts, Mick Jagger and many more.
