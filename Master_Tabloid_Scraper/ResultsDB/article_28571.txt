Sorry, Usher is officially off the market!

The “I Don’t Mind” crooner has secretly wed longtime girlfriend Grace Miguel, Us Weekly reports. According to the publication, the couple, who’ve been together since 2009, eloped and jetted off to Havana, Cuba for their honeymoon over Labor Day weekend.
One source tells the magazine that Usher, 36, and Miguel originally planned to marry in front of 100 guests in Atlanta, Ga., but decided have their own secret nuptials instead.
A golden band was spotted on Usher’s wedding ring finger in an photo shared on Miguel’s Instagram earlier this month.

Usher has two sons — Naviyd Ely, 6, and Usher Raymond V, 7, — with his ex-wife Tameka Foster.
