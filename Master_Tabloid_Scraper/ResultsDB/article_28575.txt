 She may be back together with boyfriend Justin Bieber, but Selena Gomez is still making time for her family, especially her new baby sister, Gracie. The “Come & Get It” singer recently posted an adorable photo of the 9-month-old lying on Selena’s chest and looking at the camera.With her chubby cheeks and big eyes, little Gracie could follow in her big sister’s footsteps and be the next Disney star. Selena, 21, whose mom Mandy Teefy gave birth to Gracie back in June, shared this image with her Instagram followers on Wednesday:

Selena captioned the photo: “Sissy”
And despite her relationship with the Biebs reportedly back on, Hollywoodlife.com claims the brunette beauty is playing it cool this time around. The web site’s source says, “Justin wants Selena to be with him 24/7 right now but she’s playing hard to get and it’s really driving him wild. The power has shifted in their relationship — he’s the one doing the chasing right now.”
