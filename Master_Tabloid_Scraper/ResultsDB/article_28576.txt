Caption Contest Field Trip: We’re Riding Roller Coasters With Beyoncé and Her New Weave!/n
She sings. She dances. She acts. She cuts her hair. She rides roller coasters. She does everything. She is Beyoncé. She has never, to my knowledge, submitted a caption for one of our caption contests, though. What’s the deal, Bey? You do everything, and yet you’ve never bothered to submit a caption? Rude. Well, whatever. I doubt you could top today’s winning captions, anyway. Read ‘em after the jump.

“need to smile for the pic, and I pray my wig and glasses don’t fail me” – Graciela
“i hope she didn’t seriously expect those glasses to stay on her face..” – Stephanie
“if I were a boy” I would cut all my hair off for attention and then go buy some more” – April
“I hope her weave is properly attached…” – Rafi
Congrats to our winners! Visit our Facebook page for a new Caption Contest each and every weekday.
