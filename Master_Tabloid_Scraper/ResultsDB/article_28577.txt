Selena Gomez On Babysitting Her Newborn Sister: ‘I’m Not Very Helpful’/n
When it comes to changing dirty diapers, Selena Gomez doesn’t want to “Come & Get It.”
The songstress, who’s album Stars Dance is sitting pretty at No.1 spot this week — admits she’s not such a good babysitter when it comes to cleaning up her newborn sister, Gracie Elliot Teefey. She tells Jimmy Kimmel on his late night talk show Thursday night:
“I’m the babysitter that likes to cuddle and I’ll feed her and sleep with her. But the moment anything thing happens, you know, down there or she throws up I’m like, ‘Here you go, mom. Thank you’ and kind of walk out.”
She continues, “I’m not very helpful but she’s so cute!”
Despite her lack of enthusiasm for baby spit, the former Disney starlet says she did show off her responsible side at her 21st birthday last month, asking friends to donate to UNICEF as opposed to giving presents.
“They gave me cards [too] but I received a lot of alcohol for gifts,” she adds with a smirk.
Well, maybe she’s up for more shots of Jack then.
