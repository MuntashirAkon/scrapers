Tim McGraw Performs a New Song with 18-Year-Old Daughter Gracie/n

His “little girl” is all grown up!  
Tim McGraw brought his eldest daughter, Gracie, 18, onstage to join him for a duet Saturday night at the Bridgestone Arena in Nashville.  
The father-daughter duo performed a new track, “Here Tonight,” The Tennessean reports.  
And Gracie wasn’t the only family member to get in on the onstage action: McGraw’s wife of 18 years, Faith Hill, lent her vocals on his hit “Shotgun Rider,” which was celebrated with a No. 1 party prior to the show.  
This is just the latest public appearance this year for Gracie: In April, she, Mom and her sisters – Maggie, 17, and Audrey, 13 – attended the Time 100 Gala, where McGraw was honored.  
“You never feel like you are doing everything right as a parent,” McGraw previously told PEOPLE. “Especially when you have daughters. I dread the first broken heart!”
