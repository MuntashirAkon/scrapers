Teen Asks Gracie Gold to Prom in Adorable Viral Video/n
This is certainly one way of “going for the gold.”  
A California teen has attained Internet fame for a video in which he asks Team USA ice skater Gracie Gold to his school’s prom. 
Dyer Pettijohn, a high schooler from Malibu, Calif., created a “video proposal” inviting Gold to his May 16 prom. “Watching you skate has made me realize how perfect we are for each other,” Pettijohn says.  
“You’re gorgeous, my mom thinks I’m pretty,” Pettijohn continues. “We’re both blond, five-foot-something and graceful on the ice,” he adds, before taking a series of tumbles on an ice rink.  
Gold responded Monday, Tweeting that Pettijohn’s video “melted her heart.”   


This melted my heart ❤️😍 http://t.co/Y0mDDQiFmB
