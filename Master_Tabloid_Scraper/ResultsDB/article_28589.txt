Looks like Selena Gomez loves being a big sister! E! News has exclusively obtained the first photos of the singer and her new baby sister, Gracie Elliott, and they're even more aborable than you could imagine.The pop star's mother, Mandy Cornett, along with Cornett's husband Brian Teefey visited Selena at work in Malibu while the brunette beauty was on her lunch break for a shoot for her Dream Out Loud clothing line.According to an eyewitness, Selena "ran out of the studio door as fast as she could when she realized her mother brought the baby...She was so excited to be a big sister."

We can tell! And it looks like her motherly instincts have already kicked in. "Even though the baby didn't realize what was going on, Selena was making faces, waving her hands…Her mom Mandy looked great and happy" the insider adds. The brunette beauty smiled and laughed as she held the little one close. She didn't feed the baby during her break (let's leave that to mom!), but she enjoyed snapping pics with her sister. "Selena loved taking selfies of her and the baby," the eyewitness said. "After each shot she showed her mom...she got the photo she wanted on the third try."

And of course, the doting sibling made sure to give her sis a kiss goodbye before she headed back to work. Cornett welcomed her first child with Teefey just nine days ago. Little Gracie is Selena's first sibling. "Momma, Brian, and me are all so grateful for all your well wishes," the "Come and Get It" singer tweeted after the baby's arrival. "My lil sissy Gracie Elliot Teefey was born on June 12th. Luv you all XO."
