EXCLUSIVE! Selena Gomez Talks First World Tour, Making Movies & Baby Sister Gracie: "I'm Obsessed With Her"/n
Selena Gomez really likes this big sister gig.The singing super star paid a visit to the Verizon Wireless innovative Verizon Destination store alongside COO Marni Walden at the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minn., and during her stop, took some time to chat with E! News about her baby sister Gracie."Gracie is five months old, she's adorable," Gomez told us. "I'm obsessed with her and becoming a big sister…I know I've had the responsibility to be a role model for girls but, when you have a little sister of your own, you kinda think, 'OK, this is legit.'"

Unfortunately, the brunette babe doesn't get to spend as much time as she'd like with her little partner-in-crime.Gomez kicked off her Stars Dance Tour in Vancouver, Canada, back in August, and will be entertaining fans in 56 cities all over the world, something she has yet to do in her career."It's my first world tour, so actually being able to experience these places while I'm there alone, all by myself, it's great. I feel like a big girl," she tells us, and mentions that once the tour is done, she's going to focus on her other great talent—acting."I'm gonna take some time for myself and get back into movies," Gomez says.
