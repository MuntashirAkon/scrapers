Welcome to Catalina Island! It's been waiting for ya, Taylor Swift !Just when you thought the "Shake It Off" singer was spending less time with her celebrity BFFs, the blonde beauty pulled off the ultimate day trip as she headed to the California island Friday for a fun-filled afternoon."Wandering around Catalina with my favorite people to wander around with," she captioned on Instagram. "@LordeMusic @GracieGold95 @HaimtheBand @Jaime_King"And if you think this was a "Ladies Only Trip," you're surely mistaken. In addition to Hollywood director Kyle Newman joining in on the fun, it turns out Swift's dad couldn't pass on the trip.

"Scott Swift, the newest member of @haimtheband," T-Swift shared on Instagram while dad walked in the park with some of his daughter's closest friends.While most details of the trip remain a secret, we can tell you the group enjoyed shopping, ice cream and some fabulous weather for the winter.  Unfortunately, the trip wasn't able to last too long as Lorde is expected to attend Sunday's Golden Globes where she is nominated for best original song for "Yellow Flicker Beat," her new track from The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part 1.Wonder who she will befriend from Hollywood on Sunday night?
