The ladies from Team USA's figure skating team are leaving Sochi with no regrets about their performances."I'm feeling wonderful," 18-year-old Gracie Gold said about her first Winter Olympics on Today. "To walk away with a bronze medal at the beginning of the games and to place fourth in my first Olympics, I'm on cloud nine."Ashley Wagner, who finished in seventh place and won a bronze medal during the team competition, shared the same sentiments as her teammate."I'm coming home with three clean programs," the 22-year-old told Savannah Guthrie. "My head is held high, I'm so proud of what I accomplished here."

15-year-old Polina Edmunds, who finished in ninth place, said it was a "great experience all together.""I was really excited to compete on the Olympics ice and I was really proud of myself for skating two clean programs," Edmunds said.Wagner was outspoken about the somewhat controversial scoring following the competition, saying that the judging was "too hard to understand.""I think that the ladies in the top three, absolutely hands down, belong in the top three, I don't even question that," Wagner clarified. "I think we need to get rid of the anonymous judging," Wagner added.

As for the 2018 games in South Korea, all three ladies are eyeing their return to Olympics ice."Absolutely. I'm looking to make the podium in 2018," Gold said, as the crowd cheered."As soon as I stepped foot here, I was sold for four more years,"Â Wagner added. "I'm ready to go and fight for what I like to think is mine,"Don't forget: E! is broadcasting from Sochi!
