Royce Gracie Taps Out of Marriage/nUFC Hall of Famer Royce Gracie -- one of the greatest MMA fighters of all time -- is pulling the plug on his 22 year marriage ... TMZ Sports has learned. Gracie filed divorce docs in L.A. County Superior Court seeking to end his marriage to Marianne Cuttic.  The two were married back in 1994 and have 4 children together -- 3 of them are under the age of 18.  In the docs, 49-year-old Gracie cites irreconcilable differences for the split -- but the most interesting part ... he's the one demanding spousal support. He also wants her to pay his attorneys fees.  Shocking, considering Gracie is one of the most famous MMA fighters ever -- and just fought Ken Shamrock at Bellator 149 back in February.  Marianne is a podiatrist in Los Angeles.  Royce is requesting joint physical and legal custody of their minor kids.  According to multiple reports, Gracie and his wife have been battling with the I.R.S. -- which has accused them of owing more than $1 million in back taxes. /n
