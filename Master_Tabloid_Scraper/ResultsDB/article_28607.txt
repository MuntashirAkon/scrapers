Kurt Angle: Considering MMA Fight ... Name Drops Kimbo Slice/nKurt Angle could lay a real life smackdown on a real life fighter ... 'cause the wrestling legend says he's considering doing a real MMA fight -- and named Kimbo Slice as a possible opponent.  Angle -- who's been doing commentary for Bellator -- recently appeared on  "The Roman Show " and was asked if he'd ever step out from behind the media desk ... and into the ring. Angle says there's a VERY SMALL chance he agrees to a fight -- since he's 47 years old now -- but if it does happen, he's already thought about who he wants to fight.  "Of course, I'm not going to fight a guy in their prime, " Angle said ...  "It's obviously gonna be one of the older guys. But if it does come to fruition, it'll be a helluva fight, whether its Kimbo Slice, Ken Shamrock, Dan Severn ... or even Royce Gracie. " He added,  "If I do decide [to fight], it'll be with a Hall of Famer ... it won't be someone in their prime in their early 30s, no way, not now. " Fingers crossed! /n
