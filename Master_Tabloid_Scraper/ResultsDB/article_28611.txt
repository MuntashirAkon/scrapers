Betty White -- Early Bird Birthday Special/nBetty White is celebrating her birthday this week with a raucous birthday party at one of the fanciest restaurants in NYC -- and the whole thing kicks off ... at 6:00 PM. Say goodnight, Gracie!TV Land and the cast of  "Hot in Cleveland " are throwing the soiree in Betty's honor Tuesday night (her actual birthday is Monday) at Le Cirque in Manhattan. TMZ snuck a peak at the menu for the evening -- which includes pigs in a blanket, mini crab cakes, and a shrimp display. Broiled chicken and Salisbury steak did not make the cut./n
