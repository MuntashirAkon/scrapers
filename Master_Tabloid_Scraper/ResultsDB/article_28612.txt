The Devil and Grace Jones/nSinger /actress and all around freak Grace Jones showed up to an art opening in London on Thursday looking like something a demented cat dragged in.Sporting many layers of dark clothes, a hat that appears to be a cross between a beret and a dish rag, and her signature possessed facial expressions, the former Bond girl proved there's never a dull moment when Ms. Jones is in the house.Normally we wouldn't condone this kind of behavior, but Jones' brand of insanity is secretly fabulous, so we say keep up the good work Gracie!
