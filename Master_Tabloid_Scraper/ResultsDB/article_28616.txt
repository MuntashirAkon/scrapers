Jiu Jitsu Master Rodrigo Gracie -- PROTECT ME ... From 5'3" Woman/nJui Jitsu master Rodrigo Gracie -- a member of the legendary Gracie MMA fighting family -- is begging the court for protection against an allegedly drunk and violent enemy ... TMZ has learned. In one corner ... 6'0 ", 185-pound Gracie -- a 5th degree black belt and 4-time Pride fighting winner. In the other corner ... 5'3 ", 135-pound woman named Tiffany -- who lives in an apartment above Gracie's Brazilian Jiu Jitsu studio in Torrance, CA. Rodrigo filed a request for a restraining order against Tiffany last month, claiming she's been terrorizing his training center: "[Tiffany has been] cursing, yelling, hitting my door, hitting the glass ... knocked a hole in my door ... comes drunk every time. "The judge sided with Rodrigo ... at least for now ... granting a temporary restraining order against Tiffany, requiring her to stop pestering Rodrigo and his studio. The case is due back in court later this month -- when Rodrigo will likely ask the court for more permanent protection from his allegedly pain-in-the-ass neighbor. Attempts to reach Tiffany were unsuccessful./n
