'He's DOMINATING Community Service' /nJon Jones is CRUSHING his court-ordered community service -- TMZ Sports has learned he's made a sizable dent in his required 72 appearances to speak to kids groups ... with high praise from the orgs.   As part of his plea deal in his hit-and-run case in New Mexico last month, Jones was ordered to make 72 appearances with kids groups to educate children about making good decisions in life.  We've learned Jones hit up 5 different places on Thursday -- to rave reviews from the people who run the groups.  One of the places he went was Sandia Prep School -- where he spoke with the kids about how he almost lost his career over a few bad choices.  We spoke with the coach, who tells us,  "His message to my team was simply awesome. His whole demeanor was great. "  "These are young men, 8th grade to seniors in high school who really look up to him and I think they learned from this and appreciated Jon’s visit. I appreciated it. " Jones also swung by Gracie Barra New Mexico Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu --where instructor Don Ortega tells us Jon was equally candid with his students.   "He talked about losing a lot of wrestling matches but setting hit goals high and working hard to achieve them. " We reached out to Jon's camp for comment -- so far, no word back./n
