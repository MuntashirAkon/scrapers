Shocking New Details! Hunter Biden's Ex Claims He Blew His Family's Money On Drugs, Prostitutes, & Strip Clubs!/n

Grab the popcorn! The Biden family soap opera is only getting JUICIER!
As we reported, the media was shocked when it was revealed that Hunter Biden is now dating brother Beau's widow, Hallie Biden, while he is still working out his separation with wife Kathleen.
On top of that messy love triangle (or square??), it was revealed that prior to their split, Kathleen kicked Hunter out of the house on July 5, 2015 "due to his conduct the night before."

But what exactly did he do?? He was (allegedly) a VERY naughty boy!
On February 23, 2017 — a week before the public found out about Hunter and Hallie's romance — Kathleen filed a new motion in court claiming her ex has "created financial concerns for the family by spending extravagantly on his own interests" during their split. Allegedly, he spent $122,179 of their marital income in "less than two months."
These interests include "drugs, alcohol, prostitutes, strip clubs, and gifts for women with whom he has sexual relations." WTF?? 
Because of these expenses, Kathleen says the family has maxed out all of their credit cards, and has accumulated a tax debt of at least $313,970.
To add insult to injury, she says Joe Biden's son tried to reduce her spousal support by nearly $10,000!
According to the docs, Kathleen now wants $20,000 a month, while he only gets $5,000.
In response, Hunter's attorney said:

"Hunter and Kathleen have been separated for some time and are in the process of finalizing a divorce. Hunter loves and admires Kathleen as a person, a mother, and a friend. He hopes their privacy can be respected at this time."
Forget about the Kardashians! The Bidens are the next tabloid family!
