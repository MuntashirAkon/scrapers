Beau Biden's Widow Is Now Dating Joe Biden's OTHER Son Hunter!/n

This is like something out of a telenovela! Los Bidens Di Amore…
Hallie Biden, the widow of Joe Biden's deceased son Beau, is now dating Joe's other son Hunter!
As you know, Beau died from brain cancer in 2015, at the tragically young age of 46. Five months later, his brother Hunter separated from wife Kathleen Biden — with whom he has three children, btw.

Somewhere amid all of that family drama, Hallie and Hunter found new love together!
Hunter confirmed the relationship to Page Six, saying: 

"Hallie and I are incredibly lucky to have found the love and support we have for each other in such a difficult time, and that's been obvious to the people who love us most. We've been so lucky to have family and friends who have supported us every step of the way."
How does the former Vice President feel about this turn of events?
He and his wife Jill Biden are being remarkably supportive through it all! Joe said:

"We are all lucky that Hunter and Hallie found each other as they were putting their lives together again after such sadness. They have mine and Jill's full and complete support and we are happy for them."
Wow!
In case this couldn't get any more complicated, Hallie also has two children by Beau — named Natalie and Hunter.
We guess the heart wants what it wants?
