 Disney Channel’s A.N.T. Farm star China Anne McClain and her talented sisters Sierra McClain and Lauryn McClain AKA pop group the McClain Sisters, stage a Radio Disney Take Over airing Friday, September 7.
The McClain Sisters are staging the Take Over and premiering their new single, “Great Divide.” And they may have thought they were in control…
But, Radio Disney had a surprise for China Anne. And Celebuzz has an exclusive first look at the moment.
What was China Anne in for?
It’s the star’s 14th birthday this Saturday, Aug. 25, and she was in for a treat. Radio Disney’s Hallie Ashford dropped off an early birthday surprise for the star – an assortment of cupcakes with a lit candle. Sweet!
