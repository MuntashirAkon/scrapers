 Before all the arrests and jail time, Lindsay Lohan was the adorable redhead who won us over playing a duel role of identical twins Hallie and Annie in the 1998 remake of The Parent Trap. The role won Lohan a Young Artist Award for best performance in a feature film — as well as a three-film contract with Disney.
Although we really can’t imagine anyone else in the role now, there is one Hollywood actress who is still upset about not being cast. Can you guess which actress almost landed the role? Hint: She’s pretty Shameless.

Emmy Rossum!

Reflecting on all her auditions, the 25-year-old brunette revealed to Celebuzz that she’d give anything to go back in time to nail her Parent Trap audition.
“I was 12, but I really wanted the role,” she revealed.
Does Emmy have any hard feelings?
“Not at all. Lindsay beat me out of the role… I’m having the time of my life and currently working on Shameless,” she added. Sounds like everything worked out after all.
