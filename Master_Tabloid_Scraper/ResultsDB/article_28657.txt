Meet Alice.
Reese Witherspoon‘s character is going through a bit of a mid-life crisis in her upcoming film Home Again — and PEOPLE has the exclusive debut of the first official teaser trailer.
In it, Alice Kinney (Witherspoon) decides to move back to her hometown of Los Angeles with her two young daughters after separating from her husband (Michael Sheen).
“Alice is a newly separated loser,” Witherspoon’s character says in the trailer while typing on a computer.

But while out celebrating her 40th birthday (which her character deems as her “own personal New Years Eve”), Alice has a chance encounter with three aspiring filmmakers in need of a place to stay. When she offers them the use of her guest house, the guys accept and a new, unconventional family is formed.

And naturally, romance begins to develop in some unexpected ways.

“I’m not in love with her,” says one of the young filmmakers. “I just love a lot of things about her like her face and her personality.”
Witherspoon teamed up with a first-time female director for the project. Home Again was written and directed by a newcomer with an impressive pedigree, Hallie Meyers-Shyer. Her mom, Nancy Meyers, is the director behind hits like Something’s Gotta Give and It’s Complicated, as well as the writer of Private Benjamin.
Home Again hits theaters Sept. 8.
