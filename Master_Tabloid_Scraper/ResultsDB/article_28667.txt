The world has sadly lost another star. Ann Morgan Guilbert, the character actress synonymous with beloved sitcoms like The Dick Van Dyke Show and The Nanny, died Tuesday after battling cancer. Her daughter Nora Eckstein confirmed her death, as reported by Variety (via AP). The longtime actress was 87 years old. A Minnesota native, she left her hometown and headed for California to study theater and begin working as a performer. By the time she was in her early 30s, Gilbert had scored the role of Millie Helper, the signature next door neighbor on The Dick Van Dyke Show. In addition to subsequent guest roles on shows like I Dream of Jeannie, The Partridge Family and Cheers, she got another turn in sitcoms in the 1990s with The Nanny alongside Fran Drescher. She would star on the Emmy-nominated show for six years. Her co-star took to Twitter late Wednesday to honor her longtime colleague. "Such a great actress!" Drescher wrote. "I thank you Annie. Thank you for all the laughs! May you be cracking them up in heaven!"
