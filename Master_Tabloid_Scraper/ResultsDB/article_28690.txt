Matt Lauer Walked Out On His Long-Suffering Wife! Inside Their Epic Fight/n
Matt Lauer continues to make news for all the wrong reasons. But his latest drama, RadarOnline.com has learned, occurred far from the Today show set! Radar can exclusively reveal that Lauer recently walked out on his wife, Annette Roque, and their three children — after rumors he was having an affair.
Sources tell Radar that the skirt-chasing Lauer “walked out” on his long-suffering wife and kids’ Hamptons home this past summer, and moved into their pad in the city.
The insider said a “bitter fight” sparked their latest split after The National ENQUIRER published photos of the notorious womanizer relaxing on a boat with a mystery blonde in the Hamptons on July 8.

Sources familiar with the situation defended Lauer: “Yes, he was spending more time at the New York City apartment because Savannah Guthrie was out on maternity leave,” one source said. “Matt didn’t take any time off for three months, and it was just easier for him to be in the city. He always tried to make it back to the family home in Long Island on the weekends.”
According to an insider, he later begged “her back for the sake of their three kids” and the family was reunited under the same roof.
