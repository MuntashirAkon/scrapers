 Warren Beatty & Annette Bening Sell Their Beverly Hills Mansion: Take A Peek Inside!.../n
By Radar Staff
Warren Beatty and Annette Bening have finally unloaded their Beverly Hills estate, accepting a $6.7 million offer from a Paramount Pictures executive.
As RadarOnline.com previously reported, the 1992-built house was extensively damaged in L.A.’s massive 1994 earthquake. Beatty and Bening rebuilt the place, but they later moved and spent a year trying to lease the estate out before listing it for sale in June.

The 10,592 sq. ft. Mediterranean-style mansion has a sweeping staircase, media room, library, gym and office. There are six bedrooms, eight baths and maid’s quarters in the main house and a guest house with another three bedrooms and baths. The property is extremely private, adjacent to a nature reserve, with killer views overlooking Beverly Hills.
As fabulous as the mansion sounds, the new buyers intend to gut it and rebuild it as a more “contemporary home,” reports The Los Angeles Times, including a home theater that will be called the Warren Beatty Theater.
