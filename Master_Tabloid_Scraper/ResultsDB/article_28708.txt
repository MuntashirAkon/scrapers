Simon The Giant Rabbit Mysteriously Found Dead On United Airlines Flight!/n

Not every hare makes it to O'Hare Airport, evidently.
United Airlines' PR crisis tour continued after news broke that Simon the giant rabbit died in the cargo hold of a trans-continental United flight.
The 10-month-old Continental Giant Rabbit, destined to be the world's largest, was flying from London's Heathrow Airport to Chicago's O'Hare Airport on his way to meet a new "celebrity" owner.

Sadly, Simon was found dead when the plane landed at O'Hare.
More confused than anyone is breeder Annette Edwards, who said the animal was as "fit as a fiddle" when she placed him in the cargo hold. She told The Sun: 
"Simon had a vet's check-up three hours before the flight and was fit as a fiddle. Something very strange has happened and I want to know what. I've sent rabbits all around the world and nothing like this has happened before."
Uh oh. Looks like United has some explaining to doâ€¦ again.
In a statement to BBC News, the tainted airline said they were "saddened" by the news, saying in a statement:
"The safety and well-being of all the animals that travel with us is of the utmost importance to United Airlines and our PetSafe team. We have been in contact with our customer and have offered assistance. We are reviewing this matter."
Well, it's safe to say United has become a frequent flyer of bad press.
