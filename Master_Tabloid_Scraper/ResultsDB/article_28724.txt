We’ll take any excuse to talk about Cruel Intentions and look at Ryan Phillippe’s six pack from 16 years ago.
Entertainment Weekly is reporting that the 1999 film that gave us one of the best onscreen smooches and soundtracks will have a sequel in the form of a TV series. NBC has already commissioned a pilot script following the spawn of the movie’s leads Sebastian (Phillippe) and Annette (Reese Witherspoon). Yes, we are to believe that Annette is already carrying his child while she drives out of New York City in his beloved Jaguar XK140 Roadster. (R.I.P. Sebastian, R.I.P. Ryan and Reese’s relationship on and off screen).

According to EW, the TV adaptation will switch coasts and find 16-year-old Bash Casey in San Francisco. After he finds his late father’s journal, Bash leaves Kansas (?) and heads to the Bay Area on a full ride to Brighton Preparatory Academy.

Roger Kumble, who directed the movie, will write the script with Lindsey Rosin and Jordan Ross, who wrote The Unauthorized Musical Parody of Cruel Intentions.
Perhaps the TV show will help us forget about the prequel Cruel Intentions 2 and sequel Cruel Intentions 3, starring Amy Adams and Dawson’s Creek’s Kerr Smith, respectively.
