Presented by Calvin Klein Collection, L’Oréal Paris, and David Yurman and held at the Four Seasons in Beverly Hills on October 19, 2015, Joel McHale served as emcee for the evening while presenters to the honorees included Mary J. Blige, Lena Dunham, Leslie Mann, Zoe Saldana, Meryl Streep, Shailene Woodley, and Icona Pop.
Johnson, who received the L’Oréal Paris Legend Award, attended with her family Melanie Griffith, Tippi Hedren, and Stella Banderas. Mulligan was presented with her award by hre Suffragette co-star Meryl Streep, who was mentioned in almost every acceptance speech for being “a trailblazer in the industry.”
Elle Editor-in-Chief, Robbie Myers opened the awards with an inspirational speech:
Every year, someone gets up on this stage and says —do we even need a night for “Women” — why can’t we just be “people” in Hollywood? Actors, Directors, Screenwriters. And I get that—someone recently asked me if “women’s media” was really necessary anymore. I said, well, as long as Women make up only 20 percent of Congress, as long as senior movie studio execs are 93 percent male, and only 4 percent of studio films are directed by women; as long as the President of the United States, the VP, the Speaker of the House, the President Pro Tem, the Secretaries of State, of the Treasury, of Defense are all men; -you have to go 7 layers down to find a woman, Attorney General Loretta Lynch, on the succession plan,” then I’d say yes, We need “women’s media.” We need as many “Women In” gatherings that we can dream up.
Also in attendance: Nina Dobrev, Nikki Reed, Sarah Hyland, Julianne Hough, Kiernan Shipka, Jaime King, Jenna Dewan, America Ferrera, Rachel Zoe, and more.
