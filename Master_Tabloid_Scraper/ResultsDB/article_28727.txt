Stephen Ira, the transgender son of Annette Bening and Warren Beatty, is the latest celeb to speak out about the tragic story of Leelah Alcorn, the transgender teen who recently committed suicide after her parents wouldn't let her transition."one of the last things leelah alcorn did in her life was tell another trans girl on tumblr that she was beautiful," Ira, a 22-year-old activist, tweeted last week after news of Alcorn's death went viral."also get really confused when parents ‘mourn' when their kid comes out as trans," Ira went on. "like, your kid didn't die, they're right there and they're the exact same person...if anything, they've gained a kid now that their child feels comfortable enough to come out."

"IF YOU CAN'T HANDLE HAVING A TRANS KID, DON'T HAVE KIDS. IF YOU CAN'T HANDLE HAVING A TRANS KID. DON'T HAVE KIDS," he added. "the meaner but truer version of previous tweet: IF YOU CAN'T HANDLE A TRANS CHILD, YOU DO NOT DESERVE CHILDREN."Ira also spoke out against conversion therapy for transgender boys and girls. "if your therapist tries hard to convince you not to transition, that's conversion therapy! they don't have to ‘be' a conversion therapist," he wrote. "if your therapist won't endorse transition until you are on the brink of suicide, that is conversion therapy.""give this young woman the peace in death that she deserves and work for what she wanted, work for the things she needed while she lived," Ira shared.If you or someone you know needs help, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255). Transgender people who need someone to talk to can also call the Trans Lifeline at 877-565-8860 or the Trevor Project at 866-488-7386.
