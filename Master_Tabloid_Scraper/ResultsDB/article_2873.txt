Hathaway's Ex: Guilty... Guilty... Guilty...Gui../nAnne Hathaway's ex won't be bothering her anytime soon -- well at least for the next 5 years -- after the dirtball pled guilty to 14 counts of con-artistry just moments ago in a Manhattan Federal court.Raffaello Follieri will serve at least five years in prison for filching $6 mil while pretending to be the Vatican's chief money man.But here's the rub -- so to speak -- while entering his plea, Raffa begged the judge to let him out of his NYC holding cell ASAP because of  "unspecified inmate issues. " It's hard in prison for those Zach Braff-alikes (pun intended).UPDATE: Check out all the Raffa bling Anne H. had to give back to the Feds in the criminal complaint: Two Rolexes, a bunch of rings and a five-strand pearl necklace, among other things./n
