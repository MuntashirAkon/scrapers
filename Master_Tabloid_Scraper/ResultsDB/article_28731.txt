Warren Beatty and Annette Bening's transgender son Stephen Ira continues to follow in his parents' politically minded footsteps.Ira appears in a new PSA opposing a New York State Medicaid regulation that excludes transgender people from accessing healthcare."I grew up outside of New York, but I've always known I've wanted to move here for the city's vibrant artistic community," Ira, 21, says in the two-minute video spot. "As a trans person, I would hope that I'd be welcomed but many trans people aren't because we don't have the basic healthcare coverage we need to survive."Ira appears in the PSA, produced by GLAAD and the Sylvia Rivera Law Project, with fellow trans activists, medical providers and a mother of a transgender woman.

"Trans medicine is a medically necessary intervention," says Ronica Mukerjee, a family nurse practitioner. "Many people believe that providing hormones for trans patients is cosmetic but as a medical provider I can tell you how crucial it is for trans people to have knowledgeable trans-friendly providers."Betty and Bening have not publicly commented on Ira's gender identity.In a video for the WeHappyTrans Project in March 2012, Ira called himself, "a trans man, a faggy queen, a homosexual, a queer, a nerd fighter, a writer, an artist and a guy who needs a haircut."He also says he came out as trans when he was 14 years old. He is the oldest of Beatty and Bening's four kids.
