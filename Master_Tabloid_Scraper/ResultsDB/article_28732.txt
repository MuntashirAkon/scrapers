Warren Beatty is setting the record straight—no, he has not bed nearly 13,000 women. While the longtime star with an notably active past personal life has filled the Casanova archetype in Hollywood since he burst onto the scene in 1961's Splendor in the Grass. Having romanced some of the most famous starlets in the business—many of them his own co-star—Beatty was once estimated to have slept with 12,775 people by biographer and Star: How Warren Beatty Seduced America author Peter Biskind.Six years after the book's publishing, Beatty is pointing out the exaggeration in the writer's claim. "Think about it, sleeping with 12,775 people...that would mean not just that there were multiple people a day, but that there was no repetition," he told AARP The Magazine.

While the number is, by simple math's sake, pretty steep in proportion, there's no denying that Beatty has enjoyed flings and relationships with a lengthy list of unforgettable names, including supermodel Janice Dickinson, Madonna, Diane Keaton and Carly Simon. "Look, I never misled anyone," he told the magazine of his appeal. "And…and I'm a nice guy."However, the bachelor ultimately said "I Do" to his current wife of over two decades, Annette Bening in 1992. The two met on the set of Bugsy, but didn't make any moves until after the film wrapped.  

"During the making of the movie, there was no suggestion as to a future relationship," Beatty told the magazine. "I mean, there was in my head, but otherwise, no." In fact, he even recalled telling her, "You don't have to worry about me." However, Bening was equally smooth. "She said, 'Well, I didn't ask.'"
