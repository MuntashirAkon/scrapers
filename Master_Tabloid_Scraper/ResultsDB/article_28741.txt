President Jimmy Carter -- Grandson Dead at 28/nFormer President Jimmy Carter's grandson has died, and he was only 28. Â  Jeremy Carter apparently wasn't feeling well Saturday, took a nap at his Georgia home, and when his mom, Annette Carter, hadn't seen him for awhile she went to check on him. His heart had stopped beating. The family tried CPR, to no avail. President Carter announced the sad news while teaching a Sunday school class in his hometown of Plains, GA. Carter is resolute about teaching his class, and even the family tragedy did not stop him. The coroner has not determined a cause of death./n
