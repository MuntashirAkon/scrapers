NBC Mum on Lauer's Marital Woes/nNBC is extremely concerned over reports that Matt Lauer's wife filed for legal separation, and the network is doing everything in its power to stop the story from spreading. Annette Roque Lauer, who married Matt eight years ago, filed a petition for legal separation last month, according to Rush & Molloy. The columnists say Lauer withdrew her petition, but sources inside the network are on red alert to manage the story. Indeed, one source at a rival broadcast network tells TMZ that NBC is deeply worried that a messy break-up, especially involving the couple's two kids -- and another on the way -- could damage Lauer's image as morning TV's golden boy. A rep for the couple told Rush & Molloy that the pair is  "not divorcing. " It's unclear why Lauer had a change of heart and withdrew her petition.

TMZ spies spotted Simpson and Mayer at the tony Four Seasons Hotel in Beverly Hills last week. There's been considerable buzz about the story, and several reports suggested that it couldn't be so. Now, other sources have come forward saying that TMZ is right on the money. Here's how it went down: Mayer was the first to arrive at the hotel's bar, and he actually chatted up one of our spies and asked her upstairs to  "talk. " She declined. Not long after, Jessica arrived and made a beeline for her friend and musical collaborator Romeo Antonio, who was sitting at a table. When Antonio subsequently hit the boys' room, Mayer was there and asked if any romance existed between Antonio and Jessica. Apprised that there was not, Mayer then returned to the bar, talked to Simpson for about ten minutes, and then the two left the bar together and disappeared into an elevator. They were never seen again -- that night, at least.          Related     Articles              Jess' Revolving Men -- Dane, John, Adam...

It all went down Saturday afternoon, according to the Associated Press, when Pitt and Jolie were leaving their hotel, the Le Meridien. A British photographer was trying to snap shots of the couple, and that's when their bodyguard reportedly attacked. He grabbed the photog by the neck and started yelling at him-and it was all caught on tape by Indian television.  "I couldn't breathe. He had his fingers on my windpipe and he knew what he was doing, " the photographer told the Hindustan Times. That'll teach him to mess with Brangelina, no doubt.

Photos surfaced of the singer looking, well, very disheveled the other night, and reports said that he had been kicked out of Moss's house half-naked at 3:30 in the morning after the two got in a huge fight.
