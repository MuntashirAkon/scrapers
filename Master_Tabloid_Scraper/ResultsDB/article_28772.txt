Meet Bobby Flay's Possible New Girlfriend/n
Bobby Flay has moved on to a new lady! The celebrity chef has been seeing Masters of Sex actress Heléne Yorke, sources tell Page Six.
The 51-year-old brought Yorke, 30, to the star-studded premiere of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice at Radio City Music Hall on Sunday.
“They didn’t walk the red carpet,” an onlooker told the publication, but added, “She was Bobby’s guest — they were together. He’s moved on to another beautiful blonde.”

Though the Food Network star’s rep said the two are just “friends,” it seems there could be more happening in their relationship behind the scenes.
“Bobby went to the [December] Knicks game with his daughter when she was home on break from school,” the rep explained of their previous sightings together. “Coincidentally, Heléne was at the same game that night.”
Of course, their debut occurred only two months after Flay was spotted getting cozy with TV host Chelsea Handler — what will she think of his potential new flame?
