Search For Missing Country Star Craig Strickland On Hold/n
The search for Craig Strickland was temporarily called off Tuesday evening, resuming early this morning, authorities say.
The Backroad Anthem singer was declared missing after disappearing on a duck hunting trip this weekend in Oklahoma with pal, Chase Morland, who was found dead at 11 a.m. Monday morning.
Strickland’s dog, Sam, was discovered guarding Morland’s body, refusing to leave him until help arrived, Heather Strickland, Craig’s wife, tweeted to fans.

“For everyone wanting to know, Sam is fine, he was a brave boy,” she gushed of their dog. “We are overwhelmed with the love and prayers we have received.”

For everyone wanting to know, Sam is fine. He was a brave boy. He wouldn't leave Chase's body until the Warden found him.

As Radar previously reported, the devastating events came just days after Morland wrote an ominous tweet foreshadowing their duck hunting expedition.
“In case we don’t come back, @BackroadCRAIG and I are going right through Winter Storm Goliath to kill ducks in Oklahoma. #IntoTheStorm,” he wrote on Saturday, before the duo struck out on their trip.
