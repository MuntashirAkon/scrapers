This was truly a rousing and inspiring performance ‚Äî and the entire world is taking notice!

It's not just because the performance was on point (although it was!), but more so because Tomlinson did it while dealing with the aftermath of his mother's death earlier this week, and as Simon Cowell noted live on the show, the bravery Louis showed fighting through the pain and grief is notable and admirable!
Louis no doubt knew how important today was, tweeting this (below) earlier before his performance:

All the support has been incredible! Let's do this together tonight .
