And now that the 22-year-old and his new flame have gone public, it's time we learn a little bit more about this mystery girl! Here's what we know so far (below)! 
1. She's NOT Famous!
Miz Vandycke keeps her Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter pages completely private. That's because she's a Belgian student and NOT a celeb, which Directioners are LOVING!
2. She's Super Smart!
According to LinkedIn, Celine is an alum of University of Exeter, where she studied European Law. But that's not all! Reports are saying that she's currently continuing her education in law at France's Universit√© de Rennes.
3. She's Multi-Lingual!
Apparently, Niall's new girl can speak Dutch, French, AND English! Damn!
4. She Enjoys EDM Music!
Celine's supposed Soundcloud profile has reposted several tracks from DJs like Calvin Harris, Diplo, and Flume. But she does have a solid appreciation for mainstream greats like Destiny's Child, Lukas Graham, and we're assuming 1D! LOLz!
5. She Can Bust A Move!
The gorgeous gal might not have been shaking it during her date with the former boy bander, but she reportedly taught dance at Stage School Algarve in Quarteira.
