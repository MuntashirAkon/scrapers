Colton Haynes Just Launched A Merchandise Line & Everyone's Losing Their Sh*t! See The Social Media Praise & Shade!/n

Move over, Kim Kardashian West, because Colton Haynes is breaking the internet now!
On Tuesday, the Arrow alum launched a brand-new merchandise site, and everyone's going out of their minds about it! The gorgeous guy made a video for the exciting endeavor, revealing that he'll be selling shirts, hats, posters, and more in a limited-edition sale ahead of his upcoming clothing collection!

Ch-ch-check out his AH-mazing announcement (below)!

Among the merch, the 27-year-old is selling apparel that says "anxious" and "daddy." The hunky heartthrob has been open in the past about his longtime struggle with anxiety, so it makes sense why he'd include his battle with the disorder in his brand.
But, he also took to Twitter to reveal why he went with "daddy" for his new swag, saying:

I did the DADDY Merch cause y'all have always called me that on Twitter :) & y'all know why i did the ANXIOUS items!

But we aren't the only ones! Fans freaked so fast over Colton's items that within hours they crashed his site, AND he had already sold out of certain products! He wrote: 

Y'all r crashing the site haha! We r having the Homepage fixed right now! https://t.co/cZnNqVeyUI

Among those gushing over Mr. Haynes' new line was none other than tennis star Serena Williams, who took to Instagram to announce that she's a happy customer:




Coltonhaynes.com is finally here. I just ordered my iPhone 6 case. (I'm so serious) lol now I can tease Colton at all times. Go now they have amazing things!!A photo posted by Serena Williams (@serenawilliams) on Jul 5, 2016 at 2:41pm PDT


But not everyone was all that thrilled with Colton's new move:

Colton Haynes' webstore is embarrassingly cringeworthy.

Some people complained the prices are too high, writing:

Really Colton Haynes!?! Almost $50 for a baseball cap from your new clothing line.
— Mark Pierce (@WillfulPhoenix) July 5, 2016

Why are people freaking out over Colton Haynes clothing line? $38 for a T-Shirt that says "Daddy". Daddy could give me $38 and I'd be happy

@ColtonLHaynes 25$ for your signature is too expensive. Chill the fuck out. Not everyone's rich.
— Helene (@__helene_) July 5, 2016
But Colton doesn't have time for haters, because he's too busy laughing or smiling or both:

I think I'm crying but I can't feel anything right now lol. I might be laughing or smiling but who knows. https://t.co/cZnNqVeyUI
