A $4 million mansion isn’t the only new thing in Niall Horan’s life!

The One Direction singer made things official with a Belgian college student named Céline Hélène Vandycke when they were spotted kissing while attending a Mumford & Sons concert during the British Summertime Festival in London over the weekend. In photos obtained by The Sun, Horan, 22, couldn’t keep his hands off Vandycke, 22, as he wrapped his arms around his new ladylove and planted a smooch on her lips.

So, who’s this lucky lady?
According to Vandycke’s LinkedIn, she graduated from the University of Exeter this spring. She also spent a year at Paris’ prestigious HEC business school, where she studied Luxury Management.
Vandycke is fluent in Dutch, French and English and currently studying law at France’s Université de Rennes.
Her personal Soundcloud has EDM acts such as Skrillex, Avicii, Disclosure, and David Guetta as listed her favorite artists. She also follows Rihanna, Snoop Dogg, Frank Ocean, The Weeknd, Justin Timberlake, and 50 Cent. Maybe 1D will be on that list one day.
