 Somehow, Heidi Klum manages to make a snowsuit look sexy!
The legendary supermodel strutted her stuff around Aspen, CO, with her family, enjoying a traditional white Christmas this year. Today, Heidi, her hubby Seal and kids Helene, Henry, Johan and Lou were spotted having family fun at the Buttermilk Resort.  
Heidi Tweeted a pic smiling with her hubby, simply saying:
“Sun and Snow and Seal.”
While we love seeing Heidi serving Arctic realness in snow gear, we’re an even bigger fan of her Christmas attire — as “Mrs. Claus”– joining the ranks of our celebrities in sexy holiday costumes!
