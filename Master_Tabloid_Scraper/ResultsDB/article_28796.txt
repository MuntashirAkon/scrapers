Heidi Klum and Her Kids Get Colorful/n
Even with her hair pulled back and wearing a casual off-the-shoulder top with jeans, 35-year-old Heidi Klum looks the very definition of sexy!
The supermodel mom and wife of pop singer Seal took her kids Helene “Leni”, 4, Henry, 3, and Johan, 2, to the Color Me Mine ceramic painting store in Beverly Hills yesterday for some creative time.
Seal and Heidi both know that three children can be a handful. But while proud poppa wasn’t in attendance, Heidi’s mother Erna was.
The German-born Klum matrons smiled as they helped the little tykes paint a green dinosaur, a coffee mug…and even little Johan’s hand!
Heidi’s show Project Runway, in the meantime, is still in legal limbo. Runway’s original cable network Bravo successfully sued in September to keep the series from moving to a new home on Lifetime.
However, by late November, Lifetime had counter-sued in a bid to keep Bravo from moving forward with their re-acquired program.
In an interview that ran last week in the Washington Blade, Project Runway mentor Tim Gunn stated, “We have this horrible, nasty court case. We have an angry Bravo/NBC. We have an angry Lifetime. We have, I’m sure, an angry [producer] Weinstein Company. We have Heidi and I despondent about the whole thing. We worry that season six will never be seen by anyone.”
Here’s hoping for an early resolution, for the sake of the show’s legion of fans!
