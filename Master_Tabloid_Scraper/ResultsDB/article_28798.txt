Leonardo DiCaprio Loses His Grandmother/n
Leonardo DiCaprio said goodbye to his 93-year-old grandmother Helene Indenbirken, who passed away at a hospital near her home in North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany. 
According to the Recklinghäuser Zeitung, Indenbirken’s health had steadily declined over the past few months. The specific cause of death and date has yet to be released. Initial reports claim that an intimate funeral is planned, although it is not yet known if DiCaprio will attend.
Leonardo referred to his grandmother as “Oma” and frequently visited her in her home in Germany. He also took her on the red carpet for the 2005 Berlin premiere of his film Aviator and told press at the time, “It’s always good to see her.”
