News Friday."It's genuinely mutual and amicable and they truly remain friends," one of them said.Hyland, who recently made her debut on Shadowhunters, and Sherwood met on the set of the 2014 movie Vampire Academy and began dating that winter, a few months after she split from Matt Prokop, who she had dated for five years.

In February 2015, Hyland and Sherwood were photographed kissing outside a Hollywood nightclub and spent Valentine's Day in Disneyland."He's amazing. He's an amazing person," Hyland told E! News the following April. 

That October, she and Sherwood adopted a puppy together, a chocolate lab named Boo, who joined her dog Barkley. 

During their time together, Hyland has brought Sherwood as her date to many high-profile celebrity events, including movie premieres, the SAG Awards, the Teen Choice Awards and Oscar, Emmy and Golden Globe parties.
