She may not have found true love during her time on The Bachelor in 2002, but Helene Eksterowicz certainly has now.
The winner of the second season of the hit ABC show, which starred bachelor Aaron Buerge, is engaged to her boyfriend, Andrew Goodman.

Goodman proposed to the former reality show contestant with a stunning rectangular radiant-cut diamond ring, which he designed with a little help from Max Weiner Jewelers in Philadelphia.
And the bride-to-be couldn’t be happier with her fiancé’s taste in jewelry. “The ring is perfect,” Eksterowicz tells PEOPLE. “It’s exactly what I’ve always wanted.”
Goodman popped the question during a jaunt to the Poconos to celebrate Eksterowicz’s birthday, and the couple plans to tie the knot this summer. Tell us: Do you like Eksterowicz’s ring?
