Helene Eksterowicz Engaged to Andrew Goodman/n
There weren’t 29 million people watching this proposal – which was just fine by Helene Eksterowicz.  
The Bachelor alum, 37, to whom Aaron Buerge popped the question during the show’s second season finale, only to split five weeks later, is engaged once again.  
The lucky man? Andrew Goodman, a senior technology consultant for IBM whom Eksterowicz has been dating for a year and a half.  
“We are very happy about planning our future together,” the middle school psychologist tells PEOPLE.  
Goodman proposed during a birthday trip to the Poconos last weekend, catching Eksterowicz off-guard.  
“I thought we were just going up there to celebrate my birthday, but boy was I surprised! We stopped somewhere to have a drink after a long day of snow-tubing and sightseeing and Andrew proposed after singing a karaoke version of the song ‘Fire and Rain,’ ” she says. “I almost thought it was a joke!”  
Adds the bride-to-be: “Andrew is a great guy – handsome, loving, family-oriented, hardworking and very non-Hollywood, which is perfect!”  
Eksterowicz plans to wed this summer and has already started daydreaming about the big day. “We want to do something different, like have our reception at a winery or unique venue,” she notes. “We’re really excited!”  
Buerge, meanwhile, returned to his hometown of Springfield, Mo., following The Bachelor and married Angye McIntosh in 2009.
