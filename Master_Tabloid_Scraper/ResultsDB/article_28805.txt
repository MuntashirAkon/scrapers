Remain calm, Directioners.Niall Horan got more than a few fans talking Monday afternoon after photos surfaced of the One Direction singer getting cozy with college student Celine Helene Vandycke.In photos obtained by The Sun, the pair was seen displaying some PDA at Mumford and Sons' concert as part of the British Summer Time Festival. In fact, cameras even caught Niall kissing her and wrapping his arms around the beauty.As you likely could have guessed, fans immediately began to freak out on social media. "HE'S DATING A NORMAL. THE ACTUAL DREAM. SHE IS THE KATE MIDDLETON OF OUR GENERATION!!!!!!! (send help)," one follower tweeted. Another added, "Welcome Celine Helene Vandycke to the dark side, also known as the One Direction fandom."While the pair hasn't commented on their status, we wanted to know more about this special lady. Get to know Niall's possible new girl with five fun facts below.

1. Keep it Private: While her Instagram, Facebook and Twitter profiles are private, fan sites are already being created and uncovering a few fun facts about the student. What we can say is she was born on April 25—Go Taurus—and grew up in Belgium.2. Study Up: According to a Linkedin account, Celine is a "European Law graduate from the University of Exeter." Right now, she's studying law at France's Université de Rennes.3. Music to Her Ears: If you're curious to know what's on Celine's playlist, we may have the answer. According to a Soundcloud account, Lukas Graham, Flume and Destiny's Child are just some of the artists she loves listening to.

4. Shake It: While photos from the festival may not show off her moves, E! News learned that Celine taught dance at Stage School Algarve in Quarteira, a Portuguese town in the Algarve region.5. Speak Up: Talk about beauty and brains! In addition to her studies, Celine speaks many different languages including Dutch, French and English. Perhaps this is only fitting if she plans to travel the world with the A-list performer. Too soon? Sorry, Directioners.—Additional reporting by Kendall Fisher
