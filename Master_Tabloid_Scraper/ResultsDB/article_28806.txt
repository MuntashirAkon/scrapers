Flay is coming up on a year since he filed for divorce from his wife, Stephanie March. The pair split in April 2015 after 10 years of marriage as Flay wrote that their relationship had "broken down irretrievably." An insider told us at the time that Flay was "heartbroken [and] still cares about her."The divorce marked the third for Flay and the first for March.

Following his divorce, Flay was rumored to be dating fellow chef Giada De Laurentiis. However, E! News confirmed the speculation was false.A rep for de Laurentiis told us the rumors were simply "not true," adding, "Back in December [2014], Giada had dinner at Bellato with her agent. Bobby Flay was also having dinner with some friends and dropped by Giada's table to say hi," her rep tells E! News. "They did not have dinner, nor was there any touching going on."De Laurentiis is now seeing producer Shane Farley—a relationship she recently told E! News is "very exciting."
