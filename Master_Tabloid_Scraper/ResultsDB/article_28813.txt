Sir Patrick Stewart's latest looks has a lot of fans doing a double take. The X-Men actor took to his social media on Monday night to unveil his incredible transformation. "Something is happening in Hollywood tonight. #blunttalkseason2" he captioned a photo of himself dressed in drag, featuring fake eyelashes, a gray wig, a satin pink dress, rhinestone jewelry, black pumps, a silver purse and a full face of makeup. In honor of the second season of his sitcom, Blunt Talk, the 75-year-old actor took the stage in Los Angeles to promote his upcoming project. 

The look was so glamorous that fans immediately began comparing the actor to Oscar-winning dame Helen Mirren. Comment after comment, the actress' name continued to pop up. "You look a little like Helen Mirren," one user remarked. "Doesn't he look like Helen Mirren?!!! Like could be her sister!" another fan wrote with excitement. Stewart was not the only star on the show to don some drag. His castmate Adrian Scarborough also showed up donning a black velvet cocktail dress with a white collar and cuffs, a blond wig, full makeup and red manicure. On the Starz series, Stewart portrays a British broadcaster who moves to Los Angeles to try his hand at a nightly cable show. Could this be a tease of a dramatic wardrobe change to come for the second season? Will Mirren be a guest star? Share your predictions in the comments below.
