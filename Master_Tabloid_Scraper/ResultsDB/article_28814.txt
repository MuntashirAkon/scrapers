Even Oscar winners have a hard time at Starbucks.Helen Hunt hilariously documented her experience this morning when grabbing a cup of Joe at her local coffee spot.The 52-year-old actress tweeted a shot of her drink which showed the name "Jody"—wait, what?!"Ordered my drink @Starbucks Asked the barista if she wanted my name. She winked and said ‘We gotcha' #JodieFoster," Hunt wrote on her social media account.Ouch. Not only did the employee get the wrong actress, but she didn't even spell Jodie Foster's name right!

But in all fairness, who doesn't have a fun Starbucks name-related tale to tell?This isn't the first time that Hunt has been mistaken for the Taxi Driver actress either.Back in 1994, she explained on The Late Show how "a lot of people" have told her she looks like Foster.
