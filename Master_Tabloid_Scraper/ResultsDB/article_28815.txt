Rosie's "View" Review: Too Bad It's Beige/nRosie O'Donnell and her two JaHeRo video blog pals, Janette Barber and Helene Macaulay (who worked with Rosie on  "The View "), dished the show's debut episode. What did the trio think?  "It was very beige, " said Macaulay, adding,  "I meant that metaphorically, as well. "  "Nah, it was all right. It was good, " said O'Donnell, who had high praise for her replacement, Whoopi Goldberg.  "Whoopi was good. It was okay. " O'Donnell took issue with the bland set design.  "Why did they change the set back to beige? That was an error in judgment. " JaHeRo answered dozens of fan questions. Asked whether she felt sad while watching  "The View, " Rosie said,  "No I wasn't sad. I thought It was interesting to watch. I was sad that the set was beige. Truthfully, it's just wrong. "/n
