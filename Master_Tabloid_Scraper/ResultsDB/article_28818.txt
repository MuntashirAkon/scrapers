Amy Duggar's Grandmother Slams Abuse Claims: 'None of That Is True!'/n
In a bombshell confession, Amy Duggar just named her father, Terry Jordan, as the perpetrator of her traumatic childhood abuse.
“My dad was like, ‘Amy, did you brush your teeth?’ And I was like, ‘Yeah, Daddy.’ And he was like, ‘No you didn’t.’ And he picked me up by my throat, all the way up to the ceiling. He was like, ‘You will brush your teeth,'” she recalls in a new preview clip from the upcoming episode of WE tv hit Marriage Boot Camp Reality Stars. “I was scared s***less.”
The 30-year-old also claims her dad called her “every name in the book,” and even attempted to run her over with his car.
But Amy’s paternal grandmother, Lenora Jordan, tells RadarOnline.com the reality star’s shocking stories are a work of fiction.
“None of that stuff is true,” the Arkansas native, 77, exclusively responds to Radar, adding that her granddaughter was just attempting to create drama for her reality show.
“Amy just felt like she needed to be on that show, and needed something to tell.”

The conservative Duggar family’s rebellious cousin, who is mending her marriage to husband Dillon King on the series, has endured a tumultuous family life.
In December 2015, Terry filed for divorce from Amy’s mom Deanna, citing “intolerable” treatment during their nine-year marriage.
But the problems allegedly began years prior to the split. In 1992, Deanna filed a restraining order against Terry, claiming he once threatened to kill her and “the baby,” likely daughter Amy.
