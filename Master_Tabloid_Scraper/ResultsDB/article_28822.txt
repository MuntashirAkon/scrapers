Jay Leno's Last Tonight Show Grabs 14.6 Million Viewers In Teary Goodbye!/n

Way to exit out on top!
Jay Leno's final Tonight Show had the most viewers it's had in 15 years, as 14.6 million people tuned into laugh, cry, and say goodbye to Jay!
That's almost as many cars as he owns!
The last time such a large audience watched The Tonight Show was on May 14, 1998, when 15 million watched on to see Jerry Seinfeld talk with Jay right after the end of Seinfeld.
Well, it looks like these ratings should give Jay a reason to chin up! With such a large fan base, who knows? Maybe he'll return to television again!
