I Want To Eff You With A Cobra!/n

Someone needs to get off the crazy pills!
The Craft's Rachel True has been granted a temporary restraining order against stalker Elenora Redmon, who was recently arrested outside the actress' home with a large sex toy claiming she wanted to "fuck [Rachel] with a cobra."
Can you say creepy!?
The stalker has been ordered to stay 150 yards away from Rachel for a year and a half, to stop sending her sexually explicit and creeptastic emails, and obviously to stop showing up at her house.
Crazy!!!
