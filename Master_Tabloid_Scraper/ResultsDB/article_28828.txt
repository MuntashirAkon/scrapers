Summer Makeup Strategies/n
“Avoid cream shadow because it’ll melt into the creases of your eyes. Instead use a sheer layer of powder in neutral colors.”
-SUSAN McCARTHY, Jennifer Nettles’ makeup artist
TRY: Nars Single Eyeshadow in Bengali, $23; narscosmetics.com
“If you like powder, try a silica-based one that reduces shine without adding more layers to your face.”
-SHEILA DAVIS, makeup artist for Little Big Town’s Kimberly Schlapman
TRY: Jemma Kidd On Set Mattifying Powder, $20; target.com
“Sweat can cause mascara to run. I use waterproof mascara. For skin, oil-blotting rice papers are a must.”
-MARY BETH FELTS, Martina McBride’s makeup artist
TRY: Maybelline Great Lash Waterproof Mascara, $4.99; drugstore.com
