Picks and Pans Review: Being Human/n

FANTASY
True Blood fans will enjoy this milder British import about three housemates who can be classified separately as dead, undead and occasionally hirsute. Annie (Lenora Crichlow) is a ghost whose visibility fluctuates with her moods. Vampire Mitchell (Aidan Turner) and were-wolf George (Russell Tovey) work at low-level hospital jobs. The performances—especially Tovey’s—have a youthful, often funny mopeyness. It’s Friends for ghouls.
