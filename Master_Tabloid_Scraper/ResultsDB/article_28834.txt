Picks and Pans Review: National Lampoon's Attack of the 5 Ft.2 Women/n
Showtime (Sun., Aug. 21, 8p.m. ET)
B+
In this daffy double-header, Julie Brown spoofs two of last year’s tabloid inamoratas. First, in an utterly unruly farce, she plays Tonya Hardly. The chain-smoking, asthma-atomizer-sucking, overweight skater is consumed with jealously for her competitor Nancy Cardigan (Khrystyne Haje). Her envy results in a conspiracy of dunces that makes the guys in Airheads look like a think tank. When the attack on Cardigan doesn’t initially come off, Brown bemoans, “That was our entire hit-man budget. What are we going to do now?” That’s just the appetizer. Then comes Lenora Babbitt, whose notoriety as a husband-gelder makes strong men faint dead away. Brown plays her as a sex-starved she-devil, a fractured-female Ricky Ricardo. “Yes,” she bubbles to her media adviser (Sam McMurray) after her trial, “when the court declared me insane, it was the most happiest day of my life.”
While this pair of infamous headline-generators present perfect targets for Brown’s raucous, ribald satire, the fact is that both episodes seem a little dated already. Nothing goes stale faster than a juicy tabloid scandal.
