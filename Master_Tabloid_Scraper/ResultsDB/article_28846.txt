Teresa Giudice is lining up her friends for the upcoming season of The Real Housewives of New Jersey and Elvira Grau exclusively told RadarOnline.com that she is definitely Team Teresa!
“We have been friends because we’re both comfortable with each other as we are, not jealous or insecure,” the party planner said about her relationship with Teresa.
 Elvira has been filming for season five of RHONJ and she says she’s going to be squarely in Teresa’s camp if any of the other women want to cause trouble with her friend.

 “I would absolutely defend Teresa against the other woman,” Elvira told Fox News Correspondent Tom Murro.
In the last season of the show Teresa battled with Melissa Gorga, Jacqueline Laurita and even Caroline Manzo, so her friendships on the show are dwindling, but Eliva says she won’t turn her back on Teresa.

She explained why she is such good friends with Teresa, saying: “We both have families that we love and that’s priority over anything else.”
