Well now we know Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton are Doing It To Country Songs! Ow ow!
That's gotta be a first for Gwennie! LOLz!
Anywho, the country crooner took the stage at the CMT Music Awards on Wednesday night with The Oak Ridge Boys to perform the sexy new hit from his latest If I'm Honest album.
That was good and all, but the crowd really got excited when Blake & co. transitioned into the folk quartet's 1981 classic song Elvira! Throwback!
Now that certainly livened things back up!
Watch the amazing collaboration (above)!!!
