The Ladies Of Grease Live Wear Outfits Any T-Bird Would Approve Of At The People's Choice Awards/n

Grease is the word!!
The ladies of FOX's Grease Live decided to strut their booties (and promote the live event which airs January 31) on the People's Choice Awards red carpet.
Carly Rae Jepsen was caught looking like Elvira's teenage daughter in a leather keyhole halter dress. The songbird's bangs were extra choppy and her poof was sloppy. Someone please get this girl a Bumpit — she's too cute for this mess!
Keke Palmer also chose black, but her ensemble was a bit more esthetically pleasing. A sparkly Yousef Al-Jasmi crop and high-waisted skirt paired with black pumps completed the look. Outfit aside, we must shout out her hair. Although we're always a fan of a good updo, Miz Palmer's braid is looking a tad bit rat tail-y. Le sigh.
Julianne Hough went with a dark hue too — did their stylists plan this?! — donning a sequin off-the-shoulder two-piece frock, Edie Parker clutch, and Giuseppe Zanetti shoes.
But Vanessa Hudgens was clearly the standout in a metallic silver lame Kayat gown with a fierce leg slit, strappy sandals, Rodo clutch, and sleek messy locks. Rizzo would approve of this hawtness!
We can't wait to see these Pink Ladies on TV!
