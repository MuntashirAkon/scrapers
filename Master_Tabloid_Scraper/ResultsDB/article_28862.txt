Nicki Minaj, Meek Mill, And Her Massive Ring Take The BET Awards Red Carpet By Storm!/n

They may be a couple, but coordination is clearly NOT at the forefront of their main concerns.
Nicki Minaj and her maybe fianc√© Meek Mill hit the BET Awards red carpet Sunday evening, leaving many people scratching their heads at the pairing's collective look.
Meek looked like a yachty (yacht hottie) in white pants, a polo, and golden shades. Nicki, on the other hand, chose an unflattering zippered ensemble that resembled an updated version of Elvira's iconic costume.
Hopefully the duo's performance outfits make up for these missteps.
At least her HUGE ASS RING looked perfect!
