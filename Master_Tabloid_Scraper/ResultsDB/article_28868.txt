Kim Kardashian and Kanye West most definitely know how to throw a party. The evidence is all there and no one should ever be surprised when they decide to go a little over-the-top.
But, with that being said, you will not believe how far they overshot the top with the celebration of their daughter’s first birthday.

North West turned the big 0-1 on June 15th and her family celebrated over the weekend, sharing almost every moment of the party with their Instagram followers.
Guests at the Coachella themed party, lovingly re-titled “Kidchella,” included Kendall and Kylie Jenner, Khloe Kardashian, Kourtney Kardashian, Kris Jenner, Jaden Smith, designer Rachel Roy, Blac Chyna, and that 20-year-old who caused a scandal for Willow Smith Moisés Arias.
From a ferris wheel to a music festival-themed lip-sync booth, the party looked like a blast for everyone in attendance. The weather was also perfect, thank you Southern California.
