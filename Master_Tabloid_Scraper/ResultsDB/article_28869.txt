Mila Kunis stepped out with a huge diamond ring on her finger yesterday, confirming the reports that she and Ashton Kutcher are engaged.
The former That ’70s Show co-stars have been dating for nearly two years, and have been inseparable since then. A source told People magazine back in December that, “Ashton and Mila have talked about getting married for quite a while, and a friend of Kutcher’s said, “They’re incredibly happy together.”
Mila, 30, was spotted out shopping with her mom Elvira in West Hollywood yesterday when she flashed this huge sparkler.

The Black Swan actress also just posted this sweet photo of she and Ashton with her Instagram followers and captioned it: “Happily ever after..”

Ashton’s divorce from Demi Moore was finalized in November of last year. It’s the first marriage for Mila.
