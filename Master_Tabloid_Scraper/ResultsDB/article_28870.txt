Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher Stroll London With Her Parents/n
Looks like all is still rather lovely for Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher.
The couple has been shacking up in northwest London, England, as Kunis shoots her starring role in the upcoming Jupiter Ascending, an anticipated scifi from the Wachowskis. And over the weekend, the former That ’70s Show costars toured around some special visitors — Kunis’ parents, Mark and Elvira.
Dressed down in casual clothes — as per usual — Kunis, 29, and Kutcher, 35, strolled the streets of foggy London town with Mr. and Mrs. Kunis in tow on Saturday. After chatting and sipping coffee in the afternoon, they took in a showing of Billy Elliott: The Musical.
This isn’t the first time the couple — who have been dating since April 2012 — has double dated with Kunis’ parents, though. Last summer, the foursome bonded while cheering on the Los Angeles’ Dodgers — decked out in the team’s gear — from the comfort of the the exclusive Lexus Dugout Club.
And Kunis is in with his family, too. Kutcher took his leading lady home for the holidays to Cedar Rapids, Iowa, last December. Do we hear wedding bells on the horizon? Well, at least not until Kutcher’s drawn-out divorce from Demi Moore is settled.
