Fashion FTW: Halle Berry Dominates The Red Carpet (PHOTOS)/n
Last night’s DKMS 4th Annual Gala: Linked Against Lukemia meant red carpet moments for a few select FTW celebrities so of course we’re here to evaluate. Halle Berry was looking amazing, as yuge, in her Vera Wang delight (please check out the back of this masterpiece). Eva Mendes, also one who rarely disappoints, was looking quite sultry in Alberta Ferreti, and Whitney Port looked like Elvira’s unholy union to a lilypad but she managed to pull it off. You have our thumbs, ladies.
