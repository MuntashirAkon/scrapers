Mila Kunis, Stud Magnet/n
For a gal whose current TV role doesn’t even show her face, Mila Kunis sure can draw a crowd. 
The Family Guy voice artist (she provides the vocals for matriarch Meg Griffin) was besieged by autograph-seeking fan-boys after arriving at Los Angeles International Airport with her mother, Elvira, yesterday. 
Were these rabid cartoon fans? They sure fit the profile. 
Maybe they’re just impressed by the Ukraine-born beauty’s wiener-handling skills. That would be entirely understandable.
Mila’s admirers better watch their manners. Her boyfriend’s a total badass, and isn’t above breaking the law when he feels it’s necessary.
