This article originally appeared on EW.com
The Oscars family could soon grow by record numbers, as AMPAS announced Wednesday its list of annual invitees, which represent 57 countries from around the world among the biggest collective ever asked to link with the Hollywood organization.
Among potential new faces in the Academy’s acting branch (members are not confirmed until they accept their invitations) are Kristen Stewart, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, Betty White, Riz Ahmed, Priyanka Chopra, Aishwarya Rai, Maggie Cheung, John Cho, Chris Pratt, Gal Gadot, Wanda Sykes, Naomie Harris, Janelle Monaé, Jon Hamm, Molly Shannon, Amy Poehler, Aishwarya Rai, Armie Hammer, Chris Evans, Charlotte Gainsbourg, Adam Driver, Elle Fanning, Anna Faris, Rupert Grint, Donald Glover, Phylicia Rashad, Chris Hemsworth, Anne Heche, Keegan-Michael Key, Sanaa Lathan, Zoë Kravitz, Leslie Mann, Kate McKinnon, Sienna Miller, Elizabeth Olsen, and Margot Robbie.
Directors on the list include Barry Jenkins, Jordan Peele, Kim Ki-Duk, Theodore Melfi, David Ayer, Emmanuelle Bercot, Fatih Akin, Derek Cianfrance, Patricia Cardoso, Garth Davis, Lav Diaz, Tom Ford, Anna Hui, Kleber Mendoça Filho, Takashi Miike, and Guy Ritchie, among others; Additionally, Jimmy Jam, Nick Cave, Angelo Badalamenti, Justin Hurwitz, Mica Levi, Lin-Manuel Miranda, and Justin Timberlake were invited by the music branch.
Writers with an offer to join include Simon Pegg, Katie Dippold, Mike Mills, Taylor Sheridan, Joss Whedon, and Peele, who was invited by multiple branches.
The invitations come on the heels of one of the Academy’s most diverse Oscar ceremonies to date, during which the highest number of black winners took home awards in AMPAS history — including Fences‘ Viola Davis and Moonlight‘s Mahershala Ali in the supporting acting categories.
Under the leadership of president Cheryl Boone Isaacs, the Academy has undergone an aggressive push for more diversity among its ranks, an initiative that has seen a large number of women (46 percent of a record 683 movie professionals in 2016) and racial minorities (41 percent of that same figure) asked to join the prestigious industry group in recent years.

According to the Academy, between 2015 and 2017, the number of women invited into AMPAS has increased by 359 percent, while the number of people of color has jumped 331 percent across the same frame. Seven branches have also invited more women than men, namely the actors, casting directors, costume designers, designers, documentarians, executives, and film editors.
“We’re proud to invite our newest class to the Academy. The entire motion picture community is what we make of it,” Isaacs said in a statement. “It’s up to all of us to ensure that new faces and voices are seen and heard, and to take a shot on the next generation the way someone took a shot on each of us.”
