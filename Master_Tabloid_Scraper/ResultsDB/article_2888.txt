Justin Bieber Sets The Record Straight On Kourtney Kardashian Hook Up Rumors/n
After nearly blowing up Instagram with a steamy New Years kiss pic featuring longtime pal Hailey Baldwin, Justin Bieber switched gears and finally addressed the rumors of his tryst with Kourtney Kardashian.
The 21-year-old sat down for a pre-taped interview on The Bert Show, recorded Dec. 17, leaving the possibility of a hook up with the reality star as an open-ended discussion.
“I’m being used, man. What can I say?” he quipped about their rumored romance to show host Bert Weiss.
When asked if there was anything new to share on the matter, Bieber replied, “Nah, we’ll leave it at that.”

Then, adding one last comment, the “Sorry” singer made sure to pay the 36-year-old a serious compliment.
“For real, she’s great,” he shared. “I’ve known [the Kardashians] for years.”
Of course, it was only weeks later that the Canadian crooner seemed to announce his relationship with young model Hailey, posting a series of sexy snaps from their Caribbean vacation over New Years.
