Mila Kunis Surprises Her Parents with Home Makeover: 'I Desperately Want to Give Them Something That I Think They Deserve'

Mila Kunis is a home design fairy godmother.
The actress and mom of two surprised her parents, Mark and Elvira Kunis, with a makeover of their Los Angeles condo.
“They’ve done so many things for my brother and I,” says Kunis, 33, in the latest episode of the online series My Houzz. “And so I desperately want to give them something that I think they deserve.”

Kunis’s biggest qualm about her childhood home — besides its “Miami Vice circa 1994” vibe — was that it was too closed off, and under equipped to handle their growing extended family. (Kunis and husband Ashton Kutcher, 39, welcomed their second son, Dimitri, during the remodel.)
“My family all descends upon the family room/kitchen/dining room area,” she says. “And whoever is in the kitchen is isolated from everybody else because you’re surrounded by these weird walls.”

Thankfully, designer Breeze Giannasio was able to get rid of the awkward barriers for good — and she let Kunis take the first swing.

“I might be nine months pregnant, but if anyone is knocking down that wall it’s me,” she says. Kutcher also provided a little help with the “heavy lifting.”
A deluge of design decisions, including the statement chandelier in the dining room, caused some stress for the Bad Moms star, but she says, “seeing my parents’ reaction to their condo for the first time made everything worth it.”
