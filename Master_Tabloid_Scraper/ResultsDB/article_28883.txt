The duo went public with their romance in 2016 at the Golden Globe Awards, where Isaac planted a kiss on Lind before accepting a statue for his performance in Show Me a Hero.The parents-to-be both share a love of the movie industry. While Isaac is an acclaimed actor, Lind is a passionate filmmaker.Get the cameras ready, you two, because this next chapter is going to be one to never forget. 

Cheers!
