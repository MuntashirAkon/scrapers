Wearing her signature cleavage-revealing black dress, Elvira blows out candles, dances near skulls and eventually hugs Adams as she stares directly into the camera. Stop creeping us out, Elvira!  Along the way, director Michael Reich pays tribute to classic TV shows like Fright Night and Movie Macabre.  "Gimme Something More" is the lead single from Adams' 14 studio album. The self-titled disk is available beginning Sept. 9.
