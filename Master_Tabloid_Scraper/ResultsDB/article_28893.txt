We really do.But you gotta wear pants sometimes, OK?We know what you're thinking: Rules and pants are a bummer! But, Lils, having your bums hang out of some 99-cent pantyhose at the London GQ Awards is unacceptable.Actually, the whole thing is kind of a nylon nightmare, with the creepy cougar nightie, the flagrant bra straps, the tussled Elvira hair and your relentless insistence on underwear as outwear. It's too much.We know this is a phase you'll grow out of, though, and we'll be ready to help you bundle up against overexposure. Love ya!
