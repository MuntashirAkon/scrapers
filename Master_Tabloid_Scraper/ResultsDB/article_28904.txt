'Dukes of Hazzard' Star John Schneider -- My Ex Is Cleaning Up ... More Than $18k Per Month!/nJohn Schneider -- one of TV's  "good ole boys " -- is gonna hand over a big ole bundle of dough to his estranged wife in spousal support. Bo Duke from  "The Dukes of Hazzard " was ordered to pay Elvira Schneider $18,911 every month, which sounds like a hefty bill -- 'cause it is -- but it could have been worse. Elvira had requested $31k per month. If you're wondering how the star of an '80s TV show can still afford to fork out that kinda cash --Schneider says he earned $40,487 last month. He owns a production company where he's directing, writing and producing ... plus he's still acting in several projects. Elvira filed divorce docs almost 2 years ago. They've yet to reach a final settlement.Â /n
