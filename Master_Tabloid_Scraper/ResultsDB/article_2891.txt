Alessandra Ambrosio Goes Topless For LOVE Mag's Raunchy Advent Calendar/n
Welcome to the danger zone! Alessandra Ambrosio channeled her inner American cowgirl, rocking a red, white and blue bikini for LOVE magazine‘s 2015 advent calendar.
The Brazilian-born model stripped down to a barely-there bathing suit as she posed on top of an American flag in a swimming pool, as sexy video reveals.
The must-see clip also includes Kenny Loggins‘ 1986 hit-song “Danger Zone,” taking the Victoria’s Secret Angel’s look to a whole new level.

Dancing in tiny Daisy Duke shorts, Ambrosio gets playful with the camera, miming pistols with her hands as she sways in a straw cowgirl hat.
LOVE‘s advent calendar is jam-packed with celebrities this year, including Miranda Kerr, Cara Delevingne, Hailey Baldwin, Gigi Hadid, Bella Hadid, and Kendall Jenner with mom Kris – remember their dirty dancing for last year’s addition?
