What Happened to Carmen Electra?!/nCarmen Electra has gone from hot to not-so-much. Que paso?!The 35-year-old former  "Baywatch " babe was snapped backstage at  "The Ellen DeGeneres Show " on Monday, sporting a bad blonde dye job, black liquid eyeliner and a Holly Hobbie /dominatrix dress from Laura Ashley's Elvira line. Throw on a pair of Lucite heels and she could be Shauna Sand's classier, long lost sister. While on Sunday, Electra was photographed in Chile (inset)-- looking like a Druid high priestess.Hopefully, her best gal pal, Joan Jett, isn't behind Carm's new disposition.
