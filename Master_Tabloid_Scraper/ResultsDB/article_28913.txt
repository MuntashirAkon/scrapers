Hester sued A&E for wrongful termination after he alleged that the hit show was staged. As Radar previously reported, the reality star, best known for his “yuuup” while bidding on storage lockers, claimed the show’s producers filled lockers with valuable items before they were auctioned off to buyers, rigged the bidding and even paid for a female cast member’s plastic surgery to add sex appeal to the show.
He claimed he was fired in retaliation only days after he aired his grievances to the production company executives. He originally sued for $750,000 in general and punitive damages. /n
