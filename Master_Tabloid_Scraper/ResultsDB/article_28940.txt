Leave it to Jay-Z to save the most touching tribute to Chester Bennington for last.

The rapper closed out the V Festival in the U.K. this weekend by breaking out “Numb/Encore,” the Grammy-winning single from his joint EP with Linkin Park. Though 13 years has passed since the release of Collision Course, it was clear the collaboration still remained close to Jay-Z’s heart as he performed the song.
Via Revolt TV:
Before the beat dropped, JAY asked the crowd, “Can you guys light it up tonight for Chester from Linkin Park, one time tonight? Please make some noise so he can hear you all the way in heaven tonight.”
