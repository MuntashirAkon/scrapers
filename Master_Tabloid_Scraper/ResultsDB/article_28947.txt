The music industry is in mourning after Linkin Park frontman Chester Bennington passed away at the age of 41.

The singer was found dead in his home at the Palos Verdes Estates in California around 9 a.m. Thursday, according to TMZ. According to law enforcement sources, Bennington committed suicide by hanging himself in his private residence.
He was the father of six children: Jaime and Isaiah from his previous relationship with Elka Brand; Draven from his first marriage to  Samantha Marie Olit; and Tyler and twins Lilly and Lila with wife Talinda Ann Bentley.
Bennington died on what would’ve been late musician and longtime friend Chris Cornell’s 53rd birthday. The two were reportedly very close until Cornell’s suicide in May, when the grunge legend hung himself in his Detroit hotel room after taking anxiety medication.
“You have inspired me in many ways you could never have known,” Bennington wrote in an open letter on the day of Cornell’s death. “You talent was pure and unrivaled. You voice was joy and pain, anger and forgiveness, love and heartache all wrapped into one. I suppose that’s what we al are. You helped me understand that.”
