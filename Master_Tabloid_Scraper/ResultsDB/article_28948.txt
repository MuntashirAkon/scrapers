Three weeks after the terrorist attack that rocked her concert in Manchester, Ariana Grande is finally ready to hit the road again.

The singer has resumed her Dangerous Woman Tour following a bombing at the Manchester Arena on May 22 that left 23 people dead. Taking to Instagram, Ariana shares her thoughts ahead of her concert in Paris on Wednesday (June 7, 2017).
“First show back tonight. Thinking of our angels every step of the way. I love you with all my heart. ☁️ ♡ Grateful for and incredibly proud of my band, dancers and entire crew,” Ariana writes. “I love you I love you.”

As previously reported, the 23-year-old halted the tour following the tragedy to help manager Scooter Braun organize the One Love Manchester benefit concert. The star-studded event raised over $13 million for the victims and families affected by the attack.
“There is nothing I or anyone can do to take away the pain you are feeling or to make this better,” Grande wrote when she initially announced her plans to return to Manchester for the performance. “However, I extend my hand and heart and everything I possibly can give to you and yours, should you want or need my help in any way.”
She added, “We will not quit or operate in fear. We will not let this divide us. We won’t let hate win.”
