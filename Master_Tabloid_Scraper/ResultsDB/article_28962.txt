Who said hospitals weren't sexy? Certainly somebody who's never seen the new Scream Queens promo. Hospitals: they can be scary and sexy.In the above spot, get your first peek at Keke Palmer's new Zayday look and Lea Michele's return as Hester, Hannibal Lecter-like mask and all. Emma Roberts' Chanel says it best: "Oh hell no."And don't think we forgot about the making out that's going on between, well, it seems just about everybody. Yes, that's Abigail Breslin's Chanel No. 5 and Taylor Lautner's hot doc, Dr. Cassidy Cascade. Don't fret, John Stamos' Dr. Brock Holt, Billie Lourd's Chanel No. 3 and Jamie Lee Curtis' Cathy Munsch are there too. And while she's not featured here, Niecy Nash will return as Denise Hemphill along with Glen Powell's Chad Radwell.

Scream Queens is shifting the horror-comedy action to a hospital for season two. Years after the events of season one, the Chanels are in medical school and learning a thing or two about medicine, making outâ€¦and likely murder."Right away we get into some romance on the show," Stamos told us at Comic-Con. And yes, there will be plenty of shirtless scenes all around.In addition to newbies Lautner and Stamos, guest stars this year include Jerry O'Connell, Colton Haynes, Cecily Strong and from the looks of Curtis' Instagram account, Saturday Night Live veteran Cheri Oteri."When they got there it just made sense," Roberts said of her new cast mates joining. "It's like six degrees of separation on Scream Queens. We all know each other in some weird way, which is so fun."Scream Queens premieres Tuesday, Sept. 20 at 9 p.m. on Fox.
