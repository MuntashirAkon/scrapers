This is war, indeed.The network behind reality series Storage Wars, A&E, is firing back in response to star David Hester's lawsuit alleging that the show is rigged, filing its own legal documents vouching for the show's authenticity and questioning Hester's motives.Per The Hollywood Reporter, the network, which filed its response in Los Angeles Superior Court last week, is accusing Hester of "a transparent attempt to distract from the issues."

Those issues purportedly include an apparent tussle between the network and Hester over "improper use of AETN's trademarks," such as the use of catchphrases like "storage warrior," as well Hester's reported attempt to renegotiate his contract.A&E is also claiming that Hester has now recast himself as a "crusading whistleblower" in order to drum up drama.In his lawsuit filed last month, Hester alleged that the network committed fraud by planting valuable items and memorabilia on the show.He also claimed that when he confronted producers about this, he was unceremoniously fired from the show. He is suing for wrongful termination, breach of contract and unfair business practices, and is seeking $750,000 in damages.
