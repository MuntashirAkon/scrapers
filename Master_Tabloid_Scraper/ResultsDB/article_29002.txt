Police: California Woman Tried To Cut Off Husband’s Genitals/n
By Radar Staff
A 67-year-old woman in Palm Springs, Calif. is accused of doing a Lorena Bobbit.
Authorities say Virginia Valdez attempted to cut off her husband’s penis with a pair of large scissors Saturday evening. She failed to sever his genitals, however, and the 62-year-old man was treated for a non-life-threatening wound at a local hospital.
Valdez is charged with mayhem, assault with a deadly weapon and felony domestic violence in the alleged attack, which took place Saturday evening. On Sunday, she was released on $100,000 bond.

The couple had been married for 32 years, and at this time, the reason for the attack is unclear.
“It was just a long-standing marital dispute, and we are not sure what caused her to do it,”  Palm Springs Police Sgt. Kyle Stjerne said.
Valdez will face a judge next month.
