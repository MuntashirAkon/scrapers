Tavera was held outside the store until police arrived and arrested her at 6:45 p.m. She was booked on Saturday at the El Paso County Jail before being released the next day on $300 bail.
According to one report, Tavera said details of the arrest were “misconstrued, and it’s twisted.”
The 5’10” brunette model won the 2006 Miss El Paso Teen USA before placing sixth at the Miss Texas USA pageant in 2008 and runs a modeling agency in El Paso called Laura’s Productions.
