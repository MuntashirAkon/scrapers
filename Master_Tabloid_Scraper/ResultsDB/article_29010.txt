RadarOnline.com caught up with American Idol judge Randy Jackson Thursday, and in an exclusive video interview, he gave props to Simon Cowell‘s upcoming X-Factor, saying: “I’m sure it’s going to be a hot show!”
“Simon will always do fine,” Randy told RadarOnline.com of his ex-Idol colleague. “He’s a very smart and talented guy. I’m sure it’s going to be a hot show as well. He’s my dear friend, we love him. What’s up Simon?”

We spotted America’s favorite “dawg” lunching with Chef Lorena Garcia at The Grove in Los Angeles. Randy also told RadarOnline.com that the addition of new judges Jennifer Lopez and Steven Tyler on this season of American Idol is: “coming along good and it’s a good mix.”
Randy would not reveal who he thinks will take home the title this season, but he did jokingly predict that “somebody with hair is going to win.”

As RadarOnline.com previously reported, Pia Toscano and Stefano Langone were among the clear standouts on Wednesday’s edition of the hit Fox show, as each delivered rousing performances on a night the 12 remaining contestants had to perform songs released the year they were born.
Stefano  — a wild card contestant  — delivered a powerful performance of Simply Red’s 1989 ballad If You Don’t Know Me By Now. His set was lauded by Randy, who said the 22-year-old Kent, Washington native “took a song with the highest degree of difficulty and slayed it.”
On Thursday night’s ‘Results Show’, Stefano and Pia were both safe from the get-go, but Naima, Hailey, and Karen were all in the bottom three — eventually Karen was sent home.
