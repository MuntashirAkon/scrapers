Meagan Good Is Looking Pretty 'Good' On The BET Awards Red Carpet!/n

Looking GOOD (sorry we had to)!
On Sunday, Meagan Good brought her A-game for the BET Awards red carpet as she rocked an emerald green, silk dress designed by Lorena Sarbu. FABOOSH!
In addition to the Think Like A Man actress' gorgeous cut out Lorena Sarbu gown, Miz Good donned some seriously stunning accessories. We mean, did you SEE her gorgeous gold clutch?? LOVES it.
Not to mention, Meagan's hair couldn't have been more perfect for the summer event as she let her curls fly free. Bravo.
Keep doing you girl, because you are TOTALLY killing it right now. You know we're rightâ€¦
