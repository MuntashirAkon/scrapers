Kellie Pickler Makes The Wrong Shoe Choice At The CMT Music Awards/n

We love the top half of this dress!
But then there are the shoesâ€¦no bueno!
Kellie Pickler was all glam in this red Lorena Sarbu high-low gown with lace bodice at the CMT Music Awards in Nashville Wednesday.
Very unfortunately her beige suede pumps were kind of not the best choice.
She should've worn dainty strappy red or black sandals instead!
Thoughts???
