Pharrell Looks So Zen Posing With Little Big Town At The CMT Music Awards!/n

Classic prayer pose!
Pharrell gladly joined Little Big Town on the CMT Music Awards carpet just before their big collaborative performance.
While this show isn't really about fashion, these ladies and gents made an effort!
Karen Fairchild went with a patterned gown and Kimberly Schlapman was pretty in pink Lorena Sarbu, while Jimi Westbrook chose all black and Phillip Sweet decided on a jacket and blue jeans.
However it was The Voice judge who stole the evening with his camouflage ensemble. Perhaps he was inspired by coworker Blake Shelton??
We'll never knowâ€¦
