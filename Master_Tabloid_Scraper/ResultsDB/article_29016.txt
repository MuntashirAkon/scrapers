Demi Lovato Disappoints With Her Overly Gelled Hair At The AMAs/n

Ooh, not her best.
Demi Lovato admitted she was feeling confident at the American Music Awards — and she should! — but we're not crazy about any aspect of her outfit.
The hair especially looks so stiff and rigid! Yikes!
Even though we usually love an homage to old Hollywood, we just don't think DemDem's black-and-gold lace Lorena Sarbu dress and heavy makeup worked on this occasion.
Of course her face was gorgeous and that's one thing that'll never change!
Thoughts???
