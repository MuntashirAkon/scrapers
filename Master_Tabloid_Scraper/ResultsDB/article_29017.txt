Jewel Sparkles On The CMA Awards Red Carpet — See The Singer's Party Dress HERE!/n

Va va voom!
Jewel is kicking off the CMA Awards on a high note in this low-cut Lorena Sarbu silver beaded long sleeve cocktail dress paired with Swarovski's Nirvana Star Clutch.
The Hands singer kept it simple with loose, beachy waves and nude lip — but we are loving the dramatic, smoky eye!
We think the 41-year-old looks ready to have a good time at country's biggest night.
What do U think, Perezcious readers?? Hit or miss?
