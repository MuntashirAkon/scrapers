Have you ever seen so many stunning ladies on one red carpet??

But Emma swapped out her pretty pink number for a slinky black gown, complete with a matching clutch and a whole assortment of jewels.
It's very American Horror Story-themed!
Meanwhile, the Modern Family starlet looked stunning in yet another body-hugging dress by Lorena Sarbu.
We didn't think we could love a look more than the red piece she wore earlier in the night, but this sparkling number comes very close!
And last but definitely not least, Laverne opted for another custom Calvin Klein Collection gown, this time with the cutouts in the front!
Such perfection!
