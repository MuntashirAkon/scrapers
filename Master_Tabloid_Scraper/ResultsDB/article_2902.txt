Burger, Bikini, Bella Thorne!/n

UPDATE 1:40 P.M. EST: Plot TWIST! This is actually at Scott Disick's Hidden Hills home — according to TMZ! Those two just can't quit each other!
What's a Tuesday without eating a giant hamburger in a tiny white seashell bikini??
Bella Thorne probably wouldn't know as that's exactly how she spent the day… as shown by her Snapchat and Instagram Story.
The 19-year-old first documented the big piece of meat she was planning to devour, only to later outdo herself by eating it in front of the camera while showing off her booty.
You think she was trying to get Scott Disick's attention?

While he doesn't follow her on IG, we wouldn't be surprised if he creeped onto her page just to check out these snaps — especially after their run-in at EDC over the weekend!
