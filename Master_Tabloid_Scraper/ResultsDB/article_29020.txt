Carrie Underwood Shows Off Growing Baby Bump at Country Music Awards/n
Carrie Underwood and her little baby bump hit the red carpet at the Country Music Awards tonight, and though it’s the seventh time she’ll co-host the show, it marks the first since Underwood announced her pregnancy.
But it’s not just the pregnancy that had her glowing tonight.  The 31-year-old Grammy winner stunned in a high-low, dazzling gold gown made by Lorena Sarbu, which featured gorgeous beading, a sweetheart neckline and a sheer overlay.

Though the dress was loose and kept her tummy covered up from the front, as the singer turned to the side, we finally see the first stages of her growing bump! Yay!

Underwood announced her pregnancy in September and revealed she is due in spring of 2015.  So the CMAs are just the beginning of the many bump-baring photos we’re sure to see.
But as excited as we are for the baby to get here, the “Before He Cheats” songstress has her concerns over being a first time mommy.
“Just being responsible for a tiny human,” she admitted in an interview on The View, “That’s the hardest part.”
