They're sexy, they're cute! They're popular to boot! And now, cheerleaders are considered members of an official sports team! Wait, what's that you say?Cheerleading isn't a sport? Well, technically it wasn't. Until this past Wednesday, high school cheerleading was not recognized as an official sport in the state of California despite it totally being a fierce athletic pursuit.Twitter is on fire following the game-changing announcement. Supporters are using the hashtag #AB949 (named after the bill) to sing their praise for the exciting news. Signed into law by Gov. Jerry Brown, the bill was authored by Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez. Sorry not sorry for all the Bring It On lyrics you're about to be subjected to. We're just excited, okay!? The assemblywoman tweeted her own excitement, thanking child athlete advocate Kimberly Archie for her helping hand in making the sport official.
