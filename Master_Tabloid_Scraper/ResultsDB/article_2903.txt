Scott Disick SPOTTED Mere Feet Away From Bella… by videosuploaded__
We see you, Scott Disick!!
If you were following Bella Thorne's Snapchat at all this weekend, then you're aware that the former Disney darling hit up the Electric Daisy Carnival in Las Vegas to support her sister's latest DJing gig. However, as Lord Disick isn't one to miss out on a good rager, the KUWTK celeb was spotted partying mere feet away from the Famous In Love actress!

It's unclear if Kourtney Kardashian's baby daddy was at the event as Bella's plus one, especially since the twosome seemed to keep their distance at the bash. Is Scott STALKING Bella?? We mean, we'd be surprised if the 19-year-old rekindled her romance with the father-of-three as she JUST opened up about their disastrous Cannes trip in Complex magazine.
Although, per gossip around town, the twosome did hang out with each other once Scott returned to the States following his bender in the south of France. Perhaps those pink roses and peonies won Miz Thorne over once more?? *Shrugs*
SIDE NOTE: Why on Earth was Disick spending Father's Day weekend with half-naked ravers rather than with his children?? Tsk, tsk.
