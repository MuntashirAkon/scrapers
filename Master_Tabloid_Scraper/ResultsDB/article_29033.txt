It was a big night for the country darling who hosted the annual awards show with Brad Paisley for the seventh year in a row.In addition to wearing a fully hand-beaded gown featuring a high-low skirt by Lorena Sarbu, the 31-year-old revealed she was having a baby boy."I know something you all don't know. Suck it TMZ," Paisley gloated before accidently (maybe?) revealing the baby's gender. "We should name him Garth!" he shared while gesturing to Carrie's baby bump.Secret's out folks!"Something in the Water" is featured on Underwood's upcoming greatest hits album that is slated to be released Dec. 9. Merry Christmas to country fans, y'all!Â
