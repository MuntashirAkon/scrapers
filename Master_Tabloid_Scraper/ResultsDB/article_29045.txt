As Radar reported, the actress was seen pole dancing and stripping, and even falling to the ground, as she was too drunk to handle herself.
Said an onlooker: “She kissed one guy, and even started dry-humping him while they danced! At some point during the night, she lost her blouse, so she was only wearing a bra for the more scandalous dancing!”
