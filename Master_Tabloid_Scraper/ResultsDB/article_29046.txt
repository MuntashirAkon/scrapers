Sigler battles constant pain, especially when caring for her three-year-old son, Beau.
“I try and take him to parks that have gates, so he can run free,” she revealed.
“But I’m also conscious of driving places and whether I can park close enough so I don’t have to walk too far.”
Sigler also confided that Cutter, 27, a former pro baseball player, has restored the strength she’s lost to the debilitating disease.

As for her pregnancy, Jamie declared; “It’s a beautiful miracle!”
