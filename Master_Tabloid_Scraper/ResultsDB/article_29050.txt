Olivia Newton John has announced that she has been diagnosed with breast cancer, and it’s already “metastasized to the sacrum.”
The Grease star, 68, initially postponed her tour over what she believed were sciatica complications. But ultimately, the diagnosis was much more severe.
“The back pain that initially caused her to postpone the first half of her concert tour, has turned out to be breast cancer that has metastasized to the sacrum,” the singer’s announcement stated.
