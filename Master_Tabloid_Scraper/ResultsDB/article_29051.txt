“He and Kelly have and continued to date,” an insider told Radar. “They are keeping things light, but are still seeing each other.”
As Radar previously reported the avid golfers were spotted together back in February at the Pebble Beach Pro Am, before he and Olivia Munn were officially split. After Rodgers broke up with the actress in April, he and Rohrbach went public.
