 Olivia Newton John's Daughter Cops To Botched Plastic Surgery, Says She Was 'Mutilated'.../n
Olivia Newton John‘s daughter is finally telling all on her plastic surgery woes!
Chloe Lattanzi revealed to Australia’s Woman’s Day that her first boob job when she was 18-years-old left her body completely destroyed, and her lip fillers weren’t much better!
“All those things were a disaster,” Lattanzi, 31, said. “Not only did the lip implants look ridiculous, the first boob op I had in Australia when I was 18, left me looking mutilated.”

Lattanzi explained that she had her surgeries corrected as “a reward [to herself] for [her] sobriety” after overcoming a drug addiction and eating disorder. The Grease star’s daughter went to rehab in 2013 for her cocaine and alcohol addiction.
A new boob job cost the wannabe singer $10,000, but she didn’t mind.
“Now I’m a 32DD and I love my body and love showing my new boobs off,” she said, adding, “Mum supported my surgery decisions because she knew how unhappy I was before.”
Lattanzi also denied having a rib removed to make her skinnier, saying, “I’d never dream of removing a vital part of my anatomy. I wear a waist trainer and work out to stay in shape.”
