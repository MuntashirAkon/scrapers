Taylor Swift Donates BIG To Mariska Hargitay's Charity Which Aids Sexual Assault Survivors/n

Making good on her promise.
As we previously reported, on Monday, Taylor Swift walked away victorious in her groping trial against disgraced Colorado DJ David Mueller. Following her big win, Miz Swift announced she'd be donating a certain sum to charities that aid survivors of sexual assault.

Well, the A-lister has already made good on her promise as she made an undisclosed, but "generous" contribution to the Joyful Heart Foundation. On the Blank Space singer's act of generosity, a spokesperson for the charity told E! News: 

"Joyful Heart is honored to be recognized by Taylor Swift for our work on behalf of and in service to survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, and child abuse."
We can't say we're surprised to learn that Swift donated to the Joyful Heart Foundation as it's the charity founded by Law & Order: Special Victims Unit star Mariska Hargitay. In case you forgot, TayTay is a HUGE L&O:SVU fan — we mean, she even named her cat Detective Olivia Benson after Hargitay's character. Mariska was also in Taylor's Bad Blood music video.
We're sure Hargitay is more than grateful for the donation. The industry vet even teased the hitmaker's donation earlier this week as she wrote on Twitter:

Leading takes courage — @taylorswift13 is leading with her voice, with fearlessness, and aplomb. Thank you for allowing #Justice to be had.

We couldn't have said it better ourselves!!
