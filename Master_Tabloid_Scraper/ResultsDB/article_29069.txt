Olivia Newton-John is taking some time off from performing to battle breast cancer.

The Grease star was diagnosed with the disease again after she experienced back pain during the first half of her North American tour, according to a statement released on her Facebook.
“Olivia Newton-John is reluctantly postponing her June U.S. and Canadian concert tour dates. The back pain that initially caused her to postpone the first half of her concert tour, has turned out to be breast cancer that has metastasized to the sacrum,” it read. “In addition to natural wellness therapies, Olivia will complete a short course of photon radiation therapy and is confident she will be back later in the year, better than ever, to celebrate her shows.”
The 68-year-old added, “I decided on my direction of therapies after consultation with my doctors and natural therapists and the medical team at my Olivia Newton-John Cancer Wellness and Research Centre in Melbourne, Australia.”
Newton-John was first diagnosed with breast cancer in 1992, for which she underwent chemotherapy and a modified radical mastectomy.
“Common sense prevailed,” the actress, who was reluctant to undergo chemotherapy at first, told CNN in 2007. “One of my girlfriends said, ‘Why would you want to risk even that one cancer cell? You have a child.’ “
