Bella Thorne is taking it al off!

The Famous in Love star recently bared her bod in a nude photo shoot. Shot by Damon Baker, the sultry spread featured the 19-year-old posing naked in her bathtub as she took a dip in blue-tinted water.
The actress accessorized her birthday suit with an armful of bracelets and wristbands she acquired from the Electric Daisy Carnival music festival.
“In case you were wondering my bracelet says ‘dubstep,'” she captioned on shot.

The portrait’s photographer wrote on his personal Instagram, “My art is not limited to the pictures I create but also to the reaction it creates. When you create reaction, ideas are turned upside down, and everybody looks at things in a different way.”
According to recent reports, Bella is back to hooking up with Scott Disick after ditching the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star in Cannes this May. “He’s still hanging out with Bella, but hooking up with other girls as well,” a source told People. “Bella loves to party and is soaking it up.”
