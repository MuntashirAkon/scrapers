Olivia Munn and Aaron Rodgers are no longer an item.

A source close to People reports that the couple “amicably ended their relationship of three years” but “remains close friends and wish nothing but the best for each other moving forward.”
Munn’s relationship with the Green Bay Packers quarterback began at the end of 2014. It was rumored that they were engaged at the beginning of this year when Munn was spotted wearing a diamond ring on that finger.

Rodgers stuck by Munn’s side after it was alleged that she further strained his relationships with his father and younger brother Jordan, who competed for JoJo Fletcher’s season of The Bachelorette.
“Olivia doesn’t really have anything to do with it,” a source told People at the time. “This is not her issue; this is the Rodgers family issue.”
