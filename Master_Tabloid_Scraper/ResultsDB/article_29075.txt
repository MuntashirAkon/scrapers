A That’s So Raven spinoff has officially been ordered by the Disney Channel.

Deadline reports that the new multi-camera series, Raven’s Home, will continue the storylines of Raven Baxter (Raven-Symoné) and Chelsea Daniels (Anneliese Van Der Pol), who are now “divorced single mothers raising their two separate families in one chaotic, but fun household full of friends.”
Production is set to begin this month in Los Angeles and the series will premiere later this year. Other cast mates include Issac Brown (black-ish), Navia Robinson (Being Mary Jane), and Sky Katz (America’s Got Talent).
Symoné announced that she was developing this spinoff when she left ABC’s The View in 2016. She will also serve as an executive producer of the series.

Gary Marsh, the President and Chief Creative Officer of the Disney Channel, expressed his excitement about the project in the following statement.
“There is only one Raven — and for over 25 years, she has blessed audiences around the world with the greatest gift of all — the pure, unadulterated joy of laugh-out-loud funny. After being a part of over 20 different Disney projects, we are thrilled to be bringing Raven home to Disney Channel once again.”
That’s So Raven ran on Disney from 2003-2007.
