Olivia Newton-John revealed a bit of news about a Grease reunion that’s currently in the works ahead of the film’s 40th anniversary. Before she accepted the Icon Award at the Fame Awards in Las Vegas, she noted that she and John Travolta are “thinking up ways” to make it happen.
“Nothing to announce yet,” Newton-John continued. “Forty years anniversary of Grease, which I can’t believe. Time goes so fast. It is so exciting.”
The actress said in her speech that, even as a seasoned actress, she still needs to warm up when she performs.
“You have to keep that muscle toned and that’s important and I love to sing,” said Newton-John. “Singing is an expression of yourself, so I love singing and performing. The traveling thing gets a bit tiring of course, but as I say, I have a very lucky life.”
