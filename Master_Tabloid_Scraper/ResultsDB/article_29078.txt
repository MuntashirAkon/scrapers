As it turns out, there’s a whole category of Academy Awards that we never thought about voting for until now.

It’s so fun to look at the best and worst fashion moments from the red carpet, but for every jewel that is returned by the end of the night, there’s a hilarious candid moment that was pushed to the wayside. We decided to preserve those moments this year by putting them all in a handy-dandy gallery that you can click through at the top of the page.
