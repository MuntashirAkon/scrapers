It may be spring, but Jessica Simpson is already dreaming of summer.

The mom-of-two slipped back into her Daisy Dukes — again — this weekend for some fun in the sun with gal pal Odette Annable. In an Instagram photo shared by her friend, Simpson flaunted her bod in a revealing bikini top paired with a crocheted cover-up and chunky high heels.

On Friday (March 17, 2017), the 36-year-old shared a behind-the-scenes video from her photo shoot for the spring campaign of her fashion line. In the short clip, Simpson also channeled her inner Daisy Duke in skimpy denim bottoms.
Seriously, have we gone back in time to 2005? This is giving us major Dukes of Hazzard flashbacks.
