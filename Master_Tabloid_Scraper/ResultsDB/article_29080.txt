When it boils down to it, the Academy Awards ceremonies are really just annual proms for the famous people working in Hollywood.

We watch the arrivals on E! to see which gowns made it from the runway to the red carpet and lose track of how many tailored Tom Ford suits parade on by. We bite our nails when someone nears a wardrobe malfunction and gasp (then laugh) when someone takes a gentle tumble, but in its entirety, the Oscars have always been a celebration of the beauty in film, acting, score composition, directing, and screenwriting. This is why we feel it’s our duty to kick off tonight’s commemoration of visually pleasing things by presenting you with a collection of the hottest couples that have hit the Oscars red carpet throughout the years.

Inside, you will find a timeline of our favorite pairs that stole the show on the carpet before they even made it inside. We take a look at those who are still together — Chrissy Teigen and John Legend, Jason Sudeikis and Oliva Wilde — and reflect on those who have since parted ways, like Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. Take a dive in the pool of good genes by launching the gallery at the top of the page.
The 89th annual Academy Awards begin tonight (Feb. 26, 2017) at 8:30 p.m. EST on ABC.
