In true Olivia Palermo fashion the style star has, yet again, expertly paired some incredibly high-end pieces with some low-cost gems (and you'd never be able to tell they weren't designer.)She attended a show in Paris wearing a feathered, sequin-encrusted Elie Saab jacket and embellished kitten heels then topped off the outfit with her newest accessory obsession: a pair of blue RumbaTime sunglasses—that just so happen to be $40.And Olivia's not the first celeb to be seen rocking the insanely-affordable lenses, Pretty Little Liars' Lucy Hale made a coffee run in hers and country singer Kelsea Ballerini wore them on stage while performing at a festival in Alabama.

To emphasize just how versatile the acrylic glasses are, here's Lucy rocking an off-the-shoulder top and black skinny jeans—proving they also perfectly compliment even the most casual of outfits. Try yours this summer with jean shorts, and mix up the color! 

Then Kelsea chose to wear hers with a glittering silver top and leather hot pants. Clearly, anything goes.Keep scrolling to check out the exact pair and some similar options!Shop the Look
