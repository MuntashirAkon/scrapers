It’s like we’re back in 2005.

Jessica Simpson is channeling her Dukes of Hazzard character in a new Instagram photo, slipping back into a pair of itsy-bitsy denim shorts. The 36-year-old pairs her famous Daisy Dukes with a white tank, a grey cardigan with embroidered designs, colorful wedges and heart-shaped sunglasses.
“Hello sunshine ☀️,” she captions the snap.

The sunny shot follows the unveiling of Simpsons’ new spring collection from her fashion line, in which she’s seen, yet again, in a pair of denim shorts for its ad campaign.
According to a press release, Simpson was “inspired by the essence of travel” for this season’s pieces.
It feels a little like deja vu, no?
