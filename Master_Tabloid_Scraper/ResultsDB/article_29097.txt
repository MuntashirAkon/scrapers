Former Miss USA Olivia Jordan and Model Allie Ayers Hit Miami Swim Week for S.I. Photo Shoot/nFormer Miss USA Olivia JordanÂ and model Allie Ayers partnered up in Miami Beach ... in pastel swimsuits incredibly easy on the eyes. The bubbly blondes teamed up for a Sports Illustrated photo shoot during Miami Swim Week ... and they definitely work well together. Allie opted for a 1-piece instead of a bikini ... but still managed to reveal more than Olivia. Jordan was crowned Miss USA in 2015 and went on to place second runner-up in Miss Universe. Allie's one of 15 finalists in S.I. Swimsuit's open casting competition. Always good to lean on friends ... especially half naked ones./n
