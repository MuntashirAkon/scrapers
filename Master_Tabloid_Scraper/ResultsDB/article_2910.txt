Jessica Simpson isn’t ready to retire her short shorts just yet.

Almost 12 years since the release of 2005’s Dukes of Hazard, the singer-turned-actress-turned-designer is slipping back into the iconic Daisy Dukes for her fashion label’s Spring 2017 campaign. In photo shot by James Macari, the 36-year-old looks to have still got it as she poses in a pair of jean shorts and matching jacket.

According to a press release, Simpson was “inspired by the essence of travel” for this season’s offerings.
Aside from denim, the collection will feature knitted pieces like an orange crop top and cream-colored cardigan. As seen in Simpson’s new ad, the line also includes a lacy LBD perfect for date nights.

While the mom-of-two may look comfortable being back in her skimpy shorts, Simpson admittedly only wears comfy clothes these days. “[I’m] normally in sweats,” she told People last year. “I wear sweatpants but I have to wear heels with them.”
Maybe she can include them in next season’s collection?
