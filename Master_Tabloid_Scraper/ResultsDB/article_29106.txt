Aaron Rodgers On Golf Date with 'Baywatch' Actress Kelly Rohrbach (PHOTO)/nAaron Rodgers was spotted at an L.A. golf course Thursday with a very attractive blonde -- and we're told it's  "Baywatch " actress Kelly Rohrbach. Just a few weeks after reports surfaced he split with longtime girlfriend Olivia Munn -- the Green Bay Packers quarterback hit up the Westchester Golf Course.  Witnesses tell us Rodgers and Rohrbach appeared to be holding hands and looked flirty -- until they noticed people watching them. Both Rodgers and Rohrbach are avid golfers -- so maybe it was just a platonic trip to the links. Then again, maybe not./n
