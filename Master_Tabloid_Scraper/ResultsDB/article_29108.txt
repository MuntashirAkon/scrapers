Aaron Rodgers and Jordy Nelson: All-Pro Groomsmen At Randall Cobb's Wedding/nGreen Bay Packers receiver Randall Cobb is officially a married man ... and he had a little help from a couple superstar groomsmen -- Aaron Rodgers and Jordy Nelson﻿. The Pro Bowler married his longtime girlfriend, Aiyda Ghahramani, in New York over the weekend ... with his Packer teammates and other pros like Prince Amukamara in attendance at The Pierre hotel. 250 of the couple's closest friends and family attended the ceremony and celebrated with a reception, according to The Knot. Something worth noting: Aiyda and Olivia Munn became close friends while she dated Rodgers (they even spent this past Christmas together) ... but it's unclear if she was at the wedding and we can't find any photos of her there. /n
