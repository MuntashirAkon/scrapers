The Last Jedi — perhaps a nod to the ending of The Force Awakens — follows the events of preceding the last film. Mark Hamill, Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Adam Driver, Oscar Isaac, Lupita Nyong’o, Domhnall Gleeson, Anthony Daniels, Gwendoline Christie and Andy Serkis are all set to return. Meanwhile, newcomers Benicio Del Toro, Laura Dern and Kelly Marie Tran are slated to join the cast.
This will be Carrie Fisher’s last Star Wars film. As previously reported, the late actress finished filming her scenes as Princess Leia before her untimely death in December.
