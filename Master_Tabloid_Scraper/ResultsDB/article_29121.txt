I gotta feeling he's gonna be strong after uniting with Bob Kraft over the high-five fail. People haven't high-fived me my entire life and I turned out OK. "Darren Sproles --  "He's short. I'm short. United we stand. "Fantasy Bust:Aaron Rodgers --  "I'm worried about Aaron Rodgers because I think he gets psyched out by the media. And I think all those stories about Tony Romo and Jessica Simpson are probably messing with his mind. And the more he thinks about it, the more it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.  "He should be focusing on the Bears ... not Olivia Munn. "Remember, head to Draftkings to get a shot to win $10k by participating in this week's $100k Play-Action Pool.
