Chrissy Teigen revealed that she’s more comfortable posing completely naked than in a swimsuit.
“I’ve never been much of a beach girl,” the model said in an interview with ELLE Australia. “I grew up in Washington — it’s freezing in that ocean. So it’s out of my comfort zone, and it’s the craziest thing that I’m probably most known for Sports Illustrated when that’s how I feel the most uncomfortable.”

Teigen also revealed she didn’t think she was sexy until after she gave birth to daughter Luna. “I always felt like a bit of a tomboy, and I never looked at my body as particularly sexual — I wasn’t a curvy girl,” she said. “But to be able to see my body afterward, and of course, you get, like, hips. Finally, for the first time, I feel like I have a bit more of a womanly figure.”
