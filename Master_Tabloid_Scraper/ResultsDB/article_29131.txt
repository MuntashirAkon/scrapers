The source revealed that the fight escalated when 44-year-old Michael, who filed for divorce in May, was in the shower and Jules took his phone.

Jules, 35, then placed the phone call to 9-1-1.
The source said Michael then left their home to take their son, Jagger, to camp.
“She has a history of calling 9-1-1 in front of the kids,” the source told Radar. Jules last called the police on June 16, claiming she did not feel safe.
Officer Arlene Muniz in the New York City Public Information Office confirmed to Radar that the police were called to the apartment.

The incident report in the case read, “She stated her and her husband had a verbal argument. He began video recording her with his phone. He grabbed her by the arm and twisted it while he was standing on her feet so she could not move.”
“This was deemed harassment,” Officer Muniz told Radar, noting that Michael will not be arrested. “This did not constitute a crime because harassment isn’t a violation.”
“This is an attempt by Jules to paint a picture that she lives in a violent home for the judge for the hearing in September,” the source claimed. /n
