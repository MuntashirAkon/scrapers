 'Would You Not Think That Would Affect You?' Family Friend Asks Of 'Whitney' Biopic That.../n
A family friend of Bobby Brown says Angela Bassett‘s biopic of the late singer negatively impacted her ailing daughter, Bobbi Kristina Brown.
“Would you not think that would affect you?” music manager Debra Antney asked Extra TV of Lifetime’s Whitney, which aired exactly two weeks prior to Bobbi Kristina being found unconscious in a bathtub Jan 31. “Everyone has a breaking point.”
Bassett, who directed the controversial movie, has not publicly commented or tweeted since the 21-year-old’s downturn in health.

Antney told Extra TV that the TV film (which starred Yaya DaCosta as Houston and Arlen Escarpeta as Bobby Brown) was just one in the long line of factors that burdened Bobbi Kristina, born into the searing spotlight of celebrity.
“That baby has not stood a chance since she was conceived, just about — she was talked about, ridiculed,” Antney said. “All the people that had all those things to say about her … that’s a baby, a 21-year-old baby.”
Rosie Perez echoed similar sentiments earlier this week, saying that “it must have hurt [Bobbi Kristina] deeply to watch that.

“We forget these people are human beings — we put them into the tabloids, and we forget they’re human beings.”

Antney said the odds were against Bobbi Kristina in the wake of Houston’s death, as she had “to constantly listen to things, and to still have to deal with the death of her mom.
“And every five minutes they are posting something about her mother — and never anything good.”
As far as Bobbi Kristina is concerned, Antney implored the public to “leave the negative behind” and “start putting positive thoughts into the universe.” /n
