Spokeswoman Arlene Winnick said ABC show producers chose the beautiful dwelling after looking at many other high-end homes. 
“Ben is from Sonoma and they wanted to do a show in Sonoma,” Winnick told Zillow. “So they went on our site and called us and said, ‘This is what we’re looking for.’  We narrowed it down to six properties and took them around to them.
“What’s great about the property is that anyone can rent it — but Ben is not included!”
The Bachelor airs on ABC Monday at 8/7c on ABC.
