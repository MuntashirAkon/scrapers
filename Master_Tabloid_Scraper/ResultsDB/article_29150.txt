Croweology/n
This week, The Black Crowes offer up Croweology, a two-disc retrospective featuring newly-recorded acoustic versions of favorites from the band’s impressive 20-year canon along with a cover of the Gram Parsons’ classic ballad She.
“Before the band that dares dream out loud puts it down for a while, we are proud to give you our Croweology,” says Crowes frontman Chris Robinson. “And celebrate what has been, what is now and whatever will be.”
And though The Brothers Robinson definitely still have their own brand of flavorful Southern-fried rawk—complete with Rich’s memorable guitar parts and Chris’ vocal twang—they’re pulling a Jay-Z and claiming an indefinite hiatus after the rather lengthy Say Goodnight to the Bad Guys 2010 Tour, which kicks off on August 13 in Milwaukee and wraps up in late December in San Francisco.
“After this tour we are going to take some much needed time to spend with our families,” says Rich. “But for now, we are very much looking forward to a great year of touring.”
