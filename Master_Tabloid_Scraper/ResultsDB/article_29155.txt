Sean Spicer Says Donald Trump's Trip Abroad Was 'Extraordinary' & Twitter Is Not Having It!/n

It's the return of the Spicey!
Sean Spicer made his first appearance in the White House press room since Donald Trump's trip overseas — a trip the press secretary says was nothing short of "extraordinary," "unprecedented," and "historic."
Obviously, Spicer wants us all to believe everything is A-OK despite the shit storm that's going on behind the scenes.

He opened the White House media briefing by reciting:
