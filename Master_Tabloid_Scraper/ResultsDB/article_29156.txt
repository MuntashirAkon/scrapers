But Kimmy has gone ahead and put her face on the Virgin Mary for a emoji, and people are NOT okay with it.
The reality star tweeted the Kimoji as part of her new series of merch on Thursday, showcasing it prominently among all the others (below).

Twitter was quick to call her on it, both the religious and non-religious alike: 

@KimKardashian I don't think this is a fun emoji, for Catholics the Virgin Mary is Sacred.

@KimKardashian That is the most disrespectful thing i've ever seen.

@ItsJohnnyCyrus @KimKardashian Or you could not appropriate my religion. The Blessed Mother is not a joke to us. And her image isn't to be used for your disposal & mockery

Kim didn't respond to any of the fans' comments, naturally.
Also on Thursday, the 36-year-old was spotted out in LA in a tight black dress with the Virgin Mary's face on it, presumably for a photo shoot, so this is obviously something that's dear to her at the moment.
Do YOU think this is offensive, Perezcious readers???
