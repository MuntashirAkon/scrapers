Carrie Fisher will appear in the next installment of the Star Wars franchise, Variety reports. The late actress, who played Princess Leia in the series, completed shooting scenes for the upcoming flick prior to her death on Tuesday (Dec. 27, 2016).
Filming wrapped in July, and the project is currently in post-production.
Titled Star Wars: Episode VIII for now and directed by Rian Johnson, the sequel will be last Star Wars film to star Fisher. She was originally slated to appear in the franchise’s ninth movie as well, though production for that has not begun.

According to Variety, Fisher also finished voice-acting work for two Family Guy episodes before her passing, reprising her role as the uptight boss of Seth MacFarlene’s Peter Griffin. No premiere dates for those episodes have been announced.
Before her death, Fisher had a recurring role on the Amazon/Channel 4 sit-com Catastrophe as the mother Rob Delaney’s character. Fisher will reportedly appear in one of the show’s six episode. The 60-year-old was on a flight returning from her work on the comedy in London when she suffered a massive heart attack.
