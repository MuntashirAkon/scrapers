The six lovely stars of Pretty Little Liars decided to do something extra special for the end of the popular series.
To celebrate the final day of shooting on the series finale, stars Lucy Hale, Shay Mitchell, Troian Bellisario, Ashley Benson, Janel Parrish, and Sasha Pieterse each got matching tattoos on their “shhhh” fingers with their respective characters’ first initials.
“We got the Shhhhhhh immortalized. #pllforever,” Parrish wrote alongside a shot of the six women lined up with their index fingers to their lips.
“This happened,” wrote Hale with a pic of all the fingers together. “We couldn’t not get tattoos to commemorate the show! And obviously on our ‘shh’ finger.”



This happened. Thank you @shamrocksocialclub for taking care of us. We couldn’t not get tattoos to commemorate the show! And obviously on our “shh” finger 😏

The cast members also were gifted with matching Cartier rings from showrunner I. Marlene King. “All my women,” wrote Bellisario with a photo of their bejeweled hands. “And the rings that bind us. Thank you @imarleneking for so much more than this.”
