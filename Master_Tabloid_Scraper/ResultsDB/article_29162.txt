“It’s been an honor to work with such a talented cast and crew over the last seven years. We are a family, and it will be hard to say goodbye to a show that has made such an impact on young audiences and been a mouthpiece for cultural change. I’m excited for fans to finally have all of their questions answered, and I believe they will be satisfied with the wild ride that is our last ten episodes,” King said in a statement (via E! News).

“It’s been such an amazing chapter of our lives and we’re so glad that you guys could share it with us,” Hale, who plays Aria Montgomery, said in the video. “But you know all good things must come to an end. These last 10 episodes are pretty crazy. We’re going out with a bang.”
The final 10 episodes of the hit series will premiere in April 2017, and it will all come to a head in the two-hour series finale in June. Literally, the only bright side to this news is that we will finally get ALL the answers we’ve been patiently awaiting for seven years.
