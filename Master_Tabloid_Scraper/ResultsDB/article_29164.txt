She’s already got a gold medal and Kim Kardashian’s approval. Now, Simone Biles is about to get a taste of Hollywood!

The 19-year-old scored a set invitation to Pretty Little Liars after I. Marlene King, the Freeform series’ showrunner, learned that the Olympian was a fan. Following Biles’ impressive 62.198 points victory in the women’s individual final, King offered the gymnast a chance to visit her show’s California set once she returns to the States.
