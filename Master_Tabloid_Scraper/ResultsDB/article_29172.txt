Royals, start your engines!
The world’s most glamorous auto race, the Monaco F1 GP, commemorated its diamond anniversary over the weekend, turning up the wattage with appearances by several celebrities and, of course, Monaco’s royal couple. 
Princess Charlene, who attended Sunday’s big event alongside husband Prince Albert, stunned in a fitted sleeveless scarlet Akris gown, continuing her red dress trend at the event.

Charlene, who was born in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) and raised in South Africa, recently spoke out about life as a royal mom of two. In a rare television interview during her five-day trip to South Africa last month, she opened up about her strong ties to Africa.

“I am African,” she told Eyewitness News, “this is my home. It will always be. It’s in my heart, it’s in my veins and it always will be. I can’t wait for them to come here. I can’t wait to introduce them to Africa.” 
When asked how her 2-year-old twins, Princess Gabriella and Prince Jacques, were by a local Johannesburg radio station, she said candidly: “Actually, they’re really a handful. They’re beautiful, they’re smart. Full of energy. I really hope that in the next couple of years I’ll be able to bring them to South Africa, that would be an amazing moment for me.”
