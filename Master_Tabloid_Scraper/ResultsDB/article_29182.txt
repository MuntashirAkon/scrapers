Carrie Preston is ready to bring The Good Wife's Elsbeth Tascioni back to life…so what's the hold up?Preston, who won an Emmy for the role in 2013 and is up for another for her work in The Good Wife's final season, became a fan-favorite as the eccentric lawyer.

"It's the best character I've ever gotten to play, no offense to Arlene on True Blood, but Elsbeth was like a real gift…I would take any opportunity to go and bring her back to life again," she told us.You hear that, CBS?
