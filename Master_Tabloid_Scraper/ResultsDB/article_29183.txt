Only HBO's True Blood could get away with releasing a promotional spot for season three that has precisely three words in it...and send us all in a tizzy.That new promo, starring Alexander Skarsgård (Eric) and those three little words, is below—along with a second teaser, in which Alex says precisely zero because he's too busy undressing us with his eyes.So what does this new teaser mean for the fate of a certain fan-favorite Merlotte waitress, and the much-rumored death this season? Spoiler Alert:

Sources tell me that a female will die this season on True Blood.That, coupled with the news that Carrie Preston (Arlene Fowler) has been cast on CBS' The Good Wife for multiple episodes—while according to Ryan Kwanten True Blood is "halfway through shooting the season" has us fans (rightly) concerned for Arlene's well-being. Especially since Carrie (Michael Emerson's real-life wife) told me "Something shocking happens to Arlene."In the promo above, some of you are asking, could the gun-wielding Merlotte waitress be Arlene? Clearly whoever she is, she's stepped in some deep and dangerous doo-doo, but the waitress has blond hair, and though Carrie is a blonde in real life, Arlene is a redhead.So for the time being, let's hold out what little hope we have left that Arlene will survive. After all, she and Terry (Todd Lowe) just got together, and will be very much in love when the show returns. So killing Arlene off would be...tragic.And, ugh, just the sort of thing True Blood would do.Guesses on who'll bite the dust when True Blood returns to HBO on June 13? Hit the comments.
