Now that The World According to Paris has been kneecapped for ratings so low they make Homekeepers With Arlene Rippy's Nielsen numbers look like the M*A*S*H finale, Paris Hilton is forced to actually take her vapid, glossy schtick to another world altogether.Meaning, she's exporting her talents to India, a country apparently so deprived of entertainment they're willing to put up with her...
