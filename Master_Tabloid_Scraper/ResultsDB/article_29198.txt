Foxy Pleas Out of Brooklyn Beatdown/nJust moments ago, Foxy Brown pleaded out of her Brooklyn Blackberry beatdown case, and -- believe it or not -- might be clear of any court dates for the forseeable future.Brown pled guilty to one misdemeanor charge of menacing in Brooklyn Criminal Court today, and the prosecution threw out the felony assault charge stemming from a 2007 incident in which Foxy allegedly smacked Arlene Raymond with her mobile device.She was sentenced to time served, and a letter of apology was submitted. Now that she's also pled out of her Florida case, the legal radar is more or less clear for Foxy.We're also told that someone attempted to serve Foxy with a lawsuit -- we hear from Raymond -- but given what happened today, that it might get dropped.
