Kim Kardashian Mocked On Leasing Company Sign/n
“Construction set to finish faster than a Kim Kardashian marriage!” is the outlandish claim posted on a huge sign outside a building nearing completion in Toronto.
It was put up by the leasing company handling rentals in the new Bay Adelaide Centre.
The funny smack down is, of course, a reference to Kim‘s 72-day marriage to NBA player Kris Humphries.  Their hard-fought divorce was finalized in June.

Kim may also be likely to fight to have the sign taken down, now that she’s happily moved on to Kanye West and is new mom to daughter North.
She and West and their infant are currently holed up in mama Kris Jenner‘s Calabasas mansion while the momager negotiates a deal for first photos of the baby.
