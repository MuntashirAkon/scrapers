A jewelry company has gone viral thanks to its perverted slogan (above). "Something for every hole"??? HA!!!
That would also be an excellent slogan for a dildo company. *smirk*
Nadine McCarthy Kahane, CEO of the marketing company Stone & Strand, told Buzzfeed News the slogan was intentionally provocative, and written by a team of young women with "an irreverent outlook." She said: 

"We did write the banner deliberately, because we believe that in the same way men have historically been granted room in our discourse to make playful references to their sexuality, women should have that same freedom."
Hmmmâ€¦was it really deliberate, or are they just covering their butts?
Well, the actual designer of the brand, Maria Tash, said she did NOT personally approve the message:

This is from a 3rd party without our approval. We've asked to change it, we prefer to think we have something for every piercing! ðŸ˜‚ Thanks. https://t.co/FHvqE9IGxH

People have found the whole thing hilarious though, and encouraged the brand to keep the slogan!

@margeincharge Oh my God! I actually grasped at invisible pearls.

@RatPiper @MariaTash @margeincharge That's right. I'd never heard of Maria Tash before. Now I have, and I have already formed a fantastic view of the brandðŸ˜œ

I can imagine someone in marketing, retirement in a week, cracking their knuckles and saying "let's go out with a bang, shall we?" https://t.co/Bxz5t58ohY
