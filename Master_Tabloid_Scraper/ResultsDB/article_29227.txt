Katherine Heigl and her husband Josh Kelley quietly welcomed their newborn son at the end of December, expanding their family to five!

A rep confirmed to People that Heigl gave birth to a baby boy, Joshua Bishop Kelly Jr. on Tuesday, Dec. 20, 2016. He is Heigl and Kelley’s third child — a little brother to Adalaide, 4, and Naleigh, 8.
Heigl confirmed her pregnancy in June in an official statement that read, “The Kelley clan is thrilled to announce that we are expecting a third addition to our family. Naleigh and Adalaide could not be more excited to welcome their new sibling into the fold, and Josh and I are overflowing with joy and gratitude.”

Heigl adopted Naleigh from South Korea in September 2009 when she was 9 months old. Adelaide was adopted domestically in 2012. Heigl previously explained her name choice for her youngest daughter as such: “Adalaide because of my great-grandmother, Marie after my middle name, and Hope because that is what the process became.”



Happy New Years Eve from the Kelley girls! Here’s to a spectacular, joyful abundant 2017 for all! 🎉👏😘
