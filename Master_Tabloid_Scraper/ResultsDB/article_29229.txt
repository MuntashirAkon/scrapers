Adele will be performing in Australia for the first time in her career next year as she extends her multi-city tour Down Under.

The 25 singer announced the Australia Live 2017 leg of her tour in a handwritten note on Twitter. “G’Day it’s me,” began the message. “I was wondering if after 10 years in the game you’d finally like to meet me in Brisbane, Sydney, Perth, Melbourne and Adelaide,” she wrote. “Yep! I am coming Down Under. In the Round, outdoors and upgrading myself to stadiums to make sure I get to see as many of you as possible.”
