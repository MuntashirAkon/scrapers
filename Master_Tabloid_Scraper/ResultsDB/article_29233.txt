Sam Smith has cancelled the remaining dates of his In The Lonely Hour tour after suffering a hemorrhage on his vocal chords.
The singer got the bad news while on tour in Australia, where he not only had to cancel all of his upcoming shows, but also a scheduled appearance Sunday night at the TV industry’s annual Logie Awards.

Smith says he’s ‘deeply, deeply saddened’ by the news in a statement issued on Instagram on Tuesday (Apr. 28, 2015).
I am deeply, deeply saddened to tell my Australian fans, I have to cancel my Australian tour. I have been vocally exhausted for a while now however last night in Sydney I had a small hemorrhage on my vocal cords. The doctors have told me I need to fully rest until my vocal chords have healed, otherwise this could become a huge long-term issue. I am so sorry to all who have bought tickets, I truly am. This kills me.
Smith had already performed to sold-out crowds in Auckland and Brisbane, and had a second show in Sydney and dates in Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth to come.
The 22-year-old even got a new tattoo in a sign of his dedication to his fans. The tattoo comes right after he set sail in Sydney, Australia, showing off his new, slim figure (see gallery). We wonder if he reached his weight goal.
