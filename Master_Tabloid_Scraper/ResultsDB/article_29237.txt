John Mayer’s been talking about his love for Beyonce’s song “XO” for quite some time now.
In April, the 36-year-old singer songwriter tweeted:

The best thing about Beyoncé? The break in her voice on the first “baby, love me lights out” in XO. Real and raw.

Mayer has since taken “XO” to the studio, recording a cover of the song with his guitar and harmonica.

Artwork for the single was also made.

This isn’t the first time Mayer has crooned “Baby, love me lights out.” Last month, during a concert in Adelaide, Australia, Mayer surprised the crowd when he performed “XO” in jeans and a questionable blue-and-white polka dot shirt.





Earlier this week, Mayer was officially announced as the headliner for the Made in America festival in Los Angeles, along with Imagine Dragons. The Los Angeles show — in its inaugural run — will play at the same time as the annual gathering in Philadelphia, where Kanye West and Kings of Leon will take center stage. The two-day bicoastal festival kicks off Aug. 30.
