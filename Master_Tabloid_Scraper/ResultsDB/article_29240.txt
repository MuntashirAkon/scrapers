EXCLUSIVE! Reign's Adelaide Kaine Opens Up About This Season's Violence and Rape/n
Let the record show: Adelaide Kane has been earning those dollars on Reign.As the CW's historical drama closes out its second season, we caught up with the 24-year-old Australian actress, who is faced with one of TV's most challenging roles, for her thoughts on the show's controversial subject matter this season, including episode 209 in which her character Mary was brutally raped. It was a storyline no one saw coming—and rocked many viewers."Some of the more violent content was really surprising for me," she tells me, adding that "it was took a lot of prep…and that particular scene was a very hard day for me."

While other actresses might shy away from—or even refuse—to go to such harrowing places, Adelaide simply explains, "You gotta do what they write you."She also credits her producers, including executive producer Laurie McCarthy, for laying the groundwork that helped the process along. "I feel like it was handled well," Kane says, "and they were very communicative with us, especially 209, there were many conversations leading up to and after about how we'd like to handle Mary's storyline after that, and that it would be handled sensitively and appropriately. It's been great. There's been a lot of communication about some of the more gory details of the show. And I think that considering that we're set in quote-unquote historical times it gives us a little more leeway to show the brutality of humanity which is cool, you know, besides the dresses and the shoes.""[Rape] happened and it was awful," she adds. "As awful as we made it, it was as awful, if not worse."Press play on the video above to see what else Adelaide Kane has to say about the season two atrocities behind her, and what she knows about what's ahead for season three.
