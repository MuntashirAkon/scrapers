Well, that's not a good start to a show.Rihanna was more than an hour late to her concert in Adelaide, Australia, on Thursday, Sept. 26, and was met by boos instead of cheers when she finally took the stage, according to The Australian.RiRi did not give the crowd an explanation for her tardiness, but did say that it took her a "long time to get back to Australia.""Adelaide, what the f--k, I'm finally here," the 25-year-old singer said to her fans. "And I now remember how crazy my Australian fans are," she continued.

The Barbadian singer showed no signs of trouble at the show, tweeting post-performance "#ADELAIDE Thank you so much!!!"But some fans weren't as forgiving on Twitter."@rihanna thanks for a disappointing show last night..as if #Adelaide doesnt suck enough already #igotdressedforthat #late," @TBomb_Moritz said."#whilewaitingforrihanna I auditioned for X Factor, won it, became a pop star myself and turned up late to my own concert," @petstarr joked.Next stop on the Diamonds World Tour: Brisbane on Saturday, Sept. 28.Â  Better show up on time, RiRi!
