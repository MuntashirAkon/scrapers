 Aside from Hook in a uniform (#blessed), the trailer also gives fans their first look at the new characters joining the revamped season seven: Dania Ramirez as Cinderella, Rose Reynolds as Alice, Reign's Adelaide Kane's as Cinderella's stepsister Drizella, Mekia Cox as Tiana and Gabriella Anwar's Lady Tremaine (aka Cinderella's wicked stepmother). And The Walking Dead's Andrew J. West makes his debut as the grown-up version of Henry (Gilmore).And fret not, we do get quick glimpses of Regina (Lana Parrilla) and Rumple (Robert Carlyle), although, fair warning, they really are quick. Still, anyone else get chills when the trailer promised the following: "A new curse awakens. A new hero rises. The legend of good vs. evil reborn."
