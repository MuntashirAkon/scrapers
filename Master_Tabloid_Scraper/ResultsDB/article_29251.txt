Kim Kardashian -- Publicly Humiliated By Construction Workers/nOne erects buildings, the other erects ... well, you know ... but it seems a construction company in Canada is taking a shot at Kim Kardashian with a hilarious street sign, and TMZ has the pic. The Bay Adelaide Centre in Toronto, Ontario is currently under construction -- but in an effort to alleviate public concern, building honchos posted a sign telling the locals,  "Construction set to finish faster than a Kim Kardashian marriage. "Ha. We're told the sign was created by legendary comedy group Second City ... and is part of an ongoing series of jokey boards that will be used until the project is complete. For the record, the construction WON'T be completed fasted than a Kim K marriage -- 'cause her union with Kris Humphries was over in 72 days ... and the project won't end until 2015. Bummer, eh./n
