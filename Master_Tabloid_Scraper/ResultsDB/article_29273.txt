In an apparent jab at Beador, 53 – who has shown fans during these past three episodes that she is struggling immensely after gaining more than 40 pounds since last season – Peggy posted this photo on her social media, claiming that she, too, is going on a diet!6 of 9“Peggy gets into it with Shannon and tells her that she is pathetic for blaming any of the other women for her personal issues,” the source told Radar. “She doesn’t completely side with anyone though. Peggy spends the entire season playing to the beat of her own drum even though the ladies are constantly trying to get her to choose sides. But because she came in as Lydia’s friend, she will always take her side!”
