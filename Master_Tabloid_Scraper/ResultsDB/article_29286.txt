Wedding bells are in Kirsten Dunst’s future!

The actress is engaged to her Fargo co-star, Jesse Plemons. Page Six reports that the proposal went down some time during the Golden Globes weekend.
Dunst, 34, and Plemons, 28, first met during the second season of the FX show. The two played Peggy and Ed Blumquist, high school sweethearts who got involved in a mob war when they tried to cover up a hit-and-run.
Though the couple never spoke about their offscreen relationship, dating reports first surfaced when Dunst and Plemons were photographed kissing last May. At the time, Dunst had just ended a four-year relationship with actor Garrett Hedlund.
Earlier this month, Dunst sparked engagement rumors when she was spotted wearing a diamond ring on that finger at the Palm Springs Film Festival. She was later seen sporting the same bauble while appearing on The Late, Late Show with James Corden days later.

Last year, Dunst revealed that she prefers to be with guys who are more “old fashioned” in their ways.
“I want a guy to pay for dinner and open the door for me. I love the masculine,” she told Net-a-Porter’s The Edit. “I’ve dated men who had more of a feminine side and it didn’t work.”
