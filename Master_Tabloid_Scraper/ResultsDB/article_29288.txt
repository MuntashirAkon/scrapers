Here’s all the info on this spooky new sequel!

Ed and Lorraine Warren are back with another terrifying supernatural case in The Conjuring 2. If you’ve seen the original, then you might have some idea what to expect, but be warned: this new installment doubles down on the visual effects and the scares.
Here are all the details just in case you decide to give this creepfest a try this weekend! 

Who’s in it?
Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga portray the real-life couple. Frances O’Connor plays Peggy Hodgson, the single mother of four children, and Madison Wolfe plays one of her daughters who begins to have terrifying experiences in their home. 

What’s it about?
The vengeful spirit of an old man plagues a family in Enfield, England. The case causes a flurry of media attention and the Catholic Church sends the Warren couple to investigate. They soon come to believe that Janet, one of the young girls, is possessed by a demon.





Why should I care?
If having the living daylights scared out of you sounds like a good way to escape the summer heat, then this thrill ride is just what the doctor ordered!
