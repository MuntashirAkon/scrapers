“Because in what world is dating your dead girlfriends niece more acceptable than dating a guy?”

Just days after #GiveElsaAGirlfriend was trending on Twitter, movie fans have set their sights on another fantasy character they think deserves a proper relationship. #GiveCaptainAmericaABoyfriend began trending on Twitter earlier today (May. 24, 3016), and the pleas for Steve Rodgers to find his soulmate in a male partner haven’t let up.

Besides the fact that it’s about damn time we see more same sex couples on the big screen, particularly in superhero movies, the most compelling argument seems to be Captain America’s love for his best friend Bucky Barnes. The two have continually risked their lives for one other, and have even turned their back on their friends,family, and the entire world for each other. If that’s not a Romeo and Juliet style love story, we don’t know what is.
