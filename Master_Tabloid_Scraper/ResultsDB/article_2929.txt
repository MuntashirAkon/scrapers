Watch Daisy Ridley's Grueling Workout in 60 Seconds/n
There are two words we'd use to describe Daisy Ridley: Bad. Ass.The Star Wars actress doesn't just kick ass playing Rey in the film, she also brings that dominating demeanorÂ with her to the gym, too!Sharing several videos on her social media accounts of her day-to-day workouts, Daisy makes us feel exhausted simply just watching her. From weighted squats to plyometrics, box jumps to heavy curls, we now know how she keeps her body in tip-top shape: lots of hard freaking work!

The actress is a big fan of sharing her workouts going into the weekends in a post she calls #FitnessFriday.For example, today she shared a post and wrote, "IT'S THE RETURN OF #fitnessfriday !!!!! This doesn't look that intense BUT today consisted of: warm up, 3 rounds of activators, 2 circuits of 3 rounds and a finisher of 20 seconds on 10 seconds on of 5 rounds."She added, "Really struggled and wanted to give up, @gravzy12 got me THROUGH! Feeling the strongest I've ever been! #musclyandproud (the man we say goodbye to during this is one of the incredible chiropractors that keep our bodies moving through all this training!) #excusemylanguageattheend #iwasFINISHED #timetonap #gainzgainzandmoregainz."Keep it up, girlfriend!
