Love is still in the air.

It looks like Katy Perry and her sweetie Orlando Bloom are moving right on past those pesky rumors he was cheating with Selena Gomez.
Last weekend, Bloom was snapped with Gomez in Las Vegas, perhaps kissing, perhaps canoodling – no one can tell for absolute sure from the grainy pics and video – leaving many to believe the romance between Bloom and Perry was in trouble.

This weekend, however, Katy and Orlando were in Cannes, looking cozy and loving and soaking up the sun on board a yacht, near the Hotel Du Cap Eden Roc. See the pics here.
Earlier that afternoon, Bloom was seen jumping on a speedboat to head to the resort (see above). Perry is scheduled to perform next Thursday at the amfAR Cinema Against AIDs benefit at the Cannes Film Festival.
Last Friday, Katy posted a couple of tweets that sort of addressed the whole Selena deal. First, it was a tweet to the Peggy Lee ballad “Is That All There Is?” – curious and cryptic to say the least. But then later, the “Roar” singer tweeted for us to forget the “dumb conspiracy” and admire Bloom for his UNICEF work in eastern Ukraine.
“Katy has spoken to Orlando since all these pictures surfaced. They speak every day,” a source shared with E! News. “They are still together and have no issues with each other. They communicate well about everything. Orlando explained everything to Katy, and Katy didn’t look too much into the matter anyway.”
For now, all seems well between the two. Click on the gallery above for all this weekend’s celeb snaps!
