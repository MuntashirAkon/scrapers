It looks like Katy Perry is standing by her man.
The “Roar” singer further addressed the rumors BF Orlando Bloom might be stepping out on her with Selena Gomez.
Bloom and Gomez were spotted looking somewhat cozy in Las Vegas last weekend, following Selena’s first concert of her Revival tour. TMZ even posted a video of the two leaving a Sin City nightclub together. TMZ sources say they were handsy, while Gomez insiders insist they are just friends.

Perry seemed to break her silence about the whole deal when she tweeted a cryptic message earlier today, writing, “Is That All There Is?” with a link to the classic Peggy Lee ballad.

But then later, Katy tweeted that we should all stop the gossiping and praise her boyfriend and the UNICEF charity work he is doing in eastern Ukraine. “Instead of giving energy & eyeballs to dumb conspiracy, check out how cool this is,” she wrote with a link to a Time article about Bloom.

Selena herself finally spoke up for first time, sort of, by retweeting Katy’s tweet, using a praise emoji. That means she approves.
