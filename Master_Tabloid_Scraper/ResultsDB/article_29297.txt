Kirsten Dunst stars in the second season of FX’s drama, Fargo, but actress Elaine Hendrix stole the spotlight with a glamorous red-lipped smile and small romper outfit.

As for Hendrix, she doesn’t star in the series but was on the red carpet, looking very much like she and Dunst could easily be sisters. The two women have an 11-year age difference (Dunst is 33 and Hendrix is 44), but share an uncanny likeness.
