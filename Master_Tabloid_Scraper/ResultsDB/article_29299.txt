It’s all in the family!  
While promoting her upcoming TBS show Angie Tribeca at a TCA panel, Rashida Jones got candid about the scene that was shot with her parents, Quincy Jones and Peggy Lipton.  
“It was really fun,” Jones, 39, said. “They were very well-behaved!”  
Though the now-divorced couple’s scene will not appear in the first season, executive producer Nancy Carell promises an appearance in the near future.

“I think, actually, it’s like the cutest scene in the world to have your parents with you,” Carell, 49, said. “What’s great about that scene is that it stands alone. We could put that scene into any episode and we’re definitely going to do that.”  
The satirical comedy series, created by Steve Carell and wife Nancy, follows the life of Angie Tribeca, a lone-wolf detective, as well as an energetic squad of LAPD detectives.   
Angie Tribeca is set to premiere with a 25-hour, 10-episode marathon on Jan. 17 on TBS.
