Is That Peggy Bundy? See Sofia Vergara's Married...With Children Makeover/n
Al Bundy would approve of Sofia Vergara‘s new look.    
The Modern Family star shared a photo of herself looking very much like her TV husband Ed O’Neill‘s other famous TV wife.    
Vergara, 43, sported Peggy Bundy’s distinctive red hair and plunging neckline made famous by Katey Sagal on Married… With Children. Sagal and O’Neill played the lovably dysfunctional Bundys on the Fox sitcom from 1987-1997.    
In 2011, Vergara and Sagal joined forces to help O’Neill celebrate earning a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.  
“Do you like this look Ed Oneal???” Vergara captioned her Peggy photo.  
We’re guessing he does.
