How Elisabeth Moss' Cats Nearly Ruined the Mad Men Finale (VIDEO)/n
It was Don Draper’s final talk with Peggy Olson after seven seasons of Mad Men. And Peggy was   well, a bit distracted.   
Elisabeth Moss was on the other end of line when Jon Hamm filmed their critical phone-call scene for last month’s finale. But since he was the only one on camera, she was much more relaxed – maybe too relaxed.   
“I was, like, in my pajamas with coffee,” the actress, 32, revealed Thursday on Late Night with Seth Meyers. 
And then, her cats started acting out. Yes, just as Hamm was having his long-awaited emotional catharsis, his scene partner was frantically trying to keep her animals quiet.   
Check out the interview above, and one of Moss’s cute but naughty felines below. And by the way, Hamm was clearly none the wiser about Moss’s multitasking.
