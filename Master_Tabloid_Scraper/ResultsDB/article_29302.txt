WATCH: Don Draper Remembers the Ladies in His Life in Final Mad Men Promo/n
Mad Men went full ’70s with its trailer for Sunday’s series finale – and we’re digging it.   
 The preview, set to Paul Anka’s mellow “Times of Your Life,” takes Don Draper (Jon Hamm) on a trip down memory lane, focusing mostly the women in his life: daughter Sally (Kiernan Shipka), ex-wives Betty (January Jones) and Megan (Jessica Paré), and colleagues Peggy (Elisabeth Moss) and Joan (Christina Hendricks). 
Don’s agency partners Roger (John Slattery) and Bert (Robert Morse) also make cameos.   
 Sadly, the video offers up as many clues as the “clip” creator Matthew Weiner aired on Conan: It’s just a mashup of vintage scenes from the drama’s seven-season run.

There are plenty of conspiracy theories about how show will end, but the cast has kept tight-lipped.   
 “I’ve certainly had a lot of awkward moments as Don Draper,” Hamm, 44, told PEOPLE last month. “There’s a lot of bad behavior. It’s not fun to play, and it’s probably not fun to watch.”   
 More than 3 million viewers beg to differ.    
 The series finale of Mad Men airs Sunday at 10 p.m. ET on AMC.
