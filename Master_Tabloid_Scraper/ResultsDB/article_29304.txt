Agent Carter: Peggy Goes Undercover – and Blonde – in a New Sneak Peek (VIDEO)/n
The series premiere of Agent Carter is almost upon us – to add fuel to your fire burning as bright as Peggy Carter’s perfect red lip, check out an exclusive behind-the-scenes peek at the new series.   
As Hayley Atwell explains, Agent Carter takes place in 1946, following the events of 2011’s Captain America: The First Avenger.   
While performing administrative work for the SSR (Strategic Scientific Reserve), Peggy’s secret missions courtesy of Howard Stark (Dominic Cooper) place her in the kind of action-packed danger that sometimes requires blonde wigs, an American accent, and dagger eyes aimed at drunken men who ask her to dance.

“She has an intelligence about her and a skill set that’s very impressive,” says Atwell, “and yet we get to see the emotional and psychological cost of her character, of someone who’s having to live a double life.”   
In the clip, we see a hint of the marginalization Peggy suffers. An officer of the British Armed Forces, Peggy doesn’t receive the respect she deserves in America due to her status as a person strange men think they can call “darling” – to which she answers, with steel, that her name is “Agent.”  
Agent Carter‘s two-hour series premiere kicks off on Jan. 6 at 8 p.m. ET on ABC.
