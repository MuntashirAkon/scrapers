Agent Carter may be down, but she's certainly not out for the count if Hayley Atwell has her way. ABC canceled the Marvel series after two seasons, but fans are hoping the adventures of the founding member of S.H.I.E.L.D. will continue in some form or another, perhaps on Netflix. And despite headlining a new show, Atwell said she would "100 percent" be on board for reviving Agent Carter."Absolutely, yeah. I love Peggy. I love the people working on this project together. The fans are incredibly warm and welcoming and it would be an absolute privilege and honor to bring her back for the fans," Atwell said during a recent convention appearance in Florida.When asked by the panel moderator how she would do all of it with her schedule on ABC's Conviction, Atwell said she'd "Shoot on the weekends…Whatever it takes."

Season three would've delved into Peggy Carter's past some more. "The showrunners were talking about a kind of twist, I suppose…something to do with the family," she said. "They suggested there'd be more to do with my brother." But what about the S.S.R. becoming S.H.I.E.L.D.? "I think I'm going to save that for my own movie," she said to thunderous applause.Dominic Cooper, who played Howard Stark in Agent Carter and Captain America, said he has no idea if Agent Carter could come back in one form or another, but he bets you haven't seen the last of Peggy and Howard."Yeah, and I think they will. I think they'll come back somehow—whether it's on that network or another, or whether it's that show or a different type of show, you'll see them again somewhere, I have no doubt about it," he told Evening Standard.Now if you'll excuse us, we'll be here biding our time until we get our Agent Carter solo movie.
