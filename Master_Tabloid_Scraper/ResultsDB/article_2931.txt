Josh Gad Enlists Chris Pratt, J.J. Abrams and More to Get Star Wars: The Last Jedi Spoilers From Daisy Ridley/n
"How many musical numbers are there?" Odom Jr. wondered. "I'm in Guardians of the Galaxy," Pratt plead. "Do the heels of your boots ever get stuck in the grates of the Millennium Falcon?" Howard asked. "Does Luke finally get to say any lines in episode eight?" J.J. Abrams inquired. "Please tell me, Daisy."

Of course, this isn't Gad's first attempt at trying to crack Ridley on Star Wars details. Two weeks ago, they were working on Orient Express when he gave her a script from "the director" to go over. Instead, it was nothing but another ploy to get his questions about the upcoming installment answered."Suffice it to say, it didn't go well," the actor wrote to fans. Something tells us Gad hasn't given up just yet.
