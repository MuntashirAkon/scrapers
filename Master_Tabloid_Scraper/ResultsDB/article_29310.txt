Singer Peggy Lee Suffers Stroke/n
Peggy Lee, considered one of the century's top female vocalists and the creative force behind Disney's Lady and the Tramp, remains hospitalized in the Los Angeles area after suffering a serious stroke.            Lee's daughter told Associated Press that her 78-year-old mother is conscious and stable. Doctors have yet to determine whether the stroke, suffered October 27, caused permanent damage to the already frail singer.             A diabetic, Lee has had a number of health problems dating back to the late 1950s. She came down with a severe case of pneumonia in 1961. Fifteen years later she nearly died in a fall in her New York hotel room; she had another nasty spill in 1987 that left her seriously injured.  She had two major surgeries in 1985--one to clear blocked arteries, the second a double-bypass--and has been confined to a wheelchair since the early '90s.            Born Norma Deloris Egstrom, Lee got her break in 1941, when she was hired to front Benny Goodman's big band. Her two-year stint with Goodman was marked by such hits as "Elmer's Tune" and "How Deep Is the Ocean?"             She wound up marrying Goodman's guitarist, Dave Barbour, who collaborated with her on several of her most famous tunes, including her sultry signature song, "Fever." (They divorced in 1952.) Through the '50s, Lee scored her greatest popularity with albums like Black Coffee and Beauty and the Beat. She won a Grammy for her 1969 hit "Is That All There Is?"            Lee also found success in Hollywood. She sang the title track of Johnny Guitar, was nominated for a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for Pete Kelly's Blues and had a featured role in the 1953 version of The Jazz Singer.             Her most enduring screen legacy, however, is Disney's Lady and the Tramp. She voiced the roles of Peg and the Siamese cats and cowrote six songs, including "He's a Tramp." (She later sued Disney to collect royalties from the video profits.)
