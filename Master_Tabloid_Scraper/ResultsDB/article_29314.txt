Elisabeth Moss knows you love that iconic Mad Men scene where Peggy Olson struts down that hallway like a BOSS. But, sorry to burst any bubbles, she revealed on Late Night With Seth Meyers that the scene wasn't that very fun to shoot."Was that as much fun to shoot as it was to watch?" Seth Meyers asked her."No," Moss quickly responded. "It was not cool at all. I was holding this box...everything on Mad Men is super real, so they made the box really heavy. I was like, 'I can act that,' but no, so it was really heavy. And the painting was kind of awkward and kind of large and they wanted me to hold it so you could see it in certain shots and then the cigarette is actually really difficult to do. James Dean makes it look super cool and easy, but it's actually really hard to hold a cigarette in your mouth and walk and then the sunglasses...I was just trying to look cool, trying not to drop the painting, trying not to bump into the walls."
