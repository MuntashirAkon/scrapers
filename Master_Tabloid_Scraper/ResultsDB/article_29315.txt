Tanous claims we won't be seeing her on the next installment of Housewives because she is sick of the drama and her castmates' bitchiness."Many of you have been asking about season 7 and if I am returning," she wrote yesterday. "After months of negotiation and soul searching, I have declined their offer to return to the show. I just felt in my heart that being around the negative energy of certain cast members, being forced to have 'dramatic' confrontations and the time it would take me away from my family was just not a healthy path for me."The reality star's rep had summed it up for us too, saying that Tanous also couldn't reach an agreement on her contract and that "she just didn't feel the show was a good fit anymore." A rep for Bravo tells E! News, meanwhile: "We have not yet made any casting announcements regarding season seven of The Real Housewives of Orange County."Tanous, a former model, had revealed on the show she suffered from a three-year battle with postpartum depression and even contemplated suicide.The reality mom says that she took holistic supplements to control her depression and that she's currently in a happy place."I'm in a much better place now," she says, "and feel almost pretty much back to normal. I have some bad days but for the most part I feel pretty much back to normal...It's an ongoing struggle."
