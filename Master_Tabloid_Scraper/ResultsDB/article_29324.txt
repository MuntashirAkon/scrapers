Nic to Kathleen -- I Could Peggy Sue You!/nNic Cage is pissed at Kathleen Turner.In her upcoming book, Turner claims that Nicolas Cage was busted twice for DUI and once for stealing a dog. She wrote,  "He'd come across a Chihuahua he liked and stuck it in his jacket. "Nic issued the following statement:  "I have never been arrested for anything in my life, nor have I stolen a dog. I am reaching out to my fans -- many of whom are children -- so they know that I do not condone drunk driving or theft. The reason why you've never seen a mug shot of me is because it does not exist. "Turner and Cage worked together on  "Peggy Sue Got Married. " Apparently, it didn't go well./n
