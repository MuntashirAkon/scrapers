Katy Perry Says Chill Out ... Orlando's Awesome/nKaty Perry apparently has no issues with whatever happened in Vegas between Orlando Bloom and Selena Gomez, because she just pooh-pooed everyone who thought she was done or upset with her BF. Katy posted on Thursday night,  "Instead of giving energy & eyeballs to dumb conspiracy check out how COOL this is " ... linking to a Time article about Orlando Bloom helping Ukranian kids with their education.Â  It's so weird ... the day before she posted lyrics from Peggy Lee's song,  "Is That All There Is " ... which is all about breaking up. Love ... it's a confusing thing./n
