Oy Chihuahua -- Peggy Sue Got Caught Lying!/nA London court ruled today that Kathleen Turner owes Nic Cage an apology and damages after making stuff up about her former co-star in her autobiography. Paging James Frey!In her book, Turner states that Cage was  "arrested twice for drunk-driving and, I think, for stealing a dog. He'd come across a Chihuahua he liked and stuck it in his jacket. "Lawyers for Cage said the allegations were false and had  "caused damage to the claimant's personal and professional reputation. " After all, nobody wants to date a drunken dog-napper. The ruling in London's high court brings an end to Cage's libel suit. Turner and the two publishing groups accepted that the allegations were untrue and would pay the 44-year-old Cage's legal costs and make a  "substantial " donation to charity. Turner also rips on Burt Reynolds in her book, stating that he was a general a**hole - yet no suit has been brought by the mustached maven. See Also      Nic to Kathleen -- I Could Peggy Sue You!
