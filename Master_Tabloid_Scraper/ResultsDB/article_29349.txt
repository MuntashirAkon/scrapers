Score! FBI Locates Tom Brady's Super Bowl Jersey/n
Forget his throws, Tom Brady has just scored a massive CATCH!
RadarOnline.com has learned Houston Police and FBI agents have finally caught the thief who stole the Super Bowl winner’s jersey.
As Radar reported, Brady lost his Super Bowl LI jersey shortly after the game in February. Monday, the NFL released a statement saying it had been found in Mexico…along with ANOTHER jersey the quarterback wore in the big game two years earlier!

“The items were found in the possession of a credentialed member of the international media,” the statement reads. “Due to the ongoing investigation, we would refer any additional questions to the FBI.”
Brady, 39, discovered the jersey was missing when he returned to the locker room after celebrating his teams’ record comeback against the Atlanta Falcons.
The Patriots’ 25-point comeback gave Brady an NFL-record five Super Bowl wins as a starting quarterback.
And as Radar has reported, wife Gisele Bundchen, 36, says that’s enough!

“Gisele is begging him to retire and go out on top. She has retired and wants him to too,” a source exclusively told Radar. “They have more money than they can ever spend and she is worried about him.”
“Gisele wants Tom to follow the David Beckham model post sports,” the insider continued, “[and] do endorsements, modeling and personal appearances.”
But Brady has indicated he’s not ready to hang up his cleats just yet.
“He is a competitor and thinks he has another five years in him. He thinks he can win again!”
