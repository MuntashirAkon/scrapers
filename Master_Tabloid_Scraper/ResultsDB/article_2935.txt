Actress Sonia Rockwell Shows Off Bikini Bod in Malibu/nSonia Rockwell sticks out like a sore thumb on the sand, especially when it's covered in gross sea debris. The  "Being Mary Jane " actress flew solo to the beach in Malibu last week and added some beauty to the shoreline ... which looked uncharacteristically gnarly. She made the most of it, though ... finding a spot to catch some rays and read a book. Sonia showed up rocking the daisy dukes ... but stripped down to her bikini to take a dip in the Pacific. Lucky us./n
