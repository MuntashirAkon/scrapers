The Moment Of Truth! FBI Director Testifies In Secret Obama Wiretapping Hearings/n
FBI Director James Comey is currently testifying before a House committee regarding the investigation into possible Russian hacking during the 2016 presidential election, as well as President Donald Trump‘s shocking wiretapping claims.
As Radar previously reported, in a series of tweets last month, Trump accused Barack Obama of orchestrating wiretaps on the phones in Trump Tower in the weeks leading up to the 2016 election.

Trump didn’t provide any evidence alongside his claims, but Newsmax CEO Chris Ruddy said the new prez is “very confident” he will be proven right.
But as Radar readers know, Comey already opposed Trump’s claim last month, asking the Justice Department to reject the White House’s insistence that Congress open an investigation.
