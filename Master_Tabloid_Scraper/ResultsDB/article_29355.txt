Smells Like Heroin! New Series Reveals What Really Killed Grunge God Kurt Cobain/n
For over 20 years, controversy has surrounded the death of grunge rocker Kurt Cobain, with many refusing to believe it was suicide. Now, RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned that a new medical team has uncovered explosive secrets about the life and loss of the Nirvana front man.
This weekend, on the Reelz series Autopsy: The Last Hours of Kurt Cobain, expert coroner and forensic pathologist Dr. Michael Hunter examines all the available medical evidence about the death of the musical icon, who was found in his Seattle mansion with a gunshot wound to his head.
Hunter says one key finding was that Cobain had a LETHAL dose of heroin in his bloodstream at the time.
Shortly before his death, “his heroin use increased,” Hunter said. “He was using about $400 worth of heroin every day. And that’s $700 in today’s prices.”
Cobain reportedly turned to heroin during his teens, as a painkiller to help him get over a bad back and bad stomach. But as the years went on, his addiction grew out of control, and towards the end, friends were very worried about him, Hunter claimed.
“This is an enormous amount of heroin to take on a daily basis,” said Hunter. “Those that were close to him realized that if they didn’t do something, Kurt was going to die.”
Cobain was just 27 when he died. He left behind a daughter, a huge legacy and no will.
