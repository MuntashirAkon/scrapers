Mel Gibson's Ex Oksana Loses Big Payout For Exposing Alleged Domestic Abuse/n
Sometimes, it pays to keep your mouth shut! After speaking out on ex Mel Gibson‘s alleged domestic violence instead of keeping it under her hat, Oksana Grigorieva won’t be getting the hefty settlement she was once entitled to.
According to multiple reports, the Russian pianist broke the terms of her 2011 custody agreement with Gibson, who still owed her $500,000 of their $750,000 settlement, during an interview on The Howard Stern Show in 2013.

The former couple’s court agreement contained one important condition for Oksana: that she refrain from discussing the domestic abuse claims in public.
As Radar extensively reported, in 2010, Gibson offered to pay a whopping $15 million to Grigorieva if she vowed never to release damning audiotapes revealing the Lethal Weapon star threatening to kill her.
According to sources, the 46-year-old was told she could ultimately get more money if she went against the terms of their settlement.
Sadly for Oksana, in the end, she will only hold onto the $250,000 she already received — a measly 1/60 of the $15 million deal — after a California appeals court ruled this week that she did, in fact, break the contract. /n
