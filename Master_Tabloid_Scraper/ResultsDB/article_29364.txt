Steven Avery's Own Son Doubts His Innocence In Horrific Murder/n

Making A Murderer subject Steven Avery has proclaimed his innocence in the brutal murder of photographer Teresa Halbach for more than ten years— but his own son isn’t sure he believes him.
In a new interview with Crime Watch Daily, the convicted felon’s grown son, Steven Jr., claims he has “no idea” if his imprisoned father is truly innocent of raping, killing and dismembering the pretty 25-year-old near his Wisconsin home in 2005.
“Only one person can answer that, and that would be Teresa Halbach,” he says in the shocking new video. “But she can’t answer that no more.”

Steven Jr. does believe, however, that his father, 53, and alleged accomplice Brendan Dassey deserve another trial.
“The only thing I know was the entire case was very shady. It’s clear that there was corruption,” Steven Jr. argues. “Him and Brendan deserve a fair trial. That’s my take on it. If they’re guilty, let them sit. But if they’re free, get them out. It’s been ten years now. They’ve wasted going on 30 years of his life if he’s innocent.
As viewers of the Netflix hit docuseries know, Steven Sr. served 18 years in prison for a crime he didn’t commit. He was finally freed in 2003, only to become a suspect in Halbach’s murder two years later. He was eventually convicted of the crime and sentenced to life in prison.

Because their father has been behind bars for most of their lives, Steven Jr. and his twin brother, Bill, say they barely know the man who gave them life.
“I see him as a complete stranger,” Bill admits in the video.
Steven Jr. confesses he nearly changed his last name when he married his wife, but ultimately decided to remain an Avery. /n
