Teen Vogue's Controversial Anal Sex Story Has A Really Beautiful And IMPORTANT Message!/n

Read. This. NOW!!!
Earlier this month, Teen Vogue published an informational article about anal sex as part of their ongoing sex education series. In the piece, writer Gigi Engle gives a bare bone overview "for teens, beginners, and all inquisitive folk."
Sadly, the digital story received a flood of backlash, particularly from Christian vlogger Elizabeth Johnston ‚Äî aka "The Activist Mommy" ‚Äî who accused the publication of "pandering indecency to minors."

On Friday, Teen Vogue and Allure's Digital Editorial Director Phillip Picardi‚Äè ‚Äî who monitors the site's webmaster email ‚Äî opened up about the controversial write-up, and shared a personal story of how sex ed (or lack thereof) has affected his life.
He wrote: 

If it's ok with you guys, I'm gonna TALK ABOUT ANAL SEX FOR A WEE LIL THREAD.

We published a 411 on Anal Sex story on @TeenVogue as a continued part of our sex education coverage.

I monitor the webmaster email and have been inundated with hate mail saying we promote sodomy and want teens to get AIDS.

It's funny, because I went to Catholic high school and had 0 sex education. I also had a teacher tell me gay sex was a sin in God's eyes.

It wasn't until college where Phillip received an honest and accurate understanding of sexual intercourse, STDs, and the importance of using contraceptives.

Fast forward to frosh year of NYU, me crying at Callen-Lorde Community Health Center, bc I'd just slept w someone who I found out was HIV+.

The kind folks at Callen-Lorde taught me about HIV/AIDS, what it is, and how it's contracted. They also told me to get tested regularly.
‚Äî Phillip Picardi (@pfpicardi) July 14, 2017


They also explained the concept of HIV stigma, and that HIV and AIDS are two different things. And that HIV is not a death sentence.

Then they taught me the importance of safer sex, and what I needed to know in particular as a gay man.

I left a 40-minute doctor's appointment with more life-saving information than I ever received in all my years of private school education.
‚Äî Phillip Picardi (@pfpicardi) July 14, 2017


You see, my Catholic school was guilty of endangering all of us by sheer omission of FACTS. EDUCATION doesn't equal ENCOURAGEMENT.

Multiple studies have shown abstinence-only sex-ed is linked to higher rates of STIs and teen pregnancies.
‚Äî Phillip Picardi (@pfpicardi) July 14, 2017


TBH, it is IRRESPONSIBLE. How can you possibly expect teenagers to practice safe sex if they don't know what's at risk?
‚Äî Phillip Picardi (@pfpicardi) July 14, 2017


How can you expect young women to not get pregnant without access to reproductive health care?
‚Äî Phillip Picardi (@pfpicardi) July 14, 2017

Picardi also believes the negative publicity surrounding Engle's piece is really about "homophobia," and how others refuse to update their "arcane" beliefs regarding sexuality.

The backlash to this article is rooted in homophobia. It's also laced in arcane delusion about what it means to be a young person today.

If I had today's @TeenVogue and @VeraPapisova when I was a teen, I would have been so much safer and better off.
‚Äî Phillip Picardi (@pfpicardi) July 14, 2017


Instead, I made mistakes that consisted of quite a few doctor's appointments! But I'm ok!!
‚Äî Phillip Picardi (@pfpicardi) July 14, 2017


But until queer sex, love, and families are included in education, we're doing a dangerous and potentially lethal disservice‚Ä¶
‚Äî Phillip Picardi (@pfpicardi) July 14, 2017


to a growing population. Gen Z will be our queerest and most fearless generation yet.
‚Äî Phillip Picardi (@pfpicardi) July 14, 2017


In conclusion, here's my only reply I'll be giving to any of the messages. üåà pic.twitter.com/KiFjVqLlH3

We echo what Phillip has to say, and we hope this article helps eliminate the unfair stigma surrounding anal sex.
