Lea Michele's Tribute To Cory Monteith On The Fourth Anniversary Of His Death Will Have You In Tears/n

Well, damn. We weren't prepared to cry today.
As you may've realized, today (July 13) marks the fourth anniversary of Cory Monteith's death. Unsurprisingly, the late Glee star's former on-and-off screen love Lea Michele made sure to pay tribute to the actor on this very sad day.

Our hearts are just breaking for her. However, Miz Michele isn't the only alum from the Ryan Murphy comedy to remember Monteith on this day as a few of their former castmates took to Twitter and also shared:

In case you forgot, Cory died back in 2013 after consuming both heroin and alcohol, which had a lethal effect. His death was devastating for not only Lea and the Glee cast, but to the show's devoted fans (called Gleeks) too.
R.I.P., Cory ‚Äî we miss you!
