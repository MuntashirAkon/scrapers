Thinking about seeing Matt Damon defy death in this new thriller? Here’s the details.

Bourne is back! The fifth installment in the action series has all the things fans have come to love from this franchise: explosions, car chases and a lethal government operative who is (still) piecing together his past.
If you’re in the mood for some high-octane action this weekend, we’ve got all the pertinent info…

Who’s in it? 
Damon is reprising his beloved role of the titular, amnesiac, trained killer after taking a movie off. The supporting cast includes Tommy Lee Jones, Alicia Vikander, Julia Stiles and Vincent Cassel.

What’s it about?
The reclusive spy is drawn from hiding to face a new threat to the world’s safety while evading Ironhand, a new program designed to hunt him down.





Why should I care?
If you enjoyed Jason Bourne’s previous installments, then this will likely satisfy. For newcomers, this brainy brand of espionage thriller isn’t for everyone, but it has plenty of thrills and bombast to keep you occupied if the story doesn’t exactly enrapture you.
