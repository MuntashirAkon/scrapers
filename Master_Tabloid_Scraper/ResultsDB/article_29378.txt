The Oscar-winner says he has no problem passing the torch.

Later this month, the fifth installment in the Jason Bourne action franchise hits theaters, aptly titled Jason Bourne and once again starring the action series’ leading man Matt Damon (Jeremy Renner took the reins in the fourth film), but that doesn’t mean Damon plans to continue playing the lethal spy in more films.
While promoting the new film in Seoul, South Korea, the A-lister admitted he’s “definitely going to be replaced some day by some new young Jason Bourne. That happens to everybody and they reboot these things, and that’s totally fine,” according to The Hollywood Reporter.

The 45-year-old thespian went on to explain that he is doing everything he can to meet the expectations of the action films’ fans.
“The only control I can exercise is over the ones that I’m part of. I’m the curator of them as long as I’m involved, and that’s why I battled so hard to make sure that we got the same creative people [including director Paul Greengrass] to get involved in this one.”
So what can fans expect to see when Jason Bourne arrives? “It’s bigger than anything we’ve done, but it has this same kind of visceral experience that these Bourne car chases have been known for,” Damon offered. “Hopefully it’s the best one yet.”
Jason Bourne bows in theaters on July 29, 2016.
