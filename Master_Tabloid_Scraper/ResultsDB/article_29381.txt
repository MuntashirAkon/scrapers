FYI: prepare yourselves for Dwayne Johnson’s booty.

The actor revealed he’s baring almost all in his new movie Central Intelligence co-starring Kevin Hart. And we can thank Hart himself for Johnson’s semi-nudity. The Rock, who has shown his bare butt on his HBO show Ballers, explained to E! News:
I remember sitting at the table and the question was, ‘Are you going to show your butt in this movie?’ and I was like, ‘Nah.’
[But then] Kevin was like, ‘Yes. You should.’ It got a little uncomfortable.

Hart commented, “I told him, ‘The audience that we want wants your butt. If they wanted my butt, I would give them my butt. They don’t want my butt.”
In Central Intelligence, “Bob Stone (Johnson), a one-time bullied overweight geek who grew up to be a lethal CIA agent, comes home for his high school reunion. Claiming to be on a top-secret case, he enlists the help of the former ‘big man on campus’ Calvin Joyner (Hart), now an accountant who misses his glory days. The two enter a world of shoot-outs, double-crosses, and espionage that could get them both killed.”
Central Intelligence hits theaters June 17.
