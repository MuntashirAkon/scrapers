Thinking about seeing a movie this weekend? We’ve got all the info on Ryan Gosling’s new flick!

A rollicking caper is about to cruise into theaters starring Gosling and Russell Crowe in a retro-looking film about an unlikely twosome looking for answers in 1970s Los Angeles. Interested? Here’s all the details on The Nice Guys…

Who’s in it?
Ryan Gosling, Russell Crowe Matt Bomer, Kim Basinger, Margaret Qualley, Murielle Telio and Hannibal Buress.

What’s it about?
Holland March (Gosling) is a struggling private eye who must team up with enforcer Jackson Healy (Crowe) in order to find a missing young girl named Amelia (Qualley), as well as investigating the death of aging adult film star Misty Mountains (Telio). The cases lead the duo on a wild ride around the City of Angels; along the way they uncover a disturbing conspiracy.





Why should I care?
Two words: Ryan. Gosling. Not quite sold? This film was written and directed by Shane Black. This guy wrote Lethal Weapon. So The Nice Guys is a buddy cop film by the guy who kinda mastered the genre!
