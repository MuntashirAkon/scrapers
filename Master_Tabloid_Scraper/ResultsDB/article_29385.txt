A loyal dog is being remembered as a hero after sacrificing himself to save his family from four deadly cobras.
The Doberman and his eight-member family were relaxing in their home in India’s Sebekapur village, when four mountain cobras tried to slither in from outside, reports the Deccan Chronicle.
The venomous snakes were soon stalled by the family canine, who started attacking the reptiles to protect his family. In a battle that reportedly lasted hours, the Doberman mercilessly fought the cobras until all of them were slain.
Sadly, shortly after emerging triumphant, the dog died from the numerous snake bites he received during the fight.
Dibakar Raita, who bought the pet a few months ago, was both devastated and touched by the lengths his dog went to protect his family.
“I’m shocked. He has made the supreme sacrifice for me and my family. I will remember him till our death. I pray God – May his soul rest in peace,” the owner told the paper.
Shortly after the dog passed away, news of his heroics spread through the village. Hundreds of neighbors of the Raita family went to the home to pay their respects and leave flowers with the dog’s body. A well-attended funeral procession and burial followed soon after.
The Sebekapur village is not the only place honoring the dog. The story, which includes a graphic picture of the dog beside the four cobra he killed, is spreading across the globe, drawing condolences from animal lovers the world over.
