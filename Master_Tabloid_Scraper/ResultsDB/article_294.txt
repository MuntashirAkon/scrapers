Haters gonna hate...In 2015, model Sarah Stage made headlines (and haters) throughout her first pregnancy for having six-pack abs right up until the end. Two years later, the mom of one is pregnant again—and still fit as ever. Now, Stage is just shy of 8 months pregnant and she's revealing just how much weight she's gained during her second time around. During her Instagram Stories today, the ab-tastic pregnant mom shared an image of herself on the scale, showing that she currently weighs 137 pounds and writing that she's gained 18 pounds so far.The proud mama also took to Insta to post a pic of her rockin' bod' with the caption, "#31weeks baby is kicking like crazy!!"

On July 14, Stage mentioned in a previous post that she'd gained 14 pounds and quickly clapped back at the online haters, slamming her.Her plethora of pregnancy posts have had quite a varied response from commenters, some are envious, writing "#goals," while others slam the mom for not being "healthy."During her last pregnancy, Stage had gained 20 pounds by the time she was 8-months pregnant, so she seems to be on a similar track.In 2015, she spoke with Good Morning America and said she didn't seem too concerned about the Internet noise surrounding her controversial baby bump pics, saying, "As long as the baby is healthy, I don't think anything else matters...That should be the most important thing."Despite the trolls, Stage's insanely adorable 2-year-old son James is proof that she's got what she needs to keep her second pregnancy on lock down.Check out Stage's second pregnancy in pics...
