Ann Coulter Denies Dating Jimmie 'JJ' Walker! So Who's Telling The Truth??/n

Were you as floored as we were to hear Ann Coulter was dating '70s TV star Jimmie "JJ" Walker?? It definitely sounded unbelievable to us.
Well, that dy-no-mite be because it's not true.

While Good Times creator Norman Lear apparently didn't think much of casually dropping the knowledge in an unrelated interview, this is pretty shocking news for Coulter fans.
News the political pundit was quick to debunk on Twitter: 

Best of friends, love him, no romance. @mailonline: Anne Coulter is dating star of Good Times Jimmie Walker https://t.co/0Wh6YU6WGM
— Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) April 5, 2017

Hmm. We don't know what to think.
Obviously Lear has no reason to lie. Maybe he was just mistaken? The "best of friends" have been spotted together on multiple occasions looking very chummy (above).

Then again, Ann has every reason to lie, given that her ultra-conservative demo tends to create a cozy Venn diagram with the country's racist population.
Just sayin'…
Do YOU think this news would cost Ann some of her fan base??
