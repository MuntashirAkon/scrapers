It's said that the late music icon was diagnosed with  pneumonia last year and even spent 11 days at the Eisenhower Medical Center in Riverside at the beginning of 2016. According to reports, the Okie from Muskogee singer died while at his home in Redding, CA.
Despite his recent health struggles, Merle still had the desire to keep on performing as he had lined up several shows with his close friend Willie Nelson. In fact, it was just last year the two artists released an album titled Django and Jimmie.
Although, we're not entirely shocked to learn this unfortunate news as Haggard was forced to cancel many of those upcoming scheduled shows due to his wavering health.
Our thoughts are with Merle's friends and family during this incredibly sad time.
