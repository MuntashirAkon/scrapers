Cute Kid(s) Alert! Nicole Richie & Fam Out & About in LA (PHOTOS)/n
Look how big Nicole Richie’s kids are getting!
The mother of two adorable kids, Harlow, 3, and Sparrow, 21 months, was seen doting on the kiddies as they vistited a friend’s house on Thursday afternoon. The trio was looking tres chic in their all black ensembles. Harlow went with some adorable braided pigtails while Nicole and Sparrow wore matching hats!
These three have got to stay occupied while their patriarch is out on the road!

Harlow and Sparrow’s dad (aka Nicole’s hubby) Joel Madden has been touring with his band Good Charlotte and while we’re sure he misses his fam, it seems like he’s making it work.
Joel tweeted:
“Listening to jimmies chicken shack on the bus. Drinking a ice cold soda. Ahhhh thirst quenching.”
Ah, to live the life of a rock star.
Check out all the photos of Nicole and her kiddies in the gallery!
