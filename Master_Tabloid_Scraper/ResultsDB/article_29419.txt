Matt Prokop: Meet the Disney/n
Matt Prokop’s life is about to drastically change.
The 18-year-old from Victoria, Texas, is the newest addition to the High School Musical cast, which opened with a bang this past weekend.
Matt plays Jimmie “The Rocket” Zar, a new sophmore at East High School who idolizes Zac Efron’s character, Troy Bolton.
Born on July 29, 1990, the actor moved to Hollywood when he was 16, starting off with minor roles in The Office and Hannah Montana, before landing the dream gig on HSM3.
When away from the set set, Matt loves to play soccer, watch movies and hang out with his new girlfriend, cast member Jemma Mckenzie-Brown. Check out a clip of him talking about HSM:
