Kate Beckinsale Embarrasses Her Mom and Daughter on Jimmy Kimmel Live!/n
Addressing the teen directly, the married host laughed and said, "I'm sorry! I had nothing to do with this! This is all her! This is your mother! Let's not ruin the crush thing. I want to keep that going, OK? Thank you very much. I appreciate it. I'm flattered. [Now] we're both embarrassed.""When you were your daughter's age, did you have a crush on a middle-aged, out of shape, hairy talk show host?" Kimmel asked. Beckinsale laughed and said, "I do think it's a phase, the not conventionally attractive man phase. Not that that's your category! You know what I mean! I didn't really have a type, so I sort of veered from Adam Ant into Boris Becker, and then that really scary looking one from The Pogues that had no teeth for a minute...Shane MacGowan!"With Becker, Beckinsale said, "I was still at that kind of magical thinking phase where I felt like I could sort of control things with my mind. I feel like I helped him win Wimbledon just by sort of squeezing my uterus a lot. I was so desperate I could literally sort of feel l my fallopian tubes going into a ball. Then he'd keep getting a shot, and I thought it was me. I feel like I share that."

"No!" she replied. "It was, 'Oh, my God! What can I possibly cling onto that proves this isn't Kate?' Not my six African American boyfriends—all at once—but the fact that that's a carpet."Beckinsale's stories had the audience in stitches. After a beat, Kimmel said, "It sounds like you're doing a good job of embarrassing both your mother and your daughter simultaneously."
