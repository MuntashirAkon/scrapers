NBA Star Nick Young -- NASCAR Became a Sport?/nLakers star Nick YoungÂ just stepped on the same landmine that blew up in Donovan McNabb's face -- questioning whether NASCAR deserves to be called a sport. Swaggy P was answering a simple enough question -- we asked him which sport is most affected by rain. Nick could have just said softball ... he was in the middle of a rain delay at a celeb game, anyway.Instead he went and said this.Someone get 5-time Sprint Cup Champion Jimmie Johnson on the horn ... we've got a new passenger for him.Then again ... maybe you agree with Swaggy./n
