Dude, Where's My Car?  I'm Jeff Freakin' Gordon!/nHow tough a town is New York? Even Jeff Gordon, a man who drives cars for a living, can't find a ride home.A slew of auto racing's biggest stars -- Dale Earnhardt, Jr., Jimmie Johnson and Gordon -- were in the Big Apple last night to rock the NASCAR Nextel Cup Series Champion's Party at that ever-throbbing cauldron of celebdom, Marquee, along with Jamie Foxx, Gina Gershon, and Robert Iler, among others. When Gordon emerged from the club with new wife Ingrid, he wandered Tenth Avenue looking for his car, wearing a peculiarly lost expression on his face. Finally, his carriage arrived -- a Benz. Jeff -- next time, take matters into your own hands. You're a driver. Just grab a car. Drive./n
