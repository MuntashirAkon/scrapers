Nick and 'Ness Go Unglam for NASCAR/nTwo big NASCAR fans enjoyed a little cozy-time after yesterday's race in Las Vegas. Hey, wait! That's Nick Lachey and Vanessa Minnillo! We almost didn't recognize them.The couple brought their least-glammed-up selves to the Nextel Cup Series UAW-DaimlerChrysler 400 at Las Vegas Speedway, which also welcomed  "Shooter " star Mark Wahlberg. Jeans with holes? Check. Untucked plaid shirt? Check. Super-shiny, blinged-out wrist candy? Check.Whatever their sartorial choices, they were clearly a good luck charm. We're told they were guests of driver Jimmie Johnson, who won the race, and who invited the pair to party with him in victory lane.
