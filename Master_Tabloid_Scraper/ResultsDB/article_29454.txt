Safford worked closely with the singer on his very first world tour in the late 1980s.
“Before I worked with him,” he was a friend first, Safford told Radar. “I knew Prince when he first came out on tour when he opened up for Rick James. I’m sitting here in front of the TV in shock and awe right now. He will sorely be missed.”
“Today I was at work, and I left work because I just had this knot in my stomach something was wrong,” he said. “I didn’t know what it was at first. It was almost like me and Prince and an inner spirit connection. We were all like family.”
