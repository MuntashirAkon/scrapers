7 of 8    There is one reason and one reason only why I got pregnant again. Actually there is no "I" in this, its "WE"! But since i am the one carrying: "I Got pregnant again because I made love to the man I love." Now y'all can debate on why we did it until ya hair turns grey.. I feel good knowing that WE know and you just 'think' you know... A baby does not keep a man and being spiteful does not make you a winner! This is not a game. This is my life. But No matter what the circumstances were and are, I now feel happy to be expecting again and even happier to know I have the best baby daddy I could ask for. @petergunz174 I love you 4ever and I will never be scared to show or say it because of people. #babyBX üíù A post shared by Amina Pankey (@aminabuddafly) on Mar 21, 2016 at 6:08pm PDT

She may have been shocked by the baby bump reveal, but Wallace proudly displayed her own baby bump right before the dramatic show. What do you think about Peter's double baby mama drama? Sound off in comments below.
