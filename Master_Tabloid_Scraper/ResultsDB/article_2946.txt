NFL's Eric Decker -- Terrible (Hot) Fake Guitarist ... In Wife's Music Video/nNY Jets wide receiver Eric Decker may have found his second calling ... MUSIC VIDEO VIXEN ... 'cause the guy plays  "sexy model " in his wife's new video ... complete with bad fake guitar playing.  FYI -- Decker's married to country music superstar Jessie James ... who just released a video for her new song,  "Clint Eastwood. " The video has all the traditional staples of a country song -- a trailer, daisy dukes ... and dudes playing guitars.   One of those guys is Decker ... who chews on a stogie and pretends to play along in Jessie's backup band while she belts out the main tune. It's pretty funny to watch.   Bottom line -- he's a terrible pretender ... but as one person in the newsroom put it,  "OH MY GOD, HE'S SO HOT! " /n
