 'The View' Denies Purposely Leaving Conservative Candace Cameron Bure Off Segment About.../n
The View is denying that conservative Candace Cameron Bure was intentionally left off a panel discussion Tuesday over the Kentucky clerk refusing to grant same-sex marriage licenses.
The conservative Fuller House star, and sister of outspoken right-winger Kirk Cameron, is the latest addition to the show.
On her first day Tuesday, the 39-year-old said that her schedule will pick up in November after she wraps on the first set of shows for the rebooted 80s sitcom.

Reps for The View pointed to Bure’s initially-gradual on-air presence, in explaining why she was not on the segment in which the controversial topic was on the table. (As a guest panelist, Bure had previously clashed with Raven-Symoné in an on-air discussion about same-sex marriages.)

“We had her on for ‘Segment Three’ because she’s not going to be on for a couple of weeks,” the rep told the NY Post. “We want to build consistency to let viewers know who would be on for tomorrow.”

Sources told the paper that Bure has been tabbed to fill the conservative spot previously held by Nicolle Wallace and Elisabeth Hasselbeck, but reps for the ABC show said that it wasn’t the case.
“She wasn’t hired as the resident conservative,” the rep told the paper. “That diminishes her role on the show.” /n
