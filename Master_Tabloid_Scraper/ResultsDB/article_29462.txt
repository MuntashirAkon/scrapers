Chelsea Clinton Offered Spot On 'The View' -- Will She Take It?/n
Producers at The View are pleading with Chelsea Clinton to save the struggling show – but the former first daughter is flat-out refusing to get involved!
“Chelsea snubbed ABC’s offer to make her the next Barbara Walters,” an inside source told RadarOnline.com. “In the past two months, she’s been approached twice by producers begging her to join the troubled talk show!”
The once-popular morning program is in a free-fall after losing hosts Rosie O’Donnell, Rosie Perez and Nicolle Wallace in short order, and sources say ABC execs are convinced 35-year-old Chelsea can save them from impending doom.
The View is shaking things up next season to recapture some of its old magic. Original co-host Joy Behar will be returning to the panel, along with past guest host Candace Cameron-Bure of Full House fame and newcomer ABC News correspondent Paula Faris.

“Chelsea used the ‘busy new mom’ excuse to turn the offer down, but in reality she couldn’t think of anything worse than joining the show right now,” said the source.
“It’s become a nightmare behind the scenes.”
However, producers are not giving up trying to woo Bill and Hillary’s daughter!
“Chelsea’s got a name that people will recognize,” the source told Radar. “She has the brains and experience to command the panel.”
