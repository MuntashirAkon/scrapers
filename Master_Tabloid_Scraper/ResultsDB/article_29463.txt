In May, the former football player agreed to act as a lookout for an inmate who went into the cell of another prisoner without his permission. The two men ended up duking it out in what was, an inside source claims, a gang-related incident.
The professional athlete was convicted of first-degree murder in April, 2015, in the death of semi-pro football player Odin Lloyd. Lloyd – dating Hernandez’s fiancée’s sister at the time –was gunned down June 17, 2013 in a North Attleborough, Mass. industrial park.
