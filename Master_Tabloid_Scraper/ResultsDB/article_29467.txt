The actress will join Whoopi Goldberg, Nicolle Wallace and Rosie Perez, taking a permanent seat at their legendary lady table after guest hosting sporadically for the past few months.
As Radar previously reported, Goldberg in particular had been lobbying to get Symoné hired, even allegedly “shoving her choice down everyone’s throats.”

“Being a part of The View family will be a wonderful growing experience for me,” Symoné shared in a statement. “The cast and crew are warm and welcoming and has made the transition into daytime talk easier. I have a lot to learn within this new arena, but being the apprentice of these spectacular women will only make me a better person and talk show host.”
“I want to thank ABC, ABC News and The Disney Company for believing in me and my potential,” she continued. “Let’s have some fun!”
