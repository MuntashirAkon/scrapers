SUED! Kendall & Kylie Jenner's $125 Vintage Music Tees Could Cost Them BIG TIME!/n

Where's Kris Jenner when you need her??
As we reported, last month, Kendall and Kylie Jenner stirred up controversy when they tried to sell $125 vintage tees which superimposed the reality TV star's faces, social media stats, and "KK" logo over images of music icons including Tupac, Pink Floyd, Metallica, Kiss, The Doors, and Black Sabbath.

While the KUWTK stars issued an apology and took down the merchandise, the photographer of the original Tupac pics is out for blood… and money!
Recently, Michael Miller filed a lawsuit against the girls for using his snaps without asking for permission. According to legal docs obtained by TMZ, the artist — who has worked with Eazy-E, Angelina Jolie, and Jack Nicholson — never wanted anything to do with the Jenners, presumably because of Kendall's tone-deaf Pepsi ad.
He is gunning for any profits made from the tees.
The shirts were also criticized by Ozzy Osbourne's wife Sharon Osbourne, and The Notorious B.I.G.'s mother Voletta Wallace who called the incident "disrespectful, disgusting, and exploitation at its worst."
The backlash is real, y'all!
