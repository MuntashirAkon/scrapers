The View is losing one of its hosts.

Michelle Collins has left her post on the daytime talk show after one year, according to executive producer Candi Carter.
In an email obtained by Entertainment Weekly that was circulated to the staff, employees of the production were informed that Collins has stepped down from her full-time position. The note read:
Dear team,
I have some bittersweet news to share – Michelle Collins is leaving the show.
A gracious presence on stage and off, she asked smart questions, made us laugh and will always be part of The View family.
We wish her great success with some exciting new projects ahead.Please join me in thanking Michelle for her hard work, great humor and many contributions this season to The View.
She’ll be in the office next week to say good-bye to you personally.
Candi
According to People, “the parting was amicable” though Collins will not appear in any future episodes.
Collins first came to The View as a guest host following Rosie O’Donnell’s departure from the show in early 2015. She joined the cast last July alongside Whoopi Goldberg, Nicolle Wallace and Raven-Symoné as Rosie Perez’s replacement.
