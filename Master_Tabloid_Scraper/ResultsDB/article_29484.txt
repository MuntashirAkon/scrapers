There’s more of the story to tell.
Mel Gibson is looking to do a follow-up to his smash hit The Passion of the Christ to tell the story of Jesus’ resurrection.
Writer Randall Wallace, who penned Gibson’s Best Picture winner Braveheart, told The Hollywood Reporter he was beginning to write the sequel. Wallace explained he and Gibson began discussions on a Passion sequel while they were making the WWII drama Hacksaw Ridge, which Gibson directed and Wallace co-wrote.
Wallace, who also wrote and directed the surprise hit Heaven Is for Real, also said one of the motivating factors to doing the sequel came from the Christian community, who has been urging Gibson to do another film. “The evangelical community considers The Passion the biggest movie ever out of Hollywood, and they kept telling us that they think a sequel will be even bigger.”

The 2004 The Passion of the Christ is considered the most successful indie film ever made, earning $612 million worldwide on a $30 million budget.
At this point, no studio is attached to the sequel (and Gibson has yet to officially confirm), but Wallace said they do have interested investors. “It’s too early to talk money,” he added. “This is such a huge and sacred subject.”
Hacksaw Ridge opens in November and centers on World War II Army medic Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield), the first conscientious objector to be awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor.
