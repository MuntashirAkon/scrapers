Nicolle Wallace Leaves The View:  'I Never Thought I Would Get This Job in a Million Years'/n
It’s official: Nicolle Wallace is leaving The View.   
 The politics buff announced Thursday that she won’t be back after working as a co-host on the ABC talk show for one season.   
 “I love you guys, and you know, I never thought I would get this job in a million years. I was more surprised to get it than I would have been to not get it,” she told the other panelists. “But I have loved being a part of this table, I have loved sitting in this chair, and it was never mine, but I’m lucky I got to occupy it for a little bit.” 
 Wallace, 43, had special words of encouragement for new co-host Raven-Symoné, who’s gotten flack for some of her opinions on race.   
“I love you to death, and I think what you say about politics is so spot-on because it’s true, and it’s not just your truth, it’s true for a lot of people in your generation,” she told the former Disney Channel star. “So keep talking about politics, don’t let anybody tell you that people don’t want to hear it.”   
 As for Whoopi Goldberg and Rosie Perez – who is also exiting the program – the Republican commentator was overcome by emotion.   
“My girls RP and Whoop,” she said, “You are two of the loves of my life.”   
 Comedian Michelle Collins has since joined the series, and PEOPLE learned in July that Sherri Shepherd may return, along with frequent guests Candace Cameron-Bure and Stacy London.
