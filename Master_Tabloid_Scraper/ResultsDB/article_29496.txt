See Jason Segel as David Foster Wallace in the New Trailer for The End of the Tour/n

Jason Segel is stepping into some very large shoes – and a big bandana – for his new movie.  
In the first trailer for The End of the Tour, the 35-year-old actor takes on the role of David Foster Wallace, author of Infinite Jest and one of the most acclaimed writers of the past few decades.  
The film tells the story of the road trip writer David Lipsky took with Wallace for an article about him for Rolling Stone. (Jesse Eisenberg stars as Lipsky.)  
“What’s this story about in your mind?” Segel asks Eisenberg in the trailer.  
“Just what it’s like to be the most talked-about writer in the country,” he answers.  
Though the real-life Lipsky’s article was never published in Rolling Stone, the movie is based on a book he wrote from his notes and transcript, called Although Of Course You End Up Becoming Yourself: A Road Trip With David Foster Wallace. It was published in 2010, two years after Wallace committed suicide.  
The film has already generated a fair amount of controversy. When it began filming, Wallace’s family, literary trust and publisher released a joint statement to the Los Angeles Times in April 2014, saying they “have no connection with, and neither endorse nor support” the movie.   
“[Lipsky’s] article was never published and David would never have agreed that those saved transcripts could later be repurposed as the basis of a movie,” the statement continued.  
The End of the Tour, which is directed by James Ponsoldt from a screenplay adapted by Donald Margulies, hits theaters July 31.
