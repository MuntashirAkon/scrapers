Nicolle Wallace: The View's Had 'A Year of Ups and Downs' – But the Drama's Over for Now/n
The View had its fair share of scandals this year, but cohost Nicolle Wallace says everything’s A-okay today.  
“I think it was a year of ups and downs, but we’ve been having a great time. We’ve had great shows,” Wallace told PEOPLE Friday at Variety‘s Power of Women luncheon, where her co-host, Whoopi Goldberg, was honored for her work with the Figure Skating in Harlem charity.
Wallace and Rosie Perez joined the morning show in September, rounding out the cast with Goldberg and Rosie O’Donnell. But drama quickly popped up on set: O’Donnell and Goldberg exchanged barbs during the show, as well as, reportedly off camera; whispers that Perez was leaving the show popped up in January; and O’Donnell exited the show in February after announcing she’d also split with her partner.  
Despite the shakeups, Wallace insists everything’s fine today, adding, “The drama, if it’s still happening, I don’t know about it.”  
“We’ve had so much fun with our guest-hosts, and Rosie and Whoopi and I call ourselves the three musketeers: We’re sort of like the regulars, and it’s been a blast,” she says. “We really enjoy each other.”
