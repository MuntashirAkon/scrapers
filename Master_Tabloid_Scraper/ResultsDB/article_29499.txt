NASCAR driver Mike Wallace and his daughter were attacked Friday night following a Rascal Flatts concert in Charlotte, N.C.In a phone interview with WBTV, Wallace said three men he had never met before repeatedly punched and kicked him outside of the PNC Music Pavilion. "We've never been through anything like this," he told the local station.The longtime NASCAR driver told WBTV his three front teeth were knocked into his mouth, his black eye is causing impaired vision and his lip now has 10 stitches. The local station also obtained graphic photos of Wallace's gruesome injuries.

"They just knocked me out," he said. "When I come to, my daughter is laying on the ground, my son-in-law were on top of me trying to protect me. They were kicking me, beating on me."In an email to USA Today, Charlotte Police Department spokesman Keith Trietley confirmed three men were arrested and each charged with simple assault before posting $1,000 bond.According to a police report obtained by USA Today, Wallace's daughter Lindsey Wallace Van Wingerden and son-in-law Thomas Van Wingerde also suffered minor injuries while trying to protect him during the attack.

"That hurts me worse than I got myself hurt, realizing [Lindsey] was trying to help me, and a group of people attacked her," Wallace told WBTV.Kenny Wallace, a NASCAR analyst and former driver himself, told USA Today his brother is "just in shock," adding, "He can't believe it happened."Wallace hasn't competed in a NASCAR race since undergoing triple bypass heart surgery in 2015.
