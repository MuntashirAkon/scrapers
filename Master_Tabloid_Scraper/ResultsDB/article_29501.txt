"Rowdy" Wallace Off the Hook/n
    Mike Wallace is not a menace to society. At least, that's the verdict according to New York's Taxi and Limousine Commission, which won't press charges against the 86-year-old newsman following his arrest earlier this month after he allegedly lunged at a city inspector during a parking dispute.        On Thursday, commission officials said the taxi cops had acted "somewhat overzealously" in busting the 60 Minutes man on Aug. 10, and the agency's commissioner issued a personal apology to Wallace.        The CBS correspondent's troubles began while picking up a meat loaf dinner at a Manhattan restaurant while his driver double-parked outside. Wallace emerged from Luke's Bar & Grill as two Taxi and Limousine Commission inspectors were questioning his driver.       Things reportedly got out of hand when the octogenarian pressed the inspectors for details, a move they described as "overly assertive and disrespectful."        Wallace was then cuffed and hauled to the 19th Precinct station house, where he was issued a summons for disorderly conduct and released.        But a subsequent investigation failed to prove that Wallace lunged at anyone. In addition, the rookie inspector who busted Wallace (and apparently did not recognize the muckraking TV news icon) was not yet authorized to carry handcuffs or issue a summons. The inspector and his partner have since been placed on desk duty, will be issued official warnings and required to undergo retraining on conflict resolution, per the commission.        "The man made a mistake, and I think he's been made to understand that by his superiors," Wallace said in Friday's New York Times.
