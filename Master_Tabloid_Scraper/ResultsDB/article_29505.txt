"Wallace & Gromit" Animate Box Office/n
    Scary bunnies equal big box office.     Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit munched up $16 million to rule an otherwise lackluster weekend at the movies.        DreamWorks' G-rated clay-animated comic tale, about the chatty, cheese-loving inventor and his faithful canine companion who try to save their village's prized veggies from a monster bunny, bounced Flightplan from the top perch it held for the past two weeks.     Were-Rabbit is the first feature-length film for creator Nick Park's popular British duo, who have starred in Oscar-winning shorts. The new film, a pun-filled parody of classic monster movies, stars Peter Sallis as the voice of Wallace and introduces new characters voiced by Helena Bonham Carter and Ralph Fiennes. It averaged a decent $4,397 at 3,645 sites, slightly lower than studio expectations.        The new Wallace & Gromit hijinks didn't come anywhere near a close shave to the opening grosses of DreamWorks CGI 'toons. Madagascar and Shark Tale each debuted with nearly three times the Wallace & Gromit per-theater average, and Shrek 2 averaged $25,952 for a $108 million opening weekend. However, DreamWorks is hoping good reviews and word of mouth will make  Wallace and Gromit as popular in the U.S. as they are in their native land.        Though two other new movies had higher per-screen averages than Flightplan, they premiered in fewer theaters so were unable to gross enough to fly past the Jodie Foster scare-in-the-sky thriller. In its third week, Flightplan only dropped 27 percent, earning $10.8 million in second place with a $3,239 average to bring its three week haul to $60.9 million.        The star-laden chick flick In Her Shoes teetered in with $10 million in third place, while the gambling tale Two for the Money was essentially a push, pulling in $8.7 million in fourth.         Beating both those in per-screen average was The Gospel, which played in only 969 sites, where it averaged $7,764 for $7.5 million in fifth place.        In seventh place was the fast-food comedy Waiting... with $6 million.        Directed by Oscar winner Curtis Hanson, In Her Shoes stars Cameron Diaz and Toni Collette as battling sisters and Shirley MacLaine as their estranged granny. The PG-13 Fox release averaged $3,568 at 2,808 theaters. The audience was predominantly female, but the testosterone demo picked up considerably on the second night, suggesting the film seemed to work as a date movie.        With Al Pacino playing book-making mentor to Matthew McConaughey, Two for the Money couldn't beat the odds and finished slightly below what distributor Universal had expected, averaging $3,640 at 2,391 sites. The R-rated film skewed older, 66 percent of the audience was over 30, but was fairly evenly split gender-wise, with 51 percent male, 49 percent female. Exit polls showed Pacino was the main draw.     The Gospel, a tune-infused drama about a prodigal musician who rediscovers his gospel roots, stars Boris Kodjoe, Omar Gooding and Clifton Powell. The PG Screen Gems release achieved its strong fifth place debut despite fairly limited release. It was marketed to black church groups and 85 percent of the audience was African-American.      Waiting..., an R-rated, young-male-targeting farce about restaurant workers (Ryan Reynolds, Anna Faris, Justin Long and Wendie Malick) averaged just $3,645 at 1,652 sites for distributor Lions Gate.        In limited release, the top per-screen average belonged to the critically praised Good Night, and Good Luck, George Clooney's movie about CBS journalist Edward R. Murrow battles with Communist-baiting Senator Joe McCarthy.  The PG black-and-white Warner Independent release, which stars David Strathairn in the title role with support from Clooney, Robert Downey Jr., Patricia Clarkson and Jeff Daniels, racked up $421,446 at just 11 sites to average a headline-making $38,313.        Daniels also stars with Laura Linney in the family-squabble comedy The Squid and the Whale. Director Noah Baumbach's bitterly wry semi-autobiographical tale, an R-rated Samuel Goldwyn release that garnered hot buzz at the Sundance Film Festival, also found its fans, opening strongly with a $30,927 average at just four sites for $123,708. Since opening Wednesday, Squid has pulled in  $148,338.        Overall, the top 12 movies grossed $88.2 million, down 9 percent from this time last year, when Shark Tale was still gobbling up business in its second weekend, but 17 percent above last weekend's take.
