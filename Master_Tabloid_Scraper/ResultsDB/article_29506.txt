"Wallace & Gromit" Get Fired Up/n
     Unfortunately for Wallace and Gromit, the box office wasn't the only place they were on fire.           Hundreds of sets, props and models from the Oscar-winning clay-animated films were destroyed when a storage warehouse in Bristol, England, went up in flames early Monday.          The facility, housing a priceless archive of paraphernalia from all Aardman Animations productions, was completely gutted.          "Today was supposed to be a day of celebration, with the news that Wallace and Gromit had gone number one at the U.S. box office, but instead our whole history has been wiped out," Aardman spokesman Arthur Sheriff said in a statement. "It's turned out to be a terrible day."          The local Avon Fire and Rescue service said the damage was extensive, with the roof and three interior walls of the Victorian warehouse collapsing. The cause of the fire is under investigation.          According to Sheriff, props and sets from all Aardman films were decimated in the flames, including the 2000 hit Chicken Run, the children's cartoon character Morph and  the anthropomorphic Oscar-winning Creature Comforts series, as well as models from the three previous Wallace and Gromit films, A Grand Day Out, The Wrong Trousers and A Close Shave, the latter two both Oscar winners for Best Animated Short.          Props from the man and dog duo's first full-length feature  and current box-office topper, Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit, were not caught in the blaze.           Creator Nick Park said that though the loss was disappointing, recent natural disasters, such as the earthquake in South Asia, put the day in perspective.          "Even though it is a precious and nostalgic collection and valuable to the company, in light of other tragedies, today isn't a big deal," he said.          But it is the second time in less than a week that a fire has destroyed--or almost destroyed--Hollywood history.           Last Wednesday, a Pasadena home believed to be used as the Batman series' fictional Wayne Manor was gutted by flames. But Batfans' fears were allayed after officials said the burned home was not the fictional estate, but merely an identical-looking nearby home.       The Curse of the Were-Rabbit opened in theaters across North America last Friday and easily trumped all comers, nabbing the number one spot with an impressive $16.1 million.           The G-rated flick hits screens in its native England this weekend.      /n
