Nicolle Wallace Insists She Isn't ''Kardashian Illiterate'' on The View—Watch Now!/n
Nicolle Wallace wants to clear the air once and for all.The View co-host playfully addressed the audience during today's show and insisted that she isn't "Kardashian illiterate." The horror!"They crossed a line," Wallace said sarcastically about fans' criticism of her. "They called me Kardashian illiterate. I'm OK because listen to this!"Then, without any hesitation whatsoever, Wallace delivered an accurate, detailed history of the famous family to prove that she does keep up with the Kardashians.And while Wallace waxed poetic about the E! reality star family, she steered clear of the recent news claiming that she would be the latest to leave the morning talk show.But don't believe everything you read, you guys, a source tells E! News that it's still undecided whether Wallace will be returning as a daily co-host or not.

This is just the latest in the game of musical chairs at The View, as earlier this week it was announced that Michelle Collins had officially signed on as the 15th co-host."These past few months have been the most fun and exciting of my career, and I couldn't be happier to join such an awesome, smart, accomplished and funny group of women," Collins said in a statement."It's been my dream to host a talk show, and the fact that I now get to do just that every day with an amazing, hard-working team of producers, writers, cast and crew is beyond my wildest expectations. Many thanks to the people at ABC for inviting me to be a part of this team, and specifically to the great Barbara Walters and Whoopi Goldberg, whose support has meant the world to me."
