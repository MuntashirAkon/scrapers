Wallace & Gromit: Curse of the Were-Rabbit/n
Meet Hollywood's new power couple: a little clay man and his loyal pooch. Director Nick Park's claymated characters make the first Wallace & Gromit feature-length flick about as delightful as a piece of family entertainment can be. Hapless inventor Wallace and his silent yet infinitely wiser dog, Gromit, have a successful, unbearably cute business keeping rabbits out of the town's gardens.

 That is until the dreaded Were-Rabbit arrives just in time to disrupt the annual giant vegetable competition. Park fertilizes his creation with pleasant puns, nonstop visual gags and layered jokes that are funny to kids and sophisticated enough for adults, which makes Wallace & Gromit a rarity: a film touted as fun for all ages that actually is.
