They've modeled clay, but now Wallace & Gromit are modeling the latest fashions.The cheese-loving claymates are the newest faces for the British department store Harvey Nichols, exchanging their usual sensible mix of tweeds, sweater vests and dog collars with finery from designers Alexander McQueen, Dolce & Gabbana and Giorgio Armani.
