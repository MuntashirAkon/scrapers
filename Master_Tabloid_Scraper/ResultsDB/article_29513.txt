Notorious B.I.G.'s Mom Blasts Kendall and Kylie Jenner for Vintage Biggie Shirts/nThe Notorious B.I.G.'s mom is PISSED Kendall and Kylie Jenner slapped their portraits over her son's image just to peddle t-shirts. Biggie's mom, Voletta Wallace, posted a photo of one of Kendall and Kylie's new  "Vintage T-Shirts " which launched on their site Wednesday. Voletta ripped the biz move as  "disrespectful and exploitation at its worst " -- and not just against her son.       I am not sure who told @kyliejenner and @kendalljenner that they had the right to do this.  The disrespect of these girls to not even reach out to me or anyone connected to the estate baffles me.  I have no idea why they feel they can exploit the deaths of 2pac and my Son Christopher to sell a t-shirt.  This is disrespectful , disgusting, and exploitation at its worst!!!

Kendall and Kylie were selling at least 3 of these type of shirts with Pac and Biggie ... at $125 a pop. All 3 shirts are no longer available. It's unclear if the gear sold out, or if it's been removed from the site due to the backlash./n
