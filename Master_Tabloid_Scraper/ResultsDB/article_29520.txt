Notorious B.I.G. in Another West Coast Feud/nBiggie Smalls is smack in the middle of another heated battle in California -- but this time, the deceased rapper's wife, Faith Evans, is the one in the hot seat. It's all over private home videos of Christopher Wallace -- videos that a company called Kaushi Entertainment wanted to use in a documentary. In a lawsuit filed Tuesday in L.A. County Superior Court, Kaushi claims they struck a deal, approved by Faith Evans, in which they would fork over $30k for all of the movies. Kaushi claims they paid up -- but Faith Evans, along with several associates, never handed over the goods. Long story short -- Kaushi claims they got screwed and want more than $1,000,000 to make things right.Calls to Faith's people have not been returned.
