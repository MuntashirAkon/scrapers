Biggie Smalls -- Daughter Releases 'Notoriouss' Clothing Line/nI love it when you call me ... BIG CLOTHING MOGUL -- at least, that's what Christopher Wallace's daughter is aspiring to become after launching a fashion line named after her dad. 19-year-old T'yanna Wallace has officially hit the market with  "Notoriouss " -- a line of shirts and other fashion items. One interesting point -- one of the t-shirt designs has imagery of guns on the front -- an odd choice considering the manner in which Wallace died back in 1997./n
