Laura Govan: No Shame In Larsa Pippen's MILF-Butt ... Scottie Loves It /nLaura Govan is taking a stand for the MILFs of America ... saying that people hating on Scottie Pippen's wife Larsa need to fall back ... and embrace the wonder of well-aged butt cakes. Govan was out in Calabasas when we asked about the daisy dukes that shook up Beverly Hills this week ... the super skimpy jean shorts that Larsa was wearing while out shopping with Kim K ... and her kid. Laura knows all about MILFtroversy ... she recently got in a little hot water on Instagram over a sexy picture of her cooking in the kitchen ... with her son as the sous chef. You gotta see Laura hit back at the haters ... with her logic being, as long as Scottie likes what he sees ... Larsa should be all systems go to show the world. We agree ... don't stop, Larsa./n
