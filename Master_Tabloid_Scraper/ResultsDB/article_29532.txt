Cam Newton Drops $12,000 On Fancy Tail /nCam Newton is going fox tail crazy -- dropping more than $12k on his new fashionable good luck charms ... TMZ Sports has learned. Newton's been rockin' the furry new accessory all season -- and plans to continue the trend, picking up more than 60 TAILS at $200 a pop ... so says the guy who makes 'em.  We spoke with Teheran Jones, owner of the Exclusive Game store in Atlanta, who says Cam came up with the idea earlier this year to make the fox tails ... which Jones usually uses on the hoods of jackets.   And Jones says it was a million dollar idea -- 'cause ever since Cam started rockin' the look, his tails have been flying off the shelves -- and even other athletes (including Carl Crawford and Wallace Gilberry) have called to try and harness some of the good luck.  Jones says Newton recently picked up a new batch of the tails to give to his teammates as early Xmas gifts. So if the Panthers go undefeated we'll all know why ... it's cause the guys got a little tail. /n
