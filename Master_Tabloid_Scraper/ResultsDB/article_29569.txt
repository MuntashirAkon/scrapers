Scandal’s Katie Lowes is expecting her first child with her husband, Adam Shapiro.

Lowes confirmed her pregnancy during her appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live on Thursday night.
“It’s a boy! We have zero names,” Lowes told Jimmy Kimmel, though since her husband is a basketball fan, they’ve been referring to the baby as “Lebron.”
The actress, who portrays Quinn Perkins on Scandal, said that she couldn’t hide her baby bump from show creator.
“I told her five minutes from being pregnant,” Lowes explained. “She already knew—she’s a genius.”

Lowes and Shapiro were married in 2012. She said that her mom is excited and that she’s preparing their “sensitive” family dog by carrying around a crying baby doll.
“He’s my baby, too. He’s just my furry baby,” Lowes joked. “I’m sounding like a crazy mom already, arent I?”
