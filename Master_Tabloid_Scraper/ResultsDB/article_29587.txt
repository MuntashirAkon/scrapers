Steve Harvey Meets His "Better Looking" Doppelg√§nger on Family Feud/n
"I'll tell you something, 'Steve,' it ain't a bad deal," the Family Feud host said. But he did find one problem with his lookalike..."I hate to say this," the real Steve said to Olden, "but I'm an honest guy: You're actually a little better looking than I am! That's kind of hurting me a little bit."Nonsense, Steve: You and Olden are both handsome, mustachioed men!
