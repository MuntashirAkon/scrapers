Steve-O, My New Project Makes 'Jackass' Look Tame /nIf you thought Steve-O was wild in  "Jackass﻿, " then strap in for his new project that supposedly puts Johnny Knoxville's stunts to shame ... with things like human snow angels doused in burning rocket engine fuel. Steve-O posted a video Thursday in which he's covered in boils from what look like 1st or maybe even 2nd degree burns ... from the  "fire angels " stunt. He won't show us the stunt ... just the aftermath. It's part of a new comedy special Steve O's doing with  "Jackass " director Jeff Tremaine. No word on a release date yet -- but this sounds epic ...  and painful./n
