Marston was “not responding to treatment and one after another his bodily functions failed to support his life,” his mother said.
She added that the actor — who also had cameos on Blue Bloods, Castle and Law & Order: SVU — had “required a ventilator and would never have been able to utter one more word and would have been sentenced to life as a quadriplegic” had he lived. “By God’s love and mercy Nathaniel was spared this living hell.”
Marston was “a man who grew into an individual who touched more lives than I ever could have known,” his mother said.

Jackson said that tentative plans were being made for memorial services in New York, Hawaii and Nevada. /n
