Six brothers and their parents have been charged after the boys allegedly abused a young girl for a decade and their parents did nothing to stop it, RadarOnline.com is reporting.
Eric, Jon, Matthew, Nathaniel, Benjamin and Aaron Jackson were arrested on May 6 and each charged by the Perquimans County Sheriff in North Carolina with three to five counts of rape and their parents, John and Nita, were also arrested and charged because they witnessed the abuse and didn’t intervene.
The boys, ranging in age from 18 to 27, were all homeschooled and an investigation was started when one of the brothers confessed their abuses to a church pastor in 2012.

“Personally, I lay the blame on the parents, and their charges are less than what the boys are going to get,” Sheriff Eric Tilley told WTKR.
“It’s their responsibilities to raise those kids and somewhere along the line, they failed.”
The brothers turned themselves in, but were said to be emotionless.
