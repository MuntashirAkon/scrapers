Carnie offered up a pair of her own bedroom slippers and dozens of books.  A treadmill was one of the larger items she wanted to unload.
Wilson and her husband Rob Bonfiglio, who have two daughters, ended up under water and lost their last home in July, 2011.
Fortunately the singer’s facial paralysis appears to be going away, which is good news because Wilson Phillips has its next appearance March 29 in Oklahoma.
