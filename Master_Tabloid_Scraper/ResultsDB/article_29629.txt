Idol: More Finalists Picked/n
Last night, nine of the dozen semifinalists on American Idol got early retirement.
The three performers who received the most votes from viewers were 23 year-old Memphis mother of three Lil Rounds, 23 year-old Scottsdale pianist Scott MacIntyre, and 20 year-old Puerto Rican college student Jorge Nunez.
Among those who didn’t make the grade were famously combative Nathaniel Marshall and Kristen McNamara.
Nunez, MacIntyre and Rounds join the finalists selected earlier, Kris Allen, Adam Lambert, Allison Iraheta, Danny Gokey, Alexis Grace and Michael Sarver.
The twelve finalists will have been chosen after tonight’s wild card round. The judges themselves get to select from among Von Smith, Jasmine Murray, Ricky Braddy, Megan Corkrey, Tatiana Del Toro, Matt Giraud, Jesse Langseth and Anoop Desai.
Starting next week, the tough part begins as the finalists start competing with one more dropping by the wayside each Wednesday. /n
