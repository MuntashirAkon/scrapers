This wasn't Max's first foray into monster dressing, however, as he also crashed a web design course before in a T-Rex costume.

Watch him attack an innocent column (below).

I don't know why people are surprised. Max dressed as a T-Rex last time I brought him to work. @ngmferguson pic.twitter.com/ltE5X6CHLO
