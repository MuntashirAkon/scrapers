MORE Peen Pics? The Originals' Nathaniel Buzolic Is The Latest Hollywood Hunk To Have Alleged Nudes Leak Online!/n

When will these male celebs learn that peen pics ARE NEVER a good idea?
It seems ANOTHER young hunk in Hollywood has had a d*ck pic surface online as, on Tuesday, The Vampire Diaries' Nathaniel Buzolic was linked to some X-rated photos. Tsk, tsk.

In case you forgot, The Originals stud joins the countless MTV celebs (as well as The Wanted's Max George) who have had sexually explicit content featuring their peens leak in the new year. Oof.
Now, the photos in question are only ALLEGEDLY of the Hacksaw Ridge actor, as his face cannot be seen in the snaps. However, users on the site Pandlr.com seem pretty convinced the peen belongs to Buzolic. Poor guy!
As we've previously said, we don't feel comfortable posting these pics (below) unless they're censored because EVERYONE deserves their privacy. 

This is just not okay. Nathaniel has yet to comment on the images allegedly of his peen, but we have a feeling he will soon.
Regardless, we hope the up-and-comer is able to track down the person who violated his privacy so terribly. Good luck, bro!
