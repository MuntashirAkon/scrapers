Along for the ride with three-year-old twins Tabitha and Marion Broderick, who were born to a surrogate in June 2009, were their favorite stuffed koala bears, safely tucked into their fanny packs on the handle bars.
The girls may soon be riding in a new neighborhood, after their famous parents listed their stunning Manhattan townhouse on the market for $24,995,000!
