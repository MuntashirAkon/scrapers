This is truly life-giving.

Britney Spears posted a teaser on her Instagram account for a top secret project a few weeks ago that was then set to the sounds of Nathaniel Rateliff & The Night Sweats’ “S.O.B.”. A parody video was made in the meantime while we all patiently waited for the full project would arrive, and it finally has.
Sort of.
Spears revealed on Tuesday (Feb. 23) that the clip was from the filming of an unreleased music video for a remixed version of her song “Breathe On Me” from her 2003 album, In The Zone. 
“Never released a video for this song,” she wrote in the caption of her first video. “So decided to do a little tease on Instagram instead…enjoy!!”
