Britney Spears is working that bikini.

The singer has taken to Instagram to share multiple videos of herself striking poses in a black two-piece and covered in various temporary tattoos for, well, reasons. Though Spears, 34, have yet to specific exactly what these videos are for (or why she’s writhing around to the tune of Nathaniel Rateliff & The Night Sweats’ “S.O.B.” for that matter), it’s pretty much an disputable truth that the mom-of-two is smoking hot in these clips.

So, what does she to to stay fit? According to the Princess of Pop herself, she’s back on the yoga grind to tone her body. Earlier this month, Spears shared a photo of herself doing a handstand.
