 Here is your first look at Ron Howard’s In the Heart of the Sea, starring Chris Hemsworth, Cillian Murphy and Benjamin Walker.
The film, based on Nathaniel Philbrick’s 2000 book of the same name, tells the story of Essex’s crew and their ill-fated journey in 1820.

The ship’s tale, which includes an encounter with a giant sperm whale, is believed to be the real inspiration behind Herman Melville’s Moby-Dick.
