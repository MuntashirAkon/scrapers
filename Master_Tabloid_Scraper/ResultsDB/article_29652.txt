Nathaniel Marston's One Life to Live Love Interest Shares Touching Tribute: 'I Felt as Though I Had Always Known Him'/n
Nathaniel Marston’s One Life to Live love interest is remembering the late actor.  
Marston, who died in November from complications stemming from a car accident, was buried at sea in Kauai, Hawaii, last month, where costar Kathy Brier delivered a eulogy.  
On Monday, Brier posted her remembrance on her Facebook page at the request of Marston’s mother Elizabeth.    
“From the first moment Nathaniel and I caught each others eyes on set there was an instant connection. I felt as though I had always known him somehow, a recollection of our souls,” wrote Brier, who played Marcie, the love interest of Marston’s character Michael. “We pretty much spoke in short hand from the very beginning and most times no words needed to be spoken. We would just look at each other and know.”    
Brier, 40, played Marcie from 2002-2011. She was initially only slated for three episodes, but that changed when producers noticed the chemistry between her and Marston.    
“Before we knew it we were in the middle of one of the greatest love stories ever written for a soap opera,” Brier continued. “The real secret to the magic of our story was that as Marcie & Al were falling in love so were Nathaniel and I. The love and respect between us naturally carried over onto the screen.”

His mother shared the news that he had died on Nov. 11 at age 40.    
“Nathaniel passed away peacefully as I held him in my arms,” she wrote. “His injuries, which Dr.’s did their best to heal were not responding to treatment and one after another his bodily functions failed to support his life.”
