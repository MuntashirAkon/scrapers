Soap Star Nathaniel Marston 'Will Likely Live Out His Life as a Quadriplegic' After Car Crash, His Mom Says/n
Nathaniel Marston will likely be paralyzed after being injured in a car crash Oct. 30, his mother says.   
 Elizabeth Jackson released a statement updating the soap star’s fans on his health Wednesday, revealing his heart stopped twice during surgery Thursday.   
 “He remains in critical condition, fighting pneumonia, a heart infection and irregular pulse. The relatively positive prognosis which followed his previous surgery has dimmed,” she said, according to Entertainment Tonight. “It is now believed that the hope of recovering upper body function was premature and that Marston will most likely live out his life as a quadriplegic.”   
 Marston, 40, is best known for his role as Michael McBain on One Life to Live and also appeared on As the World Turns before being let go in 1999 after being arrested for attacking an ATM in New York.   
 He is scheduled for another surgery to reduce pressure on his brain Wednesday, Jackson announced on Facebook.   
 “Thank you soo much for your love , kindness, prayers and positive and generous support,” she added. “It really means so much to me.. Sending all of you love, light and Gods blessings.”   
 A GoFundMe page in Marston’s name has raised more than $7,000 so far.
