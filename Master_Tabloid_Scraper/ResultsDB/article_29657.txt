Picks and Pans Review: Steve Lopez and Nathaniel Ayers the Duo Behind the Soloist/n
>Nathaniel Anthony Ayers, 58—the gifted musician whose struggle with schizophrenia is portrayed by Jamie Foxx in The Soloist—is “as good as he’s ever been,” says his closest companion, Los Angeles Times columnist Steve Lopez, 55. Since the two forged an unlikely friendship four years ago, Ayers has traded a life of homelessness and isolation for an apartment and renewed family ties. The one thing that hasn’t changed? His passion for music. “He may never take antipsychotic meds, but he has the advantage of music working just like medicine,” says Lopez. Watching himself portrayed on the big screen was tough for Ayers—”he sat through it with his eyes closed,” says Lopez—but “the movie and his life are celebrations of music.”
