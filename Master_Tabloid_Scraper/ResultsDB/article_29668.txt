Klaus Mikaelson (Joseph Morgan) is not someone who handles life well when things don't go his way, as we've learned over the past three seasons of The Originals (and on The Vampire Diaries before that). So naturally, he's not handling the death of his love, Cami (Leah Pipes) in the best way.E! News has an exclusive sneak peek at Friday's episode, in which Klaus is in the "anger" stage of his grief over Cami's murder. Well, TBH, he's kind of always in a perma-anger stage but it's especially bad this week. He basically skips over the mourning and goes straight to the "avenging her death" portion of his grieving process, but Hayley (Phoebe Tonkin) wants to do something a little more traditional: plan a funeral."Klaus, I think we should do something about the body, about Cami. I know that she wanted an Irish wake," she tells him. "I can make the arrangements."

Klaus isn't too interested in that, however. "It doesn't matter what she wanted," he says. "She's gone. There's no time to sing dirges—we're at war."The episode will see Klaus, Elijah (Daniel Gillies) and Freya (Riley Voelkel) desperate to find a way to end Lucien (Andrew Lees), the vampire-turned-super-strong-werewolf hybrid who killed Cami and has helped destroy their family. But they'll have to help Kol (Nathaniel Buzolic) and Marcel (Charles Michael Davis) try to save Davina (Danielle Campbell) before facing off against Lucien and trying to end the threat against the Mikaelson family for good.Press play on the video above to watch Klaus shut down his baby mama, and tune in to The Originals on Friday at 9 p.m. on the CW to watch the fallout from Cami's death.
