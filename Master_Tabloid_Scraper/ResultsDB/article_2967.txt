Madonna’s Material Girl Mini Me! Lourdes Leon Is Growing Up Fast/n
By Radar Staff
She may be Madonna’s doppelganger daughter, but Lourdes Leon is not going to live in her mother (or father’s!) shadow!
The fashionably fierce 15-year-old showed off her individuality and superior style sense (as well as the results of an apparent growth spurt!) in New York this weekend and RadarOnline.com has the photos. 
PHOTOS: Lourdes Leon Is All Grown Up And Fashionable In New York City Lourdes, the Material Girl’s first-born, enjoyed a Sunday afternoon stroll with her father and mother’s onetime lover Carlos Leon in Manhattan, adding her own twist to the style of the 1980s wearing cross emblazoned cutoffs with a white t-shirt, clunky black shoes, cat eye sunglasses, and rocking a studded fanny pack as a purse. 
The far-from-average high school student appeared to have grown a few inches, standing almost as tall as her pops.

Later that evening, she rubbed shoulders with Kelly Osbourne at the Zac Posen Spring 2013 show, which was one of the most highly hyped shows at New York Fashion Week with supermodels Naomi Campbell, Karolina Kurkova, Crystal Renn and Coco Rocha taking the runway. 
Wearing leopard print shades, a sheer black etched shirt and ripped jeans, Madonna’s little girl looked far older and more fashionable than most teenagers.
