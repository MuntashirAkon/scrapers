NFL Star Vernon Davis -- Call Me 'Captain Torpedo ... I'm an Actor Now! /nSan Francisco 49ers tight end Vernon Davis is trying his hand at ACTING -- and he just released his first scene as the brand new superhero ...  "CAPTAIN TORPEDO!!!! " Apparently, the whole thing is supposed to be a comedy sketch in connection with a comedy group called French Mustache ... which has a channel on FunnyOrDie.com. In the scene, Vernon argues with some Russian guy (who's not really Russian) and then gets shot in the head ... (spoiler).  Vernon's no Blake Griffin (yet) ... but at least he's trying. 10:30 AM PT -- We spoke to the actor who played  "Torpedo Boy " -- Nathaniel Weiss -- who told us Vernon couldn't have been a nicer guy on the set. Weiss says the NFL star also told him he was excited about the project because he hoped it would lead to similar roles in the future. Bottom line -- ya probably haven't seen the last of Davis in front of the camera./n
