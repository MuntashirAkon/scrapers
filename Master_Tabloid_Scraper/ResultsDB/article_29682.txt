Our sources had no comment on Nathaniel's singing ability (or lack thereof) -- but said they were excited he was reppin' for their pretend regiment.  As for Nate's fake soldiering ... we're told he usually sports a Union uni -- and is  "always serious, but very polite. " It was a civil war, after all./n
