Nathaniel Marshall -- Former 'American Idol' Contestant Now Doing Gay Porn/nNathaniel Marshall -- who made the top 36 on season 8 of  "American Idol " in 2009 -- is now trying his hand (and a few other appendages) at a new career ... gay porn.Â Marshall, now using the porn name Jadyn Daniels, is appearing in a film called  "Men Caught on Video 2 " which became available just yesterday. The movie does not appear to have much of a plot, so if you like your porn with a gripping story ... this is not the one for you.Marshall /Daniels isn't the first reality star to transition into gay porn -- Steven Daigle, who appeared in  "Big Brother 10, " moved into the gay XXX biz 18 months after he left the show./n
