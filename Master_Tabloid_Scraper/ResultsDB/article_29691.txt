Radar has learned that just moments after taking off from John Wayne airport, the pilot placed a mayday call, telling air traffic controllers he’d lost an engine and would try to make it back to the airport.
Witnesses say that when the plane hit the pavement, the woman aboard was seen pulling the man out from the fire. Miraculously, nobody else was inured.
After the incident, the Orange County freeway was shut down in both directions and the airport was closed to arrivals.
