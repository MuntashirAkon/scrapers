Chris Cornell’s Deadly Drug Cocktail Revealed In Toxicology Report/n
Chris Cornell died of a deadly mix of benzos, barbiturates and amphetamines, according to a new report.
Cornell’s May 18 death in Detroit was ruled a suicide by hanging, but newly leaked details from the yet-to-be-released toxicology report suggest that he had recently relapsed after more than 15 years of sobriety.
According to reports, Cornell, 53, had four puncture wounds on his arm at the time of his death, which appeared to be the result of EMTs treating a drug overdose.

The powerful opiate antidote Naloxone was also found in his system, the report claims.
He also reportedly had Lorazepam (Ativan), the sedative Butalbital, and barbiturates in his system at the time of his death, as well as decongestant.
Wayne County Medical Examiner employee Jim Martinez told RadarOnline.com that the toxicology report has not been officially completed yet, and has not been distributed internally or publicly released.
