Harrison Ford Cheats Death Again In Shocking Plane Incident/n
Harrison Ford narrowly escaped a deadly disaster on Feb. 13 after he mistakenly landed his private plane on a taxiway and just missed crashing into another aircraft at John Wayne Airport in Orange County, Calif.
Air traffic controllers had cleared the 74-year-old licensed pilot to land his single engine Husky on runway 20-L.
Despite the FAA later noting that Ford correctly read back controllers’ landing instructions to set down on the runway, he instead headed for a taxiway and narrowly missed hitting American Airlines flight 1546, which carried 116 crew and passengers and was awaiting takeoff for Dallas.
“Was that airliner meant to be underneath me?” Ford reportedly asked air traffic control after he flew just over the aircraft.

As RadarOnline.com reported, this isn’t the first time Ford has been involved in a potentially deadly incident.
In 2015, the engine on his World War II vintage plane failed, forcing him to make a crash landing on the Penmar Golf Course in Santa Monica.
He suffered head injuries and a broken arm in that crash.
The FAA, which is currently investigating the most recent incident, later released an explanation of the shocking incident.
“The pilot…landed on a taxiway that runs parallel to the runway, overflying a Boeing 737 that was holding short of the runway,” the agency’s statement read in part.
