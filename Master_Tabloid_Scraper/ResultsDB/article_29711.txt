As You Can Imagine, DJ Khaled Flew For The First Time In Over 10 Years In The Most Extra Way Possible/n

We're so proud of DJ Khaled!
The key to the producer finally overcoming his fear of flying after 10 years of not stepping on a plane? Having his adorable son, Asahd, by his side!
The We The Best artist documented his first time flying in a decade on Instagram this week — and gave all recognition to his first born!
