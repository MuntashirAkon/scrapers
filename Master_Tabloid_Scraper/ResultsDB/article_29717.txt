Scarlett Johansson may have a new man in her life.

The Ghost in the Shell star, who is currently in the middle of a divorce with estranged husband Romain Dauriac, was spotted making out with Saturday Night Live’s Colin Jost during an after-party for the sketch show this weekend.
According to Page Six, the couple couldn’t keep their hands off each other after SNL’s 42nd season finale, in which Johnasson reprised her role of Ivanka Trump during Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson’s opening monologue. While celebrating with the cast at Rockefeller Center’s ice rink, the 32-year-old was spotted packing serious PDA with Jost, 34.
“Scarlett and Colin were making out at the bar at the SNL season finale party at 30 Rock … They would make out a bit, then go back to talking,” an eyewitness claimed. “They made out at least twice.”
Anther insider added, “They were laughing and seemed to really hit it off.”





Of course, Johansson is no stranger to SNL. The actress is one of the handful of woman who have hosted the NBC comedy five times.
Earlier this year, amidst her heated custody battle for 2-year-old daughter Rose, the mom-of-one told Playboy she didn’t quite believe in the idea of monogamy. “I don’t think it’s natural to be a monogamous person,” she said. “I might be skewered for that, but I think it’s work. It’s a lot of work. And the fact that it is such work for so many people—for everyone—the fact of that proves that it is not a natural thing.”
