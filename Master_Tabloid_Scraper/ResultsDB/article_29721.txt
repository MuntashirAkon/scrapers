Even though Remy Ma said that her feud with Nicki Minaj is “over,” Minaj made sure that she had the final word on the matter all while looking like royalty.

Minaj released the music video for “No Frauds,” her rebuttal to Remy Ma’s “Shether,” on Wednesday (Apr. 19, 2017). The video takes place in London, where all royalty resides, and Minaj is joined by her good friends Drake and Lil Wayne. Also in attendance is Remy Ma’s ex-friend and Love & Hip-Hop co-star Rashidah “Rah” Ali, which glazes this entire situation with a new gloss of petty.
“Rah took you to her doc, but you don’t look like Rah,” raps Minaj. “Left the operating table, still look like nah.”
