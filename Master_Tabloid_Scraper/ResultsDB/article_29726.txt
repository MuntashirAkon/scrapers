Ryan Reynolds, Rihanna and Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson Earn Streamy Awards Nominations/n
Get ready for the Oscars for the YouTube crowd!
The nominations for the seventh annual Streamy Awards were announced on Tuesday, and some of Hollywood’s biggest names garnered nominations while YouTube favorite and videographer Casey Neistat lead the pack with six nods.
Ryan Reynolds will compete against Dwyane “The Rock” Johnson in the Collaboration category. Reynolds is nominated for his “Logan Feat. Deadpool” video with Honest Trailers, while the former WWE star is nominated for “The YouTube Factory” alongside Lilly Singh, Markiplier, Grace Helbig, Roman Atwood, Gigi Gorgeous, Alex Wassabi, LaurDIY, King Bach, Flula, and Brittney Smith.
Rihanna earned a single nomination under Fashion for her Fenty x Puma collection.
This year’s show, which has eliminated gender distinction in its categories, will include new trophies for comedy and drama series.
First held in 2009, the Streamys recognize and honor excellence in online video. That means awards for directing, acting, producing and writing projects available on YouTube, Vine and more.
The 2017 Streamy Awards will be held Sept. 26 at the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, Calif., and will live stream on Twitter at 9:30 p.m. ET.
