Drake‘s no stranger to getting tattoos that hold very special meanings to him. That’s why the “Level Up” rapper loves inking portraits of those close to him all over this body.
The star has permanently memorialized his late uncle and grandmother with their faces tattooed on his upper back. He added a tattoo of his mother’s face next to it, and his father’s mugshot. He even told Celine Dion he wants to add her face to the collection. But first, Drake added a different famous face to his arm.

The 30-year-old rapper shared a photo on Instagram as he wrapped up Houston Appreciation Weekend, which revealed his latest tricep tat: a portrait of legendary rapper Lil Wayne‘s face glancing to the side.

The star’s new tat sits on his left tricep directly below images of skull and a bottle of Drakkar Noir cologne.
It’s not too surprising to see Drake pay homage to Lil Wayne with this tattoo — the “A Milli” rapper helped Drake get his start in the music industry back in 2009, when he signed the star to his Young Money label.
