Lil Wayne is already back on his feet after suffering two seizures Monday.The "Forever" rapper performed at the Electronic Entertainment Expo Wednesday only two days after his plane had to make an emergency landing because of his health scare. Based on video footage, the 33-year-old rapper appeared to be feeling better as he worked his way through the crowd smiling.After Lil Wayne was released from the hospital, his rep told E! News that he was on the mend. "We can confirm that he did experience two minor seizures yesterday. Under the guidance of his own doctors, he is now in stable condition and good spirits," his rep said. "He thanks his fans for their everlasting support, prayers and well wishes."The good news excited fans, but the rapper made everyone even more relieved when he broke his silence after the medical emergency. "Thx for the prayers!! I love y'all!" he tweeted.Â 

The "How to Love" rapper was flying from Milwaukee, Wis., to California when he had to make an emergency landing in Nebraska. Omaha Airport Authority confirmed to E! News that it received a medical divert call around 2:36 p.m. local time. When ambulance and the rescue fire department responded, the party involved refused treatment. The plane departed after authorities terminated the response 30 minutes after the initial call came in.But E! News later learned that the jet arrived again at 3:56 p.m. where the passenger on board was transported to a local hospital by ambulance. The passenger walked off the plane on his own accord.Lil Wayne revealed a few years ago that he has epilepsy and is "prone to seizures."We're glad to see you're feeling better, Lil Wayne!
