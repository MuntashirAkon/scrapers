Lil Wayne shared a cryptic message early Saturday morning that has many fans worried about the rapper's future in music."I AM NOW DEFENSELESS AND mentally DEFEATED & I leave gracefully and thankful I luh my fanz but I'm dun," the chart-topper expressed on Twitter, followed shortly by another tweet that read, "ain't lookin for sympathy, just serenity."Many have since speculated that the "Sucker for Pain" performer's comments, who most recently dropped his fifth studio album titled Free Weezy Album in July 2015, signal his official retirement from rapping. In the hours that followed his initial tweets, Lil Wayne responded, "I'm good y'all don't trip."A source tells E! News that the artist is not retiring from music after all, and instead his tweets came from a place of frustration surrounding a separate incident. "His love is music. He is just fed up with the game. S--t went down and he was mad and frustrated," the insider said, adding, "He needed to vent like rappers do without thinking. He has no filter. He wants to make new music and will soon enough."
