Charlize Theron is one hot mama!  The big screen bombshell dropped jaws at the CinemaCon 2012 Big Screen Achievement Awards Awards, showing off her flawless figure in a Dion Lee dress, which featured nude panels. She finished off the look with strappy Giuseppe Zanotti sandals.
Coachella isn’t just for the kids, apparently!  54-year-old Melanie Griffith hit the second weekend of the annual music festival in Indio, accessorizing her attention-grabbing floral print pants fashion faux pas with a cigarette in one hand and a beverage in the other.
As for wacky, Kim Kardashian sassed up the streets of NYC, showing off her famous fanny in a pair of ill-fitting, houndstooth plaid trousers – making us wonder if her bootyful behind is an optical illusion or a reality!
Other style scores included Mila Kinis in 3.1 Phillip Lim at CinemaCon, Victoria Beckham in one of her Posh frocks in Hong Kong, and Rihanna in Marchesa at The Time 100 Gala.
