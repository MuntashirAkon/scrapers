It looks like Christina Milian and Lil Wayne have headed to splitsville.E! News confirms that the pair have called it quits on their super private relationship after dating for nearly a year."They have broken up. Their schedules started getting extremely busy and the distance was not easy for them both," a source reveals to us."They are not on bad terms. They just are taking a break. Christina is focusing on herself now and surrounding herself with her close girl friends like Karrueche Tran. They both understand each other and girlfriends are exactly what she wants about now."Milian's rep is not commenting.

The duo began dating back in July 2014 but kept their romance under wraps for quite a while until Milian began dropping hints about a special someone in her life.Then, once the news was out, she couldn't help but gush about her rapping boyfriend."I guess I just like the mystery," the E! reality star told us at the Disneyland premiere of Tomorrowland when asked why they kept their love so secretive. "I think it's so sexy. I like to keep the sexiness going."Milian also got a sexy new tattoo inspired by her boyfriend. The fresh skin art on her left arm reads, "love hardâ€¦TNT." So what does it stand for? "You can make your special guesses...of what that means," Milian teased (Tina and Tunechi, perhaps?)."We have a very fun and cool relationship," Milian added. "There are so many things, what do I start with? He's very genuine. He's a very genuine person and no matter what, love comes first with him."Entertainment Tonight was first to break the news.
