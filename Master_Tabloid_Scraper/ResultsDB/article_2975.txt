And this week, new mom Charlize Theron added her take on the denim look, wearing a light-colored denim shirt with dark blue skinny jeans, black motorcycle boots and a white Christian Dior tote.
Want to steal look? When choosing your separates, follow in the fashionable footsteps of Kate, Rihanna and Charlize by making sure your denims are a few shades apart. As far as footwear and accessories are concerned, all of the ladies opted for contrasting colored shoes and attention grabbing bags.  Make sure not to add any more blues to the mix and if you feel uncomfortable wearing so much denim, break it up with a white shirt like Kate, or a sweater tied around your waist like Charlize.
