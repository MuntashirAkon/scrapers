Drake Takes On Protege, Coaches Up Singer Tone Stith for First Tour/nThis is the student becoming the master -- we got video of Drake in studio with up-and-coming singer Tone Stith ... who's trying to kill it on the road, just like Drizzy does. Drake met up with the 22-year-old singer Monday during a rehearsal in Houston. You can see Champagne Papi dropping some wisdom. Tone recently dropped his debut album,  "Can We Talk, "  and starts a 40-city tour this week with August Alsina. The 2 men have a lot in common. Jas Prince,  the music mogul who discovered Drake, already signed Tone ... and he's the one who set up Monday's meeting.  Tone also got a big social media bump when Drake posted video of Tone covering  "Madiba Ridim. " Lil Wayne once took Drake under his wing. Wonder how Tone feels about a Drake tattoo?/n
