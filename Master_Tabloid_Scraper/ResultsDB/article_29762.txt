Adam West 'Batman' Actor Dead at 88/nAdam West -- star of TV's  "Batman " -- has died after a short battle with leukemia. The actor played Batman /Bruce Wayne in the campy 1960's television series and years later landed a recurring role on  "Family Guy " as the voice of the mayor of Quahog. The TV version of  "Batman " ran on ABC from 1966 - 68 and was an enormous, campy hit and remains an iconic version of the famed Caped Crusader. Wayne was always on the receiving end of hilarious lines delivered by co-star Burt Ward, aka Robin ...  "Holy atomic pile, "  "Holy barracuda, "  "Holy Benedict Arnold, "  "Holy popcorn, " and  "Holy shrinkage! "  West died Friday night at his home in Los Angeles. The family released a statement, saying ...  "Our dad always saw himself as The Bright Knight, and aspired to make a positive impact on his fans’ lives. He was and always will be our hero.” Fellow Batman actor, Ben Affleck, echoed the sentiment in a tweet ...  "Adam West exemplified heroism. Kind, funny and an all around great guy. Thank you for showing us all how it's done. " He was 88. RIP/n
