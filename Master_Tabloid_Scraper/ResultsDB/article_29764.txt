'Joker' Look-Alike Arrested After Pointing Loaded Gun at Drivers/nThe JokerÂ has been arrested ... again ... this time well outside the Gotham City limits. 29-year-old Lawrence Patrick Sullivan -- whose face is tatted up like Batman's archenemy -- was busted in Miami Tuesday after allegedly pointing a loaded gun at drivers passing an apartment complex. Responding officers say they found Sullivan with a loaded Smith & Wesson handgun in his pocket. Cops were responding to multiple calls earlier in the day about an armed man who resembled the Joker. He was booked for carrying a concealed firearm, and bail was set for $5,000. Stand down, Bruce Wayne./n
