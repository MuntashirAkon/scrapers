Rapper T-Wayne Fires Back at Angry Fans of T-Pain/Lil Wayne Album/nT-Wayne -- the Houston emcee best known for his track  "Nasty Freestyle " -- says he's fed up with the backlash he's been getting since T-Pain and Lil Wayne's famous collab album dropped. The rapper tells us fans of the  "T-Wayne " album -- nearly 10 years in the making -- are pissed at him because they think he's trying to compare himself to the hip-hop legends.  T-Wayne says those fans got it twisted ... he's been going by his rap name since he was a kid. His first and middle names are Tyson Dwayne, so it's legit -- and Weezy and T-Pain fans just gotta deal with it.  "T-Wayne " the album's been in the works since 2009, when the Houston rapper was 18. He went on to blow up in 2015 when his hit reached #9 on Billboard./n
