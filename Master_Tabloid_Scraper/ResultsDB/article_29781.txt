The Vanderpump Rules cast took a trip to Playa del Carmen with their camera crew last week — and Valletta was nowhere to be found. Marie previously begged Valetta to film for Bravo, but he refused.
The trip comes just months after Marie began pushing for another ring from her new man.
“Scheana wants a ring from Robert,” a source told Radar at the time. “She’s super into him.”
