And before you ask if the "period blood on the leg scene" actually happened, the genius behind Sausage Party confirmed:

The period blood on the leg scene in Superbad actually happened to my friend at a high school dance and we discovered it after the dance.

Neat, but we're pretty sure the phrase "fingerfuck" was actually a plot point in 1995's coming-of-age film Welcome To The Dollhouse. Maybe the MPAA folks blocked it out…


The end house party in Superbad was filmed about half a block from the OJ murder house.
