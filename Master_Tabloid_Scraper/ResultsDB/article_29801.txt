Robin had been a huge part Harry’s life since the star was 7, supporting him during his teenage years and The X Factor auditions. He married Harry’s mother, Anne Cox, at a private ceremony in Congleton, Cheshire in June 2013. The One Directioner crooner served as best man at the wedding.
Robin had helped raised Harry since he was 7 after Cox’s split with the star’s biological father, Des Styles. He was also the stepdad to Harry’s sister, Gemma, as well as the father of son Mike and daughter Amy from a previous relationship.
