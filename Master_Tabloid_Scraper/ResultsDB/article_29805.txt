Living legend Chrissy Teigen ditched the 2017 Billboard Music Awards to attend a much more eventful show.

Teigen announced on Twitter that she would be spending her Sunday evening with her sister and her niece in Las Vegas while John Legend attended and performed at the BBMAs. As per usual, Teigen was relaxing in a horizontal position in a towel, Snapchatting with the best filters, and tweeting about Miley Cyrus’ performance, but sometime thereafter, things got a little interesting.

She updated her Snapchat story with a video of her and her squad in full glam, walking down a hotel hallway en route to Magic Mike Live. On their trail down to the lobby, they found a naked and deflated blow-up sex doll equipped with a “pee pee.”

Later on, Teigen picked up on a story about her evening on Cosmo and confirmed the story, only adding, “And it. Was dope.”
