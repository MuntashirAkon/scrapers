Kylie Jenner can’t contain her jealousy of Kourtney Kardashian’s steamy naked photoshoot from their family trip to Costa Rica.

Kourtney strips down for the camera to get wet and wild for photographer Mike Rosenthal in a clip from Sunday’s episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians. Kylie, Kim Kardashian, and Khloé Kardashian watch in awe as Kourtney poses in the pool, flipping her hair like a water goddess in a shot that turns out like this:

“What the f—? I want to get in,” says Kylie. “I’m so jealous!”
Khloé later admits to Kourtney that she was afraid she would lose her mojo after she gave birth to her daughter Penelope.
“I did think, like, She’s gone,” Khloé says in a joint confessional. “Now she’s YOLO-ing it up, f—ing bomb ass body, naked in the pool and your sisters should be afraid of you.”

Meanwhile, TMZ reports that Scott Disick’s friends are concerned that he’s turning to alcohol once again to cope with his problems. They say that he’s been in a “downward spiral” ever since Kourtney started seeing 23-year-old model Younes Bendjima and that he “feels betrayed” by the promise of them getting back together once he found sobriety. Even though he’s been “dating” 19-year-old model Ella Ross, Disick’s home has been a “non-stop, alcohol-fueled party for weeks.”
