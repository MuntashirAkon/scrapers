The country star wed her NHL star beau in 2010 at the Ritz Carlton Reynolds Plantation in Georgia before 250 friends and family in a ceremony featuring classical music and the couple’s favorite Bible readings. The pair got engaged in December 2009, after quietly dating for about a year.

Underwood and Fisher are parents to 2-year-old son Isaiah Michael.
The American Idol alum is definitely her husband — and the Nashville Predators’ — biggest fan. The star has often posted pictures and video clips of herself and friends rooting for Fisher’s team, who lost the 2017 NHL playoffs to the Pittsburgh Penguins.
