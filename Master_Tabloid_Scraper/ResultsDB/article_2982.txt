Women With Bigger Butts Are Smarter And Healthier According To Science! Yay Science!/n

If you're anything like Sir Mix-a-Lot, chances are you're a fan of big butts!
But apparently there are more advantages to having a bodacious bum than meets the eye!
Scientists from the University of Oxford found that women with curvaceous cabooses are not only on average healthier, but they also tend to be smarter than women with tiny tails!!
According to science, ladies with rounder rumps have lower levels of cholesterol and usually produce hormones that help metabolize sugar, meaning they are at much lower risk for diabetes!
The fantastic fannies also tend to favor higher leptin levels, a hormone that helps prevent cardiovascular disease!
Having a bigger booty also requires extra Omega 3 fats, which are basically like steroids for your brain!
And apparently having a doozy of a donk is also good for your kiddies! Studies show that children born to women with wider hips tend to be smarter than children born to mommies with itty bitty waists!
Wowzers! We also knew derrieres were amazing, but we never knew they were so great for your health!
