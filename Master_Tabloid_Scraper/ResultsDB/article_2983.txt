Kourtney Kardashian Moms Like A Boss/n

Two kids. Three hands. One mom.
Wait, how many hands??
Kourtney Kardashian did Mommy double duty on Wednesday, pushing Penelope in her stroller WHILE never letting go of little Mason's hand!
Ch-ch-check out the pics (below) to see how tight the protective momma held her kids!
We guess she was extra concerned about letting the little guy run loose in a strange country. Not that England is that strange.
But they do eat kippers and sit on fannies! Or do we have that backwards? LOLz!
