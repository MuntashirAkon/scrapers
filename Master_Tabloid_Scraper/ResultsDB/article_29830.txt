Mike Epps Avoids Jail In Casino Brawl/nMike Epps has probably lost more money on a high-stakes table than he'll have to dish out in fines for beating down a dude in a New Orleans casino. Epps pled no contest Thursday to misdemeanor battery charges stemming from the February brawl at the NOLA Harrah's. He got a 30-day sentence but it was suspended, so no time behind bars. He also has to pay a $175 fine and $125 in court costs. Bottom line -- he's walking away for the low low price of $300. As we reported, Epps allegedly left the victim with a black eye and neck pain after the attack./n
