Bowling Green Kicker: I Can Hit a 60 Yarder .... Seriously. /nThe Bowling Green kicker who went viral for hitting a  "Make This And You Get a Full Scholarship " kick at practice says he was confident at 53 yards ... 'cause he can hit from 60! We spoke with Jake Suder -- who came through CLUTCH at Monday's practice when Coach Mike Jinks surprised him in the middle of the session by saying,  "Make this and you get a full ride. " FYI, Bowling Green costs $20,000 per year for an Ohio resident. Suder connected -- and his teammates went wild!!Â  We asked Suder and Coach Jinks what they were thinking right before and during the kick -- the whole thing is pretty awesome.Â  Congrats to Suder -- and to the entire BG program. Dope moment.Â   Hit It to Win It. Coach Jinks challenges Jake Suder to a 53 Yard FG for a chance to earn a scholarship..... ðŸ™Œ #NailedIt #AyZiggy pic.twitter.com /7dr6VcienP â€” AyZiggyFB Recruiting (@ayziggyfb) August 16, 2017/n
