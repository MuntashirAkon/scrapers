Berkeley Rally Against Hate Ramps Up, Violent Clashes Break Out /nA rally against hate in Berkeley is shaping up to possibly be the next Charlottesville -- albeit in reverse -- since people are already throwing punches and swinging sticks.

Cops have tried to keep the peace, but fights are still breaking out.
