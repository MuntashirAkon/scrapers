Youth Football Coach & Dad Almost Come To Blows/n
“If I find a kid not paying attention I bring the hammer down!”
The coach on Friday Night Tykes is no-nonsense but his iron fisted way of handling his football players leads him to almost come to blows with a kid’s father in a clip of the Esquire Network show.
“You have to pay attention,” the coach yells at a young player. “The thing that p***es me off is not paying attention.”
The boy is forced to run laps, enraging his father.

“Everybody thinks their kids are superstars,” the coach rails, to which the boy’s father rants:
“That’s my son…There are a lot of kids clowning around…Last year he had to run 20 laps.”
The coach rips into his player, clad in his uniform and helmet, and berates him in front of his dad.
“Benny, come with me. What do I keep asking you every day in practice to be?”

Benny responds: “A leader,” and the coach yells at him. “Say it to your dad. Have you been a leader?” and the child admits “No.”
“So tell your dad it’s your fault that you’re running, no one else’s.”
Friday Night Tykes airs on Tuesday night at 9/8c on Esquire Network.
