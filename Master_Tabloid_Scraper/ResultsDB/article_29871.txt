 He's Not Missing Her: Sean Combs 86's American Idol Judging Gig After Ex Jennifer.../n
There’s not enough room on American Idol for Jennifer Lopez and her ex Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs according to a new report that said the hip-hop mogul passed on being a judge on the show’s 13th season after his ex inked a pact with the sagging franchise.
Combs, 43, “felt it was a ‘her or me’ situation” in his negotiations with the show, an insider told US Weekly, because of bad blood that lingers with both Lopez and her longtime manager Benny Medina. (Medina also represented the rapper at one time as well.)

Combs, who dated the diva for better part of three years (from 1999 until 2001) denied the report through his camp.
J.Lo will be joined on the panel by returning judge Keith Urban when the show returns in January. /n
