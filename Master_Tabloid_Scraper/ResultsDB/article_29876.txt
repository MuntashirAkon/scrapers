Miguel Gifts The World With Three Brand New Songs AKA His First Since 2012! Listen HERE!/n

Major swoonage alert! We repeat: MAJOR SWOONAGE ALERT!
Miguel, everyone's favorite romantic R&B crooner, has dropped three BRAND NEW SONGS and they're pretty freakin' fantastic.
The songs, nwa ft. Kurupt, coffee, and hollywooddream, are the first new tracks since he released Kaleidoscope Dreams back in 2012!

Though, he did put in some work with Lorde on the Hunger Games: Mockingjay â€” Part 1 soundtrack, but that doesn't really count. (Just kidding it totally does)
But the three-song EP is proof (hopefully) that Miguel has his eyes set on a bigger album coming out soon.
How soon, we may never know, but for now, you'll have these three songs to play on repeat to tide you over.
Listen to the soulful goodies (below)!!!
