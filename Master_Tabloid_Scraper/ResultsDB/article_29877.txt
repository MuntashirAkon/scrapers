Miguel has covered Elton John's Bennie and the Jets, and you don't need to read it in a mag-a-ziiiiine-oh-oh to know that it is AH-Mazing!
Miguel recorded this song as part of the 40th anniversary for Goodbye Yellow Brick Road album reissue, and it is so much Miguel in our face! 
In fact, there's more Miguel in our face than that lady who got a crotchful when Miguel tried to jump from stage to stage! We love it - Miguel's music in our ears, not his high velocity pelvis in our grill!
Overall, his crooning homage is worth a listen, and so is Wale's rapping, too!
Ch-ch-check out the buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-beautiful cover (above)!!!
