Beyoncé, Jay Z And Solange Get Lampooned On 'SNL'/n
Maya Rudolph made a surprise return to Saturday Night Live and stole the show with her spot on imitation of Beyoncé in a sketch about the epic battle between her husband, Jay Z, and sister, Solange.
The bit starts with Jay Pharoah doing his best Jay Z impersonation and SNL newcomer Sasheer Zamata as Solange explaining that they really love each other. Kenan Thompson is there, playing a bodyguard, in case anything goes wrong.
What REALLY happened in that elevator, Jay and Solange insist, is that she was trying to get a spider off her brother-in-law.
Beyoncé, we’re told, is off “making another sexually explicit video.”

This is a return engagement for Rudolph and Pharoah playing Beyoncé and Jay, and they’ve got it down pat.
It’s Beyoncé as you’ve never seen her before, and you can watch it here!
