Solar Eclipse Totally Shades Hollywood Stars /nThe first total solar eclipse in 38 years made its way across the U.S. Monday afternoon, and while the moon and the sun got their thing on, the stars - i.e. celebs - came out in droves to catch a peek. Lady Gaga, Lance Bass, Jack Black, Bill Nye, Ryan Seacrest, Sarah Jessica Parker and many more got shaded in eclipse glasses. Amy Schumer and Sarah Hyland opted for the ol' DIY box projector. Even the Prez and his family got in on the fun. The phenomenon could be seen across North America, from Oregon to South Carolina between 10 AM and 3 PM. Eclipses happen about once every 18 months ... when the moon is expected to pass between the sun and the Earth. The next solar eclipse over the U.S. will be in 2024, and after that 2045./n
