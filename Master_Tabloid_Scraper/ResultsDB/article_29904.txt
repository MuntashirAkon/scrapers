Spears — who split from her fiancé Jason Trawick only a few months ago — was snapped Saturday night arriving for dinner at Meatball Spot at Town Square with her manager Larry Rudolph and two other people. The “Toxic” singer was later joined by new boyfriend David Lucado —  an employee at a top law firm — and six more pals.
A witness told PEOPLE that Spears, 31, and Lucado “seemed happy, sitting across from each other and chatting for more of the meal.”
The mag also reports that Brit enjoyed a meal of classic meatball sliders with mozzarella cheese and homemade mac and cheese and had a Bananas Foster ice cream sandwich and sipped a birthday cake milkshake.
After dinner, the couple took in Shania Twain’s Still the One show at Caesars Palace. /n
