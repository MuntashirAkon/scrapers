Maya Rudolph Is A Purple QUEEN Honoring Prince On His Birthday — With Special Guest Fred Armisen!/n

We are not worthy, Maya Rudolph!!!!
For those who don't know, the Saturday Night Live vet has a Prince cover band with Gretchen Lieberum aptly called Princess.
But this week, the performer made it clear she was nothing less than a QUEEN — decked out in purple, obvi — when the band performed in honor of The Purple One's birthday!

Maya and Co. brought the house down at the Teragram Ballroom in L.A. playing all of the late music icon's hits — like Darling Nikki, Nasty Girl, Little Red Corvette, and of course Purple Rain.
But the icing on the cake was the presence of Fred Armisen, who backed his SNL classmate for the night playing drums.
Best birthday party ever! Ch-ch-check out clips from Princess's performance (below)!
