Produced by McCarthy and husband Ben Falcone, Nobodies follows writers Hugh Davidson, Larry Dorf, and Rachel Ramras as they try to convince a big name actor to star in their script, Mr. First Lady.
Of course, wooing such talent is another story — as guest stars like Kristen Wiig, Allison Janney, Jason Bateman, Maya Rudolph, Jim Rash, and Nat Faxon aren't exactly chomping at the bit to work with a bunch of nobodies.
Watch the trailer (below) to see McCarthy hilariously rip on the starring trio — and catch the series premiere Wednesday, March 29 at 10 p.m. EST on TV Land!
