Police Search for Two Amish Girls Abducted from N.Y. Roadside Stand/n
Authorities are searching for two Amish girls they say were abducted from a roadside stand in northern New York.    
The St. Lawrence County Sheriff’s Office says police patrols are out searching Thursday morning for 7-year-old Delila Miller and 12-year-old Fannie Miller.    
Officials issued an Amber Alert for the two girls after they were abducted around 7:30 p.m. Wednesday in the rural town of Oswegatchie, located on the Canadian border 150 miles northwest of Albany.     
Police say the girls went to wait on a customer at the family’s roadside stand. A witness saw a passenger in a vehicle put something into the back seat, and when the vehicle drove off the children were gone. The vehicle was described as a small white, four-door sedan, Syracuse.com reported.    
Both girls, who have brown hair and brown eyes, were wearing dark blue dresses with blue aprons and black bonnets, the Democrat & Chronicle reported. The younger girl has a round scar on her forehead and is missing front teeth, while her older sister is cross-eyed, authorities said.    
Those with information about the abduction are asked to call the St. Lawrence Co. Sheriff’s Office at (866) NYS-AMBER or 911.
