Minnesota Vikings Pay Tribute To Prince With Amazing Halftime Show â€” And SPOOKY Coincidence!/n

Such a fitting tribute for a true legend!
Prince may have passed on, but he'll never leave the hearts and minds of his fans â€” and it appears that his home state of Minnesota isn't too keen on ever forgetting his memory and music, either!

The Minnesota Vikings played their first regular season NFL game in their brand new U.S. Bank Stadium on Sunday, and to open the venue, they did the best thing: a MASSIVE Prince tribute for a halftime show!
The Minnesota Orchestra performed a selection of Prince's hits with gospel support from The Steeles, and the entire stadium went purple with an incredible, inspiring halftime performance!
What a perfect memorial for the late Minnesota native and dearly beloved superstar!
Ch-ch-check out some of the highlights (below)!!!

The Vikings no doubt did justice to Prince's memory and music with the performance, and you can tell the entire stadium quite literally lit up in appreciation (below):

Even before the game, fans were already feeling Prince's absence, too.
One fan had a custom-made Prince jersey decked out in an appropriate purple (both the Vikings' team colors, and the color most well known for being linked to Prince) below:

Nice!!
To make things even crazier, though, a spooky coincidence went down in the first quarter that fans very quickly picked up on.

The stadium's first touchdown ever was on a pass from Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers to wide receiver Jordy Nelson.
Wait a secondâ€¦ Rodgers to Nelson? Prince's full name, of course, is Prince Rogers Nelson.
Weird!!!
Sadly the Vikings lost the game, but they definitely won the day overall! What an amazing tribute!!
