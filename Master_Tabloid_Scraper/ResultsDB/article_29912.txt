The Bridesmaids alum revealed that she saw a Swedish group called Erato perform Robyn's Call Your Girlfriend while hitting butter tubs — like Anna Kendrick does in Cups — on YouTube a few years ago, and has been working on perfecting that cover ever since!
Well, with a little help from the Easy A actress, Miz Rudolph was finally able to make that dream come true on her late-night show with Martin Short!
The dynamic duo flawlessly performed the a capella rendition of the electropop hit, and it's honestly amazing!
Seriously, Maya SLAYED those harmonies, and Emma sure has some pretty pipes! Ch-ch-check it out (above)!
