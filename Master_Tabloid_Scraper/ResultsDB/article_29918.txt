The full cast for Lifetime’s Britney Spears’ biopic, which the singer disapproves of entirely, has been revealed. Aside from Australian actress Natasha Bassett playing Spears, which was previously revealed when the project was announced, the full lineup includes Nathan Keyes as *NSYNC boy bander Justin Timberlake and Clayton Chitty as Spears’ ex-husband, Kevin Federline.

Other notable roles that have been cast include Nicole Oliver as mama Lynn Spears, Matthew Harrison as papa Jamie Spears, Peter Benson as longtime manager Larry Rudolph, Tamara Thorsen as a pre-Step Up Jenna Dewan and Kelly McCabe as Jason Alexander, Spears’ childhood friend who she was infamously married to for 55 hours.
Buzzfeed reports that Wade Robson, the man Spears allegedly cheated with while she was dating Timberlake, has been cast. The lucky man playing the part will be Canadian actor Markian Tarasiuk.
If you’re having a hard time imaging these people playing your faves, Lifetime has shared the following photo to put any doubts to rest. Yes, that is Keyes as a ramen-haired Timberlake. Enjoy.
