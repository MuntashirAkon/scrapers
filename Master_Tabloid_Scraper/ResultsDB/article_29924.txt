Only Tina Fey and Amy Poehler can make a mockery of Star Wars in the best way possible.
The real-life BFFs appear in a featurette titled “Sisters: The Farce Awakens,” teasing their new film, and basically reminding everyone not to forget about their movie amidst all the Star Wars: The Force Awakens hype. In this spoof promo, the Sisters stars, including Maya Rudolph and The Mindy Project’s Ike Barinholtz talk about their comedy with the same gravitas used in many Star Wars features.

In the video, Fey and Poehler speak in English accents (because they’re hiding their drunkenness), and Barinholtz reveals just how much of a fan he is of the upcoming comedy. “Growing up, I had a ‘Sisters’ lunchbox, I had all the ‘Sisters’ toys,” he admits. “For Halloween, I used to dress up like Maya Rudolph.”
We are sure to expect some of jokes during their SNL appearance on Dec. 19. Sisters opens in theaters December 18, but their parody above reminds us that #YouCanWatchBoth.
