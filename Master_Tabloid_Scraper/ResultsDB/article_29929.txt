No one could be more fitting to perform the serenade, considering D'Angelo has faced comparisons to the musician since his debut album. However, he told Rolling Stone in 2000 that his love for Prince began long before that as a child. "We always had every new album the first day, and we would dissect that shit and study it, and after we listened to it, we'd have a discussion about it. We always did that," he said. As he sang out the final line of the song Wednesday night, it couldn't have sounded more true: "All good things they say never last. And love, it isn't love 'til it's past."Prince was discovered unconscious in an elevator in his Paisley Park estate on Thursday. An autopsy was performed the following day and his body was subsequently cremated. Prince's close family and friends celebrated his life in a private ceremony held Saturday.
