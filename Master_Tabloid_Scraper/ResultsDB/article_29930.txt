You guys. How weird is this?!A lot of people may have thought that they were lucky enough to run into funnywoman Maya Rudolph while enjoying the wonderful designs shown at New York Fashion Week, but they were fooled. The Saturday Night Live alum was not present for the event—but her long lost twin was!OK, obviously it's not her actual twin, but she might as well be, because the resemblance is absolutely eerie. Maya's look-alike sat front row at a Mark & Estel fashion show last week, and people instantly assumed it was the actress.And apparently, the mystery woman didn't go out of her way to let people know she wasn't Rudolph. "Photographers were yelling ‘Maya,' and she didn't deny anything, but kept saying, ‘No photos,'" an eyewitness told Page Six.A rep for the designers said they did not meet "the supposed Maya Rudolph in person at the show," but as she's one of their longtime clients, they're "always delighted to see Maya Rudolph, real or impersonated."Well, all right then.
