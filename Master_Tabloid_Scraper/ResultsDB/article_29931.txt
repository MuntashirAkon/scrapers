Emma Stone and Maya Rudolph Perform Robyn's "Call Your Girlfriend" With Butter Tubs "Call your girlfriend / It's time you had the talk / Give your reasons / Say it's not her fault / But you j.../n
"Call your girlfriend / It's time you had the talk / Give your reasons / Say it's not her fault / But you just met somebody new / Don't you tell her how I give you something that you never even knew you missed / Don't you even try and explain how it's so different when we kiss / And you just tell her that the only way her heart will mend is when she learns to love again / And it won't make sense right now but you're still her friend / And then you let her down easy," Stone, 27, and Rudolph, 43, sang. "Call your girlfriend / It's time you had the talk / Give your reasons / Say it's not her fault / But you just met somebody new / And now it's gonna be me and you."Since its May 31 debut, Maya & Marty (co-hosted by Martin Short) has featured a number of high-profile guests, including John Cena, Miley Cyrus, Larry David, Drake, Jimmy Fallon, Tina Fey, Will Forte, Ricky Gervais, Tom Hanks, Kevin Hart, Sean Hayes, Nick Jonas, Eva Longoria, Steve Martin, Kate McKinnon, Amy Poehler, Kelly Ripa, Jerry Seinfeld and Ben Stiller.(E! and NBC are both members of the NBCUniversal family.)
