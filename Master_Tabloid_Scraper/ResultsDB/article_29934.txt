Afterwards, Meyers and Rudolph impersonated the exact interview. The Bridesmaids star even brought along her "Rachel Dolezal wig" for the occasion. Launching right into the mock interview, Meyers asked "Dolezal" the same questions, with Rudolph staring blankly and taken aback the entire time."Is your father an African American?" Meyers asked."Wait...I don't really understand the question," Rudolph responded, stuttering her way through the answer while looking severely confused."Are either of your parents black," he continued."I don't ugh. I mean ugh," Dolezal answered, pointing to her wig.When the interview was over, Rudolph joked, "I think America really missed out. I'm so glad I brought my Rachel Dolezal wig. I always keep it in my purse."Watch the video above to see her spot-on impression.
