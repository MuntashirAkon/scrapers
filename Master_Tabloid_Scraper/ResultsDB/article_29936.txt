"The only one in your business is the city because it ain't finished yet," Moore snapped.And so began the feisty threats. "Let's just hope you never have a flood because, bitch, I hope you know how to swim," Whitfield told Moore.Ferrell's Moore continued to mock Whitfield for her slow-moving construction project, so Rudolph's impersonation poked fun at Moore's house, which she said resides in a "ditch.""I'll be in the ditch for three months, but you'll still be in a tent outside cuz your bitch ass can't move in yet," Moore said.Ooh burn! Watch the clip to see how these two resolved their issues. When Rudolph wasn't fighting about her fake house, she answered fans' questions. One fan called an asked her how much money it would take her to make a Bridesmaids 2."Well I would like 50 million dollars and I feel like Kristen [Wiig] would probably say the same thing," the Sisters actress joked. "I would do it for free it was so fun. That's the truth.""There was a real sisterhood," added Ferrell, who didn't appear in the movie"There was a real Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants," Rudolph quipped.(E! and Bravo are both part of the NBCUniversal family.)
