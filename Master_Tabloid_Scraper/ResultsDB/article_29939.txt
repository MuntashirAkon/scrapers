Maya Rudolph and Fred Armisen Nail 'Purple Rain' to Celebrate Prince's Birthday/nMaya Rudolph tipped her hat to Prince Thursday night with her cover band, Princess ... the last night of back-to-back sold-out shows honoring the Purple One's 59th birthday. The 'SNL' vet performed at the Teragram Ballroom in L.A., and her old co-star, Fred Armisen, sat in on drums for  "Darling Nikki ",  "Nasty Girl " and  "Purple Rain. " Even Prince had said he was a fan of Maya's group ... easy to see why. If you know what I'm singing about up here, c'mon, raise your hand!      I only want to see you #laughing in the #purplerain !! #mayarudolph and #fredarmisen in #prince #coverband #princess was amazing.
