Trump's D.C. Hotel Guest Arrested with Guns Obsessed with Timothy McVeigh, Cops Say/nThe Trump International Hotel guest who was busted with high-powered guns -- blocks from the White House -- has a troubling interest in Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh. According to new police docs ... Bryan Moles left a voicemail with a friend about his trip from Pennsylvania to Washington D.C., saying his car  "looked like Timothy McVeigh or Eric Rudolph was going on a camping trip. " McVeigh killed 168 people in the 1995 OKC bombing, and Rudolph is the convicted Olympic Park bomber. Once cops tracked Moles to his hotel room, they discovered a large amount of cash. According to docs ... Moles told them he'd withdrawn $10k from his checking account to leave it with a balance of $4.19, as a nod to April 19 ... the date of the Oklahoma City bombing. He also told cops he'd once written a term paper on McVeigh. Cops say Moles, who is a physician at a PA hospital -- also admitted he'd stopped taking anti-psychotic meds -- to treat PTSD from his military service -- because they made him suicidal. As we reported ... the Secret Service says the people they protect were not at risk at any point during Moles' time in D.C./n
