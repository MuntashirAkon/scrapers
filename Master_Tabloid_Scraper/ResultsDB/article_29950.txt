Ex Mgr to Brit: Keep Me Outta Yo Mess!/nWith K-Fed's lawyers looking to nail Brit's former manager with a subpoena, Larry Rudolph says he'd rather stay in hiding than be forced to drop the dime on Britney in court.In a statement to ThatOtherBlog.com, Rudolph said:  "Despite the things that Britney has publicly said about our relationship in the past, I truly understand where she's coming from and why she's said the things she said about me post-rehab and I don't take it personally. As her former manager, I know and understand Britney better than anyone, I know what makes her tick and I understand everything she's going through. With that being said, my loyalty will always stay strong with Britney. I have consulted with my lawyers and I do understand that eventually the time will come when they will find me, but until then, I'm trying to avoid being brought into this mess. She's going through so much right now and I wish Britney the best. "/n
