Britney Ices K-Fed/nNewly single and icy cool, Britney Spears took to the world famous ice skating rink at Rockefeller Center in New York tonight, in a post-filing-of-papers celebratory skate. With K-Fed in the deep freeze, she has reason to celebrate.Brit's manager Larry Rudolph helped the blonde pop tart stay upright, while hordes of amazed tourists took pictures and watched the teen idol skate. Once Britney got her balance, she was twirling and putting on quite a show -- just two hours after news of her split was scooped by TMZ.Just before skating, she did some damage at a local Gap store to pick up an outfit for the rink. She looked fine in her slick black pants, plunging neckline and white hat (the good guys always wear a white hat).  She had been seen earlier leaving her hotel, and dining at Italian bistro Baldoria, protected by dark glasses and a large bodyguard. You go Brit!
