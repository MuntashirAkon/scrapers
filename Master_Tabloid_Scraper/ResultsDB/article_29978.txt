“It’s the most insane thing I’ve ever seen,” joked Fallon, “How did this happen?”
The 54-year-old Ghost star admitted: “I sheared off my front teeth. I’d love to say it was skateboarding or something really kind of cool, but I think it’s something that’s important to share because I think it’s literally, probably after heart disease, one of the biggest killers in America, which is stress.”
The actress, who, as readers know, is currently stuck in a wrongful drowning death lawsuit, later joked that her children find her gap endlessly hilarious, although they also feel it makes her look more “human” and “vulnerable.”
