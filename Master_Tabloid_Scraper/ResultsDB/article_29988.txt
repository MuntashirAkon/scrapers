On July 1, the 28-year-old posted a stunning selfie (above) along with an inspiring message thanking all those who have been supporting her.
Revealing she's been substance free for all of 2017 so far, the actress wrote: 
"I will be the first one to say I'm not perfect and I mess up sometimes and every once in a while I get it right but I wanted to share this because I am really proud of myself. Yesterday I celebrated 6 Months of Sobriety. It's not something I planned on but after the long journey of getting here I can honestly say I have never been more proud of myself in my entire life. Thank you all for the love and support and remember to be gentle with yourself ðŸ˜Š"
AH-Mazing!
This is the first time Bruce Willis and Demi Moore's oldest daughter has been public about her battle. Though in 2014, Rumer's sister Tallulah Willis entered 45-day rehab inpatient program for substance abuse and an eating disorder.
We applaud Rumer for opening up about her battles and how she's overcoming them.
