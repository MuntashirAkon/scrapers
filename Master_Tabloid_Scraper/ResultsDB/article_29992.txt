Is that you, Rumer Willis?

The eldest daughter of Bruce Willis and Demi Moore was nearly unrecognizable when she stepped out with a noticeably bigger and more pronounced pout on Wednesday night (Feb. 1, 2017) for the FISHBOWL grand opening party at Dream Midtown in New York City. Rocking a light pink lipstick, the 28-year-old immediately sparked rumors that she had some work done to enhance her upper lip.
However, as we previously saw with Kylie Jenner and Khloé Kardashian, it’s not hard to create the illusion of fuller lips just by using a darker shade of liner around your pout. So, is it all just makeup mastery?
