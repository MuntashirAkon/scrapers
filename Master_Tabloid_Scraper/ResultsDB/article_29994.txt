The couple that drags Piers Morgan together, stays together.

Chrissy Teigen and John Legend proved that they have no time for trolls when they went in on British journalist, who’s now more known for verbally attacking celebrities more than anything else these days, after Morgan made some insensitive remarks about the late Muhammad Ali just hours after the boxer’s passing.
The Twitter war first started when Morgan claimed that Ali made “far more inflammatory/racist things about white people than Donald Trump ever has about Muslims” when he was alive.
“Why sugar-coat what Ali said or stood for? He never did that to himself, or when speaking to others. I hope people don’t make me sound too perfect when I die. No coats of sugar please,” he wrote in a series of tweets. “Why would stating that Muhammad Ali made a lot of inflammatory, race-charged statements in his life be remotely controversial? He did. I’m sorry for ‘saying inflammatory things for attention.’ That’s the last thing Muhammad Ali would have condoned.”

Legend then responded, “You could test us by announcing your retirement,” to which his wife quipped, “From what? Trolling isn’t a job (I’ve tried).”
Morgan then tried to take a dig at Teigen by writing back, “Maybe I should take up a proper job, like modeling?”

“It keeps me nice and not-racist so sure, give it a go,” she responded. Meanwhile, Morgan wrote back, “I’m not racist either, so that makes two of us.”
“Remember when Bruce Willis didn’t know he was dead? It’s like that,” Teigen replied, referring to the twist ending surprising 1999’s The Sixth Sense.

@piersmorgan remember when Bruce Willis didn’t know he was dead? It’s like that.

Though it seemed the spat died down, Morgan reignited the feud when he called out Teigen and Legend the following Monday (June 6, 2016) after writing a column about how Ali “was a racist who repented.”
“You may want to read my new column about Ali & racism, @johnlegend @chrissyteigen -you may learn something,” he tweeted.
“Sorry can’t read, just a model doing modeling,” Teigen sarcastically wrote back. “Troll recognize troll. I can’t tweet him anymore.”
She continued, “Piers Morgan searches his name every 4.8 seconds. Hi, Piers. I know you’re reading this. You unequivocal douche.”
Not one to take the road, Morgan then continued to lash out at Teigen, writing, “My 4 kids all just looked at me and said: ‘Daddy, who’s Chrissy Teigen?'”
He added, “Hi Chrissy. No I’m not, you ludicrous swimwear accessory.”

my newborn just looked up at me and said “mommy, why is piers morgan so unequivocally douchy?” i didn’t know what to say
