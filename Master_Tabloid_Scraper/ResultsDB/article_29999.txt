Someone’s channeling her inner Khloe Kardashian.

Last night (Apr. 7, 2016), Katharine McPhee may have bid adieu to the show that launched her career, but she said hello to a brand new look. McPhee showed off a blonde ombre lob on the American Idol series finale red carpet. The singer turned actress debuted her new look on Instagram the day before, declaring, “Blondes have more fun…. At least for 3 months.”

It sounds like McPhee will have to return to her brunette locks after her CBS show Scorpion comes off of hiatus, but until then, it looks like blondes really do have more fun.
