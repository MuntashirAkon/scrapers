“Always.”

Alan Rickman passed away in London after fighting a long battle with cancer. The news of his death was confirmed by The Guardian on Thursday (Jan. 14, 2016) with an official statement from his family that said that he was “surrounded by family and friends”. Rickman is best known for his roles in Love Actually, Die Hard, and in the Harry Potter franchise as Professor Snape. He had kept his cancer diagnosis under wraps as he did with most other occurrences in his private life—including his marriage to partner Rima Horton.
“Harry Potter” author J.K. Rowling expressed her sentiments on the actor’s death on Twitter.

My thoughts are with Rima and the rest of Alan’s family. We have all lost a great talent. They have lost part of their hearts.
