There was a Willis family affair last night! Fresh off of winning Dancing With the Stars, Rumer Willis made her Broadway debut Monday as blond bombshell Roxie Hart in the musical Chicago. Naturally, the major accomplishment called for celebration, and Rumer's A-list fam was on hand to congratulate the starlet's successful start.Friendly exes Bruce Willis and Demi Moore reunited for their eldest daughter's special evening, as did Bruce's wife, Emma Heming. Scout, 24, and Tallulah, 21, completed the Willis sister act, looking chic in their own unique ensembles outside the New York City theater.

Rumer offered a sweet message to her adoring family, writing on Instagram, "These people are everything to me. I would never had made it to that stage without you guys. Thank you to my amazing parents for supporting me my whole life and thru all my crazy ideas and adventures and pushing me to be the best version of myself and to my sisters for being my partners in crime, my confidants and for always letting me be my goofy unabashed self. I love you all."The celeb's tight bond with her parents and sisters is nothing out of the ordinary. Throughout her DWTS run, the Willis clan all made a point to support the 27-year-old's dancing venture. Rumer also told E! News that Demi was "really excited" upon hearing that she joined the show, adding, "I think that's the most important thing that anybody can ask for, is just the support and love from your family." So sweet!
