Tallulah Willis has officially hit the one-year anniversary of sobriety.Willis, 21, celebrated the milestone with a party Monday thrown by her sister, Scout Willis, and Harold Kuhn. Demi Moore's daughter announced the party and her feat on Instagram, where she posted a couple of photos from the festivities. Tallulah looks gorgeous in the pics, where she is seen holding Asian-style parasols and dragons. "@haroldkuhn and #freeSLW threw me a sober birthday party and I am so wholly overwhelmed with love right now I want to cry. cc: @stylememaeve," she captioned the pic. In another photo Bruce Willis' daughter is blowing out the candles on her cake while surrounded by friends and family. "Last night was one of the most beautiful nights of my life. I was surrounded in a womb of the purest form of love," she captioned the pic. 

Scout has been a major part of her recovery and support system, and in the past Tallulah has even credited her with helping her turn her life around after some very dark times. She said Scout "forced me to see what I was doing."Tallulah has been open about her struggles with body dysmorphic disorder and depression and also has chronicled her recovery on social media since leaving a treatment center last year."In college the depression became overwhelming," she admitted to Teen Vogue. "I didn't sleep or want to talk to anyone, nothing seemed to have a point, the world lost its color, and food lost its taste."I was so removed from my body and from my mind that it was like I was living in a cardboard replica of what life should be. Not even so much because I was doing drugs but because I was so sad and so unhappy."In April she posted a triumphant pic of herself atop Los Angeles' Runyon Canyon in honor of being sober for nine months. She captioned it, "today marks the day I have kicked 9 months of sobriety's ass."Congratulations, Tallulah!
