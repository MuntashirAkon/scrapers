Summertime and the living's easy for Tallulah and Scout Willis.Demi Moore and Bruce Willis' daughters spent the day at the beach in Malibu and snapped photos of themselves basking in all their bikini glory and working on their tans.The Instagram of Scout shows her suggestively posing with a slice of watermelon, and as luck would have it, there's even underboob involved in the candid shot.And then there's the photo of Tallulah, who is perfectly perched on a beach towel all the while wearing a bathing suit ensemble that only she would be able to pull off so well.

Between the straw hat, ivory scarf, retro white shades and mismatched black-and-yellow floral bikini, Tallulah is serving up a side of summer realness like no one else."Leisurely plotting the demise of my enemies," she wrote as the caption to the glam shot.It's been quite a whirlwind year for the 21-year-old, who entered a treatment last year and has been documenting her sobriety on Instagram ever since.In fact, she detailed her struggles with depression and body dysmorphic disorder in a recent issue of Teen Vogue.

"In college the depression became overwhelming," she admitted. "I didn't sleep or want to talk to anyone, nothing seemed to have a point, the world lost its color, and food lost its taste."I was so removed from my body and from my mind that it was like I was living in a cardboard replica of what life should be. Not even so much because I was doing drugs but because I was so sad and so unhappy."Tallulah also wrote that her sister Scout "forced me to see what I was doing."
