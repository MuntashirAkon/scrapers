Rumer Willis is the queen of changing up her look.Her style might be ever evolving, but what beauty products stay constant? We caught up with the starlet at the Minions Lost in Paradise surf collection event to find out. From eyelash extensions to trying all of the new must-have products, her makeup collection can be best described as "obscene," said the actress and singer. However, we find her beauty routine to be refreshingly light and easy. Keep on reading for the details.What is your everyday makeup look?Bronzer and very light. I feel like you shouldn't have a lot of makeup on during the day. Most of the time, I'll do just a bit of eyeliner on the top. Super kind of retro has been my vibe. I've been wearing red lipstick more at night.

Do you wear makeup to the gym?Oh my god no. That's like so much effort, and then I feel like it would just end up sweating off my face anyway.Bronzer or Blush?Never blush. I don't like it at all, always bronzer. I have the Tom Ford one and I love it.What is your best non-product related beauty tip?Honestly, drink water. You're supposed to drink half your body weight in ounces per day, which is crazy, and I don't think anyone drinks enough water. If you do that, your skin will be magic.What is your signature scent?I never tell anybody. I don't want anyone else to have it. I mix stuff; it's like random, weird shit. [I will mention] Kilian—they make beautiful stuff.
