Bruce Willis Gambles at Craps Table in Vegas on Eve of Mayweather/McGregor Fight/nBruce Willis is betting on himself in Vegas on the eve of the Mayweather /McGregor fight.  Bruce was playing craps at the MGM Grand Friday night ... he's in town to catch the fight. Check out the photo ... it's interesting he's just a dude at the table ... not attracting much attention.   There's a lotta loot riding on this fight, and that trumps any celeb siting./n
