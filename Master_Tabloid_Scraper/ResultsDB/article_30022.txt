Man with No Arms -- THROWS OUT 1ST PITCH ... Nails It!!! /nThis is the most amazing thing we've ever seen!!!A man born with no arms threw out the 1st pitch at the K.C. Royals game last night  -- using his feet -- and he absolutely CRUSHES IT.  The guy's name is Tom Willis -- a motivational speaker who has a production company with the slogan,  "No hands. No arms. No problem. "Willis used his feet to fire out the first pitch -- and put 50 Cent to shame!!! The 54-year-old has thrown out the 1st pitch at 22 stadiums -- we're guessing he's trying to get to every single one. Watch the clip -- the guy is amazing.  /n
