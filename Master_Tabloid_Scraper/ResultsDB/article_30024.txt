Retired NFLers -- Still Living in the Fast Lane ... Bowling Party With Rap Stars/nWe now know what former NFL stars like Bryant McKinnie, Edgerrin James, and Willis McGahee do when their pigskin days are over -- they bowl. A bunch of former NFL stars -- a lot of 'em from Da U -- got together for their weekly bowling night on Wednesday ... but this week had a hip hop twist. Benzino from  "Love And Hip Hop Atlanta " hosted, and rapper N.O.R.E. threw 10 frames too.  Phillip Buchanon, David Clowney and Larry Johnson also got lanes at Strike 10 Bowling -- and we know what you're asking. Who wins when world class athletes go pin-for-pin against each other? We're told Clowney and McGahee did the most damage, for what it's worth. Congrats ... although we're sure they don't hand out rings for that./n
