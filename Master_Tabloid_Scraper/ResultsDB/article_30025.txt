Rolling Stones -- Sorry Normies ... Celeb Fans Got to Rock at Secret Show (PHOTOS & VIDEO)/nBruce Willis and Jack Nicholson scored the hottest ticket in Hollywood Wednesday night -- seats at the Rolling Stones' show in a small theater -- something normal Stones fans struggled to do. Actually, struggled is an understatement -- but yeah, Bruce, Jack, Andy Garcia, Harry Styles, Scooter Braun, and Joe Pesci were among the huge stars inside the Fonda Theater to see Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and the boys warm up for their Zip Code stadium tour. Tickets went on sale online at noon on Wednesday ... and reportedly sold out in just a few minutes. There's a buzz that NO ONE -- as in non-celebs -- was able to get a seat.  Monica Lewinsky and Charlotte McKinney also made it in, so ... yeah. Altogether now die-hard, regular working class fans -- FML! Bonus: We got footage of the Stones performing  "Start Me Up " ... from across the street and through the bar inside the Fonda. We know, lame -- but it's he best we could do without a ticket./n
