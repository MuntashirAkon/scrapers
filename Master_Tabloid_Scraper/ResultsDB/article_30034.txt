Kelly, Ashlee, Petey and Rumer - The Barneys Bunch/nA luscious, adorable, knickered, pony-tailed, perky Kelly Osbourne bounced up the steps and into Barneys in Beverly Hills. It's time to shop! Whee!  Just moments later, a pistol packin' Pete Wentz, fresh from the Spike-Me-a-Man-bob Barbershop, exited the store wearing way too much mascara for daytime, while being held onto by a purple fedora-ed Ashlee Simpson. As the two maneuvered into the valet area, who should be spotted but teen gal about-town, the lovely Rumer Willis! Yes, nothing completes a hard-rocking punk image like a trip to one of the swankiest shops in Beverly Hills! *I love you, you love me ... We're a great big family!*  Related Links      Sharon Osbourne and Barneys Friends!     The Simpsons are Barneys Friends!     Vampires are Barneys Friends!     Xenu and Barneys Friends!/n
