Well, this throwback pic has officially made our week. And it's not even Thursday.Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson took to Twitter on Wednesday to tweet a flashback photo of himself—and it's pretty much the best thing we've ever seen.In the shot, the actor and semi-retired professional wrestler sports some epic '90s fashion, rocking jeans and a fitted black turtleneck while accessorizing with chainlink silver jewelry...and an old-school fanny pack."Fanny pack and lean take it to a whole other level..#90sRock #WTF #BuffLesbian," he wrote as the caption to the must-see shot. (And though we love his self-deprecating side, we might suggest avoiding stereotypes.)

Oh, and can we take a minute to talk about that hairstyle? Love the curls, Johnson.The 42-year-old star is currently gearing up for the release of his next flick Hercules: The Thracian Wars, in which he plays the son of Zeus.Johnson has shared a number of photos of his epic transformation which required "a 3 hour daily process" in the makeup chair in addition to pumping some serious iron in order to beef up for the role.Directed by Brett Ratner, the action adventure also stars Ian McShane, Rufus Sewell, Joseph Fiennes, Peter Mullan, John Hurt, Rebecca Ferguson, Ingrid Bolsø Berdal, Aksel Hennie, Reece Ritchie and Tobias Santelmann.Hercules: The Thracian Wars hits theaters July 25.
