An understandably upset Tokyo begins the seemingly threatening clip by informing her followers that she’ll be releasing a video, in which she will reveal never-heard-before facts regarding the entire messy situation. “I’m going to be sending a video out on to social media about Rob and Chyna, the Kardashians, the media, the lawyers,” she says. “I believe that I have all rights to say what I have to say. Why? Because I feel somewhat in the middle of what’s going on, and this isn’t a good feeling for me. I tried to remain silent because I was always told silence is golden, however, untrue.”
Tokyo Toni concludes, “I am going to speak on everything that’s going on. I am going to give my opinion, I am going to give facts. Why? Because I’m Dream’s grandmother, Chyna’s mother, King Cairo’s grandmother and Rob Kardashian’s ex mother-in-law.”

As readers knows, Blac Chyna appeared in court Monday to get a restraining order against Rob Kardashian, and the court docs, obtained by RadarOnline.com, revealed not only details of cyberbullying, but brutal abuse on Rob’s behalf.
The bitter battle began when the duo took over social media late last week in their most heated public battle to date. The exchange got so bad that Chyna has now hired women’s rights lawyer Lisa Bloom, who claimed before a Los Angeles judge on Monday that Kardashian crossed the line by posting nude pics of the video vixen, medical information and other personal details.
