 'Cam Needs Rehab!’ Douglas’ Friends Beg Troubled Star To Seek Treatment After Relapse.../n
Michael Douglas’ troubled son Cameron’s friends think he needs rehab, RadarOnline.com can exclusively reveal.
“It was inevitable that he’d relapse,” an insider told Radar. “Anything he could get his hands on, he would do.”
“He would always joke about partying on the inside,” the source added of how the 38-year-old would pass his time behind bars. “Everyone thinks he needs rehab.”

Drug advocate and Cameron’s friend Tony Papa also told Radar that he knew a relapse was on the horizon for him.
Radar previously reported that Cameron violated his probation just three months after he was released from federal prison by testing positive for marijuana. His probation officers initially told a Manhattan judge that he “attempted to manipulate the results,” but insisted that “relapse is part of the recovery process” and asked the judge to take it easy on the actor.
Cameron was first sentenced to five years behind bars in 2010 for narcotics distribution, but a judge increased his sentence just a year later after he was found with drug infractions while in prison.
