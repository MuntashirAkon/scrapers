Aging Yoko Ono Sitting On $30K Treasure/n
John Lennon’s New York City apartment is already worth millions ­— but it just got a bump in value! The spacious digs in the Dakota — the tony building where Lennon’s widow, Yoko Ono, still resides — has $30,000 hidden beneath the floorboards, according to real estate heirs Toby and Larry Milstein. The pair says a former owner of the ritzy digs stashed the cash — but the hoity-toity co-op board refuses to mangle the historic parquet to recover the rumored booty!
