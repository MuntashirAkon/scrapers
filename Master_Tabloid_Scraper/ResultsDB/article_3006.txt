"Frenemies" will focus on Rachel (Lea Michele) and Santana (Naya Rivera) as the two former enemies-turned NYC besties, deal with the fact that Santana will snag the role of Rachel's understudy in "Funny Girl."To get you ready for all the back-stabbing betrayals, we've got six all-new photos from the episode that you definitely don't want to miss.

Over the years, we've loved watching Rachel and Santana's relationship transform from insult-throwing high school rivalry, to a compassionate and kickass NYC team. So you can imagine how bummed we are that there are rough waters ahead for our beloved PezBerry.On the plus side, we're thrilled to see that, "Frenemies" will heavily focus on the New York side of things, as the series begins their exciting transition to an all-NYC show. (Sorry, Lima, but we're ready to leave you behind.)And we're not saying that there will definitely be a slap in the episode, but come on, y'all—it's Santana. It's safe to assume that if she doesn't meet her monthly quota of slaps, she'll go all Lima Heights on some poor NYC bystander.Click through our "Frenemies" mini gallery below and feast your eyes on six first look photos packed with scoop from Glee's highly anticipated return.
