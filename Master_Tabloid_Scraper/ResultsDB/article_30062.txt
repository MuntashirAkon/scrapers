This Man Was Savagely Rejected After Making A Detailed AF PowerPoint Full Of First Date Ideas ‚Äî But Twitter Has The Dude's Back!/n

We may've just found our soulmate.
Earlier this week, Twitter user Ben Velzian took to the social media site in order to show off the elaborate PowerPoint he made for a beau he was supposed to go out with. The presentation was incredibly detailed as it featured all kinds of fun and outside-of-the-box date ideas ‚Äî it even included the pros and cons for each option!

*Swoon* Mr. Velzian posted: 

A guy asked me on a date today & said "any suggestions where to go?".
Because I'm a full time weirdo I sent him a PowerPoint of ideas.

Sadly, Ben's intended was not impressed with his planning skills as he blocked him (below) shortly after receiving the deck. Oh no!

He blocked me.

That chap is clearly an idiot. And it seems as though others on the internet agree as MANY people have since vocalized their support for Velzian. See the best reactions to the extra PowerPoint (below).

His loss. üíï pic.twitter.com/DUObhomccM

He's an eejit. You're clearly adorable, so handsome. I'd date you with or without a PowerPoint üòç

Totally HIS loss! You sound fun and sweet. I hope some other fella appreciates you with or without a ppt (which I thought was awesome!!!) pic.twitter.com/G78VYSDWC9

Hear! Hear! Don't fret too much over Ben though, as he's since moved on from this rejection. The Londoner added online:

I think I dodged a bullet because OBVIOUSLY this is tongue-in-cheek and I don‚Äôt want someone who has 0 humour

I'd care a lot more if you had an ounce of personality that wasn't fish
‚Äî BV (@velzzb) August 2, 2017
Preach! Oh, and the PowerPoint has also gotten Ben plenty of other date offers (below).


A lot of people have offered me their hand in marriage today, which is nice.

We think Ben is going to be just fine. Keep doing you, bud!
