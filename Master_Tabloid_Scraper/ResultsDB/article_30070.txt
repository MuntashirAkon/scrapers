The sun may be out, but Kristin Cavallari is seeing a full moon thanks to Jay Cutler.

The Hills alum, who is currently enjoying a vacation with the football player down in Mexico, recently shared a nude photo of her husband enjoying the weather from their resort’s balcony.
Standing naked with his back towards the camera, Cutler flaunted his naked butt as his wife captioned the cheeky shot, “‘Good times, no tan lines. Let the sea set you free’ – @tony2coat.”

The parents-of-three are spending some time across the border after announcing their move from Chicago, where they have been living for the past few years.
“So we’re moving from Chicago soon and I gotta say, I’m really gonna miss this place,” Cavallari wrote on her Instagram. “Not only we’re all 3 of my babies born here, it’s where it all began with jay, it brought me closer to my mom who has become my best friend, I’ve made some amazing girlfriends, and I’ve really enjoyed being back here (a lot of people don’t know I lived here when I was younger). Thanks for all the good times, Chicago. This will always be a special place for us.”
