Unlike “fetch,” a Mean Girls musical is totally happening!

It’s been confirmed that a stage production of the hit 2004 movie will premiere at Washington, D.C.’s The National Theatre. Written by Tina Fey — who also wrote the screenplay for the beloved film — with music composed by the comedienne’s husband Jeff Richmond, the musical will run from October 31 to December 3.
Tony Award nominee Nell Benjamin is writing the lyrics for show, while Tony Award winner Casey Nicholaw will direct and choreograph. As a producer of the film, Saturday Night Live head honcho Lorne Michaels will also produce the tuner alongside Stuart Thompson.
The National Theatre describes the plot of the production as such: “After years of living with her zoologist parents in Africa, Cady Heron moves to Illinois and must find where she fits in the social hierarchy. A sweet, naive newbie, Cady quickly attracts the attention of The Plastics, a trio of popular frenemies led by the vicious and calculating Regina George. When Cady devises a plan to end Regina’s reign, she learns that you can’t cross a Queen Bee without getting stung.”
In 2016, Fey confirmed she was working on a musical version of the high school flick, though she noted at the time that opening day could still be “years away.”
The word’s still out if Lindsay Lohan, who played the lead role in the cult classic and has been desperately vying for a sequel, will have anything to do with the musical.
