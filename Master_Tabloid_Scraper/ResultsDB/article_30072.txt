When Margot Robbie trades her Tonya Harding high-waisted denim for Tonya Harding sequined skating apparel, no one is safe.

In the behind-the-scenes clip from I, Tonya that was sent via heaven and TMZ, Robbie acts out the mic drop moment in which Harding drags U.S. Figure Skating officials for criticizing her outfit. She boldly defends herself and her outfit to the officials before she spits at them, “Suck my d**k!”

This scene is one of the many previews of the upcoming Tonya Harding biopic that have emerged from its production. In January, photos of Robbie as Harding made their way online in which her ’90s hairdo is more feathered than a bird in winter.
I, Tonya will narrate the events leading up to the physical attack of Nancy Kerrigan, Harding’s athletic rival, during a training session for the 1994 Olympics. It’s expected to release sometime in 2018.
