On Tuesday (Jan. 17, 2017), Entertainment Tonight reported that a source close to the Super Bowl halftime show said that Lady Gaga was instructed by the NFL to not “say anything or bring anything up about the election, or mention Donald Trump.“

 Natalie Ravitz, senior vice president of communications for the NFL, told CNN on Wednesday (Jan. 18, 2017) that this wasn’t so. “It’s false,” said Ravitz. “This is unsourced nonsense from people trying to stir up controversy where there is none. The Super Bowl is a time when people really come together. Lady Gaga is focused on putting together an amazing show for fans and we love working with her on it; we aren’t going to be distracted by this.”
Lady Gaga’s reps confirmed this statement.

In the early morning that followed the election of Trump as president, Gaga stood on a sanitation truck outside of Trump Towers holding a sign that read, “Love Trumps hate.” She also chided Melania Trump for declaring her platform as one against online bullying given her husband’s tendency to air his personal grievances on Twitter.
Aside from politics, Billboard reports that Gaga will be tackling the halftime show on her own, without any musical guests. This would make her the eighth performer to do so and would disappoint Tony Bennett immensely, though it’s probable that the buttery, flaky pigs in a blanket in his box suite will make it all okay.
