The first on-set photos of Margot Robbie from the upcoming biopic about the 1994 Winter Olympics show Robbie’s eerie transformation into former figure skater, Tonya Harding.

The film, I, Tonya, will narrate the events leading up to the physical attack of Nancy Kerrigan, Harding’s athletic rival, during a training session for the Olympics. For those who don’t recall, Harding’s ex-husband Jeff Gillooly hired a hitman to club Kerrigan in the leg with a police baton after a practice session at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Detroit on January 6, 1994. The attack took place while cameras were rolling and footage of Kerrigan on the ground repeatedly wailing “Why?” later became an infamous historical clip.
Kerrigan went on to win silver at the Olympics while Harding placed 8th. Harding was kept under probation for three years and had to complete 500 hours of community service and pay a $160,000 fine. She avoided jail time after Gillooly took a plea bargain in exchange for implicating her.
