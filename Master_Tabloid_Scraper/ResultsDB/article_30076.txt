Last night (Dec. 20, 2016), a tribute concert honoring Tony Bennett’s 90th birthday aired on NBC, assembling some of the world’s greatest performers including Michael Bublé, Bob Dylan, Stevie Wonder, Alec Baldwin, Kevin Spacey, Billy Joel and of course, Lady Gaga, who took the opportunity to convey the impact that Bennet has had on her over the years.

First, the “Million Reasons” singer started off the concert by belting out a soaring rendition of Frank Sinatra’s “The Lady Is a Tramp.”

Later, Gaga returned to the stage to perform “La Vie en Rose” in perfect French. Afterward, the songstress, who recorded the 2014 album Cheek to Cheek alongside Bennett, had some thoughtful words for the beloved crooner.

“You’re my family, Tony,” she gushed. “You really changed my life … You are indeed an icon, but for me, you’re so much more than that.”
For the night’s finale, Bennett himself took the stage to perform the classic standard “The Best Is Yet to Come.”
Happy Birthday, Tony Bennett!
