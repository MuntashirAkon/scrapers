6 Can't-Miss Looks from the Tony Awards Red Carpet
/n

 
On Sunday night, all of the stars of Broadway took a break from their non-stop schedules of rehearsal, run-throughs, and matinee performances to take a turn on the red carpet and honor a handful of the best performances of the year at the Tony Awards. And while there was plenty to talk about regarding theater’s biggest night, from Lin-Manuel Miranda’s Mom’s bedazzled boot cast to Chrissy Teigen, i.e. “one of Broadway’s biggest stars on Broadway’s biggest night,” celebrating her husband getting one crucial step closer to EGOT-ing and jumping into the press line to snap some paparazzi pics of John, the real stars of the evening were of course the red carpet gowns. And while you may have gotten an eyeful during the award ceremony last night, there’s still a few standouts you probably missed out on.

Olivia Wilde was one of the surprise guests of the evening, bringing her Oscar’s A-game with a side of political activism courtesy of her accessories. The actress arrived wearing a vibrant red Michael Kors Collection column gown with a plunging V-neckline to her navel, slightly gathered at the waist with a bell sleeve and all over crystal embellishment. To compliment her glittering dress, Wilde kept her beauty look equally clean cut with her brown bob slicked back and a peachy smokey eye, carrying a gold Edie Parker clutch, wearing earrings, two chainlink bracelets, and two rings from Tiffany & Co., and finishing off her ensemble with a gold Planned Parenthood pin on her lapel because, as her stylist Karla Welch wrote on Instagram, “Ladies First.”

Cynthia Erivo also brought a whole lot of glittering drama to the theatrical affair after taking home an award at last year’s ceremony. The actress attended in a black, custom,  sequin CG gown, which much like Olivia’s featured a deep-V neckline with glittering embellished striped panels made out of 8,000 Swarovski crystals with an additional 130 yards of fringe, all of which took over 350 hours to create. And Erivo upped the wow-factor by adding on sheer sleeves and a long train, accessorizing with Sophia Webster shoes, and Fred Leighton jewelry.

Sara Bareilles also went for something sparkly on last night’s red carpet, arriving in a Naeem Khan semi-sheer gown with yellow and silver all-over metallic embellishment with long sleeves, an A-line skirt, and a black sash at the waist, accessorized with Casadei heels, an Edie Parker clutch and H. Stern jewelry.

Even Victoria’s Secret model Candice Swanepoel was in attendance, wearing a strapless Prabal Gurung gown with a sheer skirt and an abstract camouflage print made out of over 400,000 crystal bead which took over 600 hours to be hand embroidered in the designer’s atelier.

But the most surprising attendees of the evening hands down has to go to Vogue Editor-in-Chief Anna Wintour and her daughter Bee Shaffer.

The pair decided to demonstrate their support for the arts in some boldly printed gowns, with Bee opting for an Alexander McQueen patchwork gown with some tinsel-like bring embellishment scattered intermittently across the piece and Anna choosing a Maison Margiela ‘Artisanal’ red dress with a gold lace overlay featuring large butterflies. And, of course, no Wintour outfit would be complete without her signature pitch black shades.
