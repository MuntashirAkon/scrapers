Sean Spicer Resigns, Bails After President Trump Appoints New Communications Director (UPDATE)/n11:34 PM PT -- The White House has just announced Sarah Huckabee Sanders as the new Press Secretary and Anthony Scaramucci officially as Communications Director. They won't have Sean Spicerto kick around anymore. President Trump's Press Secretary resigned from his post Friday morning, saying he strongly disagreed with Trump's pick for Communications Director ... Anthony Scaramucci.  Scaramucci, a NY financier, would have been Spicer's boss, and he was reportedly not down with that power structure. Spicer was, arguably, the face of Trump's administration -- frequently arguing with reporters, and was famously portrayed by Melissa McCarthy on 'SNL.' A crowd fave, for sure. Spicey's taking his motorized podium and heading home./n
