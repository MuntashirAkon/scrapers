James Brown Says Tony Romo Has Secret Weapon As Broadcaster /nFirst off, James Brown is awesome -- this guy rules.  So, when we saw him out in NYC on Wednesday, we had to ask about his newest CBS Sports colleague, Tony Romo -- and if he had any advice for the ex-QB on how not to suck in the broadcast booth.  That's when James -- with that legendary voice -- told us why Romo has a secret weapon that will make it almost impossible for him to fail.  A secret weapon who once appeared in a Papa John's commercial with Peyton Manning. /n
