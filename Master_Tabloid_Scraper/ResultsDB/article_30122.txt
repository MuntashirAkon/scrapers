Tony Gonzalez Says Tony Romo Didn't Cost Him His CBS Job/nTony Gonzalez says he was NOT forced out at CBS to make room for the new guy, Tony Romo -- telling TMZ Sports the decision to leave was HIS and his alone. The future Hall of Fame tight end spent 3 seasons on  "The NFL Today " (and was pretty good) only to announce he was leaving the show back in March. A few days later, CBS announced Romo was joining the network as a live game broadcaster -- replacing Phil Simms who will take over for Gonzalez on  "The NFL Today. " So ... was Tony G pushed out?? Gonzalez is adamant the answer is 'No' -- and gives a pretty solid explanation about his career choice. And for the record, Tony G says he wishes Romo well and even offers some advice./n
