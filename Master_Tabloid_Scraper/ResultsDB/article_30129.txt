David Justice Sends Explosive Message To Halle Berry Over Domestic Violence Rumors/n
David Justice is coming after ex Halle Berry, begging the actress to set the record straight on domestic violence rumors.
As Radar previously reported, Justice, married to Berry from 1992-1996, has been working hard in recent months to clear his name regarding old allegations that he abused Berry — instead insinuating that the “famous” man she claims once bashed her eardrum (and permanently damaged her hearing) was actually actor Wesley Snipes.
“I’m telling everybody I didn’t do it,” Justice, 49, told Inside Edition in a recent interview. “You know I didn’t do it.”

The former baseball player explained that he is fed up over the gossip, especially since Berry has never named her abuser, nor denied any rumors regarding the incident.
“People would say, ‘yeah, I heard it was David Justice,'” he shared. “She could’ve squashed [the rumors]. I have 3 kids and a wife for 15 years. It was important that my kids knew that their dad didn’t do [it].”
“If it was me, then say it. Say it,” Justice continued. “But she can’t say it because she knows it wasn’t. So she’d rather not say it and just let you go ahead and believe it.”

In a final message directed at Berry, Justice slammed the star for letting his reputation be dragged through the mud.
“It would’ve been cool if you had come out a long time ago and let people know it wasn’t me. That would’ve been cool. But you didn’t do it.”
Justice’s interview will appear on INSIDE EDITION Monday, Feb. 1. /n
