 'RHONY' Cougar Sonja Morgan Debuts 22-Year-Old New Man -- He's A Model & A LANDSCAPER!.../n
For Sonja Morgan, hunky young men are the best accessory. And RadarOnline.com has learned that this fashion week, she’s got a new model by her side — literally!
The 51-year-old Real Housewives of New York star has been getting close to 22-year-old model and landscaper Tommy Maksanty.
Maksanty, a native of Virginia, is a landscaper by trade.

But he recently flew up to New York to walk in several shows at Fashion Week. During his stay, he caught Morgan’s eye, and the two were inseparable at the Sonja Morgan New York Fashion, Swimwear, and Jewelry event presented by Social Life at Beautique on September 16.
The pair continued on into the wee hours of the morning at Townhouse gay bar on the Upper East Side. A source close to Morgan told Radar, “They did karaoke past 1 am with her staff, friends, and a guy she said she found on the street!”
Maksanty bragged about the outing on his Instagram, writing, “After party at the townhouse wasn’t too shabby…”

They were also spotted dining at Chez Josephine with makeup artist Oscar Caballero:
