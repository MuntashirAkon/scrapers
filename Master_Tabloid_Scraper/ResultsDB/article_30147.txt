The CW Is Replacing The Vampire Diaries With A Reboot Of The Lost Boys! And Wait Until You See Who's Adapting It…/n

This definitely doesn't suck!
The Vampire Diaries has been The CW's flagship series for seven years now, but unlike the characters in the show, nothing can last forever.
It's already been announced that the upcoming eighth season of the Nina Dobrev, Ian Somerhalder, and Paul Wesley drama will be its last, but it looks like the network has already found its replacement!
That's because according to a Deadline report out Thursday, The CW has ordered a TV adaptation of the 1987 classic The Lost Boys from Veronica Mars creator Rob Thomas!

But this isn't some regular 'ol remake — apparently, Rob wants to make this the channel's first anthology series, with each season taking place in a different decade.
Following Season One's stint in 1967 San Francisco, the only constants moving forward would be the lost boys themselves… and nothing else!
Let's just hope the movie's original stars — Kiefer Sutherland, Corey Feldman, and Jami Gertz — find a way to get involved.
But in case you're worried about having another vampire show on the air… Rob managed to make iZombie completely different from The Walking Dead, so we have complete faith in him!
Would U take a stab at a Lost Boys TV show??
