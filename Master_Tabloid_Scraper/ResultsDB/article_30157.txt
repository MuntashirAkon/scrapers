For any actress in Hollywood, staying in shape is usually at the top of their priority list. Which is why when Gina Rodriguez was diagnosed with Hashimoto’s disease at just 19 years old, she feared her career had ended before it even began.

The actress recently opened up to Health magazine about how she manages the disease and why at 32 years old, she considers it a blessing. “If I can at least walk for 30 minutes a day, it’s extremely helpful for my thyroid gland. Running, boxing, jump rope, and hitting the heavy bag are my workout constants,” Rodriguez said when asked how she handles Hashimoto’s before adding, “It’s always been a battle for me with weight.

“Keeping weight off is very difficult because my metabolism is pretty much shot, which to me felt like a curse when I was 19. As an actress, I was like, ‘Seriously?! In a world that’s so vain, I have to deal with the disease that makes you not keep weight off?'” she explained.
These days Rodriguez sees the disease in a whole new light and feels grateful to be able to use her platform. “But it actually became a blessing because then I got to represent not only women and Latinas but also women who are dealing with this disease.”
Despite calling the disease a “blessing,” Rodriguez still has her days where managing it is anything but easy.  “I’m gluten-free, which is the most difficult thing in the world because, like Oprah, I love bread! I definitely eat gluten-free bread every day.”
