The Vampire Diaries' Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley Launch Charity T-Shirt Campaign/n
Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley are phoning it in – for a good cause.  
The Vampire Diaries stars officially launched a charity T-shirt campaign on Represent Friday, and fans who buy one of the tees in the next 24 hours could get a personal call from one of the smoldering on-screen brothers themselves, EW reports. 
Designed by fan Kathryn Kij, the shirt – which comes in crew-neck and baseball styles – is significant for TVD trivia buffs with the words “Blood Brothers since 1864” written under a handsome, black-and-white shot of the two actors’ faces.  
“You guys came through,” said Wesley, 32, in a video posted to his Twitter account. “The Blood Brothers, on our chests – soon to be on your chests.”

Wesley Tweeted that a portion of the proceeds from sales will “help environment causes.” (Somerhalder, 36, has been vocal in his support for the environment.)  
Added Wesley in a follow-up Tweet: “Oh forgot: @iamsomerhalder (smoldeypants) and i will call the first few random people who get shirt in next 24 hrs.”  
Everyone has a calling – but a few lucky TVD fans might just find that theirs is from the Salvatore brothers themselves.  
Before The Vampire Diaries returns on Oct. 8 on The CW, fans can purchase the Blood Brothers T-shirt for $23.99 at represent.com/ianpaul.
