Paul Wesley on Nina Dobrev Leaving The Vampire Diaries: 'It's Never Going to Be the Same'/n
With the exit of star Nina Dobrev, many The Vampire Diaries fans are wondering what’s next for the show – and Dobrev’s costar Paul Wesley is right there with them.  
“Obviously there’s a great nostalgia. It s never going to be the same,” Wesley, 32, told PEOPLE at The Humane Society of the United State’s Los Angeles Gala on Saturday night.    
“I have no idea what they’re going to do next year, literally. Apparently they have a plan. I don’t know what the plan is. It’s going to be really interesting. It will be interesting to see what they come up with for the brothers.”  
But Wesley, who was clad in a Penguin suit for the gala, says Dobrev is happy to be moving on.  
“I know that she s really happy. I know that she wants to move on and start a new chapter of her life which is entirely respectable,” he says.  
But is Dobrev’s departure just the first of several to come, including Wesley’s himself?   
“I think everything has to come to an end, man. First of all I’m playing a 17-year-old. I’m 32 years old,” he says.    
“So theoretically, if I were to stay on the show for say three more years, I would be a 35 year old playing a 17-year-old, which is almost double. It’s more than double. It’s literally more than double!”

Even though Wesley’s future on the series may be in question, one thing is not – his dedication to ending factory farming. Wesley flew in directly from New York to attend the event and discuss the issue.    
“I ve always had issues with factory farming. That was always something that bothered me,” Wesley told reporters at the event. “I feel that I m in a position in my life where I have an outreach globally and domestically. And I feel like it s my duty to, I don’t know, I don’t want to say preach it, but spread the word about the horrendous conditions that exist.”
