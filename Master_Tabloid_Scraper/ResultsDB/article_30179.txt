Wesley Snipes will soon be getting fitted for some prison stripes.The U.S. Marshal's Office has ordered the Blade star to report to a federal penitentiary in Pennsylvania on Dec. 9 to begin serving his three-year sentence for failing to pay his taxes.The big question: will he surrender?

Per the Marshal's notice, Snipes must voluntarily turn up at the Federal Correctional Institution McKean in Lewis Run by noon that day or face the possibility of a warrant issued for his arrest (and not by Tommy Lee Jones, natch).The 48-year-old actor remains free on bail while his attorneys have been filing one appeal after another to keep him from prison after his 2008 conviction on three misdemeanor counts of willfully failing to file federal tax returns, screwing Uncle Sam out of some $7 million. However, those attempts fell on deaf ears, with a Florida judge rejecting his requests, including a Hail Mary petition for a new trial.Lawyers for Snipes were unavailable for comment, but have previously vowed to appeal the sentence all the way to the Supreme Court if necessary.Good luck with that.
