The temps apparently haven't been very bon for Rutina Wesley lately.The True Blood star has filed for divorce from husband Jacob Fishel after more than eight years of marriage.She noted their date of separation as July 22 and cited irreconcilable differences as the reason for the split, according to court documents filed Friday in L.A. Superior Court and obtained by E! News.

The couple tied the knot on June 5, 2005, and did not have any children together. Wesley is also asking that the court not award Fishel spousal support. They met while both students at Julliard.Wesley, 34, plays Sookie Stackhouse's childhood friend Tara Thornton on True Blood, which capped off its revealing sixth season this past Sunday. And though she and Sookie have been on the outs, new vampire Tara's romantic future looks bright with Kristin Bauer's Pam—presuming Pam survived the fire that seemed to kill off (but couldn't possible have really killed off) Alexander Skarsgård's Eric.
