Sylvester Stallone Says He's Open to Doing 'Expendables 4' (VIDEO)/nSylvester Stallone made a huge point Friday night, shooting down rumors he's out of the  "Expendables " game. We got Sly coming out of Craig's and asked if he's open to doing  "Expendables 4 " and he jumped on the question, sounding like he's down with it. We got some other actors from the  "Expendables " franchise earlier this week -- including Wesley Snipes and Dolph Lundgren, both of whom said they wouldn't do 4 without Sly. Sounds like it's gonna happen./n
