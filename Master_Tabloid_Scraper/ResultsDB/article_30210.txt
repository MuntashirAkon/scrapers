Snoop Dogg to Nick Young -- YOUR NEW WHIP NEEDS HYDRAULICS!!!/nNick Young said he felt like  "Westside Connection " after he got his new '62 Impala. But according to Snoop Dogg ... Nick's missing one VERY important part of a true  "Westside " whip -- HYDRAULICS!Everyone knows Snoop has a thing for classic cars -- he owns a grip including a few Impalas of his own. We're told Snoop thinks Nick's new ride is  "tight " -- but the rapper is telling friends that  "real Westside riders " can make their rides jump like Kris Kross. One source close to the rapper says Snoop put it this way ...  "He ain't really Westsidin' because he can't hit no SWITCHES! "But get this ... we're told Snoop wants to connect Young with a famous L.A.-based lowrider crew that can make Nick's ride bounce like a check from Wesley Snipes. No word if Young will accept the offer -- but we'll stay on it./n
