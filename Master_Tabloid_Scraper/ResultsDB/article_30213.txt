Rutina is more successful than Fishel and presumably pulls in a lot more bank, but she's asking the judge to reject any claim he might make for spousal support.Rutina and Jacob met at Juilliard back when they were students ... and tied the knot when they graduated in June, 2005.  They have no kids./n
