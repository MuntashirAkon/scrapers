Mariska, 47, and husband Peter Hermann, just adopted a boy named Andrew Nicolas Hargitay Herman. (He was born just three months after his new sister Amaya).
“We never in a million years thought it would happen this quickly, but something inside of us knew that this was right, and we said, ‘Yes, yes, yes!’” Mariska told People magazine. “We knew this was our guy. Everything about it felt right. It felt divinely right.”
