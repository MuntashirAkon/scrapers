A source revealed: “She’s desperately worried about him and has this fear that he’s surrounded by all the wrong people.
“Ellen’s been burning up his phone 24-7, asking if she can introduce him to a better team of advisors, even help with his lifestyle choices and telling him to cut certain characters out of his life.
“She does care about Justin and she has a right to be worried, because he’s off the deep end right now.
“But she’s gotten way too overbearing. She blows up his phone 24/7, to the point where he’s been ignoring her calls and politely texting her to give him space.”
