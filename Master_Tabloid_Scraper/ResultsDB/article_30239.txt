Katy Perry Getting Back At Taylor – With Calvin Harris!/n
Asked recently if her new album contained a response to Taylor Swift’s diss track “Bad Blood,”  Katy Perry said, “There is no one thing that’s calling out any one person.”
But the “Bon Appétit” singer may have something much more vengeful up her sleeve: a hookup with Taylor’s ex Calvin Harris!
It turns out that Katy collaborated with the Scottish DJ on a song for his album — and now, a source says she wants to turn their flirty friendship into something much more.
“At first Katy and Calvin were strictly professional. But then Katy brought up Taylor, and Calvin was more than happy to vent. He poured his heart out, and she goaded him on!”
From that point on, the duo dished nonstop about “how annoying it is that Taylor is always made to be a victim. They both agreed that she’s a total fake.”
Katy has always found the DJ “sexy,” the source says, and “planned to strike when the timing was right.”
But their connection is not all cold calculation: “They genuinely have a lot in common. It’s icing on the cake for Katy
that she can drop this bomb on Taylor. There’s only one goal for Katy now, and that’s for a romance with Calvin to go public.” Get ready for fireworks! /n
