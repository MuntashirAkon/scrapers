Ellis managed to escape and went to the nearby Shell station to call for help. Police found Smith bloody, confused and half-naked at the Hooters restaurant, and with no idea how she got there and or what happened.
Smith and Ellis had met earlier in the evening at the Shell station, where the 22-year-old girl had been trying to call a relative to come and pick her up, and the elderly man invited her to hang out with him at the abandoned eatery.
