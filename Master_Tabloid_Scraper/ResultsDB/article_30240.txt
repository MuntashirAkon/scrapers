Justin Bieber Displays Drying Briefs In Hotel Balcony/n
Justin Bieber’s underwear was recently spotted drying on the balcony of his luxury hotel —
and only Radar knows why.
“Justin no longer gets free underwear from Calvin Klein.
His deal ended in December when he decided to pursue other options,” a snitch revealed.
“After the deal ended so did the unlimited supply of briefs.
Which might explain why we recently spotted the laundry drying.”
Justin — you can afford new underwear!
Although, we all know you like to go commando! /n
