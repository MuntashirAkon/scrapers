The announcement comes amid news that Perry is in talks to judge the upcoming American Idol revival on ABC. According to The Hollywood Reporter, the network is vying to add the “Chained to the Rhythm” songstress to its roster after Kelly Clarkson and Jennifer Hudson signed on to appear on NBC’s The Voice.
Should Perry accept the TV gig, the length of her would tour could be affected as ABC is looking to premiere American Idol in early 2018. So far, she is slated to be on the road until early February.
