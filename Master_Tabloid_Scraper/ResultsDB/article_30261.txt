Two people Taylor Swift has infamously scorned — Calvin Harris and Katy Perry — are coming together to make music.

That’s right: Swift’s ex-boyfriend is teaming up with her nemesis on his upcoming album. In a teaser shared on Harris’ Twitter, the DJ reveals his upcoming album will feature a collaboration with Perry in addition to tracks with Ariana Grande, Nicki Minaj, John Legend, Travis Scott, Frank Ocean, Migos, Big Sean and Snoop Dogg.

Last year, Harris and Swift had a public spat following their breakup about songwriting credits for “This Is What You Came For,” in which the former accused the latter of trying to tarnish his reputation and “bury like Katy.”
“I figure if you’re happy in your new relationship you should focus on that instead of trying to tear your ex bf down for something to do,” Harris tweeted last summer when Swift was dating Tom Hiddleston. “I know you’re off tour and you need someone new to try and bury like Katy ETC but I’m not that guy, sorry. I won’t allow it. Please focus on the positive aspects of YOUR life because you’ve earned a great one.”
While Perry didn’t say anything at the time, she did hint that she still had beef with Swift months later. When a fan asked if she’ll ever collaborate with the “Bad Blood” singer, Perry tweeted she’ll only work with the songstress “if she says sorry.”
Clearly, she has no qualms about working with her ex though. Harris’ album is due out June 30. In the meantime, you better make some popcorn.
