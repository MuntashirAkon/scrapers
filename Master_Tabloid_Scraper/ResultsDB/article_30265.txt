It hardly seems fair, but just one day after the Academy wrongfully presented La La Land with the Oscar for Best Picture, Mahershala Ali and the men from Moonlight gave us the gift of a Calvin Klein underwear campaign.

Ali, who also took home the award for Best Supporting Actor, stripped down with his co-stars Alex Hibbert, Trevante Rhodes, and Ashton Sanders for Calvin Klein’s Spring ’17 ad. He also discussed what he’s realized as a working actor during his rise to fame.
“Even after the performance is over, I realize that you still have to service it,” said Ali. “I’ll be in a coffee shop and someone will come up to me and just open a vein…telling me how this struck a nerve for them, what their experience was. And I really try to be present for that. I’m really thankful for that.”

21-year-old Sanders reflected on the precautions that he’s taken in his own life now that his greatest career aspirations are coming true.
“I’m a very spiritual person but I’m realizing I have to be careful what I put out there…because everything I’ve wished for is happening,” he told Calvin Klein.

This Spring ’17 men’s underwear campaign is Raf Simons’ second official campaign since taking over the label, which makes us extra optimistic about what’s in store next.
