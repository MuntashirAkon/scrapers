Bella Hadid is recreating one of fashion’s most iconic shots.

In V magazine’s Spring 2017 issue, the 20-year-old model channels Kate Moss in a new NSFW photo shoot. Posing topless, Hadid replicates the runway legend’s famous 1993 ad campaign for Calvin Klein’s Obsession fragrance.
Both spreads were shot by photographer Mario Sorrenti.
“I feel so lucky to be able to work with someone who I look up to so much,” Hadid says in a press release. “He is such an incredible energy on and off set and so much fun to work with. I feel really grateful to have been able to work with Mario again for V Magazine. Thank you, Mario.”

Sorrenti dated Moss when he shot the initial spread. According to the supermodel, who was just 17 at the time, working in such an intimate environment drove a wedge in their relationship.
“He was just like, ‘I can see it, it’s ‘Obsession.’ It was obsession—he was obsessed, I’d wake up in the morning and he’d be taking pictures of me and I’d be like, ‘f**k off,'” she told ShowStudio in 2015. “I laid like that for like 10 days. He would not stop taking pictures of that.”
“We split up after that,” Moss said Sorrenti. “When you’re in a relationship with a photographer and they start abusing that relationship and being like, ‘I want you to do this, and I want you to do that,’ and I’m like, ‘No.'”
