Rita Ora Allegedly Kicked a Contestant Off ‘America’s Next Top Model’ for Dating Ex-Boyfriend Calvin Harris/n
Rita Ora was out to get one of the contestants on America’s Next Top Model, because they both banged Calvin Harris … so claims the chick who was booted.

Krislian Rodriguez got her walking papers quickly on season 23, after Rita slammed her for “oozing sex” … a weird comment given that’s what models generally do.
There was also this … at one point during the competition, Rita whispered to a fellow judge, “I just think we’re making a mistake.” Some people on the set felt Rita was talking about Krislian.
Rita and Calvin dated in 2013 and 2014 … we’re told Calvin ended it. A short time later he started dating Krislian after meeting her in his music video.
Watch Rodriguez accuse Ora of misconduct over at TMZ…
