Justin Bieber -- Retraction Victory ... He's Hunky and He's Packing/nIt only took a matter of hours before the website that posted a GIF making it appear Calvin Klein artificially endowed Justin Bieber with muscles and genitalia folded like a cheap suit.TMZ broke the story ... Justin's legal team fired off a threatening letter to BreatheHeavy.com, demanding a retraction after the site posted a GIF making it appear that Bieber was way scrawnier and  "smaller " than the Calvin Klein photo would suggest.BreatheHeavy just caved and you can literally feel the fear. The site says,  "Bieber denies the photo is real, and I respect that and will believe him. "But the site didn't stop there, quoting Bieber's personal trainer ... who said,  "I can definitely confirm that he is a well-endowed guy. I sound weird saying that, but yes.”Breatheheavy has removed the GIF and not only apologized to the Biebs ... but also to the blood thirsty Beliebers./n
