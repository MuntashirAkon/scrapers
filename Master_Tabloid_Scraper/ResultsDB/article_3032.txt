For the #brelfie (above), the A-lister quipped: 
"My drinking buddy. #neverunderestimatethepowerofawoman"
You tell 'em, girl! In case you forgot, the 32-year-old welcomed her second child with Jason Sudeikis earlier this month. The twosome are also parents to their two-year-old son, Otis.
As a matter of fact, Olivia is no stranger to being photographed while breastfeeding as she did just that for Glamour magazine's September 2014 issue. Talk about a girl power moment!
Not to mention, the House alum isn't the only celeb who is comfortable with breastfeeding in front of the camera — just ask Miranda Kerr, Gisele Bundchen, and Jaime King. And it seems as though fans are loving Wilde's intimate snap as many have since taken to IG to sing the brunette beauty's praises.
One follower wrote:
"Thank you for showing the world that breastfeeding is the most natural, amazing and beautiful connection between a mother and a baby!"
Hear! Hear!
Here's hoping Olivia shares plenty more photos of herself with baby Daisy. Fingers crossed!
