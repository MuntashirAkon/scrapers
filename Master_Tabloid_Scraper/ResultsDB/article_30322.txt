Selena Gomez: Bieber Baby Situation ‘Not Easy,’ But I’m Coping /n
By Radar Staff
It’s been a trying few weeks for Selena Gomez after her boyfriend Justin Bieber was named in a paternity suit, but RadarOnline.com has video of the actress saying everything will be alright.
The 19-year-old Wizards of Waverly Place beauty, appearing on Thursday’s edition of The Ellen DeGeneres Show, seemed relieved in the wake of Bieber’s accuser Mariah Yeater dropping her suit against the Canadian pop sensation Wednesday.
But as RadarOnline.com first learned, Yeater’s paternity lawyer, Jeffrey Leving, said they’d hired a new legal team and would be pursuing private negotiations with Bieber’s camp outside of a courthouse, including a DNA test.

DeGeneres asked Gomez, “You’ve been all right?”
“I have been, yeah,” she responded, adding the situation’s “not easy” to deal with, but she’s okay.
On a lighter note, when DeGeneres asked Gomez if she could mention something to Bieber about how baggy his pants are, the Monte Carlo star joked she’s “told him” to pull ’em up, but he “just laughs.”

Elsewhere, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Edmund Willcox Clarke Jr. dismissed a case on Wednesday against Thomas Brodnicki, the 46-year-old man accused of stalking the Disney star from July to October of this year. District Attorney spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons said her office “strenuously objected” to the dismissal.
A restraining order remains in effect against Brodnicki, who must stay 100 yards away from Gomez; a November 23 hearing will determine if it will be extended.
