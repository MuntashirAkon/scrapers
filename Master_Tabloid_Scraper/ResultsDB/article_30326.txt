Boy George Released From Prison/n
A new stream-lined Boy George was released from prison in Great Britain on Monday.
The shamed Culture Club singer (real name George O’Dowd) was let out of Edmunds Hill Prison in Suffolk for good behavior after serving only four months of an original fifteen months sentence for assaulting and tying up a male prostitute.
Wearing a black top and sporting a shaved head and new beard, the 80’s pop singer waved to photographers as he left the prison in a black SUV.
The 47-year-old performer will have to wear an electronic ankle bracelet for the remainder of his sentence so that authorities can monitor his whereabouts.
The Karma Chameleon singer was found guilty of thrashing Audun Carlsen, 29, with a chain as he was shackled to a wall in the star’s Shoreditch flat in April 2007.
The 29-year-old Norwegian managed to free himself and fled in his underpants into the street, screaming for help. Condemning his ‘premeditated’, ‘callous’ and drug-fuelled frenzy which ‘traumatised’ Mr Carlsen, the judge said his victim had been ‘deprived of his liberty and his human dignity’ before sentencing O’Dowd in January.
The judge said the offense was ‘so serious that only an immediate sentence of imprisonment can be justified’. O’Dowd’s own barrister admitted that his client’s career had hit rock bottom and likened the behavior of the two men to ‘two drug-crazed idiots’.
The fallen star did not give evidence in court – his brother David O’Dowd said it was because he did not want to cause further upset to his elderly mother.
