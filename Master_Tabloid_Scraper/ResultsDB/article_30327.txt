Oh No! More Narnia!/n
     
Even though the second Narnia film wasnâ€™t quite the box office bonanza its producers had hoped, work is moving ahead on the third film in the series, The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader.
Ben Barnes will be back as the heroic Prince Caspian, with Georgie Henley as Lucy, Peter Dinklage as Trumpkin, Skander Keynes as Edmund, and Eddie Izzard as Reepicheep.
The film begins shooting early next year and is scheduled for release on May 7, 2010 /n
