Not only did the actress have to skip out on the performance, but the entire show was cancelled as well!
It's not clear how the 30-year-old got hurt, but the Roundabout Theatre Company says that Knightley is expected to return for Thursday night's performance!
Now, that's a show must go on mentality! We hope the actress doesn't have to deal with any more unplanned drama when she returns to the stage!
