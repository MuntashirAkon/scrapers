Doctors Issue Health Warning Against Skinny Jeans After One Woman's Pants Had To Be Cut Off Her Body!/n

Raise your hand if you've been victimized by fashion!
Doctors have issued a warning against skinny jeans after one woman spent so much time squatting in a pair of them that they had to be cut off her body in the emergency room!
It's so crazy, but IT'S TRUE!
The 35-year-old Australian woman in question was helping a relative move and had spent hours squatting and crouching to unload things.
This caused her circulation to slow down significantly, leading to pain and numbness in her legs and feet.
While walking home after the move, her feet were so numb that she fell and "spent several hours lying on the ground before she was found."
Dr. Thomas Edmund Kimber of Royal Adelaide Hospital wrote:
"As she was squatting for a long period of time her trousers restricted the blood supply to both calves, and in response the muscles start to undergo stress and swell."
After her jeans were cut off, the woman was treated with intravenous hydration, and four days later when she was discharged, she was able to walk normally.
Lesson 1: Don't squat for hours in skinny jeans.
Lesson 2: Wear sweatpants when helping someone move.
