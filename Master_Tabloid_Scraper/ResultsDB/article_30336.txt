Andy Murray Receives A Right Royal Congrats From Queen Elizabeth/n
After three intense sets (6-4, 7-5, 6-4), Scottish-born Andy Murray beat Novak Djokovic to win Wimbledon 2013, a year after he lost the mens single title to Roger Federer.
Though this is a massive win for Great Britain, Murray doesn’t know if his first Wimbledon victory tops the Olympics, where he beat Federer.

“Winning Olympic gold, I don’t know if I’ll ever have feelings like I had that day,” Murray said, according to the Telegraph.  “Winning Olympic gold here, a home Olympics, I’ll never get the opportunity to do that again.


“It was probably one of the proudest moments of my career. I don’t know if I’ll ever top that.”
Murray was presented with his trophy by Prince Edward, Duke of Kent, president of the All England Club.  He was also sent a private message of congratulations by Queen Elizabeth.
Editor’s note: On the morning of Her Majesty’s coronation in June 1953, it was learned that Great Britons Edmund Hilary and Tenzing Norgay had reached the summit of Mount Everest.  It’s hard not to draw parallels between this and Murray’s historic win and the Duchess of Cambridge’s impending delivery.
