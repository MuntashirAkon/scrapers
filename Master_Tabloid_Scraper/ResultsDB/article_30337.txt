Daniel Radcliffe Does Robert Pattinson on ‘The Simpsons’ (VIDEO)/n
Daniel Radcliffe quite literally took a bite out of The Simpsons last night, lending his voice to a Twilight send-up during the series’ annual “Treehouse of Horror” episode.
D-Rad provided his famous British voice to the character of Edmund, a green-eyed vampire inspired by Robert Pattinson’s Twilight character Edward.
Watch Edmund sinking his teeth into Homer Simpson in the below clip (℅ AOL Television:)
