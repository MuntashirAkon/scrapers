Daniel Radcliffe Spoofs ‘Twilight’ on ‘The Simpsons’: First Look/n
Watch out, Robert Pattinson; you’re about to get lampooned big-time, and your former castmate is going to get in on the fun.
As previously reported, R-Pattz’s one-time Harry Potter co-star Daniel Radcliffe will be spoofing the Twilight series on this year’s “Treehouse of Horror” episode of The Simpsons, and now we have a first look at how D-Rad will look when he hits the little screen.
Radcliffe will lend his voice to the character Edmund the vampire, a not-so-veiled reference to Pattinson’s Twilight alter-ego, Edward Cullen.
“Treehouse of Horror XXI” is scheduled to air on November 7. Will you be tuning in? And what do you think of this artist’s rendering of Radcliffe-as-Pattinson? Let us know in the comments section.
