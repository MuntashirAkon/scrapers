Stalk Talk: Did Paris Hilton Tail Robert Pattinson to Japan?/n
In an interesting coincidence—or not—celebutante Paris Hilton has arrived in Japan just a scant few hours after Twilight idol Robert Pattinson.
Benji Madden’s ex ostensibly traveled to the Land of the Rising Sun to appear at a  promotional event at the No Name club in Takeshiba, Tokyo. But there may be ulterior motives at work.
Hilton was said to be flirting heavily with the man who plays Edward Cullen at an Oscar party on Sunday night.
The Mirror reported that guests at superstar agent Patrick Whitesell’s Academy Awards bash were aghast while watching Hilton drag RPattz outside to the garden for some private time.
Hilton had reportedly dragged her law-enforcing sister Nicky around the party trying to locate “Edmund Cullen,” and then spent an hour giggling and talking with him before the garden gambit.
Pattinson escaped her manicured clutches at 4:30 a.m. in preparation for a flight to Japan, so he could attend the Japanese premiere of Twilight.
And now—surprise!—Hilton, too, has found a reason to visit Japan. Such interesting timing.
This all took place despite Paris having an alleged new man in her life.
She’s supposedly seeing Amanda Bynes cast-off and Hills minor-league ballplayer Doug Reinhardt, who has accompanied Hilton to the Far East for her promotional appearance for designer Samantha Thavasa.
But Hilton is a rich girl who gets what she wants. So it’s not a stretch to suggest that she might have booked a couple of tickets to Japan in pursuit of her Twilight crush.
If Paris tells Dougie Boy to go ahead and enjoy a night of sushi and sake on his own, he should really think twice.
