Amy Winehouse Yo-Yo’s Back to Rehab/n
London’s Telegraph reports that Amy Winehouse is going to rehab. Again.
But there’s a method to all this madness! The Focus 12 clinic, which she’s supposedly checking in to, is in Bury St. Edmunds.
That’s only 15 miles from Category C Highpoint Prison, the slammer Amy’s husband Blake Fielder-Civil is locked away at.
“This is a very good idea. If she can get clean and still see Blake it can only be good,” says Amy’s ailing dad Mitch.
You bet it’s a good idea, pops! Amy was looking beat down at last weekend’s V Festival.
Previously Russell Brand had been treated for drug addiction at Focus 12. And see how well that worked out? He’s now hosting the MTV VMAs and hanging out with sane, down-to-earth folks like Britney Spears.
