Turns out Pippa Middleton knows how to keep those Roaring '20s roaring oh-so-loudly into the new millennium.Kate Middleton's younger sister made quite a dramatic entrance Saturday as she attended an aristocratic wedding in Aberdeenshire, Scotland.Per The Telegraph, the 29-year-old party-supplies entrepreneur turned lifestyle author turned food columnist was in town to attend the nuptials of blue bloods Edmund Salvesen and Abi Elphinstone, but it was Pippa's purple ensemble that stole the show.

The brunette beauty, who attended without boyfriend Nico Jackson, turned heads in a full-length printed purple gown whose prudently placed slit revealed just enough of the socialite's famous gams.But it was Pippa's accessories that truly elevated the look: Prince William's sister-in-law pulled a Great Gatsby by topping the ensemble with a fake-fur stole and headpiece that paid homage—consciously or not—to F. Scott Fitzgerald's legendary Art Deco–era literary tale of wealth, high society and glamour.Wait—wealth, high society and glamour? Yep, sounds like Pippa fit right in.
