Ben Affleckâ€™s Batman character back, but manyÂ arenâ€™t too happyÂ to see him in a new suit.

The actor, who was spotted taking a smoke break on Thursday (March 23, 2017) in Los Angeles, recently shared an image of him in the upcoming Justice League movie.

Much to fansâ€™ disappointment, Affleckâ€™s new Batman costume failed to impress â€” with some drawing comparisons to George Clooneyâ€™sÂ getup from the much-derided Batman & Robin. (Remember those Batsuit nipples?)

Umâ€¦doesnâ€™t Ben Affleckâ€™s #JusticeLeague Batman outfit look eerily similar to George Clooneyâ€™s from Batman and Robin? #awkward

Questionable costume aside, fans were still stoked for Affleck to reprise his role as the Caped Crusader in the new superhero flick.

That 20 second tease of Ben Affleck as Batman for Justice League was all I need to continue to be alive.
Still hate my ex though.
