Hilary Duff recently got  married, and I can't stop reading  news about it. People are talking about her wedding, where she might be honeymooning and what she's tweeting. The most annoying part is  that every headline just refers to her as "Hilary." So when I see "Hilary  jetting off with her new husband," I  automatically think Hillary Clinton and her cankles have up and left Bill for  some other man who is most likely blind. I don't really have a problem with  Hilary Duff, but I don't think she's  famous enough to be referred to in the news as just "Hilary." She needs to put  in a little more time before she reaches the point where when someone says  "Hilary" we automatically associate it with "Duff." I'm allowed to say  that, because when Chelsea Clinton was getting married and all of the tabloids were just saying "Chelsea," I thought people might mistakenly think they were  talking about me. They did not. Turns out I'm not as famous as I  think, so neither is Hilary  Duff. There are plenty of other Hilarys that have put in their time that should  be thought of when America reads about "Hilary."  Obviously there's Hillary Clinton and Hilary Swank. I was running out of  examples, googled "famous people  named Hilary," and found a guy named  Edmund Hilary who at one point climbed Mt. Everest. He was married twice, and I never  heard a word about it. You'd think that guy could get a little  respect.
