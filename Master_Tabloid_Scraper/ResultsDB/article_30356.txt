“He was calm and felt very little discomfort. I think he will enjoy not having to wear deodorant anymore and not having to take his clothing to the dry-cleaners as often.”
“A lot of men and women complain about not being able to wear certain fabrics or colors due to the insecurity of having sweat stains,” noted the expert. “Others just don’t want to put chemical deodorants on their skin anymore .”
“Either way,” said Dr. Nazarian, “miraDry is an amazing procedure to improve quality of life and feel confident in any situation.”
