 Truce! Dr. Paul Nassif Says He's Now Friends With Ex Adrienne Maloof After Nasty Divorce:.../n
It’s a Real Housewives of Beverly Hills miracle!
Nearly three years after their extremely nasty split, Dr. Paul Nassif and his ex-wife, former Bravo star Adrienne Maloof, 53, are no longer fighting, the Beverly Hills plastic surgeon tells RadarOnline.com in an exclusive video interview.
“One thing that Adrienne and I have done, since time does really take care of things, our relationship now, especially because we have three beautiful boys, is actually quite good,” the Botched star, 52, reveals. “I spoke to her three, four times today. Basic stuff, not even about our kids. Our relationship has definitely and greatly improved.”

Despite their newfound friendship, the couple won’t be reconciling, he says. After ending his relationship with girlfriend Chantelle de Jong, the single dad has his sights set on a very famous younger woman.
“If you know anyone who has Katy Perry’s number, Dr. Paul Nassif wants it,” the doctor’s Botched costar Dr. Terry Dubrow quips during the joint interview.
“I’m waiting to get a date,” Dr. Nassif confirms.

But unfortunately, the man Dr. Dubrow calls “the most eligible bachelor in L.A.” simply doesn’t have time to date these days.
“We’ve been filming for seven months. And we’re working 14-15 hours a day, I have my children, so any extra time I have, I’m trying to rest,” he explains. “So the dating scene has been put on the backburner.”
