 Bruce Betrayed! Kim Kardashian Reportedly Feels Stepdad Jenner’s Sex Change ‘Spoils’.../n
Kim Kardashian may have publicly claimed to support Bruce Jenner through his “journey,” but according to a new report, the reality star and rapper husband Kanye West aren’t so thrilled about her former stepfather’s transformation.
The 65-year-old Olympian’s rumored gender reassignment “spoils her and Kanye’s image,” an insider tells In Touch.
A second source tells the magazine that the outspoken West, 35, is notoriously tight-lipped on the subject.

“Kanye won’t even talk about it,” explain the insider. “He thinks it’s just weird.”
While her 34-year-old sister turns her back on him, Jenner’s youngest daughter Kylie, 17, is allegedly in denial.
“Kylie has told a friend, ‘My father isn’t transgender— he’s just having fun right now,’” the source reveals.
