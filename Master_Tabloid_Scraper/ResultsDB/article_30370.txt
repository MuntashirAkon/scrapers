But Kardashian’s rep later slammed those reports.Photo credit: GSeth Rogan and Andy CohenSeth Rogen kicked off his feud with Justin Bieber back in January 2014 by tweeting, “All jokes aside, Justin Bieber is a piece of s**t.” The actor was apparently speaking from experience after two previous run-ins with the pop star. Rogen told Andy Cohen on Watch What Happens Live, “He [Bieber] seems like he’s obnoxious and ungrateful, insincere, and he puts people’s lives at danger.” Bieber tweeted, “sorry I didn’t ow down when I asked 2 meet u was probably a bit shy and didn't want to be over the top but still. love ur movies [sic]."Photo credit: SRita Ora and Kim KardashianIf (allegedly) refusing to sit near someone means you don’t like them then Kim Kardashian (allegedly) doesn’t like Rita Ora. The reality TV star supposedly asked the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards organizers that she not be placed next to the singer who reportedly broke her baby brother Rob Kardashian’s heart.Photo credit: STerrance Howard and Robert Downey JREver wondered why Terrence Howard was nixed from the Iron Man franchise after appearing in the first film? According to the actor, it’s because of Robert Downey Jr. In an interview on Watch What Happens Live, Howard alleged, “It turns out that the person that I helped become Iron Man, when it was time to…re-up for the second one took the money that was supposed to go to me and pushed me out.”Photo credit: SShonda Rimes and Katherine HeiglIt may be years since Katherine Heigl left Grey’s Anatomy under a dark cloud but that doesn’t mean the show’s creator Shonda Rimes has forgotten her. The actress whined in 2008 that she hadn’t been given “the material this season to warrant an Emmy nomination.” In a subsequent interview with The Hollywood Reporter Rimes said she now has a “no a**holes policy,” adding that when it comes to her Scandal cast, “There are no Heigls in this situation.”Photo credit: GTaylor Swift and Katy PerryNot content with throwing her ex-boyfriends under the bus in her songs, Taylor Swift seems to be taking aim at her showbiz frenemies. In an interview with Rolling Stone, the singer said her song “Bad Blood” is about one of her peers who did “something so horrible” she realized they were “straight-up enemies.” Katy Perry later apparently outted herself on Twitter – by referring to the movie Mean Girls – saying, “Watch out for the Regina George in sheep’s clothing…”Photo credit: SDonald Trump and Russel BrandIs there any celeb that Donald Trump hasn’t traded insults with? In October 2014, he added Russell Brand to his long list of enemies, tweeting that the comedian is “a major loser” and that “@katyperry must have been drunk when she married” him. To which the motor mouth Brit responded, “@realDonaldTrump are you drunk when you write these tweets. Or does that foam you spray on your bald head make you high?”Photo credit: SCharlize Theron and Tia MoweryIt seems that Charlize Theron, allegedly, has no time for certain former child stars. That’s what Tia Mowry claimed in an interview with In Touch Weekly saying the Oscar-winner “wasn’t very nice” and “rolled her eyes and said ‘Oh my God’” when the Sister, Sister star said “Hi” to her at a SoulCycle class. But Mowry later told E! the whole incident had been “blown out of proportion.”Photo credit: GCiara and RihannaThat there is no love lost between Ciara and Rihanna is no secret. The two have had a long-standing feud that was sparked when the “Goodies” singer told E! that RiRi “wasn’t the nicest” to her when they bumped into each other at a party.Photo credit: GFloyd Mayweather and 50 CentIf the definition of low blow is mocking someone for having alleged learning difficulties then 50 Cent threw that punch at Floyd Mayweather in summer 2014. The rapper and the boxer fell out after a business venture went south. So, while the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge swept the nation, 50 Cent challenged Mayweather to read a page of a Harry Potter novel without stumbling.Photo credit: SKanye West and Jimmy KimmelKanye West’s fight with Jimmy Kimmel said less about the comedian and more about the rapper’s sense of humor (or lack thereof). West became enraged when Kimmel aired a spoof of his interview with the BBC. The rapper threw a tantrum on Twitter, writing – among other things – “Sarah Silverman is a thousand times funnier than you...” The two men later buried the hatchet on the Jimmy Kimmel Live show.Photo credit: GMiley Cyrus and Annie LenoxTwerking, dressing scantily and acting provocatively do not a feminist make. So says Annie Lennox who took aim at singers like Miley Cyrus who bandy the F-word about while bumping, grinding, singing and baring lots of flesh. “Twerking is not feminism…” Lennox said in an NPR interview. “[I]t’s not liberating, it’s not empowering.”Photo credit: GSnoop Dogg and Iggy Azelea“Iggy Azalea No Make Up.” That’s the caption Snoop Dogg added to a photo of an African-American albino woman that he posted on to his Instagram page in October 2014. It was enough to start an online spat between the two rappers, which was (sort of) squashed when peace negotiator (and Azalea’s mentor and record label owner) T.I. asked Snoop to apologize.Photo credit: GLil’ Kim and Nicki ManajIt’s the hip-hop feud that refuses to die down. Lil’ Kim seems to be upset that – with her provocative lyrics, twerking, half-naked dancing, while wearing neon-colored wigs (a look she has since ditched) – Nicki Minaj was copying her circa 1990s style. She called Minaj “obsessed,” but Minaj didn’t respond.Photo credit: GSteve Wynn and George ClooneyThere is no love lost between George Clooney and Steve Wynn who got into a spat over Barack Obama in April 2014. The Las Vegas mogul allegedly called the president an “a**hole” during a supposedly drunken dinner. But while Wynn denied hurling the insult, Clooney says “that is false” adding in a lengthy response, “I did, in turn, call him the same body part, and walked out.”Photo credit: GGweneth Paltrow and Martha Stewart“If she were confident in her acting, she wouldn’t be trying to be Martha Stewart.” With that catty remark the domestic guru revealed her distain for Gwyneth Paltrow, the star’s Goop website and cookery books. Meanwhile, just before she hired Martha Stewart Living’s ex-president and CEO to steer her own lifestyle brand, the actress gloated, “If I’m really honest, I’m so psyched that she sees us as competition.”Photo credit: GSylvester Stallone and Bruce WillisIn August 2014, Sylvester Stallone told the U.K.’s Daily Express newspaper, “I think Bruce Willis is a great guy and he does fantastically entertaining films…” That’s not what Rocky was saying a year earlier when he blasted the Die Hard actor on Twitter for being “greedy and lazy,” saying he was relieved Willis would be replaced by Harrison Ford in the next Expendables movie.Photo credit: GOrlando Bloom and Justin BieberForget Twitter and Instagram. When Orlando Bloom and Justin Bieber bumped into each other in Ibiza the two duked it out the old fashioned way – with their fists. The actor lunged for the pop prince, allegedly in response to the “Baby” singer’s taunts about getting cozy with Bloom’s estranged wife Miranda Kerr.Photo credit: GTyrese Gibson and James FrancoWhen an actor says he will happily blow up another celebrity’s house (hypothetically speaking) you know that the two stars don’t get along. That's what Tyrese Gibson told Elle about his relationship with James Franco during the filming of their flop Annapolis. Gibson said, “Whenever we’d have to get in the ring for boxing scenes, and even during practice, the dude was full-on hitting me.”Photo credit: GThe Kardashians and Joan RiversJoan Rivers stirred up drama with the Kardashians when she slammed them in her book and said Kim’s daughter North West needed an eyebrow waxing. When the iconic comedienne died, the family put all enmity aside and posted loving tributes on Twitter — except for Kim, who was noticeably silent!Photo credit: STamar Braxton and Chris BrownHell hath no fury like a Chris Brown or a Tamar Braxton scorned. When Braxton and her The Real co-host Adrienne Bailon suggested Karrueche Tran needs an “inter-friend-tion” because of her on-off relationship with Brown, all hell broke loose…on Instagram. He called Braxton a “Muppet” and Bailon an “ole trout mouth a** bitch.” Toni’s little sister ranted in response adding her own unique Instagram hash tag, “#dontf**kwithmefellasthisisnotherfirsttimeattherodeo.”Photo credit: S
