Will Cars 3 Finally Be A Worthy Sequel? Get Ready With Our Ranking Of All 17 Pixar Movies!/n

When in doubt — go Rocky!
That's what it looks like Pixar is going for based on the uncharacteristically dramatic trailer for Cars 3!
The film features a seasoned Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) finally meeting his match: hotshot Jackson Storm (Armie Hammer), who threatens the title of fastest car in the world with the help of cutting edge technology.
Older fans will recognize this story straight out of Rocky IV, in which the world's greatest boxer Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) meets his match: the technology-trained Russian destroyer Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren).
This spiritual remake might actually be a good direction for the Cars series. It worked for Toy Story 3, which was basically Shawshank Redemption that took place in a prison-like daycare.
Then again, nothing could be worse than the flat tire that was Cars 2 – widely regarded as the worst Pixar movie of them all!
