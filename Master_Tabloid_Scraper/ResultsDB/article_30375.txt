Sylvester Stallone & Casey Affleck Reportedly Clashed Over Seating At The Golden Globes!/n

That moment when Rocky doesn't have a seat at the table.
According to multiple sources, Sylvester Stallone was not in the audience during the Golden Globes on Sunday due to a seating snafu at his assigned table, which included the Manchester by the Sea team — actor Casey Affleck, producer Matt Damon, and writer-director Kenneth Lonergan.
People reports things got a little awkward when there was only one seat available for the 70-year-old and his wife, Jennifer Flavin, whose daughters shared the title of Miss Golden Globes.
One source close to the show revealed no one sitting at the table made an effort to make adjustments for the Stallones, who ultimately got frustrated and watched the ceremony from the green room backstage. We can imagine that would be a bit embarrassing!

Another insider says: 
"There weren't enough seats and so there was confusion, but it wasn't personal against him."
We're hearing more seats eventually became available facing the stage, but it was a little too late for the Creed star.
After Ben Affleck's brother won for Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture, Drama, he reportedly tried to make amends with Sly over the ordeal when they crossed paths backstage, but to no avail.
Stallone's rep responded to the rumors:
"The story you refer to is an interesting rumor — but a rumor nonetheless. Sylvester Stallone had a wonderful evening attending and presenting at the Golden Globes and celebrating with his family and friends."
Hmmm. Seems a bit silly.
