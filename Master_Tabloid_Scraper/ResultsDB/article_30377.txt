Frenemies Samantha Bee & Glenn Beck Make A Christmas Truce To Fight 'Trumpism'! Watch The Festive Full Frontal Interview!/n

This election season has grabbed U.S. politics by the p*ssy and resulted in some very weird alliances — like Hillary Clinton and Jill Stein, or Donald Trump and Kanye West.
And now, two political commentators on completely different ends of the spectrum — Samantha Bee and Glenn Beck – are joining forces to take on Trumpism!
Beck — whose views were at one time considered too far-right for Fox News — has spent the recent months during the rise of Trump apologizing for his extreme conservatism.
The pundit wrote a pro-Black Lives Matter op-ed for New York Times and blasted Trump's chief strategist Steven Bannon for his ties to white nationalists.

And if this Scrooge-like transformation wasn't crazy enough, now Beck is breaking bread (or more accurately, cake) with the Full Frontal host herself!!
On Monday night, Bee welcomed Beck on her TBS late night show for a holiday conversation — dressed in matching ugly Christmas sweaters, of course.
After exchanging a few burns, the comedienne explained the two needed to band together because the future of politics will "require a broad coalition of non-partisan decency." Beck agreed, then apologized for his past behaviors that "helped divide" the country.
At the end of their sit down, the two frenemies awkwardly held hands before Bee presented Beck with a "Strange Bedfellows" cake of them lying together in bed — and they ate each other's cake heads off, because why not?
Ch-ch-check out the weird (yet sort of heartwarming) interview (below) to see the former enemies become sort-of-friends!!
