Piers Morgan Trolls America With His Donald Trump Christmas Card!/n

We get it, you're important.
Back in 2008, Piers Morgan was just entering America's radar as the winner of Celebrity Apprentice's inaugural season.
Fast forward eight years later, and now Donald Trump is about to be the next President of the United States… and Piers sure is rubbing it in.

The British pundit paused his needless, non-stop insults towards Madonna and Lady GaGa early Monday morning to reveal his annual Christmas card — and it seems to suggest he may actually end up in Trump's cabinet!
In the pic, the racist Republican takes a break from grabbing women by the p*ssy to put both hands on the #PresidentialApprentice's shoulders… but it's the caption that has us worried: 

"Relax, everyone — I've got this.."
We hate that it's not even slightly unreasonable to assume he's being serious. With that said, we're well-versed in Piers' "comedy" by now — so hopefully he's just trolling.
Hopefully…
What do U think of the Celebrity Apprentice throwback??
