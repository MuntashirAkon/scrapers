After it had been reported that Donald Trump was considering Sylvester Stallone for a top government arts job, the Rocky star revealed he would not accept the offer.
Although he was very flattered with the President-elect’s unofficial offer to be the Chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts, Stallone said he would rather serve the administration by working to support the country’s veterans.

“I am incredibly flattered to have been suggested to be involved with the National Endowment of the Arts,” he said in a statement (via People). “However I believe I could be more effective by bringing national attention to returning military personnel in an effort to find gainful employment, suitable housing and financial assistance these heroes respectfully deserve.”
It sure sounds like Stallone is not ruling out the possibility of working under the Trump administration —  if he’s offered a position, of course.
