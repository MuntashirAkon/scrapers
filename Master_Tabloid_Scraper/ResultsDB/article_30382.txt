Jackie Chan was honored with a golden statue at the 2016 Governors Awards last night (Nov. 12, 2016). The actor says he’s wanted one ever since Sylvester Stallone let him hold his, according to E! News.

The Governors Awards are an annual event where the Academy’s Board of Governors present their testimonial awards. Chan accepted the statue from Rush Hour co-star Chris Tucker following a toast from Tom Hanks and video testimonials from directors Brett Ratner and Jennifer Yuh Nelson.
During his acceptance speech, Chan told a story about his father asking why he doesn’t have an Oscar yet. “I just look at my dad and said, ‘Ha ha ha, Dad, I only make comedy action movies.'”
The Academy Board of Governors disagreed and presented Chan with an award for his contributions to film. Chan joked in his speech that when Academy President Cheryl Boone Isaacs called to tell him he won, he asked, “Are you sure?”
Chan ended the speech by thanking his fans around the world. “You’re the reason I continue to make movies, jumping through windows, kicking and punching, breaking my bones. Thank you so much!” The actor received a standing ovation.
