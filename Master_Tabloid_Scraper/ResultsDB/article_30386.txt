Well, that must have definitely hurt him.
Liam Hemsworth appeared on the Graham Norton Show on Friday (June 10, 2016) to promote Independence Day: Resurgence, where he discussed the time that Jean-Claude Van Damme kicked him in the chest. The actor explained how it happened while they were filming a scene for The Expendables 2 — and he apparently got very hurt.

“At one point in the scene, he has a moment where he supposedly kicks this knife into my chest,” Hemsworth begins, “We did a bunch of takes and on this one particular take, he gave me a full Van Damme kick to the chest, and I dropped to my knees.”
But despite the pain he felt, he didn’t want to look weak in front of the martial artist. “And then he takes his glasses off and turns to me and goes, ‘It’s OK, it’s a controlled kick.’ And I’m like, ‘There was nothing controlled about it. You kicked me in the chest!’”

Hemsworth also went on to admit, “I honestly felt honored. If you’re gonna get kicked by someone, that’s a pretty good person to be kicked by.”
