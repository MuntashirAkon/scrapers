There’s a reason this guy is a legend…

As you may know, Sylvester Stallone did not take home the Oscar for his part in the boxing film Creed. He lost to Mark Rylance for his supporting role in Bridge of Spies.
However, Sly quickly posted a message to fans, reminding everyone that he didn’t get where he is today without some serious determination. He posted a terrific pic of himself, winking and brandishing a fist, with the caption, “To all the ‘real Rocky’s’ of the world, Please hang on to your dreams, NEVER GIVE IN , NEVER GIVE OUT , NEVER GIVE UP! thanks for the support.”

Stallone was the only person nominated for Creed; director Ryan Coogler and star Michael B. Jordan were both mentioned often as African American creatives not included in the Oscars proceedings. Sly reportedly said he also wanted to boycott the event but Coogler talked him out of it, according to Entertainment Tonight.
