Just last week, Jason Sudeikis and his ladylove Olivia Wilde welcomed their second child, Daisy Josephine. Thankfully the Hollywood duo appears open to sharing photos of their newborn because the cavalcade of cuteness has begun! Today (Oct. 19, 2016), the proud parents shared a new photo and weâ€™re betting it will have you hankering to pinch some adorable cheeks!

The new black-and-white pic features baby Daisy nestled peacefully on her motherâ€™s chest by a window. Wilde kept her caption simple â€” offering only a content emoji.

This isnâ€™t Daisyâ€™s big social media debut. That went down over the weekend when the actress gave fans and friends a glimpse of Daisy fast asleep on her new fluffy lamb bed.
Quick, Olivia, share more photos!
