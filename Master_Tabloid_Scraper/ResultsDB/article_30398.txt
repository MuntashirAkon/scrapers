Sylvester Stallone Proves Eating Pizza Is a ‘Pretty Good Habit’ with His Ripped Body/n
 
Who said eating pizza was a bad thing?
Sylvester Stallone sung the praises of everyone’s favorite food in an Instagram post on Wednesday.
“With my good friend Richie Palmer who owns the famous MULBERRY STREET PIZZA Restaurants, In Los Angeles and Beverly Hills,” Stallone, 70, wrote. “Great food! This is an example that eating his pizza is a pretty good habit!”

The Creed actor works hard for the body he has, even joining his daughter Sophia recently for pilates and being “stunned” by the brutal workout.
“I gotta admit that was brutal,” the actor said in a video on Instagram, his daughter by his side. “For anyone who has never tried pilates, the name sounds cute but it ain’t cute! It’s tough. Oh my God.”





 Brutal! Working out with my daughter doing Pilates… Oh my God. This is like going the distance with Clubber Lang  and Drago before breakfast!! This is an amazing workout but definitely not for the faint of heart.  I've lifted weights I have boxed, wrestled, Track and field, played football and many other sports… But this  workout pushes you to the limit… And beyond! @sophiastallone

Working out may be brutal, but for Sly, it may all be worth it for a slice.
