Daisy joins 2-year-old big brother Otis Alexander, who helped mom announce her pregnancy news in April.
In September, Wilde let it be known she was having a girl in a tweet supporting Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. “As someone who is about to have a daughter, this hits me deep in my core,” she tweeted.
Congrats to the happy family!
