Sylvester Stallone is happy to take the backseat when it comes to his three daughters.
The actor and his wife Jennifer Flavin joined their three daughters Sistine, Sophia and Scarlett at the star-studded Harper’s Bazaar party in Los Angeles on Wednesday night.
The girls were celebrating being on the cover of Harper by Harper’s Bazaar, an offshoot edition aimed at younger women. Stallone was every bit the doting dad for the night, smiling and posing with his family as they walked the red carpet together.

Stallone looked dapper in a sleek gray suit, but it was his daughters who stole the spotlight in coordinated black dresses with lace detail.

Stallone’s daughters catapulted into the spotlight this past January when they served as joint Miss Golden Globes at the star-studded awards show and have joined their father on numerous red carpets over the past year.
But no matter where their paths take them, the sisters have promised not to let the Hollywood lifestyle get in the way of their tight family bond.
“This is all so new,” Sophia told the magazine, “but we are so close.”
