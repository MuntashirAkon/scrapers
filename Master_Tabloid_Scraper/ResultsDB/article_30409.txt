A few tourists really wanted to make the best of their trip to Philadelphia, so they ran up the famous Rocky steps—but there was an even bigger surprise waiting for them at the top.Peter Rowe said he and two of his college friends Jacob Kerstan and Andrew Wright had just finished racing up the staircase at the Philadelphia Museum of Art on Saturday when they saw—wait for it—Rocky Balboa, er, Sylvester Stallone himself!"He said to us, `Man, you guys are fast. You're making me look bad!"' Rowe said on Tuesday.And the even better part? The famous actor even posed for a selfie with the group, telling the guys to "look tough."It looks like the excitement trumped their tough faces, but can ya blame them?!

Stallone made the art museum's steps famous in his first run as fictional boxer Rocky Balboa, who used them as part of his training regimen.Numerous people now visit the steps each year to re-create the popular scene of Stallone running in the film and to take pictures with a Rocky statue, which originally was a prop in Rocky III.The 68-year-old star is in Philadelphia for the shooting of Creed, the latest installment in the movie franchise. It stars Fruitvale Station star Michael B. Jordan, as Adonis Creed, the grandson of early Rocky foe Apollo Creed.
