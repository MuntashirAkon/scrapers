After weeks of teasing, DNCE finally dropped a music video for “Body Moves” and it is hot!

The music video (which is not the official music video) for the first single off their debut album features frontman Joe Jonas in various stages of undressing while singing in his hotel room. Victoria’s Secret models get ready to go out for a night on the town as well,
VS Angels, including Josephine Skriver, Taylor Hill and Jasmine Tookes, dance around in the video, officially titled, “Victoria’s Secret x DNCE: Bralettes & “Body Moves” wearing VS bralettes from the new Sexy Little Thing collection.
Unfortunately, Jonas and the models never come in contact with each other, but that doesn’t make the music video any less sexy.
