Beware all potential suitors—Sylvester Stallone can throw a mean punch. The 69-year-old Oscar nominee stepped out on the red carpet Thursday night for the premiere of his upcoming film, Creed, with not one, but four stunning dates—including his statuesque wife Jennifer Flavin along with his trio of striking teenage daughters, Sophia Rose Stallone, 19, Sistine Rose Stallone, 17, and Scarlet Rose Stallone, 13.We can only imagine how intimidating it must be to bring home a date to meet Rocky Balboa. Model Sistine and mom Jennifer looked like twins in coordinating black and white ensembles with accents of lace. Eldest Sophia opted for head to toe black with sexy panelling of sheer lace at the waist while youngest Scarlet wore a fittingly red cocktail number with a lace pattern overlay.The man of the hour, Stallone, ignored the lace memo and instead chose a sharp navy blue suit, strikingly white collared shirt and matching pocket square. Looking good, Rocky!




The action star stood guard as he was sandwiched by his four beauties, crossing his arms in front of him as the entire posse posed for the cameras.The women have certainly grown up right before our eyes, especially in comparison to a similar red carpet family photo from just a few years ago.

Five years ago, the grown women were just blossoming little girls as they held their father's hands on the red carpet for his debut in The Expendables.At the time, they had swapped their curve-hugging ensembles and sky high heels of today for strapless floral dresses, kitten heels and baby flats. How time flies!

In additional shots of the star-studded evening, Stallone joined his longtime wife Flavin for a few couple shots together as they celebrated the debut of the film garnering the veteran actor some Oscar buzz. In the spin-off of the Rocky series, Stallone reprises his role of Rocky Balboa as he coaches Adonis Creed, played by Michael B. Jordan, a young aspiring boxer and son of champion Apollo Creed, who was killed in the ring in the fourth installment. The film will be released in theaters on Nov. 25.
