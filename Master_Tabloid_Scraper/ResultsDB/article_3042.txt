Laverne Cox paid tribute to her idols Beyoncé, Tina Turner, and Tracey Africa in Cosmopolitan.
The Orange Is the New Black star appears in the Cosmo magazine’s October issue, but she looks nothing like herself in the photo shoot. Inside the issue, she transforms into the women who she considers her personal super-heroines.

“Beyoncé represents excellence,” she said about Queen Bey, who just celebrated her 35th birthday. “Her work ethic is like nobody else I’ve ever seen. There were so many moments when I was shooting Rocky Horror and I’d be exhausted. My body would be hurting and I’d be like, ‘Beyoncé. Beyoncé does this.’ You have to just put in the work.”

“The pain, pleasure, and agony of all she’s been through is in her voice,” she said about legendary singer, Tina Turner. “Her story is the story of so many black women who’ve endured abuse and come out the other side in such a brilliant, beautiful way.”

“Tracey Africa was a black trans woman who modeled in the ’70s and had cosmetics deals and a hair con­tract with Clairol — it was a big deal,” Cox, 32, explains. “People think, ‘Oh, this trans revolution is just start­ing,’ but we’ve been around for a very long time. It’s important to know that there’s been a path blazed for me.”
