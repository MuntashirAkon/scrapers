Will Ferrell -- Lakers Suck So Hard, It Makes Me Sad (PHOTO)/nWill Ferrell went all frowny face at the Lakers game Friday night ... with good reason. Will and his son looked on as they sat on the hardwood and watched their team lose to the Trail Blazers by a miserable score of 107 - 77. Will's face is a symbol of woe in the Lakers camp.  Ticket resale prices are at a 4-year low.  Some $400 tickets right behind courtside seats are being hawked for $119. Sly Stallone and wife Jennifer Flavin also grimly watched.  So sad. It appears Heidi Klum's son figured out the best way to endure Lakers games./n
