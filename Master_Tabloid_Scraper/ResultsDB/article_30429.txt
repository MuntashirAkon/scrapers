Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylverster Stallone -- Ordinary Lunch Buddies (PHOTO)/nHollywood legends Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone like what they like ... and they like Cafe Roma for lunch. The action stars have been going to the Bev Hills restaurant for years ... it's their place. Gotta say, they both look great and certainly look happy. Â  With all the Hollywood feuds between competing actors, it's really something that they've always gotten along, even though they've gone head--to-head and competed for top action spot on the food chain. And speaking of food chain, Cafe Roma can be delicious, if you order the right thing./n
