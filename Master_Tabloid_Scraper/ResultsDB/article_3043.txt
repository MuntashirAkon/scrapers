FKA twigs believes that the people who appreciate her art deserve a better title than a word synonymous with a ceiling appliance.

The enigmatic artist stands boldly on the cover of ELLE magazine’s August issue, inside discussing her music and why she refuses to use the word “fan.” FKA twigs says that the word is “derogative” and opts to call them “people who like my music” or “people interested in me as an artist.”
“They don’t influence what I make,” she says, “But they have a role in us all coming together and creating something genuine.”
Despite her high-profile relationship with Robert Pattinson, FKA twigs says that being in the public eye is “so weird.”
