Sylvester Stallone -- I Support De La Hoya Comeback ... He's Still Got It/nRocky Balboa fought until he was 60 ... so, it's probably not a shocker that Sylvester Stallone says he's all about an Oscar De La Hoya comeback fight!  The 42-year-old fighter has been talking about coming out of retirement lately ... and told us he wants a piece of human wrecking machine Gennady Golovkin (Triple G).  So, with Stallone being a huge boxing fan ... and a fan of old people making comebacks ...we had to ask Sly how he felt about ODLH.   Someone get Mason  "The Line " Dixon on the phone .... /n
