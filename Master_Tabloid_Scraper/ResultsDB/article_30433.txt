Sylvester Stallone -- Mayweather Will Stay Undefeated … Unless (VIDEO)/nSylvester Stallone knows the secret to defeating Floyd Mayweather Jr. … but it doesn’t have anything to do with his next opponent, Andre Berto. Almost no one is giving Berto a chance to win the fight -- so we asked Sly if he thinks he's even got a puncher's chance to upset Money. Check it out ... Sly says there's a chance, but not a puncher's one.  Stallone also throws a playful jab at  "Southpaw " star Jake Gyllenhaal's on the topic of big screen boxers. We'll give you one guess which actor /fighter he IS backing. Yep. You got it./n
