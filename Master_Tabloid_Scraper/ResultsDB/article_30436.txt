Hands Off, Maria Shriver!/nMaria Maria, cell phone cheatah! It appears Maria Shriver broke the law prohibiting driving under the influence of a cell phone -- a law her hubby supported and signed into law last year.Kaleefornia Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger apparently can't lay down the law in his own home. Maria was photographed twice driving her car while holding her cell phone -- most recently last Sunday in Los Angeles.Had Shriver been busted, she would have owed the bankrupt state of California $20 plus fees for the first offense ... $50 plus fees for the second. BTW, we need every dime we can get.We called the Guv's office and Maria's rep yesterday -- radio silence.    See Also      Amanda Peet Is Arnold's Wife?   Schwarzenegger: A Penne for Your Thoughts/n
