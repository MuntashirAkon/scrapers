Melissa Joan Hart Admits She Was Bewitched By Ryan Reynolds/n
Former teen witch Melissa Joan Hart was “smit­ten”  with co-star Ryan Reynolds —
and ­regrets not ­consummating her crush!
The pair met as teens while s­hooting the 1996 TV film Sabrina the Teenage Witch,
which served as the pilot for the long-running ABC sitcom.
Melissa thought the Deadpool hunk was “adorable,” but she didn’t act on her crush because she had a boyfriend.
“[Ryan] was a really nice guy … so maybe I should have taken a chance,” she jokes.
