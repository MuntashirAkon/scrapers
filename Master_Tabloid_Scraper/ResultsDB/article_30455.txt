 Not A 'Fuller House' After All! Nicole Curtis & Dave Coulier's Rocky Relationship.../n
Dave Coulier wasn’t the only one saying “cut it out” in his relationship with Nicole Curtis!
RadarOnline.com can exclusively reveal that Curtis, 40, and Coulier, 57, were engaged for a brief period of time — and she almost followed him to California to start a life together.
“When Nicole was engaged to Dave Coulier, she was going to be moving to California,” her mother Joan told Radar. “Steven [Cimini] had his company settle him over into California so that he would be close to [their son] Ethan. But then Nicole broke off the engagement to Dave Coulier, and Steve lived in California.”
Their bitter custody battle soon exploded, as Cimini was never able to return to Minnesota. He claimed in a 2015 court plea that he had to “fight for every minute of parenting time” since his move — which was all for nothing.
READ The Court Documents!
“Father had 150 overnights a year with Ethan until he was 8-years-old,” the court papers obtained by Radar read. “Mother than petitioned for a change of domicile because she wanted to follow her fiancé out to California.”
“With the expectation that the court would allow the change, Father got a job transfer to California so he could continue to be an integral part of Ethan’s life,” they continued. “But Mother had a change of heart when she caught her fiancé cheating on her, and never went to California.”
The Full House actor later married a photographer, while the Rehab Addict star has remained single.
“Nicole has had a lot of boyfriends, but has never been married,” her mom confirmed, despite her mentions of divorce. “She’s always let relationships run her life.”
