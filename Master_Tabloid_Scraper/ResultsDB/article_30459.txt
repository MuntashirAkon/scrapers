Joan's Message From The Grave: Rivers Forgives Monster Doctor For Fatal Surgery/n
Joan Rivers passed away more than two years ago, but according to a new tell-all, the comedy legend is speaking to her best friend from the grave!
According to Leslie Bennetts‘ Last Girl Before Freeway: The Life, Loves, Losses and Liberation of Joan Rivers, the star’s lifelong pal Sue Cameron says she’s been communicating with Rivers’ spirit through a psychic.
Rivers, who died after going into cardiac arrest during a botched throat surgery, isn’t angry about her sudden, avoidable death, the friend insists in the book.

“I said to her, ‘It was medical malpractice! I want to kill [the doctor]!’ She said, ‘Don’t bother,'” Cameron recalls of their alleged supernatural conversation. “I don’t think Joan would have chosen to go this way, and she certainly didn’t want to leave her family, but she was just bone-tired exhausted.'”
The 81-year-old Fashion Police cohost, comedienne, author and reality star was “ready to go” by her September 2014 passing.
“She was so tired of having to be Joan Rivers,” Cameron explains to Bennetts. “She said it was such an ordeal to keep the Joan machine going. She said over and over, ‘I’m exhausted. I’m done! I don’t want to be Joan anymore.'”

Rivers left behind her only child, daughter Melissa, 48, and teen grandson, Cooper.
In 2015, Melissa filed a medical malpractice lawsuit against New York City’s Yorkville Endoscopy for the deadly surgery. The two parties settled out of court in May 2016.
