While there aren't many details circulating about the project, the hitmaker has been spotted being filmed by Me @ The Zoo documentarian Chris Moukarbel this past year. It's likely that the flick will feature footage from GaGa's Super Bowl performance, her making of Joanne, the split with Taylor Kinney, etc.
We're sure GaGa's Little Monsters are more than stoked about this documentary.
