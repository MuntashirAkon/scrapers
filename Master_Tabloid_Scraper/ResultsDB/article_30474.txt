The universe kept Melissa Joan Hart and Ryan Reynolds apart while they were filming Sabrina the Teenage Witch TV movie, but what if they didn’t?

This is a question that Hart considered during her appearance on Australia’s Studio 10 while discussing her brief on-screen romance with the Deadpool actor.
“He was very sweet. I had a boyfriend at the time but we were smitten and cute and he was adorable,” said Hart. “He was a really, really nice guy, probably would have been a great boyfriend, and I didn’t end up with the other guy, so maybe I should have taken a chance!”

Hart previously discussed the time she spent with Reynolds in her 2013 memoir Melissa Explains It All: Tales from My Abnormally Normal Life.
“Though I was madly in love with James, my boyfriend of six months by then, Ryan and I spent plenty of time together,” she wrote. “Even so, he sure knew how to make a girl feel special.”
Now, Reynolds is married to Blake Lively and Hart is married to Mark Wilkerson. Lively and Reynolds have two children together while Hart and Wilkerson have three sons.
