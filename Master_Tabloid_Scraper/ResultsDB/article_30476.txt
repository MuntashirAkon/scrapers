Congratulations are in order for Steven Yeun and Joana Pak!

The Walking Dead actor and his wife welcomed a son on March 17, according to E! News.
Word of the couple’s pregnancy first surfaced last year just days after Yeun married his longtime love in a private ceremony at the Paramour Estate in California. At the time, Pak’s baby news was confirmed when she was seen with a budding bump as she grabbed lunch in Los Angeles with her new husband.
In February, the expectant mom showed off her large baby belly in a series of photo booth shots shared on Yeun’s Instagram.
