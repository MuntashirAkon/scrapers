So this is how Gigi Hadid sees Zayn Malik!

The model took on the role of photographer for Versus Versace’s Spring/Summer 2017 campaign, capturing her boyfriend in a series of raw and intimate shots. Also starring model Adwoa Aboah, the spread was shot at Los Angeles’ Chateau Marmont using just iPhones and digital cameras.
Needless to say, Hadid did a great job getting her boyfriend’s good side.
“It was sick to work with Versus. Dontella is a G,” Malik said. “It was extra special that Gigi shot the campaign.”

Fashion designer Donatella Versace also gushed about the chemistry between the couple, saying, “They are young people who define the mood of their generation with their honesty, energy and their love.”
The project was initially teased out last week when Hadid and Malik attended Paris Fashion Week together.
You could say these lovebirds are inseparable — in work and play!
