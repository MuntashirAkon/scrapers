Kendall Jenner had quite the night.

The Keeping Up with the Kardashians star got buck wild when she hit the town with a few of her model pals on Wednesday (March 1, 2017) in Paris. Joined by Bella Hadid, Hailey Baldwin, Joan Smalls, Lily Donaldson and other ridiculously gorgeous people, Jenner went out to a local strip club where — you guessed it — things got pretty naughty.
Case in point: These videos of the 21-year-old getting spanked by her friends.

The girls night out also consisted of a lot of picture-taking and people sitting around looking through social media on their phones. After all, did it really happen if you didn’t put it up on Instagram?

The morning after, Jenner was seen wearing dark shades and cornrows (cue the cultural appropriation backlash) as she left her hotel. Clearly, someone had too much fun.
