Plastic surgery for Kendall Jenner? Nope!Instead of going the artificial route for breast enhancement, the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star sought the help of gal-pal Josephine Skriver, who was more than willing to help give Kendall a little lift. Hailey Baldwin caught the moment and posted it on Instagram, writing, Jo giving kens a boost."The photo was taken as the female power crew was partying in Cannes during the Film Festival and also shows Kendall puckering up to give Hailey a kiss while the Victoria's Secret model gropes her boobs.Jenner made her red carpet appearance earlier Wednesday where she stunned in a black sexy Azzedine Alaïa black crop top and ball skirt combo. The skin-baring top allowed the supermodel to flaunt her toned tummy while she twirled on the red carpet like Lupita Nyong'o. The E! star also Instagrammed a pic from her red carpet debut and captioned it, "I had fun #Cannes." 

The Cannes Film Festival is the ultimate place to see and be seen, with stars coming out in waves to support each other. Kendall landed in Nice and documented her arrival with a sweet snap of herself and bestie, fellow supermodel, Cara Delevingne.She captiond the shot, which shows her taking in the sun (and holding hands!) with Cara D, CaKe in Cannes! I missed you @caradelevingne."Other stars in town for the two-week long festival include Leonardo DiCaprio, Paris Hilton, Jake Gyllenhaal, Emily Blunt and many, many more.
