Amber Rose got a large and intricate new tattoo as she continues to move forward in her independence from Val Chmerkovskiy.

Rose debuted her latest ink of the Hollywood sign in a photo on Instagram on Thursday (Feb. 16, 2017). From the photo, it appears that the design stretches all the way up her forearm. The model already has over a dozen tattoos, including one of two pugs on her left arm.

Her tattoo artist, Nikko Hurtado, also shared a video of the process on his Instagram account.



Working on the very sweet @amberrose yesterday. I’ll post what we did later. Hope everyone had a beautiful Valentine’s Day. Can’t wait to hang with @joannabee3 and the kids. I’m missing them.

The debut of Rose’s tattoo arrives just after she confirmed her breakup from Chmerkovskiy and clarified that her recent public kiss with her ex-husband Wiz Khalifa was just a friendly smooch.
“Wiz and I are family and we will be family for the rest of our lives,” Rose wrote in the caption of a now-deleted Instagram post. “A kiss on the lips for a photo and a fun night out is not a big deal for either of us, we are in a great place but we are very much still divorced and not together.”
She continued, “And to the awesome person I got to spend the past five months with (Chmerkovskiy) broke up due to our own personal reasons but we still love each other’s families even more.”
Chmerkovskiy also issued a statement regarding the end of their courtship.
“We decided to end our relationship a week ago, and did so with humility and understanding. She’s an amazing woman and I feel very lucky to have gotten to know and love [her],” he wrote. An amazing mother, an awesome friend, a loving human period. Reserved, poised, and loyal. To stress that to the more common folk ‘she loyal af.”
