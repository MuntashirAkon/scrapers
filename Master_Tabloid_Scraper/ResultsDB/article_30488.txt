Lady Gaga is giving us nearly a million reasons to take notice of her on-stage sartorial choices.
Because she‚Äôd never step out for a concert without all of the glitz and glamour, the singer kicked off her Joanne world tour in Vancouver with not just one but multiple major fashion and beauty statements, from Swarovski-crystal covered costumes and lips, to a custom Alexander Wang ensemble, a hand painted blazer and even a sleeping bag coat with a 10‚Ä≤ train. And in true Gaga fashion, there were a few wigs ‚Äî and some dramatic eye shadow looks ‚Äî involved as well.

Over 550,000 Swarovski crystals were used across her costumes, makeup and props, according to a release from the brand. One of her most eye-popping looks is a glistening, sheer, long-sleeve, mock neck bodysuit. The star wore it alone, and also layered it under a structured white jacket paired with a huge feathered mask, as well as a long, sparkling silver jacket. On her feet, Gaga wore custom white Giuseppe Zanotti lace-up booties with a crystal ankle strap.

But things only got bigger ‚Äî and better ‚Äî from there. Despite the risk of over-heating on stage, the risk-taker changed into a bold red Norma Kamali ‚Äúsleeping bag‚Äù puffer coat, equipped with a 10-foot-long train, to perform Bloody Mary. She also sported a white fringe¬†Lanotta Studio¬†blazer, which was inscribed with names of her songs, and a ball gown with a massive white tulle skirt.
