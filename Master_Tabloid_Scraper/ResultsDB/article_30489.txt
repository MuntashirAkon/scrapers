The home decor guru previously wrote a book alongside her husband and Fixer Upper costar, Chip Gaines, called The Magnolia Story.
Chip, 42, revealed in May that he was writing a memoir about what it took for him to build his highly successful design business.
“I’ve done so many dumb things in my day that I had enough material to write a book…so I did!” Gaines wrote on Instagram.
The memoir, which will be released this fall, chronicles the trials and triumphs of Gaines’ rise to HGTV fame, promising tales of his “craziest antics and the lessons learned along the way,” according to his and wife Joanna’s Magnolia Market site.
While the release date for Joanna’s book has not been released, Chip’s memoir, Capital Gaines: The Smart Things I Learned By Doing Stupid Stuff is now available for preorder.
