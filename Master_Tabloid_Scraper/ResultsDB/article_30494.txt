Sabrina the Teenage Witch Turns 20: Melissa Joan Hart Looks Back/n
Ready to feel old? Sabrina the Teenage Witch premiered on ABC's T.G.I.F. twenty years ago today!Even Melissa Joan Hart, who starred on the show for seven seasons, said in a Nutrisystem press release that she "honestly can't believe it's been 20 years." The now 40-year-old actress has done a lot since Sabrina premiered back in 1996, but she still has nothing but fond memories fromÂ her time on the show."Sabrina was such a fun character," said Hart, now a married mother of three. "She was always full of surprises."

In a newly released promo for Nutrisystem, the paid spokeswoman reverts to her bewitching character. As she makes an ice cream sandwich appearing out of thin air, she quips, "It looks like I still have the magic touch after all these years."

Melissa now has "a close relationship" with Caroline Rhea and Beth Broderick, the actresses who played Aunt Hilda and Aunt Zelda, but don't ask her to pick a favorite. "That would be awful," she said. "Both the ladies would attack me if I picked one or the other."As for working with Salem Saberhagen, the sarcastic black cat with a penchant for one-liners? Shooting with his character was a bit complicated. "There was a stuffed cat, a live cat, and an animatronic cat," Melissa recalled. "And so depending on what the scene called for, sometimes you'd have all three. So it was always fun, but it was always a challenge. The set smelled like cat food, it was kind of gross. I can't do cats anymore."

Melissa isn't totally sure if she could be Sabrina anymore, either. "There's a lot of talk about a Sabrina reboot," she said. "I feel like almost every day, somebody's calling me about it. Would we do it? Should we do it? How do we do it? I think the thing about reboots is they're really hard to do. They're hard to do right. I think sometimes it's better to just leave it in the past unless you do it really, really great."
