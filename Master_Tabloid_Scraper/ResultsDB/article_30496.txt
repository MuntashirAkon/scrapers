Worst Dressed at the American Music Awards 2016: Bella Thorne, Joan Smalls & More!/n
It's no surprise that the evening's co-host, the always impeccably dressed Gigi Hadid, blew us away with her killer outfit changes (around five designer looks, if you want to get specific). But not everyone in attendance fared so well at this year's AMAs.We can appreciate a fashion risk (particularly with a more millennial-skewing red carpet like this) as much as the next viewer, but let's be clear: There is a difference between pushing the boundaries and crossing a line. (Must we remind you of Britney Spears' and Justin Timberlake's denim-on-denim twinning fiasco of 2001?)

So what qualified as a worst dressed look this year? Take Bella Thorne, for instance. Alone, her all-black pantsuit and bralette combo is a fierce wardrobe choice, but it's the multi-color neon hair that took her look into tacky territory. Joan Smalls usually stuns in the wardrobe department, but her floral maxi dress fell flat. For one, it felt too casual and, quite frankly, out of season. Ill-fitting silhouette aside, it would have been much more appropriate at a springtime garden party rather than on the red carpet in the dead of fall. 

Who else didn't quite get it right? The list goes on....
