Dressed in a flowered black and white dress, with her signature patterned lacy tights and wild head of white hair, the 85-year-old Duchess was flanked by her boy toy husband, Alfonso Díez, 61, who she controversally tied the knot last October.
Her new autobiography Yo Cayetana, is written in her native Spanish and tells her life story from her childhood through great love, personal tragedies, her role as a mother, becoming the head of the House of Alba, and her “last triumph,” marriage to Diez, and according to Amazon.com, all written with the humor and stylish flair that we’ve grown to love.
