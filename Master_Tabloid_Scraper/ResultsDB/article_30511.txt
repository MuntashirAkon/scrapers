Luckily Katie Holmes has nothing to worry about, as although the woman on her husband’s arm definitely likes younger men, the 85-year-old Duchess of Alba is a happily married newlywed.
The Spanish royal and the Hollywood star were an unlikely pair when they walked the red carpet for the Spanish premiere of Cruise’s latest action movie, Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol in Madrid.

Dressed in a furry brown coat and brightly patterned paisley dress, the Duchess, also known as Maria del Rosario Cayetana Alfonso Victoria Eugenia Francisca Fitz-James Stuart y Silva, looked delighted to be basking in the celebrity limelight, but Tom seemed a little less sure about his eccentric side-kick as he smiled politely for the cameras.
The billionaire’s boy toy husband, Alfonso Diez, 61, whom she married in an extragavent wedding last October was also in attendence, standing arm-in-arm with his new bride.
