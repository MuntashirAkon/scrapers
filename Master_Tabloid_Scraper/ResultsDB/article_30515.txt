The FBI said Bulger, who was allegedly the head of Boston’s Winter Hill Gang, played a “role in numerous murders committed from the early 1970s through the mid-1980s in connection with his leadership of an organized crime group that allegedly controlled extortion, drug deals, and other illegal activities.”
The FBI took the 81-year-old and his girlfriend into custody at a Santa Monica apartment building called The Princess Eugenia with no incident Wednesday night. The bureau received a tip on his whereabouts after rolling out a publicity campaign to find him, the FBI’s Steven Martinez told the AP.

Bulger’s girlfriend Catherine Greig, 60, faces charges of harboring a fugitive in her court hearing Thursday.
