CANNES GLAM: Banks Tanks At Poetry Premiere/n
Elizabeth Banks premiered her latest flick, Poetry, at the Cannes Film Festival on Wednesday night, stepping onto the red carpet in an over-the-top gown from the Georges Chakra Spring 2010 Couture collection.  The multi-colored, attention-grabbing number, which featured a short hemline and long flowing train, unfortunately had an underwhelming effect on the stunning star.  She finished the look off with nude heels and Chopard bling.

French actress Clotilde Courau looked fab in a bright white, one-shouldered Lanvin Spring 2010 mini, which has already been worn by Michelle Williams and Kim Cattrall, while Geraldine Pailhas modeled a Lanvin Fall 2010 black number, which looked absolutely divine.
