Getting Into Fashion Week: The Gatecrash/n
     
New York City’s Fashion Week is practically here! Hold on to your Eugenia Kim’s (those are fancy hats, didn’t you know? If not, you must be wearing Eddie Bauer’s—vom!), because the shows this year are white-hot —with attendees who are even whiter and hotter. 
Didn’t get an invite? Not a member of the press? Didn’t blow the Shipley and Halmos boys at the Annex last week when you had the chance? Fret not! There are hundreds of fashionably in-the-know girls and guys just like you who are dying to sneak into the tents at Bryant Park in Manhattan. And to manage, all you need is an YSL Muse-full of chutzpah to attend the best-dressed party in town. In this the first of our three part series How to Sneak Into Fashion Week, we’ve culled together some tips from gate-crash pros to help you secure a place beside the well-heeled, as well as warnings from the beefy guys at Fashion Week’s Citadel Security to keep you from getting too foolhardy. Godspeed, everybody!
