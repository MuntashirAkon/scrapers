Aww! Rosie Huntington-Whiteley & Jason Statham Complement Each Other With Matching Sweats!/n

Not even when she’s passing through LAX have we seen Rosie Huntington-Whiteley look so dressed down!
And yet, when she and beau Jason Statham were out grocery shopping in El Lay on Monday, the supermodel was definitely donning her version of sweats.
Consisting of a tan sweater and jersey skirt, her casual look was nearly complete, though her gold Havainas flip flops made for the finishing touch!
Hey, at least she looks cozy — and maybe it just means she's finally comfortable enough with Jason! Or just that they were planning on spending their date night indoors.
Thoughts???
