Rosie Huntington-Whiteley Makes An Effort To Go Undercover At LAX!/n

Walk that walk, Rosie!!
Miz Huntington-Whiteley arrived at LAX on Wednesday looking like she was on a mission to make her flight…in first class style.
So, we don’t actually know where she was sitting, but with an outfit this classic, we would have been surprised if she didn’t get an upgrade! 
The 26-year-old supermodel was just exuding this cool air with her chic trench coat and wide-brimmed Eugenia Kim fedora. Rosie even paired the duo with a cute, striped tee, black pants, suede ankle boots, and her very fave Givenchy tote!
And to finish it off, all she needed was a simple brushing of her long, golden mane.
She makes it look so easy!
