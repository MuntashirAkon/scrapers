Beyoncé & Jay Z Get Their Basketball On With Seattle Seahawks Quarterback Russell Wilson! Bestiez!/n

Life is amazing right now for Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson! He's srsly on a serbort to success right at this moment!
Not only did he just win the Super Bowl or whatever, he actually got to sit next to Beyoncé and Jay Z at the Brooklyn Nets game against the 76ers!
The trio was spotted at New York City's Barclays Centre, becoming best of friends and laughing the night away. Just a group full of winners right thurrr! In fact, we're digging Bey's Karl Lagerfeld tartan jacket and her black knit Eugenia Kim pom pom beanie! It almost looks like she's wearing adorable Mickey Mouse ears!
It was probably enough to get Russell to completely forget about winning the biggest sports game in sports!
Hell, just looking at the pic is making us forget a whole bunch of stuff!
Does anyone else forget how to math?
