Christina Aguilera Is Tomboy Chic In A Fedora For Charity/n

Feisty!
Christina Aguilera was one of the A-listers at the Hollywood Stands Up To Cancer event yesterday, and she certainly looked the part.
The Voice judge was effortlessly cool in a look reminiscent of her earlier years and a previous episode on her show. We could see her rocking this on TRL back in the day!
Xtina's outfit consisted of a striped Theory button-down, Frame Denim skinnies, and Louboutin platform peep-toe pumps.
She enhanced the ensem with a Eugenia Kim fedora and large Loree Rodkin hoop earrings!
