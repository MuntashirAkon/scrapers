Was Justin Bieber Ready To Reach Out To Tennis Player Who Has A Crush On Him Before Getting Arrested With A DUI??/n

It's not like things had been going well for Justin Bieber BEFORE his DUI arrest, but he still had ONE Belieber who belieb-ed in him!
After earning a big win at the Australian Open, Eugenie Bouchard decided to let the world know she had come down with a SERIOUS case of Bieber Fever!!
Well, before getting in trouble in Miami last night (and being spotted with a mystery girl), apparently, word made it back to The Biebs! And, he was ready to make a house call!
According to sources close to the troublemaking pop star, he was so flattered when the tennis playing cutie named him as her celebrity crush that he wanted to get in touch with her ASAP!!
Whoa! Is there a new couple alert coming up in the near future??
However, we're not exactly sure how Biebsy will find the time since he's been super busy with all of this egging drama and then fleeing to Cuba to smoke some Cuban cigars, and you know, GETTING ARRESTED!
Oh well! One thing we DO know is these two would make some pretty beautiful Canadian babies together!
