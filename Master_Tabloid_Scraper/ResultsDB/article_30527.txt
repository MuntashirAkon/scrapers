First Look at Emma Stone in ‘The Help’ (PHOTOS)/n
Can Emma Stone successfully break away from her “geek lust-object” mold? If these new stills from The Help are anything to go off of, Emma will do just fine being courted by non-nerdy dudes on the big screen.
Emma will play the role of Eugenia “Skeeter” Phelan, a 1960s Southern socialite who starts interviewing poor black women in Jackson, Mississippi about their lives working as maids in rich white households. The film is based on the popular 2009 novel of the same name by Kathryn Stockett. The film is expected to be released on August 12, 2011.
