The last few days have been a whirlwind for Russell Wilson.Just two days after winning the Super Bowl at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, the quarterback found himself sitting courtside at the Brooklyn Nets game next to none other than Beyoncé and Jay-Z.The Seattle Seahawks star seemed relaxed while he chatted with the "Drunk in Love" couple as the Nets beat the Philadelphia 76ers.And Queen Bey took her fashion game to a whole new level with her plaid-on-plaid ensemble.She also managed to look adorable and stay warm in a knit beanie with Eugenia Kim mouse ears.

Yoncé sipped on wine as Jay and Russell did most of the talking throughout the first half of the game.Let's hope Russell's agent was nearby, considering the fact that Jay has been signing numerous athletes onto Roc Nation Sports lately.The "Tom Ford" rapper most recently signed former New York Yankee Robinson Canó to the Seattle Mariners with a reported (and astounding) $240 million contract.Per ESPN, the deal for 31-year-old Canó (which is technically still pending upon him passing a physical) is for 10 years and boasts a full no-trade clause. In addition to Canó, Roc Nation Sports' short but impressive client roster includes NBA star Kevin Durant, WNBA star Skylar Diggins, New York Jets quarterback Geno Smith and the New York Giants' Victor Cruz.
