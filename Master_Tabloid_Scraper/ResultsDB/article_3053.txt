FYI: Victoria's Secret bodies aren't just born that way—they are made…with a whole lot of discipline and dedication, that is.On top of a restrictive diet, many beauties sculpt their way to runway-worthy bodies at the gym. And, according to first-time angel Josephine Skriver, at least 10 VS models go hard at The Dogpound in NYC.E! News caught up with the stunner and fellow angel Jasmine Tookes as they show us how working out together keeps them motivated. It's all about the buddy system, guys. 

"It makes it a team," Josephine said. "Like you'll group text: ‘Who's working out today?' And it's super motivating because there's always someone hounding at you, [saying] ‘You can do it! Come on with me.' So it's fun!"Josephine, Jasmine and trainer Kirk Meyers shared model-approved moves you can do with your best bud in the comfort of your local gym or, even better, at home during Bachelorette commercials.

"The hardest thing is getting off your couch!" Jasmine advised.The dynamic duo also shared two easy arm moves that make an impact.

Bicep CurlsFor an easy bicep workout, try lifting dumbbells: "Bring them up and curl and squeeze at the top," said Kirk. Do 15 on each side for a total of 30."I used to hate arm workouts because I wouldn't want to do upper body but now I like it," added Josephine.

Tricep Dips"Tricep dips are great if you want to see that horse shoe on the back of your arms," Kirk said. "You're going to get your butt as close to the bench and go down and up in counts of four. Breathe at the top."No one said looking pretty was easy!
