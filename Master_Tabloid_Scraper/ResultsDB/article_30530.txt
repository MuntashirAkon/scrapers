The CFDA Awards may not be televised this year, but don't worry, we got you covered.The Council of Fashion Designers of America Awards (otherwise known as the Academy Awards of the fashion world) took place tonight at Hammerstein Ballroom in New York City for the first time, and although fans of the annual event were not able to witness all of it's high-fashion beauty on the small screen, we're here to give you all the details on who took home an award.As previously noted, these awards highlight individuals who have shaped American fashion "from all areas of the industry and related arts," the Council of Fashion Designers of America's site explains, "with awards being given for design excellence in womenswear, menswear, and accessories as well as extraordinary accomplishments in journalism, creative vision, and lifetime achievement."Tonight's ceremony was led by funnyman Joel McHale, who served as the host for the show. The choice to have McHale host the CFDA Awards initially confused some, since he's not necessarily known for being a fan of fashion, but Steven Kolb, chief executive of the CFDA, said having someone "outside of the fashion industry" would "keep the night lively, topical and unexpected."Sounds about right.
