The 53-year-old Los Kumbia Kings singer reportedly has eight children, and it is still unclear just how much Child Support he owes.
A mugshot of the musician was displayed along with his information, yet Abraham has not turned himself in, according to People Chica, and so the search continues.
As Radar can report, the late Selena was shot to death in 1995 during one of her outdoor concerts in Corpus Christi. Her brother Abraham was part of her musical group: Selena y Los Dinos.
