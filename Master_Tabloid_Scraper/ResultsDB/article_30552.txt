Final Fight! Amber & Matt Battle In ‘Marriage Boot Camp,’ Go Separate Ways/n
As RadarOnline.com first reported, Amber Portwood and Matt Baier attempted to mend their broken relationship by filming Marriage Boot Camp in Los Angeles last month. But the last-ditch effort didn’t work.
RadarOnline.com can exclusively reveal that the Teen Mom OG former couple fought bitterly while in the Boot Camp house, and Baier even left filming early! Now, the 27-year-old mom is in her native Indiana, while the father of nine, 46, still hasn’t returned back to her home.
“They went their separate ways,” a source told Radar, adding that after months of back and forth, the couple “is definitely broken up.”

As Radar reported, Portwood accused Baier of stealing thousands of dollars from her on the Teen Mom OG reunion on Monday night, though her ex vehemently denied the claims.
The split began when Baier failed a lie detector test, including a question about him hitting on another woman. She later called him a “pathological liar.”
Of course, Radar first exposed Baier’s lies soon after the couple began dating in 2014. Though he said he had only two children, Radar discovered that he actually hid at least nine secret kids from his girlfriend. Also, despite telling Portwood that he had never seen Teen Mom before, Radar exposed his desperate tweets to Jenelle Evans and Farrah Abraham.
