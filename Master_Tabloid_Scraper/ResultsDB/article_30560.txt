Farrah Abraham Is Trying TOO Hard At The MTV VMAs!/n

Farrah Abraham is trying to pull off these boots!
SO hard!
The Teen Mom 2 star arrived to the MTV VMAs in Los Angeles on Sunday night, showing off her curves in a structured white top, matching pants, and those metallic knee-high boots.
It almost looks like she's channeling the Spaceman or a hot alien, but not in a good way!
Sorry, girl.
P.S. Her daughter was cute, though (above)!
