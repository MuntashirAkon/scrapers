Selena's Brother Is A Top 10 Most Wanted Fugitive!/n

So sad!
The August Top 10 Most Wanted list for Nueces County, Texas was released this week, and it has a name on it that breaks our hearts â€” Abraham Quintanilla.
That's right, A.B. Quintanilla, the brother of late legendary Tejano singer Selena Quintanilla, is a most wanted man in Corpus Christi.

There is a warrant out for the arrest of the 53-year-old, who used to perform with his sister as part of Los Dinos and later formed groups Los Kumbia Kings and Kumbia All Starz, for contempt of court and felony unpaid child support.
See the Nueces County Sheriff's Office wanted poster (below): 

A.B. was apparently first charged back in 2015, but it seems he never did pay up. Local network KZTV reports the father of eight now owes $87,000 in back child support!
Totally unacceptable!
