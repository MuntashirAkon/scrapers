Did Johnny Depp learn nothing from Kathy Griffin?

Like the comedienne before him, the Pirates of the Caribbean star made a joke about killing President Donald Trump that got the public all riled up. While speaking to the crowd at the Glastonbury Festival Thursday (June 22, 2017), the 54-year-old started talking about the Commander-in-Chief, musing, “I think he needs help, and there are a lot of wonderful dark, dark places he could go.”
“When was the last time an actor assassinated a president?” he asked.





Though Johnny made it seem like he was referring to Abraham Lincoln’s death after he was shot by John Wilkes Booth in 1865, his remarks received a few boos from the audience.
“It is just a question — I’m not insinuating anything,” he quipped. “By the way, this is going to be in the press. It will be horrible.”
Following the incident, the White House issued a statement about the actor’s comment, saying, “President Trump has condemned violence in all forms and it’s sad that others like Johnny Depp have not followed his lead. I hope that some of Mr. Depp’s colleagues will speak out against this type of rhetoric as strongly as they would if his comments were directed to a Democrat elected official.”
Johnny since apologized for his action. “I apologize for the bad joke I attempted last night in poor taste about President Trump,” he told People in a statement of his own. “It did not come out as intended, and I intended no malice. I was only trying to amuse, not to harm anyone.”
