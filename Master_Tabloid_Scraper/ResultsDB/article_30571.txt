Simon Saran Accuses ‘Teen Mom’ Producer of Giving Ryan Edwards Drugs/n
Was Teen Mom OG the reason why Maci Bookout’s ex, Ryan Edwards, turned to drugs?

Just after Ryan checked himself into rehab for an addiction problem, Simon Saran — Farrah Abraham’s loudmouthed on again, off again boyfriend — made some startling allegations about the reality star’s drug problem. According to him, a Teen Mom producer had been secretly supplying the 29-year-old with pills during production.
Via Teen Mom Talk Now:
On June 5th, Simon tweeted, “I wonder if I should talk about kili giving Ryan pills during shoots or save that for another day?” He then corrected his tweet with “Kiki*.”
“Kiki,” as Simon referred to her, is co-executive producer Kirsten Malone.
Kiki has been with MTV since 2009; she’s worked on 16 & Pregnant, Teen Mom OG, Teen Mom 2 as well as other TV shows and even some films.
