Farrah Abraham may be heading down the aisle soon!

Wedding rumors after the Teen Mom OG star was pictured in a photograph that suggested a marriage proposal had taken place. Shared by on-and-off boyfriend Simon Saran, the romantic snap featured Abraham as she enjoyed a candlelit dinner surrounded by twinkle lights formed in the shape of a heart. The fact that the 26-year-old was clad in white didn’t help to dispel speculations either!

This picture, posted on Simon’s snapchat, is pretty much everything you would expect from a proposal picture. Check out that romantic beachfront view, the heart in the sand, roses, dinner by candlelight … What more could you want to pop the question?
