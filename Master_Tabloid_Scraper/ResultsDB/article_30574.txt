Amber Portwood won’t say no to doing porn yet.

The Teen Mom OG star is seriously thinking of venturing out into the adult film world after Vivid Entertainment offered her a deal to star in a sex tape with her 46-year-old fiancé, Matt Baier.
“It’s in consideration. I still have not made up my mind,” the 26-year-old tells E! News. “I am not strapped for cash. I have a nice house, a nice life. I have everything I need. But I’m a business person.”
She continues, “Right now I’m weighing the pros and cons. I’ve called most of my family and they told me they love me no matter what.”

Baier, who recently postponed his fall wedding with the mom-of-one amid cheating allegations, confirms they have received an offer for $85,000 and 35 percent of all of the net revenues for the NSFW movie.
“We are considering it, we look at all offers,” he says, adding the chances of them actually taking the deal are “slim.”
Back in 2013, Portwood blasted castmate Farrah Abraham for starring in two sex tape, which were both distributed by Vivid Entertainment. Now, Abraham thinks it’s “sad” that Portwood is thinking of making her own adult film.
“They hope to follow in footsteps of mine, the envy of them wanting to be me never fails,” she tells Us Weekly. “I doubt doing a sex tape at 26 is the right direction. It’s sad how hard Amber tries to be me.”
