Farrah Abraham Finally Sells Hollywood Hills House, But Takes a Loss/nFarrah AbrahamÂ flipped her house after a year of trying ... and might be flipping out over the money she lost in the deal. The reality star sold her 4 bed, 4 bath, 2 story townhouse in the Hollywood Hills for $860,000 ... after changing the asking price at least 3 times. Problem is, she bought it in April 2016 for $845k and plunked down about $100k in renovations. As we reported ... Farrah tried to sell the home for $950k just months after moving in but didn't have any takers, so she kept dropping the price until it was listed back at what she bought it for -- $845k. Bright side -- she got a little more than that ... but she'll probably want to avoid the real estate game from now on./n
