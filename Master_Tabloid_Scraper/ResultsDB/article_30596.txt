Johnny Depp Makes Controversial Joke About Assassinating President Trump/nJohnny Depp apparently didn't learn a damn thing from Kathy Griffin ... he just went and made a joke about killing President Trump. Depp was speaking to a crowd at the Glastonbury Festival Thursday when he starting talking Trump, saying ...  "I think he needs help. " Then he asked the crowd ...  "When was the last time an actor assassinated a president? " The crowd's reaction -- mostly cheers, but Depp still attempted to backpedal a little bit from his clear reference to John Wilkes Booth killing Abraham Lincoln in 1865. We're guessing Depp can expect a call from the Secret Service ... stat. His comments would be controversial at any time, but especially now ... just weeks after Griffin went through the wringer./n
