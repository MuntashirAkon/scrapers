Victoria's Secret Model Takes a Pounding In Heavy Surf/nVictoria's Secret model Josephine Skriver got smashed from behind when she underestimated the power of the ocean during a recent photo shoot in St. Barths. The video is awesome from the very start -- Josephine rolling in the sand, ass in the air -- but gets even better when she decides to wash that sand out of her nether regions. Watch, you won't be disappointed when the surf takes aim at Josephine. It's alright to laugh ... her tiny frame held up just fine.  At least she got the sand out./n
