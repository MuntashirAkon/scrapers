Scott Disick -- Regular Club Appearances Suck ... I'm Doing Strip Clubs Now!/nScott Disick has earned the nickname  "The Lord " for pulling off this move ... he's graduated from doing plain ol' clothed club appearances ... to getting paid a fortune to show up at a strip club!  Yes, instead of being the one to fork over the cash, Scott will actually be the one making it -- presumably not in wrinkled up singles. The  "Keeping Up with the Kardashians " star will score $50,000 to headline at the Crazy Horse in Pompano Beach, Florida on April 25. We're told the club will fly him out first class, put him up in a hotel suite, and pay for his meals at a restaurant that favors steak, not chicken wings. This club is no stranger to reality stars -- they've got  "Teen Mom " star Farrah Abraham headlining later this month.  /n
