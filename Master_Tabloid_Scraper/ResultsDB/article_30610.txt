Wiz Khalifa -- Banging Playboy Chick Turns Into Six Figure Sex Tape Offer/nWiz Khalifa's got a lot of problems -- about six figures worth -- the Playboy model he banged last week is close to cashing in big time on a sex tape ... but there's just one hang up.Our porn sources tell us vixen Carla Howe is very close to making a deal with Steve Hirsch at Vivid Entertainment. Carla's totally down to sell the footage for the right price. Problem is ... if Wiz doesn't sign off ... Vivid can't release the porno.TMZ broke the story ... Wiz and Carla hooked up last week, took a bunch of pics, and -- she says -- shot footage of their bang sesh. Wiz admits doing the deed, but claims he had no idea it was being recorded. We're told Carla's footage shows Wiz looking right into her lens, and shooting with his own phone camera. It's possible, we guess, he doesn't remember -- dude smokes kush like a chimney.   But it makes no diff -- sources close to Wiz tell us he's not interested in the sex tape going public. Then again ... everyone has their price, and Hirsch has a great track record with sex tapes ... said Kim Kardashian, Ray J, Farrah Abraham, Mimi and Nikko./n
