Horrible good luck being negative #Godbless busy making TV. " Nicki wasn't done ...  "Your mother didn't open her legs and have the child. Be happy she's helping! Stop talking to her like that on tv u lil c*** ". In your case #BIGC*** " Instead of dragging your mother, learn the difference between 'you're " &  "your', ding bat. " Farrah ended the convo with this ...  "You must really want attention--talk about women with respect - it's Sunday stop watching reruns & go to church. To be clear my mom doesn't help me i help her. I love & care for my mom. Stop disgusting talk @Nickiminaj. " Easiest story to write ... ever.     / //n
