Farrah Abraham Fires Shot at Kardashians with a Ray J Assist /nFarrah Abraham is ready to take on anyone who wants a piece of her (and not in the porn sense) -- because she fired off a helluva comeback at Kendall Jenner.  Kendall took the opening shot on Wednesday night's debut episode of Khloe Kardashian's show,  "Kocktails with Khloe. " When Farrah's recent beef with Nicki Minaj came up ... she ripped Farrah for her  "decisions in life. "  Check it out ... Khloe and co. had some laughs, especially with Snoop's Farrah impersonation. But then Farrah dropped this meme bomb -- a Kardashian /Jenner family pic (vintage with Lamar and Bruce) ... with Ray J photoshopped over them. The caption, giving props to Ray's famous junk, is straight outta the comeback hall of fame. Which should definitely be a thing./n
