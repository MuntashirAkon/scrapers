Sylvester Stallone -- Bollywood 'Rambo' Actor Is BUFFER Than I Was/nSylvester Stallone says he's flattered that Bollywood is gunning to remake  "Rambo " ... telling TMZ the guy rumored to play the lead role is way more RIPPED than he ever was. Sly -- who's still in pretty damn good shape -- was leaving Cafe Roma in Bev Hills this weekend when he told us he was  "flattered " by reports that Indian actor John Abraham would take over the role.  "Actually, he's built better than I ever was, " Stallone told us. FYI -- Abraham is a 40-year-old former model who's become a huge action star in Bollywood ... but in better shape than Stallone?? He was pretty jacked in  "Rocky 4. "/n
