Does Disgraced Fox News CEO Roger Ailes Have A Secret Love Child?/n
Was former Fox News CEO Roger Ailes hiding illegitimate children before his sudden death? RadarOnline.com has learned Ailes’ will alludes to the possibility of other kids out there.
As Radar reported, Ailes, who was busy fighting a whirlwind of sexual assault allegations from former staffers, died May 18 after a fall at his Palm Beach, Florida mansion.
In his will, he left most of his reported $100 million fortune in a trust for his wife Elizabeth and 17-year-old son Zachary.
But wording in the will is raising questions about whether Zachary is really Roger’s only heir.

“I give and bequeath such property in equal shares to those of my children who survive me,” the will reads, according to The Daily Mail. “Or all to the survivor if only one of them survives me.”
Elizabeth was Roger’s third wife. According to Roger’s last wishes, she’ll receive a substantial check every three months for the rest of her life.
But the vast majority of his fortune will eventually go to Zachary, who gets full control of his father’s money when he turns 36.
For now, the teen will receive $250,000 along with his father’s personal items.

The will came to light when the former NBC journalist petitioned a Palm Beach County judge to be appointed executor of his estate.
In addition to administrative duties, that would give her the authority to “compromise, settle, submit to arbitration or release any claim in favor of or against” her dead husband.
