Who will welcome Jay-Z and Beyoncé into Hollywood’s exclusive parents-of-twins club now that they’ve announced that they’re expecting two more children?

It could be Zoe Saldana and Chris Hemsworth, or Roger Federer, who has two sets of twins with his wife, Mirka. However, it was Real Housewives of Atlanta star Kim Zolciak-Biermann — mom to twins Kaia and Kane — who, out of all them, first congratulated Bey-Z on social media on Wednesday afternoon (Feb. 1, 2017).
