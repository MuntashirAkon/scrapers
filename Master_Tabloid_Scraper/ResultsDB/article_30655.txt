Megyn Kelly is leaving Fox News for NBC News after joining the network 12 years ago.

NBC announced on Tuesday (Jan. 3, 2017) that in her new role at the network, Kelly will host her own daytime news program, anchor a Sunday night news show, and partake in “special political programming and other breaking news coverage.” Andrew Lack, Chairman of the NBCUniversal News Group sent out a statement confirming Kelly’s move. “Megyn is an exceptional journalist and news anchor, who has had an extraordinary career,” Lack said. “She’s demonstrated tremendous skill and poise, and we’re lucky to have her.”
The journalist shared a statement of her own on Facebook, in which she said, “I will greatly miss my colleagues at Fox.”

Fox News chairman Rupert Murdoch wished Kelly the best of luck on her new endeavor. “We thank Megyn Kelly for her 12 years of contributions to FOX News,” said Murdoch in a statement. “We hope she enjoys tremendous success in her career and wish her and her family all the best.”
Kelly’s last day on her show, The Kelly File, will be on Friday (Jan. 6, 2017).

In August of 2015, Kelly was the target of a long series of verbal attacks made by Donald Trump after the first GOP debate.
In July, former Fox News Chairman and CEO Roger Ailes resigned after Gretchen Carlson, a former Fox News anchor, filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against him. Kelly wrote about being sexually harassed by Ailes in her memoir, Settle for More, though Ailes has denied all of these claims entirely.
