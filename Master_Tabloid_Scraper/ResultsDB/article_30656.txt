Like many Hollywood stars, Steve Martin took to social media this week to pay tribute to Carrie Fisher, who passed away Tuesday after suffering a massive heart attack at the age of 60. However, unlike his contemporaries, his tribute was not welcomed by fans.

The comedian receive backlash for writing in a now-deleted tweet, “When I was a young man, Carrie Fisher was the most beautiful creature I had ever seen. She turned out to be witty and bright as well.”
Some Twitter users were quick to label Martin a misogynist, accusing the actor of focusing on Fisher’s looks and beauty rather than her work as an actress, writer and mental health advocate.

Seriously @SteveMartinToGo quit being such a jerk for thinking Carrie Fisher was beautiful and saying so on the occasion of her death…

@jbennett0121 @TheCut Tasteless because he thought she was pretty? That is SJW crazy…

What’s worse? One of your favourites tweeting something sexist or being dead? (Seeing Steve Martin in my news ticker had me jump!)

Steve Martin’s tweet about Carrie Fisher is extremely bad https://t.co/if7QV6Ow3b

Though Martin did cave and eventually removed the tweet, some people thought the tribute was “sweet” and a “compliment” to Fisher’s legacy.

I would give away all my toes for Steve Martin to compliment me the way he complimented Carrie Fisher.

Yeah.
 Good job, Internet.
 Let’s go after Steve Martin.
 Clearly he’s a sexist and needs to be villainized.
Morons.

Carrie Fisher in “Star Wars” was both lovely and badass. That’s why we men of a certain age all had a crush on her. Leave Steve Martin alone

On Wednesday (Dec. 28, 2016), Fisher’s ex-husband, Paul Simon, tweeted his reaction to the passing of his former spouse. The singer, who married Fisher in 1983 after six years of dating, stayed in touch with Fisher after their divorce and, at one point, even resumed their relationship.
“Carrie was a special, wonderful girl,” he wrote. “It’s too soon.”

“Yesterday was a horrible day. Carrie was a special, wonderful girl. It’s too soon.”
-Paul Simon

Simon penned the songs “Heart and Bones” and “She Moves On” about his relationship with the Star Wars icon.
Fisher, who never remarried, wrote about her ex in Wishful Drinking, “If you can get Paul Simon to write a song about you, do it. Because he is so brilliant at it.”
