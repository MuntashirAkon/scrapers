Roger Federer’s Identical Twins (Both Pairs!) Cheer Him on to Record 8th Wimbledon Win/n

Roger Federer had a full support system looking on from the stands as he took home his eighth Wimbledon men’s singles championship on Sunday.
The Swiss tennis star, 35, defeated Marin Cilic in three straight sets,  6-3, 6-1, 6-4. The win gives Federer the record for the most men’s titles in the history of the event, edging out Pete Sampras and William Renshaw, who each won seven titles at Wimbledon.
“It’s disbelief that I can achieve such heights,” Federer said after his match, according to ESPN. “I wasn’t sure if I was ever going to be here, in another final.”
