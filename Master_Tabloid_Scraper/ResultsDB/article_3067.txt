Madonna: I Exposed the Right Left Breast ... No Criminal Charges /nA 17-year-old whose breast was exposed during a Madonna concert in Australia could have gotten the singer in some serious legal trouble, but turns out Madonna's instincts were good. Josephine Georgiou was pulled onstage at Madonna's Brisbane concert Thursday night and without warning the singer yanked Josephine's top, exposing her left breast to the audience.  There's an Australian criminal law that prohibits anyone from touching a woman's breasts, even over clothing. Australian authorities tell TMZ, they would only go after Madonna if the alleged victim complains, and Josephine thinks what Madonna did was awesome.   Josephine, who appears to be an aspiring model, says,  "Seriously, why would I sue Madonna for the best moment of my life? " BTW, the age of consent in Australia is 16, although the indecent assault law applies to minors and adults.  And one more thing ... if you type  "Josephine " in Google this morning, it autofills her last name as one of the top results./n
