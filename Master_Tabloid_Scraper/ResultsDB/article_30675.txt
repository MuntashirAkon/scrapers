Roger Dodger/n
Life's just full of surprises. Who'd expect a movie about a rogue and his horny teenage nephew to be so good? Yet Dylan Kidd's frosh outing as a writer-director is just that, thanks to Kidd's refreshingly honest script and the gifted Campbell Scott (George C.'s kid) as the eponymous lead. Scott's Roger is handsome, witty, smart and too bitter for his own good.

 So when his callow nephew (Jesse Eisenberg) comes to town unexpectedly, he takes it upon himself to help his young protégé look for love in all the wrong places (Jennifer Beals and Elizabeth Berkley fill in as hot-babe targets). The results are often funny, more frequently poignant. You can't help but like Roger, even if he is wholly an A-hole. Better yet, the nice guys don't finish last here. Okay, so maybe the script isn't totally honest, but Roger's still worth a whirl.
