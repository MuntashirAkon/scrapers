Roger Ebert Critiques Recovery/n
      Roger Ebert is giving his road to recovery two thumbs up.            Two months after undergoing surgery to remove a cancerous growth on his salivary gland, the veteran movie reviewer posted a letter of progress on his Website Thursday, telling fans that while he has been bed-ridden since July 1, he is nevertheless anxious to return to work.            "I have always believed in full disclosure," he wrote. "When I announced that I had a recurrence of salivary cancer that required surgery, I had no idea when I went into the hospital on June 16 that I would still be here on August 16."            The 64-year-old TV personality underwent surgery in Chicago's Northwestern Hospital two months ago when doctors removed the growth, as well as a section of bone, from Ebert's right jaw.             The Chicago Sun-Times critic was only expected to stay in the hospital until July 1, but as he was preparing to be discharged, a blood vessel burst and he was readmitted.             Ebert says the rupture was due to weakened tissue around the artery, caused by a series of particularly intense radiation treatments he underwent three years ago after doctors removed malignant tumors from his thyroid and salivary glands.            While doctors are making headway in Ebert's recovery, he nevertheless writes that he has been kept in a hospital bed for nearly seven weeks and has been fitted with a tracheostomy collar to ease breathing during his surgeries, the most recent of which took place Aug. 6.            Shortly after the operation took place, Ebert's wife, Chaz, took to the Internet, posting her frustrations with the "non-linear" progress and treatment.            "Darn that surgery! Please excuse me if I don't sound like my usual cheerleader self, but if you had seen him last week, even yesterday, when he was doing so well. We were secretly back to using his computer. He wanted to surprise everyone with messages."            It apparently didn't take long.            Ebert seconded that things were taking longer than he'd like, but said he and his medical team remained positive about the progress he's made so far.             "As you can imagine, it is no fun being hospitalized this long," he wrote. "This is a unique situation and the doctors are moving cautiously, but they are enthusiastically optimistic about my recovery.            "I am a lucky man."            While still in the hospital, Ebert has already begun rehabilitation, in the form of physical therapy, regular chats with friends--via scrawled messages only, as the tube in his throat as yet prevents him from speaking--and, proving old habits die hard, catching up on new releases thanks to a specially installed plasma TV and DVD player in his hospital room.            "I am happy to report that despite all, I am doing well," he said, tempering the message by adding "while I believe in full disclosure, I also need the time and privacy to heal.            "I don't have a crystal ball, so I can't tell you when, but I sure look forward to being back on the movie beat."            In the meantime, there's been no shortage of seat-fillers.             Earlier this month, Jay Leno and Kevin Smith separately substituted for the ailing critic, while AMC's Movie Club host John Ridley is set to take over this weekend.            And that may not be the last of the thumb lenders. Fred Willard and Aisha Tyler are both reportedly in talks to guest host.
