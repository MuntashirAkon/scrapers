Roger Moore Knighted/n
    Roger Moore loyally served on Her Majesty's Secret Service for many years, now the former 007 has been rewarded on another royal roster.       Moore became Sir  Roger Saturday as Queen Elizabeth II doled out her annual honors to  outstanding Britons.                 Moore, who played James Bond in seven movies, including Octopussy and A View to a Kill, was        knighted for his charity work and not for his derring-do or        martini-making abilities.                "I am so proud to be the recipient of this great honor," said the        75-year-old Moore. "I am doubly proud because this is an acknowledgment        of UNICEF, the United Nations Children's Fund, an organization I am        honored to work for as an international goodwill ambassador."                The tribute is a morale booster for the former sexy secret-agent who        was shaken and maybe a little stirred after collapsing three months ago        during a Broadway performance of The Play What I Wrote. Moore        was later fitted for a        pacemaker and went on to attend a UNICEF benefit dinner just days        after being discharged from the hospital.                The awards, bestowed on the queen's birthday, are given to everyone        from show-biz stars, like Moore, and business leaders, such as Body Shop        founder Anita Roddick, to ordinary citizens who perform extraordinary        work. In total, 509 of the U.K.'s best and brightest made the Birthday        Honors list, selected both by the public and the government.                 Other celebs honored Saturday include Gosford Park's Helen Mirren, who        became a dame (the female equivalent of a knight). While American movie        audiences may hold the stinker Teaching Mrs. Tingle against the British thesp, the two-time Oscar nominee is revered in her home land as a serious actress.                Further down on the honor scale was the English Patient's Kristin Scott Thomas,        who was named an Officer of the British Empire.                Recipients of the honors CBE, MBE and OBE, or Commander of the British        Empire, Member of the Order of British Empire and Officer of the        British Empire, have no title but can use the letters after their        names.                 Meanwhile, Sting expressed himself "surprised and flattered" when he was made a CBE. Former Pink Floyd guitarist Dave Gilmour was also        dubbed a CBE for donating $5.9 million to a charity that benefits the        homeless.                 Other honorable rockers include Gerry Marsden, of the '60s pop group Gerry and the        Pacemakers, and Errol Brown, lead singer with the '70s band Hot        Chocolate, who were both made MBEs.                Others in line for royal kudos were MBE noms TV's Naked Chef Jamie Oliver  and actor Jim Dale, who lent his voice to the Harry        Potter books on tape.
