Madonna: 'Breast Girl' Back for More/nThe girl whose breast Madonna exposed at an Australian concert was back ... sitting front and center as the singer called her out ... again. 17-year-old Josephine Georgiou and her mom were 600 miles from Brisbane -- where the teen saw Madonna last week -- for her concert Sunday in Sydney. Madonna stopped the show to heap compliments on Josephine, who said the Brisbane prank was the best moment of her life. Check out the video. It sure feels like Josephine is a plant, and knew what was up when Madonna grabbed her top last week.Â /n
