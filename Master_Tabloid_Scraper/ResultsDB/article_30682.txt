Michael Irvin: Cowboys Players Get Wrong Kind of Special Treatment/nMichael Irvin says the  "special treatment " the Dallas Cowboys get from the NFL is the kind of special treatment  "you don't want " -- because their high profile status makes them big, fat targets.  We started off talking about Ezekiel Elliott and asked #88 if thinks the RB will get suspended as a result of the domestic violence investigation.  That's when our guy asked if Cowboys players will sometimes get a pass from Commish Roger Goodell because they're  "America's Team. "  "A pass?! " Irvin said ...  "The kind of special treatment the Cowboys get is the kind of special treatment you don't want. "  Irvin added that players on other teams can sometimes screw up and fly under the radar -- but if you're a Cowboy, you're always on thin ice. /n
