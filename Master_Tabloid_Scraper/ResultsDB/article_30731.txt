The Vampire Diaries alum is dating Glen Powell, according to People.
The couple sparked romance rumors when they were seen kissing in the photo booth at Julianne Hough’s wedding to hockey player Brooks Laich this weekend. In several silly shots, Nina and Glen, both 28, cozied up and touched tongues for the camera.
