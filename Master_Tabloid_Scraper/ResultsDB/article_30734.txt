Congratulations are in order!

Ronda Rousey is engaged to UFC fighter Travis Browne after almost two years of dating.
The couple, who first met four years ago when they became teammates at the Glendale Fighting Club in Los Angeles, told TMZ the proposal happened a week ago while they were vacationing together in New Zealand. According to Browne, he popped the question under a waterfall because “it felt like the right place to do it.”
Rousey added their nuptials will be “soon,” though she admittedly has no idea “what goes on in planning a wedding.”
While it may be Rousey’s first walk down the aisle, this will be the second marriage for Browne. He shares two sons — Kaleo and Keawe — with ex-wife Erin Browne.
