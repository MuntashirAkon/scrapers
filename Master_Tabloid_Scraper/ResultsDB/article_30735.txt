President Donald Trump made a grave error on Wednesday (Feb. 8, 2017) when he failed to run his tweet that referred to an “easy D” by a millennial before he sent it.

Trump wrote in the tweet, “Big increase in traffic into our country from certain areas, while our people are far more vulnerable, as we wait for what should be EASY D!”


Big increase in traffic into our country from certain areas, while our people are far more vulnerable, as we wait for what should be EASY D!

He did not and still hasn’t elaborated on what the “D” was meant to refer to — some say “decision,” some say “defeat” — so the collective mind of Twitter took it to the dirty place that we all have in the back of our minds. Yes, there were penis jokes and, of them, there were plenty.


SPICER: I can't do it. There's no way to make "easy D" sound presidential.
