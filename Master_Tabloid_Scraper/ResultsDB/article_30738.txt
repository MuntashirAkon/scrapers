According to Us Weekly, Yeun and a pregnant Pak were spotted on a lunch date on Monday (Dec. 6, 2016) in Los Angeles, looking casual in sweats.
The couple tied the knot at the Paramour Estate in Los Angeles. Pak’s sister, Kayce, posted a sweet pic of the two on Instagram.



Getting to celebrate the love between these two, last night, along with all their friends and family was so beautiful and special!! This whole week has been an awesome, family-filled, fun time and it’s been so great! (We’ve also gained a brother in-law from it!) #loveyouguys #pakpack
