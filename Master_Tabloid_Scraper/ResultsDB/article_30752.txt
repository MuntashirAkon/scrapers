Mean Girls is the movie that keeps on giving. If you celebrate October 3, can quote every line, and are still saving up for two Fendi purses and a silver Lexus, you're living your best life. Oh, and the actor who played the beloved Glen Coco totally approves of your obsession.Â David Reale, despite moving on from Mean Girls with tons of other roles, says he's still all about the love and attention Glen Coco has brought him. According to Daily Mail, David got the part of Glen almost by accident. He was hanging around the set after not getting the original role he auditioned for and was asked to play Glen Coco instead. Honestly, best decision of his life, right?Even though we only see the back of his head, everybody knows Glen Coco is just as iconic as Cady, Regina, Aaron and the gang. In fact, he might even be more iconic since we know so little about him. Hmm...could there be a Glen Coco spin-off? That probably would have been a lot better than most people's opinions of Mean Girls 2. Just saying.
