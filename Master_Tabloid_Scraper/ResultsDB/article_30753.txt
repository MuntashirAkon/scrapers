Glen Campbell Jail Bound/n
       The Rhinestone Cowboy has been saddled with jail time.              Glen Campbell was sentenced Tuesday to 10 days in jail following last month's guilty plea of extreme drunken driving and leaving the scene of an accident.              He had been scheduled to appear in court Monday, but the sentencing was delayed a day so he could perform Sunday at the CMA Music Festival in Nashville.              Campbell, who begins his sentence July 1, will be allowed out of jail each day for 12 hours for work furlough.               He has also been fined $900, placed on probation for two years and ordered to serve 75 hours of community service as part of his plea agreement.               The country-music singer was busted last November following a minor hit-and-run accident in suburban Phoenix when he slammed his BMW into a Toyota Camry at an intersection and then sped away.              An eagle-eyed witness ID'd Campbell for the cops, who caught up with him at his affluent Biltmore Estates home.              Campbell failed a Breathalyzer test, exceeding Arizona's legal limit of 0.08 percent with a 0.2 blood-alcohol level, and was taken into custody where, after a rather grim mug shot was taken, the entertainer allegedly kneed a sergeant in the thigh.              A related charge of aggravated assault was later dropped.              The 67-year-old, who blamed the accident on a mix of booze and prescription antianxiety drugs, originally pleaded innocent last December but changed his tune to score the current slap-on-the-wrist sentence.               The Arkansas-born Campbell, an Arizona resident for the last 20 years, is best known for hits such as Rhinestone Cowboy, Galveston, Gentle on My Mind and By the Time I Get to Phoenix.          In related news Tuesday, Campbell was announced as one of the celebrity mourners--along with Stevie Wonder, Willie Nelson, B.B. King and Clint Eastwood--slated to attend Ray Charles' funeral in Los Angeles this Friday. Campbell and Charles recorded together.
