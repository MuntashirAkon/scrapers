Everything a man could ever need is his family, his friends and, in Glen Campbell's case, his fans as well.In the twilight of what can only be described as a well-lived life, the "Rhinestone Cowboy" singer has revealed that he has Alzheimer's disease.

In an interview with People, Campbell, 75, and his wife, Kim, talked about his decision to go public with the memory-sapping condition because the county music legend plans to stage a series of swan-song performances this fall and wants fans to understand what ails him."Glen is still an awesome guitar player and singer," Kim told the magazne. "But if he flubs a lyric or gets confused on stage, I wouldn't want people to think, 'What's the matter with him? Is he drunk?' "Before he rides off into the sunset of a remarkable career that has seen him sell 45 million albums, win four Grammys and host his own variety show, The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour on CBS, Campbell said he wanted to perform live while his mind's still intact as a farewell to all those who've supported him over the years.The crooner plans to release on Aug. 30 his final album, Ghost on the Canvas, which features new songs penned by such music stars as Paul Westerberg, Jakob Dylan, Robert Pollard and Campbell himself. Additionally, noted musicians such as Chris Isaac, Billy Corgan, Brian Setlzer, Rick Nielsen and the Dandy Warhols also make contributions to the record."I still love making music," said Campbell. "And I still love performing for my fans. I'd like to thank them for sticking with me through thick and thin."Godspeed, Glen.
