Glen Campbell Says He's Innocent/n
        The Rhinestone Cowboy says he's no felon.                Country crooner Glen Campbell pleaded innocent Tuesday to aggravated assault charges stemming from his arrest for "extreme DUI" and hit and run following a car accident last month.               After he was taken into custody November 24 and charged with misdemeanor counts of extreme drunken driving and hit and run, Campbell reportedly kneed a police officer in the thigh out of frustration.                The resulting charlie horse turned the tides on Campbell's evening. Rather than releasing him as they had planned, police re-arrested the country star for assault and tossed him in a cell.                 Which apparently didn't sit well with Campbell at all.                "There was a lot of, 'Do you know who I am,' a lot of profanities," Sergeant Bill Niles, the alleged victim of Campbell's knee, told the Arizona Republic about the encounter. "He didn't think he should be treated like a common criminal because of who he was."                Campbell blamed his off-the-wall actions on his so-called accidental mixing of booze and prescription anti-anxiety drugs.                 The evening began going downhill for Campbell after he allegedly ran a red light behind the wheel of his silver BMW, struck another car and just kept on moving.                No one was injured in the accident, but another motorist called in the accident while tailing Campbell back to his home.                Police intercepted the singer in his home and took him into custody after determining that he was drunk.                Down at the station, Campbell blew a 0.2 percent on the Breathalyzer--putting him over the limit for an "extreme" drunken driving charge.                 Campbell was released on $2,000 bail later that night, ordered to undergo drug and alcohol monitoring and told not to leave the state.                At the Tuesday arraignment, Judge Gregory H. Martin granted a motion allowing Campbell to travel, but said the singer must continue his drug and alcohol screening.                Campbell is still awaiting trial on his misdemeanor charges. He's due back in court on January 15.                In brighter days, the country star scored 27 Top 10 hits and sold more than 40 million records, according to his Website. He also hosted his own television show, The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour, which ran on CBS from 1969 to 1972. He's also acted in several movies, including the 1968 John Wayne western True Grit.                The singer recently told the Arizona Republic that he had battled addiction in the past and kicked cocaine and alcohol habits two decades ago after meeting his wife Kim.
