NBA Star Glen Davis -- Can I Take Your Order Please? ...Cause I'm Slangin' Chicken For Charity!!!/nGlen 'Big Baby' Davis' NBA contract must not say anything about moonlighting ... 'cause the Clippers forward was in his hometown this week pushing fried chicken in the drive thru of a fast food chain.It happened Wednesday in Baton Rouge when Glen stopped into Raising Cane's -- a super popular (and delicious) chicken finger joint -- and got behind a register during the lunch rush.Â  "Just another day working the drive through at @Raising_Canes. Come see me on Sherwood Forest Blvd in Baton Rouge. " Glen tweeted.Glen also tweeted several pictures of his fast food adventure and we gotta say, it's pretty hilarious to see the 6'9 " 289 pound behemoth workin' the drive thru booth.Anyone wondering if Davis has fallen on tough times should relax -- funds from his poultry peddling day were donated to his foundation which encourages inner city kids to stay in school.Another positive? No computers were harmed during Glen's drive thru tenure./n
