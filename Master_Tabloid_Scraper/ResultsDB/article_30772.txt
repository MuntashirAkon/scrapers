L.A. Clippers -- TEAMMATES DIVIDED ... Over Batman Flicks/nThey stood together through Donald Sterling ... fought together through the playoffs ... but there's one thing driving a wedge through the L.A. Clippers -- Batman. DeAndre Jordan and Glen  "Big Baby " Davis were leaving Boa Steakhouse in L.A. last night when we asked a pretty harmless question ... favorite comic book movie. They both said  "Batman " -- but that's where the problems began. DeAndre is all about the Christian Bale trilogy -- Big Baby explained why he's more of a Jack Nicholson, Michael Keaton kind of a guy. It's a war that's been raging between comic book nerds for years.  Question is -- who's right??!??/n
