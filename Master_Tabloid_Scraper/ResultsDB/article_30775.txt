'Big Baby' Davis -- Sucks Thumb, Leads Nap Time ... At Preschool Event/nL.A. Clippers star Glen Davis took the whole  "Big Baby " thing to another level yesterday ... leading  "nap time " with a bunch of young kids ... and sucked his own thumb to gain acceptance from the group.   It was actually a pretty cool thing ... Davis hit up the Gramercy Family Center in Los Angeles to read his children's book,  "Basketball with Big Baby " ... and the kids LOVED it.  But the funniest part was nap time (sidenote: how awesome was nap time?!) ... when Big Baby grabbed a blankie and conked out for a few with his new pint-sized pals.  /n
