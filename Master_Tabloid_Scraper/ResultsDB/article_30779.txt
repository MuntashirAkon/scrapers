NBA Star -- OUT-THUNDERSTORMS NFL STAR ... At L.A. Strip Club/nOne made it THUNDERSTORM ... the other made it drizzle. TMZ Sports has learned ... L.A. Clippers star Glen  "Big Baby " Davis and Tampa Bay Bucs star Dashon Goldson were two of the stars that hit up the grand opening of Ace of Diamonds in L.A. on Monday. For the record, Goldson signed a $41.2 million contract in 2013. Davis has made about $26 million in his NBA career. Which is why it was a bit shocking when Big Baby created his own indoor monsoon that dwarfed Goldson's mini-downpour. Our strip club sources tell us Davis was throwin' so much cash around, 4 dancers left with $3k each ... and that doesn't include the $5k he dropped around the stage.  Check out the pic below which shows one dancer's take from Davis. As for Goldson, as one strip club source put it --  "He made it sprinkle. " No one said being fiscally responsible was fun./n
