Taylor Swift certainly steamed up her look for the AMAs! The country cutie, who usually wears girly frocks or embellished gowns on the carpet, opted for something a whole lot shorter, tighter and sexier than usual with her sleeved and embellished Zuhair Murad nude mini paired with gorgeous gold heels, while fellow country star Carrie Underwood dropped jaws in a high-necked, powerfully purple gown Abed Mahfouz. Christina Aguilera wasn’t so fortunate on the fashion front, who on top of failing to flatter her curves in a purple chiffon asymmetrical Pamella Roland dress, looked overly tan and was sporting an incredibly blonde and blunt haircut.
Other style sinners of the week included Lindsay Lohan at the Los Angeles premiere of Liz & Dick, showing off her boobs in a gold gown, Rihanna, sporting garbage bag getup at a Best Buy event, and Miley Cyrus, who didn’t quite hit the high note with her blonder, choppier new ‘do in an all black ensemble on the streets of NYC.
