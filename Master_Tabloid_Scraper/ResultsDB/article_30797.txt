With her hair platinum blonde and styled in a blunt “Cleopatra A-Line Bob” by David Babaii using IT&LY HAIRFASHION products and her skin incredibly bronzed, the chart-topping singer poured her curves into in a purple ombre Pamella Roland gown paired with Neil Lane diamonds and Jimmy Choo heels.
For her performance the singer changed into something a little skimpier, hitting the stage in a star embellished costume courtesy of The Blonds, which featured a plunging neckline paired with over-the-knee Giuseppe Zanotti boots.
