By Radar Staff
In a week dominated by overly amorous men in uniform, Kim Kardashian had one marine standing at attention.
The reality star looked stunning at the Marine Corps Ball in Greenville, North Carolina Thursday night, and we’ve got all of the shots for you right here on RadarOnline.com.

The sexy 32-year-old reality star shined in a red, Roland Mouret dress that caught the attentions of her date, Sgt. Martin Gardner, who asked her to the dance. (She went back to her hotel by herself lest anyone think the date was anything but platonic.)
“Just left the Marine Corps Ball,” she tweeted after the festivities. “Thanks to all of the marines I had the opportunity to meet tonight! Thank you for all that you do!”
