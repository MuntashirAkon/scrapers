PHOTOS: Oliver Stone Nearly Cops A Feel Of Salma Hayek’s Assets
Hayek, who had her bodacious bust on display in a boobilicious, curve-hugging Roland Mouret dress, was posing for photos with the Academy Award winning director on the red carpet when the 66-year-old got extremely close to copping a feel as he stared intently at her crazy cleavage.
The inappropriate gesture did not go unnoticed by the cameras, or by Salma’s costar Benicio Del Toro who was standing alongside her and their other costar, John Travolta. The actor broke into laughter, as Salma proceeded to whisper something into Stone’s ear.
