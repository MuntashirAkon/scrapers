Wife Of U.S. Treasury Secretary Ices Haters Who Dare To Comment On Her Lavish AF Instagram Post!/n

UPDATE 5:56 P.M. EST: Linton has since apologized, saying in a statement, "I apologize for my post on social media yesterday as well as my response. It was inappropriate and highly insensitive."

Louise Linton's love don't cost a thing â€” courtesy of the U.S. government, apparently!
The wife of Steven Mnuchin, Donald Trump's Treasury Secretary, faced backlash after flexing their wealth in an Instagram post showing her stepping off a government plane in designer wardrobe.
Linton showed off her lavish lifestyle with some not-so-subtle #humblebrags in the caption, making sure to tag labels including Tom Ford, Hermes, Valentino and Roland Mouret.

And when the critics came for her fancy head, the 36-year-old hit back by saying she and Mnuchin have actually "suffered" â€” because they pay more in taxes!
There was no shortage of salty comments under Linton's post, but one responder in particular triggered the Scottish-born actress. Jenni Miller, a mother-of-three from Oregon, wrote:

"Glad we could pay for your little getaway #deplorable."
Linton didn't take kindly to the Hillary Clinton-inspired hashtag, writing a sassy AF response: 

"Cute! ðŸ˜˜ Awe!!! Did you think this was a personal trip? Adorable! Do you think the US govt paid for our honeymoon or personal travel?! Lololol. I'm pretty sure we paid more taxes toward our day â€˜trip' than you did. Pretty sure the amount we sacrifice per year is a lot more than you'd be willing to sacrifice if the choice was yours."
That's the issue, Linty â€” most Americans don't have a choice. We're forced to watch a cartoon president divide the country while your sparkly, Tom Ford-covered ass jets off to Timbuktu!
