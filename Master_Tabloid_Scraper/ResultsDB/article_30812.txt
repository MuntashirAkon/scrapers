The Razzie Awards nominations are in, honoring the worst film-related things of the year.

Zoolander 2 was the recipient of the most nominations with a tally of nine, while Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice came in second with eight. Gerard Butler was nominated for Worst Actor in Gods of Egypt & London Has Fallen, Megan Fox was tapped for Worst Actress in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows, and Tyler Perry was given backhanded praise for Worst Director for BOO! A Madea Halloween.
It would be foolish of us to not take this opportunity to reflect on the golden dialogue that came from the purported Worst Movies of the Year, so let’s take a moment of silence to remember the fallen.
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice 
Bruce Wayne: Maybe it’s that Gotham City and me… we just have a bad history with freaks dressed like clowns.






Dirty Grandpa
Lenore: Rip my bra off like your ripping open your Social Security Check!






Hillary’s America: The Secret History of the Democratic Party
