In between all the movies he is making, Idris Elba is also training for a boxing match!
The hunky actor recently posted a fetching post-workout selfie on Instagram, flexing his incredible muscles in his underwear.
Elba is getting in his last bit of training before what he told People was a “semi-professional fight.” He captioned the pic, “Cutting weight, two days before first fight, mind in the right place. Fear NO guy.”
