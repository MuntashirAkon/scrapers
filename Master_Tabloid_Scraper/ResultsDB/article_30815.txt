Actor Idris Elba was seen performing some intense action sequences on Sunday for the upcoming Stephen King adaptation The Dark Tower.
The scene looked like it involved a shoot-out between Elba’s Gunslinger and co-star Jackie Earle Haley, as bad guy Sayre, on the streets of Dumbo, Brooklyn.
Based on King’s excellent books, Elba plays Roland Deschain, The Gunslinger who roams an Old West-like landscape, which is an alternate universe to our own. He is searching for the Dark Tower, and once he finds it, Roland hopes to defeat the Man in Black (Matthew McConaughey) and preserve his dying world. The Gunslinger (and others from his world, for that matter) can also cross over into our world, which can lead to dangerous consequences.

An adaptation of The Dark Tower has been in development for years, with director Ron Howard attached to direct for much of that time. Howard had ambitious plans to tackle King’s dense material, making a trilogy of movies and a limited TV series to fill in between the movies. It’s unclear if that is all still in the works, but Howard is now a producer on the project, handing over the reins to writer/director Nikolaj Arcel.
All we know is they totally nailed the casting. Elba should be perfect as Roland, while McConaughey stretches himself a bit to play the villain.
The Dark Tower opens in theaters on February 17, 2017.
