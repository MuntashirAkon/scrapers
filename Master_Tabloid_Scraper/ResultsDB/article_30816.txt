The formidable Idris Elba was spotted on the NYC set of The Dark Tower, the long-awaited big-screen adaptation of Stephen King’s epic set of novels, and Idris looks rarin’ to go.
Elba plays Roland Deschain, The Gunslinger who roams an Old West-like landscape, which is an alternate universe to our own. He is searching for the Dark Tower, and once he finds it, Roland hopes to defeat the Man in Black (Matthew McConaughey) and preserve his dying world. The Gunslinger (and the Man in Black, for that matter) can also cross over into our world, which can lead to dangerous consequences.
McConaughey, dressed all in black and looking badass himself, joined Elba in the Big Apple, shooting what must be some of the scenes in this world. Launch the gallery above!

An adaptation of The Dark Tower has been in development for years, with director Ron Howard attached to direct for much of that time. Howard had ambitious plans to tackle King’s dense material, making a trilogy of movies and a limited TV series to fill in in between the movies. It’s unclear if that is all still in the works, but Howard is now a producer on the project, handing over the reins to writer/director Nikolaj Arcel (A Royal Affair).
All we know is they totally nailed the casting. Elba should be perfect as Roland, while McConaughey stretches himself a bit to play the villain. The Dark Tower opens in theaters on February 17, 2017.
