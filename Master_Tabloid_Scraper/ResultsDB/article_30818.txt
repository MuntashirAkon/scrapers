Eva Longoria is taking the annual Cannes Film Festival red carpet by storm this year.

Longoria, who is a L’Oréal Paris ambassador along with Doutzen Kroes, Naomi Watts, Susan Sarandon, Victoria Beckham, Julianne Moore, Blake Lively and many others, is at this year’s glitzy festival in support of the makeup line along with the squad, and they certainly are killing it:

The festival only started yesterday, kicking off with the premiere of Lively and Kristen Stewart’s new movie Café Society, but Longoria has already been making a high-fashioned splash at a number of events.
She looked amazing sporting a pale gold and white Pamella Roland gown for the festival’s opening night on Wednesday:

Longoria, who now stars on the comedy Telenovela and is engaged to Jose Antonio Baston, was surely one of the best dressed celebs on yesterday’s red carpet premiere of the Jodie Foster-directed movie Money Monster, starring Julia Roberts, George Clooney and Jack O’Connell.
