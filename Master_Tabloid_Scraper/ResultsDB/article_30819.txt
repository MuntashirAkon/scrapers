Alert: treat your ears to two new Drake songs off his upcoming album Views from the 6.

One of them is called “Pop Style,” and is Drake’s very first song with The Throne (Kanye West and Jay Z).

“Pop Style” features literally a two-line contribution from Jay, so Twitter hilariously and expectedly went in on Beyoncé‘s other half. The results?

When you’re mad that Jay only had two bars on Pop Style but then remember it’s still a Drake x Kanye collab… pic.twitter.com/vhQL0GwGFo

Pop Style is cool. I’m mad Jay verse was like 2 bars. You must have to get Tidal to hear the rest 😂😂😂

Jay is my favorite rapper but his verse on Pop Style is the lyrical equivalent of turning in an essay at 11:59 that you started at 11:50…

Kanye, of course, dropped yet another reference to his infamous VMA moment in which he crashed Taylor Swift’s speech:

“Jay about his business, and I’mma let you finish but…”

The second is “One Dance” featuring Wizkid & Kyla.

The two singles follow up “Summer Sixteen,” which the 29-year-old Canadian premiered back in January on his Beats 1 show OVO Sound Radio. Ironically, “Summer Sixteen” references both ‘Ye and Jay:
“I used to wanna be on Roc-A-Fella then I turned into Jay
Now I got a house in LA, Now I got a bigger pool than Ye
And look man, Ye’s pool is nice, mine’s just bigger’s what I’m saying”
The lyrics previously prompted speculation that there was tension between the rappers, but their newest collaboration seems to debunk any feud.
Last year, Drake released two mixtapes, including the Future collaboration What a Time to Be Alive and his solo effort If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late. Most recently, he appeared on Rihanna’s “Work.”
