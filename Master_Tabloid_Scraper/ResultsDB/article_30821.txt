A-list movie star couple, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, made a rare red carpet appearance for the premiere of their film together, By The Sea, on Thursday evening in Hollywood.

Brad was dressed in a classic black tuxedo, while Angelina turned heads in a stunning strapless cream floor-length gown covered in white jewels. Her look was elegant, yet simple, as she accessorized with a pair of earrings and wore her long brown hair down.

Jolie directed the film, which is the first time the comely twosome worked together on-screen since Mr. & Mrs. Smith in 2005.
The movie stars the real-life couple as a husband and wife, Roland and Vanessa, as they experience difficulties in their marriage.

Angelina recently told the New York Times about how when she and Brad got married in real life, the two of them were both sitting down in an edit room in California, working when an assistant brought the marriage license for them to sign.

Then the judge came in, this lovely guy, and at some point, Brad said, “Shouldn’t we be standing up?” The judge said, “No.” Then suddenly we realized we were married, in the most unceremonial way possible.

Perhaps the pomp and circumstance of their film premiere is making up for it.
