Independence Day: Resurgence Director Roland Emmerich Answers Why Will Smith's Character Isn't in the Sequel/n
Lucky for the alien invaders, Will Smith will not be returning to defend Earth in Independence Day: Resurgence.   
Director Roland Emmerich recently sat down with PEOPLE to explain why the star isn’t rejoining his former costars Jeff Goldblum, Bill Pullman and Vivica A. Fox in the upcoming sequel.  
“This happened relatively early in the production, like 4 or 5 years ago, that he opted out, and I could totally understand why he opted out,” the filmmaker said.  
“And then we asked ourselves, ‘How do we replace Will Smith?’ And what we did, we had this idea to make like a whole group, a whole generation out of him, because we have now like 4, 5, 6 young actors taking on what he was doing [as a pilot].”  
While the details are still under wraps, Emmerich has revealed that Smith’s character died in the years between when the first and second films take place, and his stepson, played by Jessie T. Usher, has followed in his footsteps as a pilot.

Usher stars alongside Liam Hemsworth, who plays a fellow pilot – which the planet is going to need plenty of judging by the size of the new alien army.  
 Emmerich noted that he became interested in filming a sequel over the years as special effects became more advanced, which allowed him to scale up the action.  
One of his first ideas for making use of new special effects technology was the mothership landing. “Let’s this time have the mothership come to earth,” he explained. “It’s so big – it’s like 3000 miles in diameter – and will have it’s own gravity, and will suck up Asia, and when it lands, it dumps it on Europe.”
