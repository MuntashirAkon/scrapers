Vanessa Williams Does the 'Stanky Leg' in Gorgeous Pamella Roland Wedding Dress: Watch Now!/n
Now that temperatures have officially gone from lukewarm to sweltering, that can only mean one thing — wedding season is officially upon us. For many, that phrase only serves to induce a cocktail dress-related panic that typically results in a multitude of Pinterest boards overflowing with questionable choices. But for all the lovebirds out there, like Vanessa Williams and her husband Jim Skrip it heralds in the opportunity to make their “I do” official all over again.

Over Memorial Day weekend, Williams got married for a second time to her beloved in a Catholic ceremony. The couple first tied the knot almost exactly a year ago with an Egyptian themed wedding, but this time around they kept things pared down, holding the ceremony at a small church surrounded by family and friends. Williams chose a dress custom designed by Pamella Roland for the occasion, featuring a full skirt cinched with a light pink sash and glittering floral appliqués all along the deep-V neckline.





 Yesterday we took one last walk down the aisle — this time in my little church. Officially wedded Catholic. Amen! #MyJim 💋 photo by @kateland7

But while the gown was all classic elegance and decorum, the actress made sure to add in her own dash of fun, getting caught on camera by her daughter Jillian Hervey, of the band Lion Babe, busting out all of her finest dance moves, from the whip to the nae nae, throwing in a stanky leg for good measure, even though it was totally lost under all that fabric.
Now may all the weddings you attend this summer be filled with as much class, laughter and stanky legs as Vanessa Williams was blessed with.
