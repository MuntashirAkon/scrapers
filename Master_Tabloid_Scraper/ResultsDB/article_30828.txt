Not even a fashion heavyweight like Roland Mouret is impervious to the sartorial whims of a star like Beyoncé. Upon the songstress’ request, the Frenchman recently strayed from his signature body-skimming calf-length dresses and launched a rainbow-themed collection for net-a-porter.com with much more abbreviated hems. The designer, who also counts Victoria Beckham, Heidi Klum, and Demi Moore as fans, took time out to exclusively share his motivation for the shorter frocks with fabsugar.com: “In a funny way, the first one that did that for me was Beyoncé, this season where my length was mid-calf. She asked to raise the hem. I said, ‘you really inspire me, because it’s nice to see that kind of attitude.'” Though he admits the longer dresses were made for women who “don’t want to show the legs because they don’t like the leg,” the new series gives girls like Beyoncé plenty of opportunity to flash their well-toned gams. To hear more from Mouret, visit fabsugar.com, and to shop the collection, go to net-a-porter.com. –Emily Hsieh
