 Casey Anthony's Parents Sell Family Home For $85K — Their Own Home In Foreclosure, Where.../n
Just one month before their own home went into foreclosure, Casey Anthony‘s parents — Cindy and George — sold their other family home in Mount Dora, Fla. for $85,000, RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned.
So where is all the money going?
According to property records obtained by Radar, Cindy signed off on the sale of the 2-bedroom, 3-bathroom home where she once held highly publicized yard sales purportedly selling off items once belonging to her dead granddaughter, Caylee.

The 1,248 square-foot home belonged to Cindy’s father, Alexander Plesea, and it was left to her when he was placed in a nursing home.
Despite banking $85,000 on the house, Cindy and George’s home — where two-and-a-half-year-old Caylee died — has gone into foreclosure, as Radar previously reported.
According to court documents filed with the Orange County Register of Actions in Florida, NationStar Mortgage LLC filed foreclosure papers against the Anthonys on November 4.

And earlier this year Casey filed for bankruptcy claiming she had $792,000 in debts from her attorney fees and only $1,000 in assets.
Casey settled with Texas EquuSearch — the company that claimed to have spent more than $100,000 searching for Caylee, even though Casey already knew she was dead — on Nov. 26, but the terms of the settlement were not released to the public. /n
