Picks and Pans Review: Metroland/n
Emily Watson, Christian Bale
Featured attraction
Waking in the middle of one fitful night in 1977, a young husband and father (Bale) throws a coat over his pajamas and heads outside to pace up and down a street of tidy suburban houses near London. Why, his sleepy wife (Watson) wants to know, does he feel the need to take these nocturnal rambles?
“I walk until the panic subsides,” he tells her.
“What have you got to panic about?” she wants to know.
“Nothing,” replies Bale, “that’s what worries me.”
Who says all happy families are alike? Metroland is an absorbing and quietly affecting movie about Bale’s slow realization that he has become, and is content to be, the very thing he most loathed as a youth: a thoroughly domesticated suburban commuter. This epiphany comes only after his placid existence is shaken by the noisy arrival of his childhood best chum (Lee Ross), now a nomadic, sexually promiscuous poet. The old pal urges Bale to question his bourgeois life. Why, the friend wants to know, has Bale settled for being a mid-level advertising executive instead of the photographer he dreamed of becoming? Why does he not live in Paris, where he spent time a decade ago while in his early 20s? And why, oh why, doesn’t he have sex with anyone besides his wife?
The film, based on a 1980 novel by British writer Julian Barnes and directed by Philip Saville, features excellent performances by both Bale and Watson. Bale deftly conveys the yearning boy still lurking in his adult self, while Watson, playing a far more stable gal here than she did in Breaking the Waves or Hilary and Jackie, radiates wholesome sexiness and smarts.
