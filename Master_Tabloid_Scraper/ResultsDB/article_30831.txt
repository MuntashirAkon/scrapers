Roland Gift/n
British actor (Scandal) and soulful lead singer of rock’s Fine Young Cannibals; 28. Solo. “We’d rather not have a group than be one of those bands with a ridiculous-looking singer. Roland looked good and he had presence. It was love at first sight when we found out he had a voice, too.”—Recruiting Cannibal David Steele
