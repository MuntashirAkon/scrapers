Nothing could possibly top Kate Middleton's tiara moment on Tuesday, but the Duchess of Cambridge still looked royally gorgeous without her dazzling diamond crown at the London Premiere of Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom on Thursday night.Clad in a cream Roland Mouret gown with black pumps and a matching noir clutch, the new mom and husband Prince William waved to fans who gathered around the red carpet hoping to get a glimpse of the royal couple. (But alas no appearance from Prince George for this movie night!)

As Kate is known to do, she opted for a dress she has previously worn. Just like when she donned the design to a private dinner back in May 2012, this time the new mom flaunted some serious leg thanks to the gown's thigh-high split. Don't worry, she was still fairly covered up (long sleeves!) given the fact that it was a chilly 46 degrees in London today.She also topped the gown with a $35 Zara crystal statement necklace, which was a lot more sparkle than the simple drop diamond earrings she wore last year. But the real surprise was that she opted to wear her hair back in a low ponytail, which is quite rare for the Duchess who usually likes to keep her hair loose in her signature blowout style. However, this move wisely allowed her jewelry to be on full display. Well played, Kate!
