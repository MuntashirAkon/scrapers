It's bold enough to steal a style from the great Blake Lively, but for Taylor Schilling to take the look the Preserve website honcho wore in a recent viral video is extra ballsy. Maybe the Orange Is the New Black star is more similar to her tough TV character than we thought?Probably not. What she pilfered is a pastel pink-based cocktail dress that any fashion lover would kill to wear, so we won't call this a full-on affront.

Given the fact that both beauties are rocking carefree blonde locks, this comes down to a battle of footwear and accessories...or just shoes, because neither celeb is wearing any accessories.Our research beyond this shot confirms that Mrs. Ryan Reynolds rocked a pair of candy dot-covered white pumps that she called "Everlasting Gobstopper shoes," while the Netflix star chose a simpleÂ Stuart Weitzman 'Nudist' blue sandal.Since the dress is already so busy, it seems the multicolored choice would make for a mess, resulting in Taylor as our winner...although we can't help but factor her overly intense blue eye shadow into the look.Once again, Blake does no wrong on the fashion front.
