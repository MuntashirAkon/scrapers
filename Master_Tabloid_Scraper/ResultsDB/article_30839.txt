Asking us to choose between Sandra Bullock and Jennifer Lopez is like asking us to name our favorite Ryan Gosling movie! We love them all (or in this case, both) so, so much!That said, we're faced with an aggressive steal on the part of the A.K.A. album dropper. Not only did the Gravity star wear an incredibly memorable Roland Mouret look, but she wore it to the Spike TV Guys' Choice Awards. Meaning, it's likely burned into the mind of every man in America. Yes, we know guys don't care about clothes, but we beg to differ when the clothes look like this.

The only discernible differences between J.Lo and Sandy are length and shoe choice. The "I Luh Ya Papi" singer went for the midi version of this hot pink hotness while America's sweetheart opted for the mini. Since this look is already in Barbie clothes territory, we say the smaller shape keeps it on theme. Same goes for the pumps. Summer calls for free toes and feet, not the Bronx beauty's chunky pumps.So it looks like Sandra would win even if J.Lo didn't accidentally flash a nipple pastie in this look! But just in case there was any question, a wardrobe whoops equals an immediate Bitch Stole My Look loss. You can't wear it best if you can't keep it on. What's your say on the sitch?
