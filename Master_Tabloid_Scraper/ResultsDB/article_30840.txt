Are we allowed to call Kate Middleton sexy or is that against some kind of princess etiquette?We feel like the British tabloids would use words like "regal" or "stately" to describe the Duchess of Cambridge in this Roland Mouret gown, but that's A. not entirely correct and B. not our style. Catherine looks super hot in this winter white look, and we don't care which royal we're offending by saying so. 

"Royal" and "stately" are words you can use to describe a gorgeous ball gown or "smart suit" (as the UK set would say). This look is sleek, body-hugging, and effortlessly sexy. The choice of loose hair and a smokey eye only further enforces the heat Prince George's gorgeous Mum is giving off, and that bit of bling around her neck (yes, a $35 steal from Zara!) seals the deal.And the best part of all—this is a recycled style! Kate isn't above wearing a perfect look twice, even if its bound to raise the Queen Mum's eyebrows, both times.
