Stephen King Sued for Ripping Off 'The Dark Tower' Character from a Comic Book/nStephen King stole the idea for his main man in  "The Dark Tower " series from a famous comic book character also known as a gunslinger ... according to a new suit. The creator of  "The Rook " comics claims King's protagonist, Roland Deschain, is based on his main character, Restin Dane. He says Deschain has striking similarities to Dane other than just their initials -- both are  "time-traveling, monster-fighting, quasi-immortal, romantic adventure heroes. "  "The Rook " creator also points out King's Deschain dresses like a cowboy despite not being from the Old West -- just like Restin Dane -- and the towers in both books look the same.  According to the docs ... the Restin Dane character was in more than 5 million comic magazines from 1977-1983 and King admits he read those stories. The first book in King's 'Dark Tower' series was released in 1982. Translation --  "The Rook " creator thinks it's more than just a coincidence Roland is a lot like Restin, and he wants the King of Horror to fork over $500 million for ripping him off. The lawsuit is impeccably timed ... teaser footage from the upcoming  "Dark Tower " movie, starring Idris Elba andÂ Matthew McConaughey, was just revealed this week./n
