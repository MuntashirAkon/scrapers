Jim Carrey -- Dumb and Dumber To ... THIS IS REALLY HAPPENING!!!/nYes, we're saying there's a chance -- in fact, more than a chance ... Jim Carrey just gave the world hardcore proof the  "Dumb and Dumber " sequel is really, finally filming.Jim posted a WhoSay pic of himself and Jeff Daniels -- aka Lloyd Christmas and Harry Dunne -- attempting to read Jim's new children's book called,  "How Roland Rolls. "It looks like they're standing in between their trailers on the movie set ... which is a good sign cameras are already rolling on the long-anticipated (almost 20 years now)  "Dumb and Dumber To. " Then again, they could just be lost in a trailer park. Either way ... awesome./n
