Nicki Minaj celebrated breaking Aretha Franklin’s Billboard record by shaking what her mama gave her. Amid news that the rapper, who released three songs just this month, had just become the woman with the most Top 100 hits by surpassing Franklin’s 73-song title, Minaj shared an Instagram video of her twerking backstage at a Drake concert.
“When u find out u just became the only woman in the history of billboard to have 76 Hot 100 billboard entries,” she captioned the clip of her dancing in a red latex two-piece.

“Walked off stage to find out history was made yet again today. #NoFrauds #RegretInYourTears + #ChangedIt charted this week on Billboard & I now hold the title of most Hot 100 entries in the HISTORY of BILLBOARD among women of EVERY genre,” she wrote. “To my fans: I fkn love u guys more than I’ll ever be able to put in words. Thank u so much for your unwavering love & support. God bless each & every one of you. To God be the glory.”
Somewhere out there, Remy Ma is eating her heart out.
