Nicki Minaj just hit a major milestone with her new song “Black Barbies.” It debuted at number 65 on Billboard’s Hot 100 chart, becoming her 70th Hot 100 hit.

According to Billboard, this brings her total above Taylor Swift, and just short of Aretha Franklin’s record 73 Hot 100 hits. Swift is expected to have her 70th hit next week with the release of “I Don’t Want to Live Forever,” a collaboration with Zayn Malik.
“Black Barbies” is a reworking of the song “Black Beatles,” by Rae Sremmurd, featuring Gucci Mane, which currently sits at the number one spot on the Hot 100 chart. The songs share the same team of writers, only with Minaj added to list for “Barbies.”
