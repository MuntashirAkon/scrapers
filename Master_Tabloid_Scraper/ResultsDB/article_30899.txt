Frankie Jonas, the youngest of the Jonas brothers, was arrested for possession of marijuana in Nashville.
TMZ reports the “Bonus Jonas Brother” got picked up by police outside a convenience store on Tuesday night (Nov. 22, 2016). Sources close to the family say that the 16-year-old is a good kid and is “extremely remorseful” about the bust. Fortunately for Jonas, Nashville recently passed a law that reduced the penalties of small marijuana possessions in September, so the consequences might not be that bad.

Considering that Frankie a bit of a genius that’s already graduated from high school and is taking college courses, this might be a blow to his “good boy” rep. However, we’re sure his big brothers, Kevin, Joe and Nick, will give him a good pep talk.
