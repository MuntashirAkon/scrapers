Ellen DeGeneres — who made a memorable splash as the forgetful Dora in Finding Nemo in 2003 — has gone from playing a fish to playing a dog.
The talk-show host has agreed to star in the animated film Dog Show, about a homeless mutt and her equally shabby pals who make a shambles of the purebred world of a big-time dog show.
The writing team behind the project, Alan Schoolcraft and Brent Simons are on a roll. They’re also the scripters of the animated Master Mind, which stars Robert Downey Jr. and Tina Fey. /n
