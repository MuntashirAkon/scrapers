If you’ve ever wondered what song is President Barack Obama’s turn up jam, here’s your answer. As he embarks on his annual vacation at Martha’s Vineyard, where his youngest daughter is currently working a part-time job at a local seafood restaurant, the commander-in-chief dropped not one, but two playlists — one for day, one for the night — he’ll be blasting this summer.

Alongside classics like The Beach Boys’ “Good Vibrations” and Aretha Franklin’s “Rock Steady,” Obama also includes contemporary tracks from Nas and Damian “Jr. Gong” Marley, Common, and Janelle Monáe on his playlists.


Of course, it may not be as “fire” as what Malia Obama is listening to these days. The eldest daughter of the POTUS and First Lady Michelle Obama was recently spotted dancing to Cashmere Cat — and maaayyybe smoking pot — at this year’s Lollapalooza.
Say what you will about the Obamas, but you can’t deny that this family has got great taste in music.
