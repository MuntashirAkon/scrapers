How To Keep Your Kid From Dressing Like A Slut/n
Watch CBS Videos OnlineIf you’re the parent of a young daughter you’re probably worried about the rampant sexuality that pervades our culture these days, particularly since it sends a message that a woman’s only value is as an object of desire for men. With Halloween right around the corner, you’re no doubt wondering how to discourage little Susie from her plan to dress up as “a slutty Strawberry Shortcake” this year, particularly when she’s telling you that the other girls in first grade are going as a “skanky Hello Kitty,” a “trashy Dora the Explorer,” and “a crack whore.” Is it possible to dissuade your child from parading about in a low-cut outfit while the 8-year-old boys leer and catcall? Probably not. But the folks at CBS are at least offering some advice. Good luck. Hopefully it’ll be cold enough that you can at least make her wear a sweater over that “Hooters waitress trainee” costume.
