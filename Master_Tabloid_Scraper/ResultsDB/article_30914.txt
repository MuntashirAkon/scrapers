Gowns?! Just gowns?! We know, Swifties. She could have said so much more.What about those impressive 1989 album sales that topped 1.2 million?  Maybe she could have mentioned her ability to tackle both country and pop music perfectly? We could go on and on.It also didn't help that the "RESPECT" singer had much nicer things to say about the two women before Swift.When asked about Adele, Franklin shared "good singer." In regards to Alicia Keys? "Young performer, good writer, producer."Regardless of one person's opinion, chances are Swift won't be too upset with the news. In fact, she's probably just going to "Shake it Off."
