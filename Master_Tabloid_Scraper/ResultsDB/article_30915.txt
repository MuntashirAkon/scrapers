Aretha Franklin Jumped Out of Bed on Hearing About Whitney Houston's Death/n
"It's not gonna be easy," she said of her scheduled performance. "But Cissy [Houston, Whitney's mother] asked me to and I'm just gonna try and do my best."Franklin also hopes Houston's ex-husband, Bobby Brown, will embrace his role as the father of their 18-year-old daughter, Bobbi Kristina. "I think it's her dad's responsibility to step up to the plate," she said. "And be responsible. But there are a lot of factors. It's really not for me to say."While the 69-year-old singer admitted Houston's personal struggles had taken their toll throughout her career, she doesn't think "we should focus on the challenges she had."Instead, she wrote some poignant lyrics to memorialize Houston. "Twinkle twinkle superstar/We don't wonder where you are/Up above the world so bright/Like a diamond in the night/Twinkle twinkle she stood alone/I can't believe that she's gone."
