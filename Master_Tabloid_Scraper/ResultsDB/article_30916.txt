If there's one person who can cover Adele, it has to be Aretha Franklin!And as it turns out, the 72-year-old Queen of Soul blows us away as she delivers her own rendition of the Brit singer's smash hit single, "Rolling in the Deep."Released today, the track features a faster melody that is sure to get listeners moving. It also incorporates the chorus from Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell's classic Motown hit, "Ain't No Mountain High Enough."It's a nice addition to a song that received the Grammy Award for Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best Short Form Music Video in 2012. Pretty impressive if we do say so ourselves.
