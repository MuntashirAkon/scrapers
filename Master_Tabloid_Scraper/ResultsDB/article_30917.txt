The Queen of Soul is breaking it to her fans gently.Aretha Franklin has scrapped an upcoming show in her home state of Michigan to focus on the ongoing treatment she's been receiving for an undisclosed health issue.The 71-year-old music legend announced the cancellation in an open letter E! News obtained from her rep, saying she was forced to axe the June 27 gig at the DTE Energy Pine Knob Theater in Clarkston just outside of Detroit because of a "miscalculation" concerning the length of her recovery."It would be totally disruptive to stop them now and go into concert with total success right at the door," Franklin said. "I love you much and more than the spoken word can tell. I'll see you next summer."

The "Respect" singer's camp declined to reveal any details about the illness except to say that she plans to hit the stage again as soon as possible."Aretha fully intends to get back to her full schedule of work as soon as she can," noted her publicist, David Brokaw, to Reuters.

The mystery ailment prompted Franklin to postpone playing the same Michigan venue in May and cancel concerts in Chicago with members of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, as well as in Connecticut, Ottawa and Montreal. No word if she'll make those dates up.In 2010, the 20-time Grammy winner was forced to nix six months' worth of performances after suffering a sharp pain in her side. Franklin subsequently underwent surgery in Detroit and announced she was given a clean bill of health. However, she declined to address a National Enquirer report that she was battling pancreatic cancer.That same year, the Rock and Roll Hall of Famer also broke her ribs in a fall, forcing her to bow out of two shows in New York.Whatever her illness, we wish Aretha a speedy recovery!
