Katy Perry made one very small fashion statement at the 2013 inauguration of President Barack Obama.The singer, known for her hard-to-miss and often over-the-top outfits, accessorized with a tiny version of Aretha Franklin's memorable 2009 inauguration hat."Big inauguration, tiny Aretha hat," Perry tweeted along with a picture of a miniature gray topper that was small enough to sit in the palm of her hand.

Though Perry wore a chic black fedora along with a Rodarte Fall 2012 coat to the inauguration, she held her playful accessory, which was attached to a clear handle, up to her own hat throughout the historic ceremony. Just like Franklin's original Luke Song hat, Perry's version featured an oversized, bedazzled bow that lent her outfit an undeniable dose of sass.And while Perry had her petite hat custom-made for the occasion, Song sells a normal-sized version for any other patriotic Americans who want to pay r-e-s-p-e-c-t to the original wearer of the fabulous headpiece.
