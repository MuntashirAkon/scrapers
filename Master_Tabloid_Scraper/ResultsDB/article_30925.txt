Nicki Minaj's Booty Popping Celebration for Taking Aretha Franklin's Crown/nWhen Nicki Minaj wins, we all win ... especially when she celebrates like this. Nicki just passed Aretha Franklin for the woman with the most Billboard Hot 100 songs of all-time. Her 3 latest entries to the chart --  "No Frauds, "  "Regret in Your Tears " and  "Changed It " -- give her a total of 76 in her career, topping Aretha's 73. Enough numbers. Just enjoy Nicki's ass-twerking party in honor of taking the crown. #Respect/n
