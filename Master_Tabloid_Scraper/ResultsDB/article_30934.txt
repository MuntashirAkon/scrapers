Justin Timberlake & Jessica Biel: We're Country Folk ... Doesn't That Just Dill Your Pickle!/nJustin Timberlake and Jessica Biel continued their country metamorphosis while filling up their bread baskets -- that's southern talk for stomachs -- at a local Nashville area deli.  The couple dropped by Franklin Mercantile Deli Monday night in Franklin, the posh Nashville suburb not too far from where they reportedly just purchased a hundred acres. Justin and Jess ordered the local favorite ... Mable's Pecan Chicken Salad sandwich. We're told they got two, plus a veggie sandwich. Justin was probably fuelin' up before his country gig at the CMAs Wednesday night ... where he stole the show./n
