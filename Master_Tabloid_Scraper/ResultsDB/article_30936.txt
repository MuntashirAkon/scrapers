Kanye West -- I Messed Up ... Kids Are Off Limits in My Twitter Wars /nKanye West blinked ... indirectly apologizing to Amber Rose and Wiz Khalifa for dragging their son into the epic Kanye /Wiz twitter war. Kanye took to Twitter late Friday with this mea culpa ...  "God's dream .... Never speak on kids again. " Mr. West crossed the line when he told Wiz,  "I own your child!!! "  The implication -- Kanye made Amber famous, which then made her desirable to Wiz, which then produced Sebastian.  Yeezy, who said his new  "Waves " album was gospel seems to be hanging with the right people ...  2 Chainz posted a pic of Ye in studio with gospel musician Kirk Franklin.     / //n
