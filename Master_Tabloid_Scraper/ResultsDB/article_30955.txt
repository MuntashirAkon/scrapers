And the singer/actress, 29, had posted pics and videos from there to her Instagram account, captioning one picture of her wearing a pink swimsuit and getting ready to dive off a dock, “CANADA.”
It clearly wasn’t the best move for Duff to share her holiday news, as her house in Beverly Hills was broken into. And according to reports, no alarm went off when the robbers entered her empty house during the night.

Robbers reportedly broke through an outer door of Duff’s home and pawed through her things, finding her jewelry worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Police have said they can’t confirm the extent of the robbery yet because Duff is still in Canada.
As Radar readers know, there has been a rash of celebrities who were robbed lately, including Nicki Minaj, Scott Disick and Ronda Rousey. 
Kim Kardashian was the most famous robbery victim, and although it happened in Paris, it’s been said her social media revealed too many clues of her whereabouts.
