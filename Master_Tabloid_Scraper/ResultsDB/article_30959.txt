 Ousted National Security Advisor Michael Flynn’s Son's Secret Druggy Past Revealed!.../n
Maybe it’s for the best President Trump booted his first security adviser, Michael Flynn. After all, RadarOnline.com has learned the retired army general can’t even keep a close eye on his own son!
An extensive investigation conducted by Radar has uncovered never-before-revealed arrest reports of 30-year-old Matthew T. Flynn, who has been busted TWICE on drug charges.
READ THE SHOCKING DOCUMENTS!
According to the official documents, Matthew was pinched for marijuana possession in North Carolina on Jan. 28, 2005.
He only avoided a prison stay because he was carrying less than a half-ounce of weed — allowing the judge to hit him with a Class 3 misdemeanor slap on the wrist.

Matthew got lucky again on March 14, 2006, when he was busted a second time for possession of paraphernalia. He faced up to 45 days behind bars on the misdemeanor charge, but got off easy with a fine.
With his dad facing possible criminal charges after covering up his connections to Russia, Matthew has been laying low at home — posting concert videos and pictures online.
