This Hilarious Text Exchange Between Mom & Daughter Is Going Viral!/n

Moms are the best!
This week, Twitter user @AintNoHoIIyBack shared a hilarious text exchange with her mother after she was locked out of their shared bank account because she didn't know her mom's answers to the security questions.
When asked which celebrity she most resembles, Holly's mom *obviously* picked Jennifer Aniston — who wouldn't?!
