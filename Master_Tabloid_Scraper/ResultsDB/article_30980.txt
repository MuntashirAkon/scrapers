Contrary to popular belief, not all Canadians do nice things. This was made apparent when Matthew Perry admitted to beating up Canada’s current prime minister, Justin Trudeau, when they were both growing up in the Great White North.

“I have a story about him that I’m not proud of,” the Friends alum said on Jimmy Kimmel Live. “My friend Chris Murray, who was also in the fifth grade in Canada, reminded me that we actually beat up Justin Trudeau. We both beat him up.”
“I think he was excelling at a sport that we weren’t, so it was pure jealousy. And, you know, we beat him up,” he explained. “His dad was prime minister, but I don’t think that’s the reason we beat him up. I think he was the only kid in school we could beat up.”
The 47-year-old added, “I’m not bragging about this. This is terrible. I was a stupid kid.”
As a kid, Perry lived in Ottawa and attended Rockcliffe Park Public School with Trudeau. Though his mother was working for Trudeau’s father as his press secretary, it didn’t stop him from picking on the politician’s son.
“I think I was rather instrumental in him going to such heights, becoming prime minister,” Perry quipped. “No, no. I feel shame. I don’t want to think about it.”
Clearly, Trudeau isn’t doing too bad these days. The same night Perry’s interview aired, the 45-year-old was spotted attending the Broadway musical Come From Away alongside Ivanka Trump. The word’s still out if the First Daughter of the United States spent the whole time ogling at the hunky PM again.
