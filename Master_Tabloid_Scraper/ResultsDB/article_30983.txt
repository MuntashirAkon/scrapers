Just a week after performing the single live for the first time, Katy Perry has dropped the music video for her new single, “Chained to the Rhythm.”

Directed by Matthew Cullen, the four-minute visuals feature Perry wandering around a pastel-colored amusement park, where choice attractions include a heart-shaped roller coaster, human-sized hamster wheel, and something called “The Great American Dream Drop.”
Like in many of Perry’s previous videos, latex suits and pink cotton candy are recurring motifs. After all, the guy that helmed this also directed “California Gurls” and “Dark Horse.”
“WELCOME TO 🎢🎡🎠OBLIVIA🎠🎢🎡 WHERE EVERYTHING IS ALWAYS ROSY,” Perry writes on Instagram alongside a screenshot.
