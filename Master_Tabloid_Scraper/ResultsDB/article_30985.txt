In celebration of this weekend’s premiere of The Dark Tower, a screen adaption of the eight book series by Stephen King, People Chica put the film’s stars, Idris Elba and Academy Award winner Matthew McConaughey, Spanish-language skills to the test. “This is going to be easy for you,” said Elba pointing to the Dallas Buyers Club star insinuating that McConaughey would have an advantage for being married to Brazilian-American model Camila Alves.

So far, the casting of Elba and McConaughey has brought much excitement to the fans of the sci-fi western book series. And the two actors were not far behind in expressing their own enthusiasm about being involved with the project.
“It was the first original big action thriller, science-fiction franchise that crossed my desk that was the original. [It was] a chance to be a part of the first one. It already had such a following with Stephen King followers so it was built in to have access,” said McConaughey—who plays the “Man in Black”—in regards to why he chose to take part in the long-awaited film. “I haven’t been part of a big summer franchise ever.
Elba, who plays the heroic gunslinger Roland Deschain in the film, added, “I wanted to play the hero, run around with guns and be cool. The script is well-written, the characters are well-written. There is a massive amount of data on these characters written by Stephen King and also, I wanted to work with Matthew.”  
The Dark Tower, from Columbia Pictures and MRC, is now playing in theaters.
