Amber Rose is never shy when it comes to talking about sex. So when the subject of her dating past came up, the Dancing with the Stars alum was more than happy to talk about her experiences.

“The women that I like are real masculine … So I like a really butch girl,” Margaret Cho, who’s openly bisexual, tells Rose on Play.it’s Loveline with Amber Rose podcast.
“I used to date a trans man, actually,” Rose, who also dated Kanye West in the past, reveals. “So I find that hot as well.”
When Cho says she likes “a dirty, old man” sometimes, Rose admits that she’s often attracted to older gentlemen with a rugged edge, saying, “Billy Bob [Thornton] is still so fuckable to me.”

“I’ve dated black men my whole life and now I’m really into white guys,” she confesses. “Well, I was always into white guys, but they never liked me because I had too much going on as far as body and shit. But now I’m starting to date white guys.”
Recently, Rose was linked to Dancing with the Stars pro Val Chmerkovskiy after the two were photographed canoodling at her 33rd birthday party. Though the two have yet to confirm their relationship, they were spotted out on a “flirty” date in West Hollywood this week.
