Matthew Modine, 'Stranger Things' Star Says We Live in Great Times!!!/nMatthew Modine does not think Charlottesville and other terrorist attacks are a harbinger of bad things to come ... to the contrary he thinks we are living in the best of times. We got the  "Stranger Things " villain Saturday at M Cafe in Bev Hills, and he blames the perception that our world is crumbling on a 24-hour news cycle that obsesses over the negative. He thinks there are definitely bad apples, but clearly doesn't believe they spoil the whole bunch./n
