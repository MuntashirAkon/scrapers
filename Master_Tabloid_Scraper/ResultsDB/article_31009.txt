Nate Diaz Was Inspired By 'Vision Quest,' Says Matthew Modine/nMatthew Modine says Nate Diaz personally told him that his 1985 wrestling flick  "Vision Quest " inspired him to become a pro fighter ... how cool is that!?  Modine -- who starred as high school wrestler Loudon Swain in the movie -- ran into Diaz in L.A. last week and said the meeting was a  "throwback because [Nate] was inspired by 'Vision Quest.' "  "He trained really hard as a young fighter and like so many young wrestlers they were inspired by that film. " WHO WANTS TO GRAB A LOG AND RUN SOME STADIUM STAIRS?!?! Sidenote: Do people really actually do that?  Anyway, Modine says Diaz has big things ahead ... including a massive payday.      Ran into @matthewmodine at @cafegratitude in Venice had good talk with him and his boy Tod Collins #visionquest #loudenswain #martialarts #vegan #wrestling #roots #ready 💪🏼💯 A post shared by natediaz209 (@natediaz209) on Jun 15, 2017 at 4:11pm PDT/n
