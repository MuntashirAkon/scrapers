Mathew Knowles Narrows Down Beyonce's Due Date, Says the Twins Are Coming/nMathew Knowles has some insider info that should get the Beyhive buzzin' ... about how much longer we have to wait 'til Beyonce has her twins. Bey's father came on  "TMZ Live " and we asked him to give us a ballpark figure on when the twins will be delivered. Like, should we order a bouquet now ... or hold off a few days, maybe weeks? Mathew answered ... and seemed pretty confident. You may recall ... Beyonce and Mathew went through a rough patch before reconciling last year. As for recent reports he's NOT in the know about her pregnancy ... he denies that, and certainly SEEMS to be in the loop./n
