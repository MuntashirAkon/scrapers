Justin Trudeau Challenges Matthew Perry to a Rematch Fight/nJustin Trudeau wants a rematch with Matthew Perry after getting his ass kicked in grade school and Matt telling the world about it -- FIGHT!!! The Canadian PM said  "I've been giving it some thought, and you know what, who hasn't wanted to punch Chandler? How about a rematch @MatthewPerry? "  You'll recall ... Matt went on Kimmel earlier this month and told the story of how he once beat up a younger Trudeau for  "excelling in a sport. " Now, JT tweeted the challenge on April Fool's day, so chances are he's joking. But it would be awesome! As long as nothing happened to Trudeau's face, that is. /n
