Brad Pitt -- DON'T GIVE UP ON DREW BREES/nDon't judge Drew Brees by his Fantasy numbers -- he's still  "ONE OF THE GREATEST QUARTERBACKS IN THE WORLD " ... so says Brad Pitt. The Sexiest Man Alive (1995, 2000) was leaving an event in Washington D.C. last night when we asked if he had any advice for the New Orleans Saints QB -- who hasn't exactly been posting those legendary Fantasy stats we're used to. That's when Pitt -- a HUUUGE Saints fan -- set our TMZ Sports photog straight with a strong defense of the former Super Bowl champ. Pitt and Brees happen to be friends -- earlier this year, they were spotted throwing a football around with Matthew McConaughey from the balconies of their expensive Bourbon Street pads. But the bottom line, if you're even THINKING about benching Brees on your Fantasy team this weekend -- as one ESPN article suggests -- you might wanna consider Brad's advice first. /n
