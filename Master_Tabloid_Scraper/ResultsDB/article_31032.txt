New Couple? AnnaSophia Robb and Emile Hirsch Get Cozy In The Capitol /n
Looks like Carrie may have found her new Mr. Big.
The Carrie Diaries star AnnaSophia Robb, 20, dashed and dined around Washington, D.C. with Lone Survivor actor Emile Hirsch, 29, over the weekend.
The pair, in town to attend the annual White House Correspondent’s Dinner on May 3, took a moment to pose during a jog around the White House on Friday morning.

“We’re takin’ over!” Robb captioned the cute May 2 Instagram shot.
Later that night, Hirsch— who welcomed son Valor with an ex-girlfriend in November— and Robb “were totally chatting it up,” in STK DC steakhouse at the Creative Coalition’s annual Celebration of the Arts in America event, an onlooker tells RadarOnline.com.
“She was smiling and seemed to be having a great time with Emile,” the eyewitness adds of the pair, who dined on chopped salad, striped bass and petite filet mignon. “She was listening intently to everything he said.”

But the distance between them may pose a challenge: Robb is based in New York, while Hirsch calls Hollywood home. /n
