 Give It A Rest! Unlucky-In-Love Doctor Slams Patti Stanger (Again!) For Calling Him 'Cheap,'.../n
Dr. Emil Chynn is firing back (AGAIN) at The Millionaire Matchmaker star Patti Stanger after she called him “cheap,” telling RadarOnline.com that he’s hired a prominent matchmaker in New York to help him find love.
As we previously reported, Stanger responded to Radar’s original story on Twitter by calling Dr. Chynn cheap! “Thx @radar_online for the Dr. Chen story but it didn’t happen that way,” she wrote. “If he’s so rich why doesn’t he hire a matchmaker in nyc? Cheap!”
But Dr. Chynn tells Radar that after he had “one of the worst dates of his life” on the Bravo show, he hired a New York matchmaker, who comes with a hefty price tag.

“I met with a prominent matchmaker, who charges $50,000 up-front, plus $100,000 if I marry a woman she introduces me to. I’m clearly not being ‘cheap,’” Chynn told Radar.
Speaking about his experience on the show, the doctor, who claimed he was worth $10 million “give or take a million,” had plenty of complaints.
“First of all, it’s nice how, after spending a week with me on set, Patti still doesn’t know my correct name. Just goes to show how much effort she makes to get to know her clients,” Chynn said.

“Patti has this weird shtick where she verbally abuses people – both the clients and dates – for laughs, [and] then acts offended when they don’t want to hire her for future services.”
After meeting Stanger, Dr. Chynn had one final word of advice for the Bravo matchmaker: lay off the botox!
“As a cosmetic surgeon who does perform dermal fillers, here’s a tip, Patti: Next time you get Juvederm, don’t ask your surgeon for so much, and stay away from the midline–that’s how to achieve a natural ‘Cupid’s bow’ instead of unnatural fish lips,” he said.
