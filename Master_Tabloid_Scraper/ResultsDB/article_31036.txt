Just Say 'Aah,' Emile Hirsch Shows Off New Son/n
Just a month after news broke that Emile Hirsch was to be a first time dad with a former girlfriend, the actor is proudly showing off his new son.
The Into the Wild and Savages star has posed with the newborn, named Valor by the actor and the unnamed former flame.  The pair met at an Oscar party last February, had a brief affair and had reportedly already gone their separate ways when she learned she was pregnant.
“Valor was six pounds and two ounces. He is a beautiful, healthy baby boy. Everyone is so excited and happy,” a source told Eonline.
