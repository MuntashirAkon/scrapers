Hollywood Film Goes Dark Thanks To Moscow Fires/n
The new movie The Darkest Hour could be renamed The Darkest Two Weeks, thanks to fires raging around Moscow, RadarOnline.com has learned.
The alien thriller starring Emile Hirsch and Olivia Thirlby has been filming in the Russian capital but on Friday production was suspended for two weeks due to health and safety concerns.

“The potential health issues and spread of fire has forced the production to be put on hold for two weeks to allow things to stabilize in the area,” a rep for Summit Entertainment told The Hollywood Reporter.
No novice to environmental disasters, Emile, who starred in Milk and Into the Wild, climbed Mt. Kilimanjaro in January to raise awareness of the clean water crisis in Third World nations.

The Darkest Hour was scheduled to be shooting exterior scenes during the upcoming days, and that was determined to be impossible because of the fires.  An estimated 50 deaths have already been attributed to the inferno. /n
