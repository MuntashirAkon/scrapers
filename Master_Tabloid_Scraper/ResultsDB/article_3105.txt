Lauren and William, 37, got married in 2014 after more than two years of dating.
“My favorite thing about being married is knowing that I have a partner in life that I get to do so many wonderful things with,” Conrad wrote in a 2015 blog post about their first wedding anniversary. “Dreaming of the things we will do 20 years from now is so fun.”
She added that she wanted two kids with the former Something Corporate guitarist, explaining, “That way we aren’t outnumbered.”
