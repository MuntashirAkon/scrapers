Nelsan Ellis struggled with addiction prior to his untimely death at the age of 39.

According to the True Blood alum’s family, the actor had abused drugs and alcohol for years prior to his recent passing. In a statement issued through the late star’s manager, Emily Gerson Saines, Nelsan’s father revealed he wanted to share his sons’ problems in an effort to help other people who are dealing with the same demons.
“Nelsan’s father has bravely agreed for me to share the circumstances of Nelsan’s heart failure,” a spokesperson said. “Nelsan has suffered with drug and alcohol abuse for years. After many stints in rehab, Nelsan attempted to withdraw from alcohol on his own. According to his father, during his withdrawal from alcohol he had a blood infection, his kidneys shut down, his liver was swollen, his blood pressure plummeted, and his dear sweet heart raced out of control.”
Nelson passed away on Saturday (July 8) from complications due to heart failure.
“Nelsan was a gentle, generous and kind soul. He was a father, a son, a grandson, a brother, a nephew, and a great friend to those that were lucky enough to know him. Nelsan was ashamed of his addiction and thus was reluctant to talk about it during his life,” the rep told The Hollywood Reporter. “His family, however, believes that in death he would want his life to serve as a cautionary tale in an attempt to help others.”
