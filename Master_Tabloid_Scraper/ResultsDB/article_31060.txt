Congratulations are in order for Jessica Chastain!

The Zero Dark Thirty star wed longtime boyfriend Luca Passi de Preposulo in an intimate ceremony in Italy this Saturday (June 10, 2017).
The nuptials took place at the groom’s family-owned Villa Tiepolo Passi, a 17th century estate just 25 miles from Venice. Jessica and Luca, who first started dating in 2013, exchanged vows in an outdoor courtyard surrounded by family and close friends, including A-list guests Anne Hathaway, Emily Blunt, John Krasinski, and designer Riccardo Tisci.
In wedding photos captured by the paparazzi, the 40-year-old bride looked stunning in a custom-made strapless white dress with a corseted bodice and lace overlay. She paired her look with a sleek up-do and a long veil.
“The wedding was stunning,” an insider told E! News. “Jessica’s dress was perfect and you could tell she was very nervous walking down the aisle. The food was delicious.”
