Like her cousin, North West has given her new Pomeranian puppy a delicious name.

Kim Kardashian took to Twitter to poll her millions of followers on what to name the dog, which was a gift for Nori’s fourth birthday. After suggesting names like Baby Jesus and Peachy Pop, the reality star announced her family has settled for Sushi as the canine’s moniker.

Previously, Kim wanted to name the Pomeranian after Mercy, the kitten Kanye West gave to her when they were first dating. She later changed her mind after fans pointed out it would be morbid to name North’s new furry friend after a dead cat.
According to People, Kim bought the dog as a way to teach her daughter responsibility. “North has been asking for a puppy for a long time,” a source said. “Kim thought it was a good idea for North to take care of a puppy. It could prepare her for baby sibling too.”
