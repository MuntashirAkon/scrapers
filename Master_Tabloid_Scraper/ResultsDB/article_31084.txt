How Emile Hirsch Gained Weight for Prince Avalanche Role (Hint: Drunching!)/n
There's your birthday suit and then there's your fat suit.And looks like Emile Hirsch felt comfortable in his fat suit (literally) when he appeared on Chelsea Lately last night."That's an interesting fitting suit that you're wearingâ€¦" Chelsea Handler pointed out, asking, "Is it yours?"

His response?"Uh, not anymore," the actor added with a laugh.The Into the Wild star explained how he purchased the suit when he was preparing for the role in his new flick Prince Avalanche and eating up to four fast food meals a day."I'm not sure if it was a special diet in the sense that I was trying to gain weight for the role. I just think I was, like, drunk post-club for a few months before I went and shot the role, " he said much to the audience's delight. "It's like the question with the chicken or the egg, or in my case eggs benedict with peanut butter and, you know."

However, the talk show host didn't seem to think Hirsch looked very "fat" in the film, which he attributed to CGI."You do look really young though, you look you're 12 in the movie. And you look like you're 14 or 15 right now, " she said, putting the 27-year-old on the spot."Well, I guess, " Hirsche paused while thinking of a comeback. "Hey, wanna hang out?"Smooth, very smooth.
