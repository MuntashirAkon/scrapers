Emile Hirsch -- Preppiest Mug Shot Ever/nEmile Hirsch was in and out of a Park City courthouse Monday for his Sundance assault case ... but he did stay long enough to take this epic mug shot.  Hirsch's first appearance was an uneventful one -- a status conference was set for April 13.  Hirsch is facing a felony assault charge stemming from an incident on January 25. Hirsch allegedly put Daniele Bernfeld, a film executive, into a chokehold at a festival event.  Hirsch faces up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine.  He checked himself into rehab following the incident./n
