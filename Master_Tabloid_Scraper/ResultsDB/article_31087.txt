Mariah Carey, James Packer: Shackin' Up in Calabasas ... We're Starting a Family/nMariah Carey and James Packer have just leased a home in Kardashian-land, and it's all about family ... TMZ has learned. Mariah and James leased a mansion in The Oaks, a fancy gated community in Calabasas. Our Mariah sources say she and James wanted to live in an area that is  "family friendly " ... especially because Mariah has the twins full time. The estate is amazing ... it's 18,000 square feet on one acre with sweeping views. All the stones are imported from Italy, there's a theater, sauna and gym. The house took 5 years to build and has never been on the market. Our sources say Emil Hartoonian from The Agency brokered the deal ... for an astonishing lease price of around $250,000 a month. We're told they are leasing the estate with an option to purchase. They shouldn't have trouble coming up with the down payment.Â /n
