Rob Kardashian: I Scored My Own House in the Family Compound/nRob Kardashian can have all the sleepovers and home workouts he wants with Blac Chyna now -- he just got his own house, but his sisters are still within shouting distance.   TMZ has learned Rob bought a 4,256 sq. ft crib in Calabasas within the gated Oaks neighborhood. Our sources tell us he scored the 4 bedroom pad for $2.285 million. Kris Jenner helped out with the purchase, which is under the family trust, and it closed a week ago. The Kardashians have quite the compound going -- Rob, Khloe, Kourtney, Kylie and even Lamar ... all live within a few blocks of each other. Mom and Kim are up the road in pricier Hidden Hills homes.  One selling point for Rob -- the kitchen has a huge center island and breakfast nook, just in case he and BC want to recreate that scene Khloe walked in on last month.  We reached out to the 2 biggest realtors in the area -- Tomer Fridman from Sotheby's and Emil Hartoonian at The Agency -- but neither was available for comment./n
