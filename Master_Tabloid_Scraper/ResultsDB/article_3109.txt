The Kardashian family just got a little bigger!

North West and Penelope Disick — the daughters of Kim and Kourtney Kardashian, respectively — just received a pair of sister puppies. The two tiny tots were recently each gifted a Pomeranian in honor of their fourth birthdays. (North hit the milestone last week, while Penelope will celebrate her birthday July 8.)
“Sister puppies for North & P! Penelope named hers honey. What should we name ours?” Kim wrote on Instagram.

“So North wants to name her puppy Mercy, thoughts?” the Selfish author later tweeted. “We need a good name!”
However, many fans quickly pointed out that Mercy was the name of the kitten Kanye West had gotten her when they were first dating. Given that the cat died in 2012 at just four months old, many thought it would be a bad omen to name North’s new dog the same moniker.
“Yes that’s why I’m not sure if we should name our puppy that too,” Kim quipped. Though the pup is a girl, she added she loved the idea of naming her “Pablo the Pom.”
Whatever it is, we’re sure it’ll be adorable!
