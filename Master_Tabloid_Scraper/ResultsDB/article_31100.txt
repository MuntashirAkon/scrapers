The deceased’s daughter also wants the tennis player to submit “Any and all medical bills, copies of prescriptions, medical reports, hospital records, bills, statements or invoices” in regards to any injuries she sustained because of the crash, as well as her driving history for the past seven years.
Among her lengthy list, she asked Williams to give the court “any bills for the month of the crash for the cellular telephone, satellite phone, iPhone, smartphone, iPad, computer and any other wireless communication device” that she owns.

The tennis pro, 37, previously asked for a protective order to prohibit Audrey Gassner-Dunayer from getting her car’s data without her own experts present at the scene. A judge ruled in Williams’ favor.
Williams was slapped with the wrongful death lawsuit on June 29 after she slammed into Linda and Jerome’s car on June 9, and police reports indicated that she was “at fault” for the wreck.
Jerome died 13 days after the crash on his wife’s 68th birthday.
