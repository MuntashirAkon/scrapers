Tennis great Venus Williams broke down in tears today, after she was asked about a car crash she was involved in last month that resulted in the death of a 78-year-old Florida man.
“There are really no words to describe, like, how devastating and — yeah,” Williams said after winning her first-round match at Wimbledon. “I’m completely speechless. It’s just — yeah, I mean, I’m just …”
At that point, her voice stopped, and the tears started flowing. After a few moments of silence Williams admitted, “Maybe I should go.”

As Radar reported, Williams, 37, is being sued by the estate of Jerome Barson, who, according to police, died 13 days after the athlete drove through a red light in Palm Beach County, Fla., triggering the accident.
Williams was not cited or charged in the crash but the lawsuit still seeks unspecified damages.
On Friday, Williams released a brief statement on Facebook about the crash:
