Time flies when you’re a mom.

Jessica Simpson couldn’t believe her eyes when she watched her first daughter, Maxwell Drew, walk the procession at her preschool commencement. Like any proud mother would, the singer-turned-designer snapped plenty of photos of the 5-year-old in her graduation cap and gown.
“Someone is excited for kindergarten! How do all you moms do it? I need help,” Jessica, 36, wrote on Instagram.
“Spread your wings and prepare to fly for you have become a butterfly,” she added in the captions of another photo. “#kindergartenherewecome #MAXIDREW.”

Jessica, who also shares 3-year-old son Ace Knute with husband Eric Johnson, opened up last month about potentially having more children. Though recent rumors suggest she’s pregnant again, the mom-of-two revealed she has no plans to expand her family… for now.
“We got an IUD, nothing is going to get into that uterus,” she joked on The Ellen DeGeneres Show. “I have two beautiful children and I’m not having a third. They’re too cute! You can’t top that.
