Venus Williams Not Clear Of Wrongful Death Lawsuit Yet â€” Family Of Car Crash Victim Now Demanding Prescription & Phone Records/n

It seemed Venus Williams had gone from at fault to in the clear after video of her fatal car accident had shown she had not illegally entered the intersection.
But the estate of the late Jerome Barson is not giving up its wrongful death lawsuit just yet.
According to TMZ, lawyers have now filed a request for all of the tennis star's phone records to double check she wasn't on her cell just before or during the accident.

They have also asked for copies of any prescriptions for drugs Venus may have taken in the 72 hours before.
Police have already said Venus wasn't distracted by her phone and that drugs and alcohol played no part in the accident. Are the attorneys just grasping at straws?
