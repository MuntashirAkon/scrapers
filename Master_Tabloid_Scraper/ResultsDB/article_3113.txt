Ariel Winter Seeks Hunk…for New Dora the Explorer Spoof/n
The production team from the web series put out an ad today asking for a "male, 18-35, Hispanic. Suave, ripped, handsome. Like Diego from Dora the Explorer, but in a Michael Bay movie. Ariel Winter is attached."In CollegeHumor's first spoof, an action-movie trailer posted in July, viewers got a taste of badass Dora, done with Ariel and a (very suave, ripped and handsome) Adrian Gonzalez as Diego.So why isn't Gonzalez taking on the role again? That, amigos, remains a mystery.
