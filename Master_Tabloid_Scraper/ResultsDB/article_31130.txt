 He’s the hardest working man in the biz, and James Franco now has a new look for his latest role.
The Spring Breakers star, who seems to be filming ’round the clock, has shaved his head for his next film, Zeroville.
A well-coiffed Franco, 36, (above photo) attended a photocall for his documentary The Director in Rome on Wednesday (September 3), and later took to Instagram to debut the new ‘hairdo.’

“Get ready for ZEROVILLE.“

“Bald as a mutha!“
Franco stars as Ike Jerome (nicknamed ‘Vikar’) in Zeroville, based on the 2007 novel by Steve Erickson about the film industry in the 1970s. The Palo Alto actor optioned the rights to the book in 2011, and plans to direct the movie as well.
Zeroville centers around 24-year-old Vikar, an architecture student who goes to Hollywood in 1969 to pursue a career in filmmaking.

Vikar, who has been heavily influenced by American cinema, has a tattoo of A Place in The Sun stars Elizabeth Taylor and Montgomery Clift on his head, which explains why Franco needed to go bald for the role.
The film features various cameos by iconic screen legends of the 1970s, including Robert De Niro, Margot Kidder, Ali MacGraw and Brian De Palma.
