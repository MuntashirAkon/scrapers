Listen to a Brand New Michael Jackson Song, ‘Love Never Felt So Good’/n
With just a week until the release of Xscape, the posthumous Michael Jackson, here is the first single off the album, “Love Never Felt So Good.” It made its premiere at the iHeartRadio Music Awards Thursday night; its sound is classic Michael Jackson.
“Love Never Felt So Good” was written with Paul Anka in 1983, though it’s been “contemporized” for its 2014 release. It features production work from Timbaland, Rodney Jerkins, Stargate, Jerome “J-Roc” Harmon and John McClain, the co-executor of Jackson’s estate.
