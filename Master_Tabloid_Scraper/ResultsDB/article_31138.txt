Picks and Pans Review: To Judge from This Memoir (cowritten with Jerome), Bowen Passed the Test. Following a Brief Spin as a Teen Sensation in the '50s, He Rose to Become the Not-So-Invisible Hand Guiding Some of Pop Music's Biggest Stars./n
After all, Bowen insisted that Dean Martin record “Everybody Loves Somebody,” handed Frank Sinatra the music to “Strangers in the Night” and urged Reba McEntire to return to her traditional country roots.
Bowen’s ego rivals his knack for choosing a hit, but his story remains a coherent—and deliciously gossipy—musical revue, from the rock-and-roll ’50s to the Nashville ’80s. (Simon and Schuster, $23)
