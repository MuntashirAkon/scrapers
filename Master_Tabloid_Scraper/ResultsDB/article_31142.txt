Game of Thrones has some fans quoting Dido's "White Flag" when it comes to Jon Snow (Kit Harington) and Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke): "I will go down with this ship…"In season seven, episode six of Game of Thrones, Dany came to Jon's rescue, lost a dragon in the process, and felt a lot of emotions throughout the whole thing. It looks like Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen—Jany? Danow?—are on the path to power coupledom."She's always been willing to risk her life to do what she thinks is right. In terms of going North to rescue them, the number of people up there have a number of claims on her heart," co-creator David Benioff said in a behind-the-scenes video about the big episode.

"I don't think either one of them really knew exactly how powerful their feelings were towards each other until these moments. Just the notion of falling for someone, that involves weakness, it's not something a queen does. But she feels that happening and he feels it happening for her," Benioff said. "I think both of them are on kind of unfamiliar ground, especially because it's with an equal.""It's kind of hard for her at that point I think not to look at this guy and realize this is not like the other boys," Weiss said. Maybe because he's (probably) her nephew?!So, it's only a matter of time before the queen gets herself the King in the North. He did call her "my queen" after all…
