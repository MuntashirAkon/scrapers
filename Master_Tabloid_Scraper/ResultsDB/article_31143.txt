Hey, remember when Jon Snow touched Daenerys Targaryen's dragon, Drogon, on Game of Thrones? It was a huge moment that might be tied to a bigger reveal about the King in the North."I quite liked that moment with the dragon," Kit Harington, Jon Snow himself, said in a behind-the-scenes video from HBO. "I think there was something I wanted to bring to it, which was quite animalistic. Animals go on the smell of something. If you're coming up to a horse, you want it to sniff you before it trusts you. Hopefully that worked with the dragons. If you show quite a vicious animal fear, it will jump on that, but if you show it bravery, it will respond in a different way."

While it has yet to be 100 percent officially confirmed that Jon Snow is Prince Rhaegar Targaryen's son, it's largely assumed that he is the product of the prince and Lyanna Stark. In the fifth episode of season seven, Gilly (Hannah Murray) and Samwell (John Bradley) discovered Prince Rhaegar Targaryen had a secret marriage. They didn't say with whom, but it could mean Rhaegar and Lyanna were married when Jon Snow was conceived and he has a rite to pretty much every seat.For Daenerys (Emilia Clarke), Rhaegar's sister and probably Jon Snow's aunt, seeing Jon with her dragon was an eye-opening moment."She sees his interaction with her dragons and it's an attractive quality for her," Clarke said.

Jorah offered his service once again and Daenerys surprised everyone by embracing him. "It's one of the most tender moments you'll see from Daenerys this season," Clarke said.Get more lowdown on the scene in the video above.

Game of Thrones airs Sundays, 9 p.m. on HBO.
