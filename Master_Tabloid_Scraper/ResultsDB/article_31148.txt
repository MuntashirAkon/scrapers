"Tell Sansa her sister's home." And with that, the remaining Stark kids all finally got back together on Game of Thrones."The inspiration for the scene was Odysseus returning after his long wanderings, no one recognizes him," co-creator David Benioff said.Maisie Williams' Arya Stark has been through, well, pretty much everything. This is her first time home, so naturally it was emotional. But, "the second she comes home she realizes it's not the same place," co-creator D.B Weiss said.The reunion between the Stark sisters was a long time coming for Game of Thrones. At Comic-Con, Sophie Turner teased the meetings between Sansa, Arya and Bran (Isaac Hempstead-Wright).

And then there was the big showdown between Arya and Brienne of Tarth (Gwendoline Christie). That was really an eye-opener for Sansa, the executive producers said."It's an incredible moment when Arya walks into the courtyard and Brienne says â€˜nice sword,'" Christie told EW. "When she first sees Arya, it's not just that she sees the living embodiment of Catelyn Stark, but also she sees something of herself in another young girl. I don't think Brienne has seen something of herself in somebody like that before. So when she hears Arya has returned to Winterfell, and sees Arya dressed not entirely dissimilarly to Brienne, it's not just that feels like part of Catelyn Stark is alive but that she's now in a position of education. It's a very distant form of parenting for Brienne and not one she ever thought she'd have."
