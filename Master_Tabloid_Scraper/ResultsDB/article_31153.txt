TMZ obtained the audio, and one witness emotionally described the accident with glass everywhere, and at least one person, Jerome Barson, left badly bleeding from his arm and leg. He died 2 weeks later from his injuries. The caller also says Venus was able to get out of her car and walk, while Jerome and his wife, Linda were badly injured and unable to exit their vehicle. She eventually recognizes Venus, and says  "she was unfortunately at fault. " As we first reported ... the attorney for the Barson estate -- which is suing Venus for wrongful death -- says vehicle data from Venus' SUV shows she went from 0 to 19.9 MPH in about 4.2 seconds as she tried to clear the intersection.
