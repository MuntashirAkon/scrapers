Jay Z -- Signs Huge Soccer Star ... I'm Global Now, Bitches/nAnother HUGE move for Jay Z's sports agency -- which just signed one of the biggest soccer stars in the world ... opening the door to HUGE CASH for Roc Nation Sports in the world of international soccer.   Jay just locked up Bayern Munich defender Jerome Boateng -- a World Cup champion who plays for Germany's national team.   BTW, he's 26 years old and a rising superstar ... so, it's a huge get for Jay, who personally signed Boateng at his private villa.   Boateng -- the 1st European athlete to sign with Roc Nation -- told a German media outlet,  "It was a great day with Jay Z. We could ask him anything. "   "We mostly talked about music and football. Jay Z knows about football and has watched numerous games. " It's been a helluva summer for Jay -- who played a key role in helping Dallas Cowboys star Dez Bryant sign a brand new $70 million contract (with $45 million guaranteed).   /n
