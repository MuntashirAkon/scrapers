Jerome Bettis: Hey Eddie George ... BREAK A LEG!/nWhen Eddie George made his BROADWAY DEBUT Tuesday night as the star of  "Chicago " ... he got support in the crowd from another NFL legend ... THE BUS!!! FYI, George became a serious actor after his NFL career and recently locked up the role of Billy Flynn in the Tony Award winning play. Tuesday was Eddie's DEBUT -- and the first time he's ever had to sing in front of an audience -- and his old pal Jerome Bettis was right there in the crowd to cheer him on. Eddie's wife was also in the crowd -- ex-SWV singer, Taj George. So far, we're hearing good things about Eddie's performance. We're workin' on video .../n
