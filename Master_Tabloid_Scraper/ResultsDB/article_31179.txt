Meeks, 33, and British heiress Chloe Green, 26, have embarked on a high profile fling this summer that has ended his marriage.
But that did not stop him flaunting the relationship yesterday much to the delight of billionaire Sir Phillip Green who owns the retail chain.
Mom-of-three Melissa has now removed any reference of him from her social media accounts.

Wearing ripped jeans and a coordinating T-shirt, the tattooed model put his striking looks to work as a cackling Chloe pouted at him as they stared at each other through the glass of the shop window.
The display will no doubt have upset a lot of people but at the moment the two lovebirds do not seem to care. Once he had finished his modeling stint the pair were photographed kissing one another as they made their way around the high end shopping area before leaving for his nearby hotel.
