Is that you, Ariel Winter?The Modern Family star—who has recently made headlines for her guardianship tug-of-war—tweeted photos of herself today dressed up as Dora the Explorer for an upcoming CollegeHumor video spoof.The impending witty webisode is a follow-up to the earlier Dora the Explorer: The Search for the Infinity Orb, in which Winter also starred as a butt-kicking, language-skills promoting version of the kiddie show favorite.

"Dora's back. And better than ever.... ;)," the 14-year-old star tweeted last night along with a photo of herself decked out in Dora gear. 

"Almost set for Dora! :)," she posted this morning along with another Instagram pic where she's presumably on her way to work, wearing minimal makeup and a blue baseball cap. Glad to see Ariel's staying busy with work.
