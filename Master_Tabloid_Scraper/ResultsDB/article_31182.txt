Emergency Surgery: Carnie Wilson's Breast Implants EXPLODE!/n
Carnie Wilson revealed a terrifying ordeal on The Talk this week, confessing that her breast implants ruptured recently, forcing her to undergo surgery.
“I’m scared to say what I’m about to say. I have to have a surgery,” The former Wilson Phillips front woman, 48, said of the emotional nightmare. “Sixteen years ago I lost a bunch of weight, and I had a breast lift and an augmentation and the implants have ruptured now. And so, I have to go have them taken out and face this reconstruction, which is really scary. I wasn’t sure if I was going to share it, but I am sharing it. . .it’s important.”
Despite the terrifying incident, Wilson managed to brave her way through it all.

“This is scary, and I’m going to face this and I’m going to get over it,” she explained of her process. “My mom said to me, ‘Carnie, this is going to be a little hurdle, a little bump, and it’ll all be in the past soon.'”
This isn’t Wilson’s first encounter with health issues. In 2013, the star revealed she was suffering from Bell’s Palsy. But after her implants exploded, Wilson thought twice about her decision to get them in the first place.
