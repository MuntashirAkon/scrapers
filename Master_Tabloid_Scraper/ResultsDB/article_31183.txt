 Mackenzie Philips: I'm FINALLY 'At Peace' 8 Years After Drug Arrest, Sex Abuse Claims.../n
Mackenzie Phillips had no idea how “crazy” the reaction would be to her first memoir, High On Arrival — but she has no regrets about coming forward with her story of sexual abuse and addiction.
“I am at peace with what I wrote, ” the One Day at a Time actress turned rehab counselor tells RadarOnline.com in an exclusive interview eight years after she first claimed she was raped by her late father, musician John Phillips, as a teen.
“I can’t go back and change the past, even if I wanted to.”

“Maybe I would do it differently, but I don’t regret writing the book at all.”
The 57-year-old star, who has remained sober since her 2008 arrest for cocaine and heroin possession at Los Angeles International Airport, says the opportunity to bring the dark issues into public discourse made the painful backlash all worth it.
“High on Arrival served its purpose in many ways, because it opened up at national dialogue about things that weren’t necessarily talked about,” she explains.

Now, nearly a decade later, the counselor at Brad Lamm‘s Breathe Life Healing Centers is moving forward to the topic of recovery in her second book, Hopeful Healing.
“It High on Arrival is the mommy, Hopeful Healing is the baby,” she says. “It’s not a memoir. It’s practical wisdom woven with personal stories.”
Since the book’s release earlier this month, Phillips has enjoyed a much more positive response from fans this time around.
“People are loving it,” she grins. “I’ve gotten a lot of terrific feedback.”
