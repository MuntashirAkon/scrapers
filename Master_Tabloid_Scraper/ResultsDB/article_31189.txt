Tyga Flashes Pricey Jewelry After Bizarre Court Meltdown/n
Tyga appears to be shrugging off his court meltdown that happened on Oct. 18. Kylie Jenner‘s boyfriend was already pulling his old stunts just days after asking to go home during trial because he felt sick.
The 26-year-old rapper was ordered to show up and face Jason Arasheben, who he owes $200,000 for some recent bling he bought from the celeb jeweler. But Tyga said he suddenly became forget and confused when he was being pressured to answer questions about the mega pricey gifts he’s given girlfriend Jenner, 19.

But a few days later on Oct. 21, Tyga magically seemed to be feeling better when he was caught taking a snapchat of some brand-new bling — a high-end Patek Phillipe watch that can cost up to six figures.

As RadarOnline.com previously reported, Tyga had a warrant out for his arrest earlier this year in August after he failed to attend a court hearing with his landlord. According to documents, the star’s landlord was suing him for nearly $500,000.

To add even more drama to his debt nightmare, at the end of August Tyga was spotted shopping for a brand-new Bentley, but faced humiliation when his Ferrari was repossessed that same afternoon.
Tyga’s over-generous presents — most recently a $200,000 Mercedes Benz — to his Keeping Up With The Kardashians reality star has already come under question in court.

Radar reported that Kylie keeps trying to save Tyga from his financial fiasco. She’s even got to the point of “begging” him to pay her back.
“He was shocked when she asked to be paid, telling her he thought the money was a gift, not a loan,” a source told Radar. “He’s a total loser and owes her over $2 million.”
“Kylie had no choice but to admit it all to Kris, who absolutely hit the roof,” added the insider. “She was always helping him, paying his legal bills when he was getting out of his record contract and she funding most of his latest album, which flopped.”
