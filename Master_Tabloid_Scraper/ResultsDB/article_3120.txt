Miley Cyrus has always been a vocal animal loverâ€”but in this exclusive behind-the-scenes featurette from The Voice, the new coach tells us exactly how many animals she actually owns.Spoiler: It's a LOT. Pretty much an entire farm's worth.In the clip above, Cyrus sits with her pitbull rescue Mary Jane, whom she's had for six years. "Is it weird that I have a dog named Mary Jane or is that what you would imagine my dog's name would be?" she asks.Cyrus grew up on a farm, so has always been surrounded by animals. "I see them as very psychic creatures. I feel like they see the rest of the world that we don't," she confesses.

Mary Jane is one of seven dogs including Dora, Tawny, Bean, Happy, Emu and Barbie (who is also sometimes called Little Dog). Then there are the three cats, two of which are sisters, Kiki, Lilo and Harlem.There are also two food-obsessed pigs, Pig Pig and Puddles, and two mini horses. Naturally! A family wouldn't be complete without two mini horses, whom Cyrus named Pumpkin and Dumplin', though sometimes they're referred to as Jerry and Freddie.

In case you don't want to do the math, here's the final tally of exactly how many animals Cyrus owns right now: seven dogs + three cats + two pigs + two mini horses = 14 animals in total. Yes, it's a lot, but be honest: Your Friday would be a LOT better if you got to snuggle with any of those 14 animals right now, pigs included.The Voice airs Mondays and Tuesdays at 8 p.m. on NBC.(E! and NBC are both part of the NBCUniversal family.)
