Phillippe was most recently linked to law student Paulina Slagter, whom he was engaged to before breaking it off in November after five years together.
He shares two children with ex-wife Reese Witherspoon, daughter Ava, 17, and son Deacon, 13. Phillippe also shares 5-year-old daughter, Kailani, with former girlfriend Alexis Knapp.
Perry split from boyfriend Orlando Bloom in late February, after a little over a year of dating. The “Chained to the Rhythm” singer recently dyed her signature dark brown hair platinum blonde, and revealed her boyish, buzzed cut on her Instagram story.
