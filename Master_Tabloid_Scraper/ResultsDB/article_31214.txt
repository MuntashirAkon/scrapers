Andy Cohen's AIDS Bombshell: Bravo Host Reveals Terrifying Doctor's Visit In Diaries/n
In his new collection of diaries, Superficial, Andy Cohen makes a very frank admission about his sexual health.
On September 15, 2014, the beloved Bravo host claims he underwent an AIDS test — and was full of fear during the process.
“Twenty-five years after I came out of the closet, sitting in a doctor’s office waiting for the results of an AIDS test hasn’t gotten any easier,” the 48-year-old bachelor writes in the honest entry. “How can that be?”
Cohen, who is currently dating Brazilian Harvard student Clifton Dassuncao, 28, swears he has practiced safe sex his “entire life,” but still isn’t immune from the “what if” terror.

“Every scenario runs through my head and all roads lead to the inevitable moment where everything changes,” he explains, adding fortunately that the test came back negative. “That didn’t happen today, and I breathed yet another sigh of relief.”
The Watch What Happens Live star and Real Housewives guru has long supported AIDS research and prevention. In 2015, while being honored by amfAR at a gala, he revealed he was “terrified” during the epidemic upon moving to New York in 1990.
“I was a gay 22-year-old taking advantage of everything the city had to offer and I was also terrified,” he said on stage. “I was really terrified that I was going to get sick and die.”
“Gay men everywhere were dying in droves. It seemed like a forgone conclusion. What’s different 25 years later is that we have powerful drugs that are keeping people alive, allowing people with HIV to live a relatively normal lifespan. But what hasn’t changed is that today, gay men are still disproportionately affected by HIV.”
