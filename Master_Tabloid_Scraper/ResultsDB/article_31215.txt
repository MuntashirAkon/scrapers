 It's Over! Andy Cohen Dumps Boyfriend After He Suspects Boy Toy Of Using Him For Fame.../n
Andy Cohen is back on the market after ending his romance with his much-younger boyfriend. RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned the Watch What Happens Live host dumped the 28-year-old because he believed he was using him for fame!
“His boyfriend wanted to attend the MET ball with Andy and Sarah Jessica Parker and that was the last straw,” a source told Radar of Clifton Dassuncao.
Since the split Cohen, 47, has been travelling with friend Anderson Cooper.

“He is happy to expose the life of his A-list friends, but if he thinks for one second that anyone is using him to get famous, he dumps them,” the insider revealed.
But Dassuncao’s alleged thirst for fame wasn’t the only reason Cohen ended the relationship.
“Andy cannot love anything but fame,” the source said. “The couple split shortly after it was exposed that Andy was dating. He refuses to share the spotlight with anyone that isn’t a bigger star than himself.”

Radar confirmed the romance when Dassuncao’s father revealed the two were keeping their relationship a secret.
“He didn’t tell me anything,” Heler Dassuncao told Radar in April. “I’m surprised, but I would welcome him.”
The Harvard PhD student posted a photo with Cohen at a WWHL taping over the summer. In December, they were photographed on a yacht in the Caribbean.
