Secret Romance? Andy Cohen's Much Younger New Man Keeping Relationship From Family/n
Andy Cohen and his new man are keeping their rumored romance a secret – and that includes hiding it from family! Clifton Dassuncao‘s father exclusively revealed to RadarOnline.com how he has been kept in the dark about the relationship and how he feels about the odd paring.
“He didn’t tell me nothing,” Heler Dassuncao said of his son’s possible relationship with Cohen.
Although the Watch What Happens Live host is 19 years older than his 28-year-old son, Heler admitted the age difference doesn’t bother him if they are dating.
“I’m surprised, but I would welcome him,” he said. “I love my son.”

Although Heler has never heard of Cohen, 47, he revealed whether or not he would approve of his son dating someone in the public eye.
“It’s like all other relationships,” he said of the Bravo host’s celebrity status.
The Harvard PhD student sparked romance rumors when he posted a photo of the duo during a WWHL taping over the summer. In December, Clifton and Cohen set sail on billionaire Barry Diller‘s yacht in the Caribbean.
They were most recently spotted last week when they were photographed on the yacht while in Miami.
