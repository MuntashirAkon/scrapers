 Ebony Editor Slams ‘Trash Bag’ Khloe K For KKK Joke: ‘Show A Modicum Of Respect’.../n
Khloe Kardashian has stuck her Louboutin in her mouth again. After the famously quick-witted Kardashian sister posted a joke about the KKK on her Instagram Tuesday night, critics were swift to slam the seemingly tasteless move, with one editor even calling her a “trash bag!”
Kardashian kicked off the furor when she posted a pic of herself with sisters Kim and Kourtney that read, “The only KKK to let black men in,” and captioned it “True.”

“Wow Khloe Kardashian, you are a trash bag,” Ebony Senior Digital Editor Jamilah Lemieux tweeted in response. “…I checked her IG, hoping it was a hoax.”
“Now just waiting for the ‘I got hacked’ tweets to start!” Lemieux wrote.
“Date the whole NBA, who cares?” she continued. “But show a modicum of respect. The Klan killed and terrorized our people. Ironically she was Black girls’ fave one of the group because she’s witty and a size 8. Ugh. Black men the only ones defending her. …”

Other twitter users chimed in, “IDK maybe it’s just me, but if I were attracted to and slept with and married black men, I might not make KKK jokes, just a thought.”
User @DerrickClifton wrote, “If you’re a white woman (ahem Khloe) who’s dated or married a black man, one would assume you’d get why a KKK joke isn’t even remotely funny.”
“Khloe Kardashian disgusts me,” @xodanix chimed in.
