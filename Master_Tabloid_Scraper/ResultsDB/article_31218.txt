 'Baby High’ Horror Story: Former MTV Star Madeleine Cornish Charged With Animal.../n
A week after PETA slammed Teen Mom 2 cast member Jenelle Evans for screaming at her dogs and leaving them in tiny crates on a recent episode of her reality show, another MTV star is being accused of abusing animals.
Madeleine Cornish, who appeared as a teen mother and high school student on 2010 MTV series Baby High, has been arrested and charged with animal cruelty and tampering with physical evidence, a felony, after allegedly abandoned her mastiff puppy.
According to Louisville, Kentucky station Wave 3 News, the 22-year-old moved homes and left her dog, Benson, behind without food or water  for three weeks. When she returned to the home, she picked up the dehydrated, malnourished pup and allegedly dropped him off on a local street instead of saving his life.

The pup was discovered wandering around Louisville’s Clifton neighborhood on July 10, and was promptly taken to Blue Pearl Hospital. According to animal cruelty non-profit The Arrow Fund, the dog, now named Hank, is slowly getting healthy.
“He’s gaining his weight back, his blood levels are coming back into the normal range, he’s definitely responding to it, his coat is looking better and he’s feeling better,” The Arrow Fund vice president Leslie Spetz told WLKY.
