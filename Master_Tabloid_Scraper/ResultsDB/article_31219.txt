How much more will Teresa Giudice take? After multiple reports about her husband, Joe Giudice, stepping out with other women, RadarOnline.com has uncovered yet another photo of the legally challenged reality star getting handsy with a mystery brunette.
It’s unclear when the photo, which surfaced on Twitter early last month and was quickly deleted, was taken. But it is obvious that the butt Joe has his palm on in the pic does not belong to Teresa.
The shocking photo is just the latest dagger to the heart for the Real Housewives of New Jersey star, who is currently facing 41 federal counts of financial fraud and tax evasion.
