Joe Giudice's Court Date In Driver's License Debacle Delayed/n
By Adam S. Levy – Radar Staff Writer
A hearing for The Real Housewives of New Jersey‘s Joe Giudice in his ongoing driver’s license fraud case was postponed this week for undisclosed reasons, RadarOnline.com has learned.
As we previously reported, authorities said the 42-year-old husband of reality star Teresa Giudice faked being his brother, Pietro, to get a license in June 2010 after his own was suspended following a DWI five months earlier. Officials say he fraudulently used his younger brother’s marriage and birth certificates to obtain the license.
The ruse was uncovered after Pietro was stopped by police in March 2011 — and Joe’s image came up in the officer’s search.

The burly reality star, who earlier turned down a plea deal of five years imprisonment, is being represented by Clifton, New Jersey attorney Miles Feinstein, who claims his client is being harshly punished because of his fame.
Joe spent 10 days in custody in connection with driving without a license two years ago, a stint he compared to a vacation.

Giudice will return to court October 29 in Paterson, New Jersey before New Jersey state Superior Court Judge Greta Gooden Brown. At that time, a trial date will be set. If convicted, he faces up to 10 years in prison.
The Real Housewives of New Jersey‘s reunion special continues Sunday on Bravo at 10/9c.
