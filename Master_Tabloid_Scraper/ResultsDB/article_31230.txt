Charlotte Ronson's Cocktail Jam Cuties/n
It was a hipster’s haven at the Charlotte Ronson and JC Penney Spring Cocktail Jam at Milk Studios on Tuesday night, where stars like Nikki Reed, Shenae Grimes and Mischa Barton indulged in a night of fashion And Foreigner?  Nikki looked super cute in a sweetheart strapless, showing off a new, and rather interesting hairdo, while Mischa Barton, who has been in questionable fashion as of late, looked tastefully threaded in all black.

Charlotte’s pops and his iconic band took to the stage, performing for Charlotte and her fashionable friends, some of who were wearing styles from her very own collections. While the overall look was fun, young and edgy, with short hemlines and funky, hipster elements, like high-waisted pants and floppy hats, a few starlets got dressed up in sexy cocktail attire.
