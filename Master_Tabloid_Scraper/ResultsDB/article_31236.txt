Olympic Basketball Player & WNBA Star Elena Delle Donne Comes Out — See What She Said About The 'Excitement' Of This Moment!/n

WNBA star Elena Delle Donne isn't here to make a spectacle of her sexuality — but she isn't hiding it either!
According to reports, an article in Vogue states the Chicago Sky athlete is engaged to her girlfriend Amanda Clifton – the first public acknowledgement of her sexual orientation.
The 26-year-old has always kept her dating life private, but has lately been more open about sharing her personal life through social media, including flaunting her engagement ring in a teaser video to USA Basketball's Facebook page.

After news spread of her engagement, the league-MVP confirmed her sexuality on Wednesday while preparing for the upcoming Summer Olympics in Rio, where she will represent the USA in basketball later this month.
Speaking to the Chicago Tribune, she said: 

"I decided I'm not at all going to hide anything. The biggest thing is respecting Amanda's privacy as well. She's not on the stage, she doesn't need to be interviewed and I don't want her to have to feel that way… As the future keeps moving on, I don't plan on having our relationship out in the public and all this media on it, but obviously there's excitement right now because people see it for the first time."
AH-Mazing! We totally respect the athlete for wanting to not make a big deal about her sexuality — because it shouldn't be a big deal at all!
Fuss or not, Delle Donne is just one of many athletes representing both her country AND the LGBT community at the Olympic Games — see more gay athletes to watch out for at Rio HERE!
