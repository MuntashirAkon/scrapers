Andy Cohen Has Reportedly Been Snatched By THIS Hot Harvard Student!/n

Welp, the day has come where we finally have to admit Andy Cohen is off the market.
Rumor has it the 47-year-old TV personality is dating Harvard PhD student Clifton Dassuncao â€” and reportedly has been for quite some time!
According to DailyMail, the two were first photographed together last July on the set of Watch What Happens Live, but the 28-year-old made his Instagram private after speculation of their relationship started swirling in the media.
That makes it even more suspicious, if you ask us!!

Most recently, the pair were spotted vacationing on Barry Diller's yacht and even at lunch with Kelly Ripa and her husband Mark Consuelos (below).

Notice Andy's hand on Clifton's shoulder! Heyo!
So who's the lucky guy?
Turns out, Dassuncao has quite the resumÃ©. He supposedly attended private school in Manhattan before going to undergrad at MIT and Harvard for his Masters and PhD.
Not too shabby!!!
If this is true, congrats to the happy couple!
