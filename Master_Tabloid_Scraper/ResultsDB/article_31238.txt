Karrueche Tran Steps Up Her Acting Game! Watch Her In The Funny Trailer For A Weekend With The Family!/n

Like many models before her, Karrueche Tran is expanding her resume by taking on a new movie role!
And while A Weekend With The Family doesn't look like it's going to win any Oscars, the comedy does offer a fresh look into multicultural families — with some hilarious twists, of course!
In the film, Chris Brown's ex will be playing Courtney, who surprises her boyfriend Travis (Marques Houston) with a weekend together joined by both of their families!

But the two households wage war when Courtney's strict Korean mother (Suzanne Whang) butts heads with Travis's "ghetto-fied" family, the Stankershets — played by the hilarious Wendy Raquel Robinson and Clifton Powell!
Can Travis find a way to make the two families peacefully co-exist so he can propose to the woman he loves!?
Watch the trailer (below) and go see Karrueche & Co. in A Weekend With The Family, in select theaters April 1!
