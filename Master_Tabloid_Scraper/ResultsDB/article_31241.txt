History lovers, rejoice. Betsy Ross will be making her television debut soon!
Rather, Nikki Reed will be playing our nation’s historic first flag maker in the upcoming season of Fox’s Sleepy Hollow.

The Hollywood Reporter reports that “Ross is described as sexy with an unsuspecting physical prowess. She’s the famous seamstress known and loved for sewing the nation’s first flag by day, but by night she’s a dynamic colonial insider, a secret operative within George Washington’s mysterious ring of spies.”
Sounds juicy.

Sleepy Hollow co-creator and executive producer Len Wiseman commented, “We are all very excited to welcome Nikki Reed into the world of Sleepy Hollow. Nikki’s the perfect choice to bring a smart and sexy edge to our show’s twisted version of American icon, Betsy Ross.”
It was also noted in season 1 and 2 that Ross was a former flame of Tom Mison’s character Ichabod Crane.
The Thirteen and Twilight star has notoriously been gallivanting around beautiful cities with new husband Ian Somerhalder for the past couple of months. Luckily for the beautiful couple, they will both be shooting their respective tv shows in Atlanta, as that’s where Somerhalder films The Vampire Diaries. 
Clifton Campbell of The Glades is also joining the cast, and taking over the role of showrunner in light of Mark Goffman’s departure.
