Ju$t How Much Did Teresa and Joe Giudice Allegedly Get Away With?/n
Teresa and Joe Giudice are no strangers to legal run-ins since they’ve become the most infamous married couple on The Real Housewives of Jersey for the last five seasons.
Here’s a refresher of their run-in rundown:
January 14, 2010: Joe was charged with a DWI, reckless driving, careless driving and failure to maintain a traffic lane in Montville Township, New Jersey. After being released from the hospital, Clifton police discovered outstanding warrants for his arrest for violating city ordinances.
September 20, 2010: Joe turned himself in to police for a 10-day sentence after driving with a suspended license.
February 23, 2011: Joe along with co-star Caroline Manzo’s sons, Albie and Christopher, were detained and questioned by Dominican Republic police for their part in a violent bar brawl, which resulted in a lawsuit filed by the alleged victims.
March 25, 2011: The 43-year-old buff businessman faces 10 years in prison after being arrested on fraud charges for allegedly obtaining a driver’s license using his brother’s identification.
Now the legally challenged pair have been charged by feds in New Jersey with 39 counts of fraud, including bilking banks out of millions over a span of eight years to the tune of nearly $5 million.
According to the indictment made public on July 29, the U.S. Attorney’s Office outlines their alleged systematic conspiracy to obtain more and more money through repeated false claims on legal documents.
Here’s how the feds have broken it down:
December 21, 2001: In an attempt to get a mortgage loan with HomeComings, Teresa allegedly stated on the application and through tax forms and pay stubs she was employed as an executive assistant making $3,750 a month with Modern Era Investment Corp. The U.S. Attorney’s Office claims she was never employed, yet she received a mortgage loan of $121,500.
June 2004: On another loan application, Teresa stated she was a self-employed owner of G&G Stucco earning $14,750 a month, which feds claim she fraudulently asserted and in return received a loan from Eastern American for $20,200.
March 2005: On two more loan applications authorities allege Teresa falsely stated she was a self-employed owner of G&G Stucco with a monthly salary of $12,100. On March 18, 2005, she received home loans in the amount of $141,550 from Alterna.
November 2005: Joe and Teresa submitted fraudulent tax returns for another loan application. On January 20, 2006, the couple received $800,000 in a construction loan from Park Avenue.
December 2006: Joe allegedly fraudulently applied for a loan from Wachovia and after being approved took out $251,360 in a home equity line of credit between 2006 and 2009.
February 2007: Joe applied for another loan with Wachovia and based on false tax returns and W-2 forms took out $170,252 from their home equity line of credit.
February 2008: Teresa and Joe fraudulently obtained a construction loan through Sterling for $1.7 million.
July 2008: Teresa and Joe falsely stated on a loan application with CBBC that they have a private bank account containing a whopping $500,000 and were subsequently approved for a mortgage loan of $1.72 million.
Since news of the charges broke early Monday, Teresa’s attorney told Celebuzz she plans to plead not guilty at a hearing scheduled for July 30.
The Housewife also spoke out for the first time standing by her husband: “Today is a most difficult day for our family. I support Joe and, as a wonderful husband and father, I know he wants only the best for our lovely daughters and me,” said Teresa, who has four children with Joe. “I am committed to my family and intend to maintain our lives in the best way possible, which includes continuing my career. As a result, I am hopeful that we will resolve this matter with the Government as quickly as possible.”
The reality stars are facing up to 50 years for charges of conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud, bank fraud, making false statements on loan applications and bankruptcy fraud, while Joe (real name Giuseppe) has also been charged separately with failure to file his tax returns from 2004 to 2008 after earning nearly $1 million.
