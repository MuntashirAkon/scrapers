 Hello, New York!
Mallory Hytes Hagan of New York is bringing the crown to the Big Apple. The 23-year-old beauty from the Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn, N.Y. was crowned Miss America 2013 on Saturday night during the annual competition, held in Las Vegas’ Planet Hollywood.
Miss South Carolina, Ali Rogers, was named runner up while Miss Oklahoma, Alicia Clifton placed third.
Hagan, who performed a tap dance to a James Brown song for the talent portion of the competition, took home the big prize of $50,000 in scholarship money, along with a crown and a sash.

During the Q&A section of the competition, the Fashion Institute of Technology (F.I.T.) student answered a tough question about having armed guards in schools.

“I don’t think the proper way to fight violence is with violence. I think the proper way is to educate people on guns and the ways we can use them properly. We can lock them up, we can have gun safety classes, we can have a longer waiting period,” she said.
Hagan, who will now become an advocate for Miss America’s official charity, the Children’s Miracle Network, is the first New York winner in the competition in nearly three decades.
Vanessa Williams took home the prize in 1984, before forcing to resign months later over a nude photo controversy.
