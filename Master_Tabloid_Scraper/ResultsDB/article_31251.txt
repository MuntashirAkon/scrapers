Russian mobster (Kate Winslet) Directed by John Hillcoat, the film's cast also includes Casey Affleck, Woody Harreslon, Gal Gadot, Teresa Palmer and Clifton Collins Jr. Triple 9 is in theaters on Friday, Feb. 26. PS: If you're wond.../n
Triple 9 may be an action-packed movie about a bunch of cops but don't ask the stars of the movie if they know a lot of police jargon.We played a little game of "Police 411" with Norman Reedus, Aaron Paul, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Anthony Mackie to test their knowledge of law enforcement lingo and let's just say their guesses at cop talk were, well, quite imaginative.Our favorite? Reedus trying to explain BOLO.Click the video above for all the hilariousness.
