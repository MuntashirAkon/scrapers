He was just trying to make an extra buck!Jason Best thought he had a great idea when he decided to buy $650 in tickets to The Interview when a local theater announced it would be one of the few hundred to screen the movie. The Ohio resident bought the tickets to the screening at Esquire Theatre in Clifton, Ohio, and hoped to re-sell them online, but his plan was quickly foiled."I saw all the hype about The Interview on the 23rd and thought, 'hey, folks are selling these tickets in other cities and it seems like that's the thing to do right now so why not give it a shot so see how it goes,'" he said.Unfortunately for him, Sony Pictures Entertainment announced after he had made his bulk purchase that it would distribute the formerly banned satire online via Google Play, YouTube and Xbox, leaving Best out hundreds of dollars.

Thinking like any shopper, Best wanted to return the tickets because, according to WCPO, he thought the tickets were refundable; however when he tried to get his money back, the theater rebuffed him!"I thought I'd get my money back because the theater's website *very clearly* said the tickets were refundable," Best wrote in an email to WPCO.Esquire Theatre sells its tickets through MovieTickets.com, which states on its site that it doesn't issue refunds for special events. The Clifton theater was the only movie house to be screening the film in the chain, so the website considered it a special event. Theater manager Allyson Duncan added that it wouldn't give Best his money back because he intended to scalp the tickets, "which is illegal," she said.Do you think he should have gotten his money back?
