Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth: Full Reunion Is Just a Matter of Time/nAll signs point to Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth becoming a couple again, and we've learned the romantic reunion has been in the works for months.   Sources from their inner circle tell us they weren't surprised to see the exes hanging together in Australia this weekend, but they've been back in each other's lives since the fall. We're told Miley's not using the bf label yet for Liam, but they're well beyond the friend zone. Our sources say they've been in almost constant communication -- texting and FaceTiming -- and never really stopped loving each other, despite the break-up. She's been singing his praises to friends even more lately. We're told Miley came through for him a few weeks ago ... watching Liam's dog, Dora, when he was out of town./n
