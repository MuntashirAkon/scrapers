Jude and Sienna: Are They or Aren't They?/nHere at TMZ, we pride ourselves on staying on top of the celebrity dating world (maybe pride isn't the word, but you get it). But even we can't keep up with Jude Law and Sienna Miller. The pair were spotted out in London on Saturday night. The couple dined at the trendy Zuma restaurant and then went onto the Clifton pub. So, are they together? We thought she dumped his ass after the whole nanny-banging incident. They should either get married or break it off for good. We've got more important things to focus on -- like whether or not Lindsay and Harry are still together.  Related Articles      Breakup to Makeup: Sienna and Jude Back (Again)?
