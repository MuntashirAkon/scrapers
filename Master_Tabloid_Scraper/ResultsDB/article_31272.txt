Andy Cohen Cavorts with BF in St. Barth /nAndy Cohen is a little late for a  "Baywatch " audition, but he still looked good in red trunks, braving the warm waters of St. Barth with his boyfriend. In case you don't know, St. Barth is the  "everybody who's anybody " place to go for Xmas and New Year's, so A.C. was right there rubbing elbows. And speaking of rubbing elbows ... he brought along his BF, Clifton, whom Andy refers to as  "Brazilian Andy Samberg " in his book./n
