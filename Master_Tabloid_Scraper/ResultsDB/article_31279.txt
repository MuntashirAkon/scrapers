“I looked up at him, and before I could even answer he asked, ‘Wait, aren’t you the girl from the commercials?’” she wrote of their first encounter.
“’Yeah, that’s me,’ I said, still embarrassed …” she continued. “I was, in fact, the girl from the commercials. I had some interest in television news. I had even done an internship with CBS In New York City, working under Dan Rather in the news division, and because of that my dad had insisted I go on camera for the local TV ads he ran for his shop.”
