Accused Child Pornographer R. Kelly to Play Radio City/nR&B singer R. Kelly, who is awaiting trial for allegedly having sex with a 14-year-old girl and videotaping the experience, will be headlining next month at Radio City Music Hall in New York City.The venue is world famous for booking family acts such as Dora the Explorer, Blues Clues, and the Radio City Christmas Spectacular. Kelly's April 18 performance seems like a striking departure.Najee Ali, the head of Los Angeles-based Project Islamic H.O.P.E., protested R. Kelly when he performed in the LA area in 2003. Ali tells TMZ that he's upset by Kelly's upcoming performance: "For him to be allowed to perform at one of the world's most prestigious cultural music institutions, it sends a horrible message to society. This performance should be postponed until his court cases are settled."  Two years ago, the NAACP became embroiled in controversy when it nominated Kelly for an NAACP Image Award. Two weeks ago, Kelly received the first annual Stevie Wonder Award for Outstanding Career Achievements in Songwriting at the Soul Train Awards./n
