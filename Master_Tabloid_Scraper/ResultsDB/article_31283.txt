Richard Simmons' Brother On Fitness Guru's Disappearance: 'I Don't Understand It'/n
Richard Simmons‘ brother Lenny is just as mystified over his brother’s strange disappearance as the rest of the world, appearing on the new podcast Missing Richard Simmons to discuss the scandal.
“He’s not angry with anybody. I don’t understand it. I wish I did,” Lenny said in a preview clip of the episode, set to air next Wednesday.
As Radar readers know, the new podcast features Simmons’ friend, Daily Show producer Dan Taberski, looking for answers on why the fitness guru hasn’t been seen in public for three years.
Taberski’s podcast also includes interviews with those who knew Simmons before he fell off the fitness map. The star, 68, hasn’t been publicly spotted since 2014.

Last year, Simmons denied reports that he was a victim of elder abuse at the hands of his housekeeper, Teresa Reveles, telling Entertainment Tonight, “I am not kidnapped.”
As Radar reported, the National ENQUIRER found in 2015 that Simmons was reclusive, “frail, weak and spiritually broken,” and “in desperate need of help,” his ex-personal assistant Mauro Oliveira said. The year before, the frizzy-haired fitness guru had stopped returning phone calls and closed his famed Beverly Hills fitness studio.
