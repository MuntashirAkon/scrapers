As RHOA fans watched on the Bravo hit last night, Williams ditched Morton’s engagement party last minute, leaving the bride-to-be in tears. Though the controversial divorcee claimed she didn’t want to run into frenemy host Kandi Burruss, 40, at the glam soiree, Morton didn’t buy the excuse.
And, of course, in a previous episode, Williams seemed to encourage Phaedra Parks‘ rumors that Burruss and Morton, 35, were lesbian lovers.
“They are really close,” Williams told Parks and Sheree Whitfield.

After the episode aired, Morton seemed to respond to Williams’ diss on Instagram.
“When someone you consider a best friend will cosign a lie about you…it gives you a new definition of friendship!” she said in not-so-cryptic fashion.
