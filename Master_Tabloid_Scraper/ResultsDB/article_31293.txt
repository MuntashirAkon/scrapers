As Radar previously reported, the overweight 29-year-old exploded at Jones upon viewing Radar’s exclusive photos of the former Glee actor kissing his girlfriend, 28, earlier this year.
“Pilot should be glad he hasn’t seen Rob out and about,” a source said.
Kardashian isn’t the only angry side of the love triangle.
The hunky Jones is now demanding his former lover take an off-camera paternity test to prove the identity of her unborn child’s father.
“This is not a joke to him,” a source revealed. “He’s taking it seriously.”
