Sarah Palin Removes Kaepernick Article from Website ... 'Not Her Opinion'/nSarah Palin has removed an article from her website criticizing Colin Kaepernick's $50,000 donation to Meals on Wheels ... and we're told the post is NOT in line with the former governor's beliefs.As we previously reported, a story went up on SarahPalin.com Wednesday morning titled,  "SERIOUSLY? Colin Kaepernick Just Pulled ANOTHER Political Stunt. " The article was NOT written by Palin -- but it was posted on Sarah's official Facebook page with a comment saying,  "And he wonders why he can't find a job. " Now, we're told Sarah did NOT have a personal role in greenlighting the story, posting it on her site or Facebook page, or adding the additional comment. One source familiar with the situation tells us,  "This is not a view that Governor Palin holds. She has a long history of volunteering for Meals on Wheels and donating to them. "  "This was an opinion by a contributor to sarahpalin.com and as has since been removed. " We're told comments that Palin personally writes are signed with her initials. /n
