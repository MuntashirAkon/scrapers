PEOPLE is celebrating the Sept. 18 premiere of Dancing with the Stars‘ 25th season with 25 days of exclusive interviews, fun retrospectives, and new details about what fans can expect from the milestone season.
There must have been a little extra Disney magic to spare this year because — for the first time ever — Dancing with the Stars will have a Disney-themed episode during a fall season.
PEOPLE can exclusively confirm that season 25 of the ABC reality dance competition will feature a Disney night, Latin night, and a Guilty Pleasures Night.
Guilty Pleasures Night is a night of “guilty pleasure” dances (think “Gangnam Style” or “The Macarena”). The last Guilty Pleasure Night was during season 15 in 2012.
