The Ghostbusters reboot is officially Dan Aykroyd approved.TThe actor, who starred in the original 1984 movie and its 1989 sequel, recently saw a test screening of the new movie starring Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy, Leslie Jones and Kate McKinnon, and in a Facebook post Tuesday, the "originator of the original" franchise wrote up a rave review for the sure-to-be summer blockbuster."Apart from brilliant, genuine performances from the cast both female and male, it has more laughs and more scares than the first 2 films plus Bill Murray is in it!" Aykryod write. "As one of millions of man-fans and Ray Stantz, I'm paying to see that and bringing all my friends!"

Akyroyd, who is listed as a writer and producer for the Ghostbusters reboot, also has a cameo in the upcoming movie, but he won't be playing his original Ray Stantz character. The U.K. version of the Ghostbusters' trailer includes Akyroyd's cameo, and a fan-uploaded clip of that is making the rounds online. The Hollywood Reporter embedded a 6-second YouTube video which shows Akyroyd as a cab driver who tells a very terrified Erin Gilbert (Wiig), "I ain't afraid of no ghosts!" Still, we know who he should call... Ghostbusters hits theaters July 15.
