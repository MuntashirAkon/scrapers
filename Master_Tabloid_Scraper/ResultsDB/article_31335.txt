Snoop Dogg Mocks 'Crying Bitch' Daniel Cormier for Trash-Talking Jon Jones/nSnoop Dogg﻿'s calling out Daniel Cormier ﻿for  "crying like a bitch " after getting KO'd by Jon Jones -- mocking the former champ and telling him he had it coming.  "You see what (Jon) did to D.C. -- he had him crying like a bitch, " Snoop told TMZ Sports, ﻿before bustin' out an impression of Cormier on the mic. Snoop says Cormier deserved the beatdown cause he was  "talking all that sh*t " on Jones while he was suspended ... and it's bad form to kick a man when he's down.  Remember -- the UFC banned Jones after a hit-and-run incident in 2015 ... and again last year after a positive drug test. This ain't the first time the rapper has come at D.C. for trash-talkin' his boy Bones ... who Snoop and his UFC broadcast partner, Urijah Faber﻿, both wanna see fight Brock Lesnar next.  Snoop told us why he's picking Jones for that one too./n
