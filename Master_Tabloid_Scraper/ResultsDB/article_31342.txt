Tom Brady Continues to Wear All His Super Bowl Rings/nHere's Tom Brady doing the anti-Dan Marino -- sporting a fist full of Super Bowl rings ... 3 days after he added #5 to his collection. Why is he still wearing the hardware out in public? Why not? Wouldn't you? Brady and his wife /concussion whistle-blower Gisele were out celebrating Dia dos Namorados -- the Brazilian equivalent to Valentine's Day on Monday.Â  The location of the celebration is unclear -- but you can see Tom rockin' 4 rings as the event band busts out a custom freestyle about Tom and Gisele's healthy eating habits. For real though ... where's your 5th ring? (Anyone got eyes on Mauricio Ortega?)/n
