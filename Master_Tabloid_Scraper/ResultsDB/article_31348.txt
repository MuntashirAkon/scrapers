Happy Birthday 'Cash Me Outside' Girl Danielle Bregoli ... and Nice Tattoo/n "Cash Me Outside " girl Danielle Bregoli celebrated a big one Sunday night ... she just turned 14, and she says Dr. Phil's an  "asshole " for not wishing her happy birthday. Danielle has just about exhausted her 15 minutes, but there's no evidence her time is up. Quite the opposite, she just made a deal for a TV show and she dined at old line Dan Tana's in WeHo. BTW ... check out the tattoo ... it's real./n
