Bristol Palin Rips Obama -- Gay Marriage Is WRONG ... and So Is 'Glee'/n "Glee " is bad for America ... so says Bristol Palin ... who just took a shot at the show during an anti-gay marriage blog entry aimed at Barack Obama. Palin makes it clear -- she believes Obama is a weak, pathetic, stupid man for allowing his daughters to influence his opinion on gay marriage. In her blog entry, Palin writes,  "While it’s great to listen to your kids’ ideas, there’s also a time when dads simply need to be dads. In this case, it would’ve been helpful for him to explain to Malia and Sasha that while her friends parents are no doubt lovely people, that’s not a reason to change thousands of years of thinking about marriage. "The 21-year-old unwed mother continues,  "As great as her friends may be – we know that in general kids do better growing up in a mother /father home. Ideally, fathers help shape their kids’ worldview. " "I guess we can be glad that Malia and Sasha aren’t younger, or perhaps today’s press conference might have been about appointing Dora the Explorer as Attorney General because of her success in stopping Swiper the Fox. "Then comes the shot at  "Glee " ... as Palin continues,  "Sometimes dads should lead their family in the right ways of thinking. In this case, it would’ve been nice if the President would’ve been an actual leader and helped shape their thoughts instead of merely reflecting what many teenagers think after one too many episodes of Glee.
