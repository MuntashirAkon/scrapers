Blac Chyna Making Her Own Version of Barbies: Chyna Dolls/nBlac Chyna's out to prove Barbie dolls are out ... and Chyna dolls are the figurines of the future. The folks at My3DNA tell us ... Chyna had a shoot Wednesday to model several different looks for her dolls. Here's how it works -- they CGI scan her face and body and use 3D printing technology to make mini replicas. We're told Chyna began working on a collab in August, and now she's gearing up to release her line of dolls in May. There'll be 6-8 different versions in multiple sizes ... starting at around $75 a pop. My3DNA has produced figurines for other celebs like Drake, Steve Aoki, Dan Bilzerian and the cast of  "Black-ish " in the past.      ðŸ˜† Working on something for my Chyna Dolls A post shared by Blac Chyna (@blacchyna) on Mar 8, 2017 at 1:55pm PST/n
