NY Giants Kicker Josh Brown -- Ray Finkle Was a B*tch /nNY Giants kicker Josh Brown has a message for Ray Finkle -- YOU SHOULDA MADE THE FRICKIN' KICK ... even if the laces were in!!!!20 years after  "Ace Ventura " came out in theaters (yes, it's really been that long) ... we asked Brown how a real NFL kicker reacts when the holder pulls a Dan Marino and doesn't get the laces out. Brown's response -- MAKE THE KICK!!!!!  "The times that it does happen, you just gotta go through with it ... ya just gotta swing. "What you shouldn't do ... is plot a murderous revenge on the holder on the day of the Super Bowl. That never turns out well. /n
