Bill Murray will do more than just root for the Chicago Cubs during Game 3 of the World Series.

The actor is slated to sing “Take Me Out to the Ballgame” at Wrigley Field on Friday night (Oct. 28, 2016), according to The Hollywood Reporter. A spokesperson has confirmed that the performance will take place during the seventh inning stretch.
In honor of Murray’s upcoming gig, his clothing line, William Murray Golf, released a never-before-seen photo of the Saturday Night Live alum — then at six-years-old — clad in his Cubbies best.



Before Game 3 gets underway; a little something for the fans—a never before shared pic of #BillMurray. All this six-year old wanted was a @Cubs’ jacket, a hat and #WorldSeries title. Got the first two. Let’s make that third wish come true, #Chicago. #ThisIsTheYear #GoCubsGo #FlyTheW #WilliamMurrayGolf #ZFG

Recently, Murray crashed into the White House press room, where he was visiting to receive the Mark Twain Prize from President Barack Obama, to show his support for his beloved Cubs. After press secretary Josh Earnest wrapped an official briefing, the 66-year-old took the podium to respond to questions about the baseball team.
“I feel very confident that Clayton Kershaw is a great, great pitcher, but we’ve got too many sticks,” he told reporters, who played along by calling him “Mr. President.”
Currently, the Chicago Cubs and the Cleveland Indians are tied with one game each in the MLB World Series.
