Bill Murray as the president? Oh, hell yes! The funnyman recently popped into the White House press room after press secretary Josh Earnest wrapped the official briefing, and talked about his beloved Chicago Cubs winning the World Series.
Murray predicted his Cubbies will ultimately defeat the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League Championship Series to advance to World Series for the first time since 1945.
“I feel very confident that Clayton Kershaw is a great, great pitcher, but we’ve got too many sticks,” Murray told reporters, who played along calling him “Mr. President.”
According to CNN, the actor was really at the White House to receive the Mark Twain prize from President Obama.
