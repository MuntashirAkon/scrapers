Much to the chagrin of liberals and feminists alike (looking at you, Donald Trump)

The first Democratic Presidential Debate took place last night, and the Internet, as well as our nation’s finest celebrities, had much to say.

Hillary Clinton stood in between Bernie Sanders and Jim Webb (to her right) and Martin O’Malley and Lincoln Chafee (to her left) while bae Anderson Cooper moderated the event (much to our collective swoon) and made everyone on Twitter thirsty. According to The New York Times, Hillary Clinton emerged the victor amongst political commentators and Twitter alike, and  Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump held down the fort overall with his live-tweeting of the debate.

It’s just nice to see a group of people who aren’t attacking each other but are talking about the REAL issues and KNOW the facts. #DemDebate
— Kevin McHale (@druidDUDE) October 14, 2015



I’m behind, but yes @BernieSanders about @HillaryClinton’s emails. 🙌also, “No.” #DemDebate @CNN
— Kevin McHale (@druidDUDE) October 14, 2015


None of this matters if we don’t show up to vote! Educate yourself on the issues and VOTE next year! It’s cool. I promise. #DemDebate
— Kevin McHale (@druidDUDE) October 14, 2015



in terms of specifics and being about something- about issues, compared to republican debate–not even close!
— Michael Keaton (@MichaelKeaton) October 14, 2015


Night and day difference AND the democrats consistently disappoint me. ALSO, Anderson Cooper is doing a great job.
— Michael Keaton (@MichaelKeaton) October 14, 2015



Is it just me or is Bernie Sanders winning this debate?
— Patricia Heaton (@PatriciaHeaton) October 14, 2015


I get anxiety at how exasperated @BernieSanders gets. @andersoncooper is doing a great job.
— Bethenny Frankel (@Bethenny) October 14, 2015



I assume @SherylCrow is the only pair of leather pants we’ll see during this debate.
— Bethenny Frankel (@Bethenny) October 14, 2015


Politicians + vegas= ?????
— Bethenny Frankel (@Bethenny) October 14, 2015



Yup @BernieSanders we’re over the email thing. @HillaryClinton game is tight right now.
— Bethenny Frankel (@Bethenny) October 14, 2015


I am more concerned about the speckles on @BernieSanders jacket then @HillaryClinton emails.
— Bethenny Frankel (@Bethenny) October 14, 2015



Hey CNN– your opening sequence for the Democratic Debate probably shouldn’t feel like a Mayweather fight.
— Seth MacFarlane (@SethMacFarlane) October 14, 2015


So excited to see @HillaryClinton in action tonight, let’s all listen in and hear the facts #letsgohillary

Making a bucket of Debate Bolognese. Verrrrry spicy with a hint of passive aggression. Not for the faint of tongue. #DemDebateCantWait — olivia wilde (@oliviawilde) October 13, 2015

 

Its a miracle anyone wants to be President. Anderson Cooper was great and Jim Webb never recovered from seeing Sheryl Crow in leather pants.

#DemDebate @BernieSanders you are killing it! You’d raise my taxes😕, but I understand. You hit all my other points, and I like it
— Raven-Symonè (@ravensymone) October 14, 2015


#DemDebate love the fact they are debating, and showing kindness to one another, rather than being cut throat. Nice change!
— Raven-Symonè (@ravensymone) October 14, 2015


#DemDebate tell it like it is Hillary! We have to stand #against the #NRA #EnoughIsEnough

Just like in the first Republican Presidential debate, there was the cacophony of Trump thanks to his Twitter feed. Here are some highlights:

I’d rather have Kanye as president than these jokers #DemDebate
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonldTrump) October 14, 2015



Should be interesting but too bad the three guys at《1% will be taking up so much time – but who knows, maybe a star will be born (unlikely)
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 14, 2015
 
We will all have fun and hopefully learn something tonight. I will shoot straight and call it as I see it, both the good and the bad. Enjoy! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 14, 2015
 

Get rid of all of these commercials. #DemDebate
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 14, 2015
 
Can anyone imagine Chafee as president? No way. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 14, 2015
 

O’Malley, as former Mayor of Baltimore, has very little chance.
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 14, 2015
 
All are very scripted and rehearsed, two (at least) should not be on the stage. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 14, 2015
 

Sorry, there is no STAR on the stage tonight!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 14, 2015
 
Sanders said only black lives matter – wow! Hillary did not answer question! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 14, 2015
 

Notice that illegal immigrants will be given ObamaCare and free college tuition but nothing has been mentioned about our VETERANS #DemDebate

One particularly charming moment was when Cooper said this about marijuana:
Coming up, some of the candidates have tried marijuana, as have, pretty much probably everbody in this room [audience laughs]. Others have not. Does it influence their views on legalization? Find out that and others ahead.

While the “victor” of the debate is perhaps debatable, no one argued against Anderson as moderator. In fact, his stans were all for his purple tie and glasses (and more):

was ready for a snoozer–big reason it was not?–Anderson Cooper

Can we switch either Chaffee or Webb out for Anderson Cooper? He is like the debate MVP. Let’s have Webb host it that way he gets to talk
— NÜ METAL KANYE WEST (@pterosaur) October 14, 2015
 

I’d like to think that @andersoncooper is offering all five #DemDebate participants a quick toke during this commercial break.
