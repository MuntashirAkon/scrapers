Lindsay Ellingson Marries Sean Clayton/n
Lindsay Ellingson is a married woman.   
The Victoria’s Secret Angel, 29, exchanged vows with medical equipment sales rep Sean Clayton in an intimate ceremony in Bluffton, South Carolina on Saturday, her rep confirms to PEOPLE.  
“Words can’t express the joy and happiness we have as we start the next chapter of our lives together with the support and love of our families and friends,” the couple said in a statement.   
Ellingson wore a dress designed by Sophie Theallet, accessorized with earrings and a bracelet by Kwiat, while her groom donned a Tom Ford tuxedo. The model’s rings were custom-made by Friman and Stein, while Clayton’s wedding band was by Van Cleef and Arpels.  
The newlyweds kept the affair small, inviting about 85 guests, and reportedly danced to Drake’s “Hold On, We’re Going Home” for their first dance.  
Clayton popped the question in November while the pair was visiting his parents in Ohio. They dated for six years.  
“My love proposed last month and I couldn’t be happier!” Ellingson told PEOPLE at the time.
