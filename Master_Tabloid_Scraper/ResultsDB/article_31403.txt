The Major League Baseball playoffs have been nothing short of electric so far—and we've been witnessing more than one kind of talent out on the field.The Kansas City Royals staged the most epic of comebacks against the Houston Astros on Monday to even up their series, the Los Angeles Dodgers' Chase Utley is the now the most wanted man in New York due to the most controversial slide since...well, ever—and the Chicago Cubs have been so great, fans seem to have completely forgotten that poor Steve Bartman is practically in witness protection.So are the Cubs on track to win their first World Series since 1908? And while Jon Hamm's Cardinals are out, there's still a chance to see Paul Rudd taking selfies with Royals fans. And surely Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis have their National League Championship Series tickets ready to roll in case the L.A. Dodgers topple the New York Mets in their decisive game five tonight!And will another groundskeeper be eaten alive by a field tarp?!
