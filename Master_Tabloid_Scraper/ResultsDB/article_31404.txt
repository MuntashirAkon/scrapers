Ellingson recently strutted her stuff at the 2013 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show and even modeled the Snow Queen Angel Wings, the show's first-ever use of 3-D printing. The glamorous accessory to the equally stunning lingerie was a collaboration between Victoria's Secret and Swarovski.In an interview with Fashionista.com before the highly anticipated show, Ellingson admitted she was "starting my prep now [in September]" and wanted to pack on a pound or two before she hits the runway."I like to add curves. I think it's sexier and more feminine to be more full," she said. "So, I add like almond butter, peanut butter, protein shakes to my diet, just to feel a little sexier and curvier."—Additional reporting by Maureen Heaton
