“Obviously, as you guys know, reality TV is not totally real, so he asked me as a friend to be on the show with him,” Rosa, 32, told Radar at the Versy App launch for Complex magazine. “And recreate a couple of things that may or many not have happened with other people.”
She also said she didn’t crash pregnant Blac Chyna‘s Emoji launch party last month — she was actually invited by Rob himself.
“I understand that people don’t know what happens behind the scenes, but obviously if I was there and we took pictures together and they allowed me to be there—it’s only because I was invited,” Rosa clarified, adding that she and Rob’s fiancée are actually good friends.

She’s making money, she has her new show, she’s having a baby, getting married, everything is going good for her. I’m actually truly happy for her.” /n
