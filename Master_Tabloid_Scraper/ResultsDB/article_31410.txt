Magic Johnson: Dodgers Will Win World Series, 'This Is Our Year' /nMagic Johnson ain't mincing his words -- guaranteeing his L.A. Dodgers are going ALL THE WAY this year and winning the World Series.  Magic grabbed the mic at Clayton Kershaw's Ping Pong 4 Purpose charity event at Dodger Stadium -- and told everyone straight-up,  "The Dodgers are going to win the World Series this year. "  "This is our year. " He then turned to the injured Kershaw and said,  "Get healthy, lead us. " No pressure, bro.  Could be a big year for Johnson -- since LaVar Ball has also guaranteed a deep playoff run for Magic's Lakers. /n
