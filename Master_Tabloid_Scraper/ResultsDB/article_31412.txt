'Boy Meets World' Star Left Dodgers Game EARLY, Misses Clayton Kershaw's No-Hitter/nDespite the fact she was with Ben Savage to throw out the first pitch,  "Girl Meets World " star Danielle Fishel says she MISSED Clayton Kershaw's historical no-hitter ... BECAUSE SHE LEFT EARLY!!!!There were rumors that Danielle and Ben peace'd out in the 4th -- but D.F. says it's not true ... she left WAYYY before that. "I left before the start of the 1st inning, " Fishel tells TMZ Sports ...  "I had been up since 3AM doing press [for the show]. "But Fishel says the fact she boned out early is a good thing for Dodgers Nation --  "Kershaw achieved something amazing. If I had stayed, I may have jinxed him. "Danielle explains ...  "I missed a chance to see history, but I live in Orange County and I have a husband and a dog and other responsibilities that come before having a good time at a Dodgers game, unfortunately. "  "I did everyone a favor because the stars aligned for the Dodgers that night. " /n
