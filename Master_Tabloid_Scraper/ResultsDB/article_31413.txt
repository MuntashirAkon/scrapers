Hero Cat Throws Out First Pitch ... With Help from Rescue Boy! /nShe's a regular Justin Purrlander ... or Clayton Furrshaw ... 'cause Hero Cat threw out the first pitch at a minor league baseball game tonight -- AND CRUSHED IT!!TMZ Sports has obtained pics of Hero Cat and Jeremy (pictured below) -- the little boy she saved from that vicious dog earlier this month -- taking the mound together at the Bakersfield Blaze game (the Class-A affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds). Of course, the now famous cat-beats-dog incident took place only miles from the stadium -- and the Blaze reached out to honor their hometown hero. We're told the crowd cheered like crazy for the pair -- and after the pitch, they stayed to take in the rest of the game from seats right near the CATcher. Ha./n
