'Cat Daddy' Rapper Jovan Clayton -- Fails to Surrender for Jail ... Bench Warrant Issued/nRapper Jovan Clayton failed to  "Cat Daddy " into court to begin a 4-month jail sentence ... so now a judge has issued a bench warrant for his arrest. As TMZ first reported, Clayton got 120 days in L.A. County lockup after he pled no contest to one count of receiving stolen property during a nightclub incident last April.  Clayton had until 8:30 AM Friday to surrender. Now that the bench warrant was issued ... a judge could possibly tack on additional jail time. We shot this video in April of Clayton getting out of jail, so ... imagine it in reverse ... once the law catches up to him./n
