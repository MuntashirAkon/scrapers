T.I. -- Stepdaughter Busted For Toting Gun at Airport (MUG SHOT)/nT.I.'s stepdaughter was busted for trying to get a gun through TSA at Hartfields-Jackson International Airport in Atlanta. Zonnique Pullins was arrested early Thursday morning after a TSA agent spotted the semiautomatic pistol in her purse ... with the help of an X-ray machine. We're told Pullins stated she had a weapons permit but didn't have the paperwork to prove it. It didn't really matter ... you can't carry a gun onto a plane.  Cops cuffed Zonnique and booked her for carrying a concealed weapon in an unauthorized area. She got out Friday AM. Pullins is the daughter of T.I.'s wife, Tiny, and member of the girl group O.M.G. /n
