Bill Murray Crashes White House Briefing/nLadies and gentlemen, please rise for the President of the Un ... BILL MURRAY!  Bill took over the podium in the White House's press briefing room on Friday -- but instead of talking politics, he was all about the NLCS ... and explained why the Dodgers are doomed.  Oh yeah, he happens to be a HUGE Chicago Cubs fan -- hence the pullover -- and warned Clayton Kershaw that his boys from Chi-Town are just too dominant for him. It's funny stuff ... Hail to the Ghostbuster./n
