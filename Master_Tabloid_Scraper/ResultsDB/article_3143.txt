 The Return Of Gretchen Rossi? ‘RHOC’ Vets Reveal Whether They’ll Return Next Season.../n
Jeana Keough is returning to The Real Housewives of Orange County but what about the other former housewives? Former stars of The Real Housewives of Orange County spoke out to RadarOnline.com about whether they might make a return to amp up ratings as well.
RHOC ladies man Slade Smiley’s original on-screen girlfriend, Jo De La Rosa, told Radar, “I have been living in L.A. for the last seven years working in digital advertising. They haven’t asked me to do the show since I’m not in Orange County anymore.”
Season Three cast member Quinn Fry also denied a rumored return. She told Radar, “I’ve sold my O.C. home and moved up to a nice home in Humboldt County, California.”

Just how far is her new life from the opulence of Orange County? She joked, “(I live) next to the pot growers, with bears in the backyard, and Sasquatch sightings!”
“I now need my own show,” Fry teased. “But no. Bravo has not called me as of yet.”
A source close to production also dished on Season Six cast member Peggy Tanous, claiming that she “hasn’t been asked back yet” and neither has Smiley’s current partner, the 36-year-old Gretchen Rossi, who is still at war with current housewife Tamra Judge.

Another production insider claimed it’s unlikely that Tammy Knickerbocker has been asked back either.
And as Radar had previously reported, super-religious Alexis Bellino is not returning either, despite posting photos with current housewife Vicki Gunvalson on social media.
