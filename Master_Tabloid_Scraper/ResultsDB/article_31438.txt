No Heart Tila Tequila Slams Big Ang After Cancer Death/n
Angela “Big Ang” Raiola‘s Feb. 18th death was met with an outpouring of grief from fans around the world, but one person who was not touched by the Mob Wives star’s death was former MTV reality star, Tila Tequila.
“Do you guys think she deserves to be praised,” Tequila asked on Facebook. “I mean she was the wife of a serial murderer mobster why is everyone so sad?”

But the 34-year-old’s shocking rant did not stop there. “Did she cry for the families her husband destroyed? I don’t understand why everyone feels so sad lol what do you guys think?”
As Radar has reported, Big Ang, who passed away at age 55 after complications from brain and throat cancer, was not in fact married to a mobster. Her mafia connections came by way of her uncle, Salvatore Lombardi. Big Ang is survived by her husband, Neil Murphy, and her two children. /n
