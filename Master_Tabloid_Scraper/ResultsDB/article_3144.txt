‘Total Divas’ Stars Talk Season 3, Relationships And Bonding Time!/n
E!’s Total Divas never fails to disappoint with shock, awe and every other emotion a TV show could lead you to feel. But in sitting down with Nattie and The Bella Twins, we found out that there is so much more to come from the third season of the show!
Sitting down at NYY Steakhouse in Manhattan, the women openly discuss how not only will cast member Rosa shake things up this season but also how they all bond as a group – when they’re not fighting, of course! As with any group of gal pals, this crew knows how best to get along: shopping and going out to dinner!
But they also know how to open up about a problem many women face: men. Nikki Bella sheds some light on her relationship with John Cena, and why she feels pressure from friends and family regarding life with the “man of [her] dreams.”
Watch the clip below to find out what else you can expect from Total Divas!
