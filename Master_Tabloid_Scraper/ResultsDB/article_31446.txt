Gisele Flaunts Her Brady Baby Bump In Boston/n
By Radar Staff
Gisele Bundchen isn’t trying to hide her baby bump any longer. Tom Brady‘s very pregnant wife, who hasn’t publicly confirmed her pregnancy, let her bump do the tailing Saturday as she checked out of her Boston hotel.
The Brazilian supermodel was in Beantown visiting Tom at training camp, and her beige T-shirt tucked into loose-fitting white pants, only accentuated her pregnant figure.

Supermodel Gisele has contracts with Versace, Givenchy, the Bank of Brazil and Salvatore Ferragamo in 2012 alone, and her superstar quarterback husband has his New England Patriots deal – $78.5 million over five years — and an estimated $10 million a year from endorsements.

Now it’s back to their new $20 million Los Angeles estate to prepare for the new baby.
