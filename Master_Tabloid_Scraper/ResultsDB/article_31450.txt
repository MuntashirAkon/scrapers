“Everything business related in Courtney’s life  MUST go through Sam now,” a source close to the situation told RadarOnline.com. “Courtney is completely dependent on him for everything, just as Britney was during the time he was in her life. Sam is able to charm his way into emotionally vulnerable celebrities’ lives. He can be absolutely charming, but he has a much darker side and it’s very concerning that he is now essentially running Courtney’s life.”
