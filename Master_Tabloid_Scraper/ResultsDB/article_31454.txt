The Hollywood power couple held hands as they attended the 77th Annual New York Film Critics Circle Awards Gala in NYC Monday night, and Brad was honored with a best actor award for his roles in Moneyball and Tree of Life.
“I never imagined that I’d be standing up here tonight,” Pitt said when accepting the award. “I do so because I’ve had the great fortune to work with the great people that I have…I love film, I really do. It means so much to me, so I thank you for this — and I thank you that this isn’t televised!”Angelina Jolie and Brad’s ex are both fans of sexy leather dresses – Jennifer Aniston wore a sexy black leather mini dress to a Horrible Bosses event last summer.
