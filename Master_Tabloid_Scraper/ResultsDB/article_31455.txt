By Radar Staff
From the red carpet of the New York Film Critics Circle Awards to the city streets, Hollywood’s hottest stars were dressed to rock and shock on Monday – and RadarOnline.com has all the photos in our daily fashion feature.
Angelina Jolie looked sexy in leather at the New York Film Critics Circle Awards. Wearing Salvatore Ferragamo from head to toe, the big screen babe supported her cane-walking hubby in stellar style. Viola Davis was also dressed to thrill at the event in a shimmery pink Ports 1961 dress, while Jessica Chastain missed the mark in her mermaid-esque Lyn Devon cocktail dress.

Salma Hayek also tried out a leather look, wearing an ill-fitting purple curve-hugger to dinner in Los Angeles, but the dress bunched up in all the wrong places!
Liv Tyler showed off her flawless figure at Stella McCartney’s new store opening in NYC wearing a sophisticatedly sexy ensemble, while Naomi Watts drenched her bod in unflattering fashion, finishing off the look with clunky, clog-like platforms.
