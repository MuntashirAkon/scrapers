The CW network’s 2016 New York Upfront presentation today has finally given a status update on the fate of The Vampire Diaries.

According to CW president Mark Pedowitz, there’s no decision yet as to whether The Vampire Diaries, which is heading into its eighth season next year, will continue on after. Ian Somerhalder may or may not be continuing on while Paul Wesley hasn’t commented.
“We’ll see how the audience reacts,” Pedowitz said.

As for the other open-ended question – will there be a Supernatural spinoff? – Pedowitz said simply, “We’re open to listening.”
Meanwhile, the network is packed with superhero shows such as The Flash, Arrow, DC’s Legends of Tomorrow, and the newly-acquired Supergirl (from CBS), which will still air on Mondays at 8 pm, preceding Gina Rodriguez’s hugely-popular show Jane the Virgin.
