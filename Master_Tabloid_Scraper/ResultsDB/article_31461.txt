“We have decided to do one last season to really do the story justice,” Somerhalder, who plays Damon Salvatore, said via Us Weekly.
However, The CW tells JustJared.com that “no decision has been made” regarding the future of the series.
The CW renewed The Vampire Diaries for Season 8 eight back in March, along with the spin-off The Originals. The news comes just days after Kat Graham, who plays Bonnie Bennett, told Us Weekly that she was leaving the show after Season 8. 
“I just hope that whatever I do after, the crew can come with me. If the crew can come with me, then we’ll be good. The crew is going to be the hardest thing to let go, because we are a family.” 
One of the series regulars of the show Nina Dobrev left last year at the end of Season 6.
