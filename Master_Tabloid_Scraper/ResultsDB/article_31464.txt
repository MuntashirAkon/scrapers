How sweet.

Emmy Rossum was spotted in candy cane red hosting Godiva’s “Hot Chocolate for a Cause” launch at their 5th Avenue store on Monday, Nov. 30 to spread good cheer at the start of the holiday season. In partnership with the Toys for Tots Foundation, the chocolatier will donate $1.0 for every Godiva Hot Chocolate drink that is sold in their stores from Dec. 1-Dec. 15 to children who are without toys during the season of giving.
“Godiva’s hot chocolate reminds me of many special moments spent with my family during the holiday season,” says Rossum. “So I’m thrilled to be part of a program that helps put people in the giving spirit and give back to children in need. There’s a joy that comes with every bite or sip of Godiva. I hope to extend that feeling by helping those less fortunate.”
