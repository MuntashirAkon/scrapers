Unless you’ve been living under a rock, you should know by now that the cast of The Vampire Diaries is incredibly good looking. Paul Wesley, a.k.a. Stefan Salvatore, included.

The seventh season of The Vampire Diaries premiered on The CW last night (Oct. 8), marking the first season without main protagonist Elena (Nina Dobrev), and the end of a very complicated love triangle between Stefan, Elena, and Stefan’s bro Damon Salvatore, played by Ian Somerhalder.

But as they say: absence makes the heart grow fonder, and it’ll be interesting to see how the show evolves with one character gone, but not forgotten.
Wesley’s character may just be the most dreamy vampire out there, as in real life he’s just as endearing. He takes to social media to flaunt his bromance with his co-star Somerhalder, as well as promote various environmental and animal causes. Oh, and let’s not forget his relationship with his other beautiful co-star, Phoebe Tonkin, who now stars on The Vampire Diaries spinoff The Originals.



Happy birthday to my best friend. Not only are you the SEXIEST person I have ever seen, but you make me laugh more than anyone else. Here’s to many more adventures with you. ✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨🍪

What will it take for people to accept the need for stricter gun laws in this country? Why the obsession?

Will be very amusing when all these anti-climate change imbeciles suddenly change their stance thanks to the pope.

The media is finally shedding light on the thousands of animals that are unjustly killed for the sake of trophy hunting. It's long overdue.
