The Vampire Diaries Returns! Which Salvatore Brother Would You Choose?/n
Picking up right where season 1 left off, The Vampire Diaries returned with a vengeance Thursday as Katherine (Nina Dobrev) managed to immediately insert herself between a barely united Stefan (Paul Wesley) and Damon (Ian Somerhalder).
After realizing he had kissed Katherine and not Elena, Damon felt the sting of Elena’s rejection when she told him she wasn’t surprised he would make a move on her, but was surprised he thought she’d ever reciprocate. Feeling hurt, Damon fell into old habits, resisting the urge to kill Katherine the next time they met and instead, passionately throwing himself at her. But their reunion proved short-lived when Damon asked her to finally pick just one Salvatore brother, and Katherine chose Stefan, saying she never loved Damon and it was Stefan she came back for. 
Never one to give up without a fight, a drunken Damon later surprised Elena in her bedroom and attempted to convince her that there was something between them, even managing to plant a kiss. But echoing Katherine’s sentiments from earlier that night, Elena also chose Stefan, saying he would always be the one for her. 
Unable to take any more pain, a heartbroken Damon snapped – literally – twisting Jeremy’s head on his way out and leaving Elena to mourn her brother’s death, until she realized Jeremy was wearing her uncle John’s ring that protects humans from supernatural attacks. Though Jeremy lived to see another day, the same might not to be true for Caroline, who after being saved by Damon’s blood, received a hospital visit from none other than Katherine. Proving she meant business, Katherine suffocated Caroline with a pillow and made her exit, but not before declaring “Game on.” 
Tell us: Which Salvatore brother is right for Elena? Do you believe Stefan is the real reason Katherine returned to Mystic Falls?
