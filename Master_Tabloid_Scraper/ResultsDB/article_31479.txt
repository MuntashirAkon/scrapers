 Shock & Outrage! Colorado Theater Shooter James Holmes Escapes Death Penalty, Sentenced.../n
There was stunned silence in the Colorado courtroom when a judge announced that theater shooter James Holmes was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole after the jury failed to come to a unanimous decision on the death penalty.
Holmes shot and killed 12 people watching the movie The Dark Knight Rises and injured 70 more on July 20, 2012.
The nine women three men jury could not come to a unanimous decision on the death penalty and now Holmes will spend the rest of his natural life behind bars.

Holmes’ mother wept in court when the verdict was read. Outrage was swift on social media, with many writing that they supported death for the killer.

An absolute travesty of justice. If ever there was justification for the death penalty, this was it. #sad #theatershooting
