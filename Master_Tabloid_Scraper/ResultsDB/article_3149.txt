Gretchen, 35, has revealed in the past that she would be comfortable making the first move.
“A guy doesn’t always have to do it [propose],” Gretchen said. “He can still do it, but maybe I might, too. If he doesn’t do something soon, I might have to!”
Gretchen’s next step is to have a “boatload” of kids. Speaking to In Touch about her relationship with Slade she revealed:
“I’m so happy right now.”
