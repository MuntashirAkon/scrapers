 Heck, I’m Thirsty! Sen. Marco Rubio Takes A Swig During GOP Response To State Of The.../n
He took a swipe – and a swig, and while it’s not exactly ‘Watergate,’ it’s still pretty funny.
Senator Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) was charged with delivering the GOP response to President Obama’s State of the Union Address Monday night, and while he managed to diss many of Obama’s policies while conveying his contention that the Republican Party is not the party of the rich and elitist ( i.e.- Mitt Romney), the headline coming from his speech is – ‘Rubio Drinks Water Mid-Sentence.’

Early on in his speech, the 41-year-old Cuban American established he was not born with a silver spoon in his mouth.
“I didn’t inherit any money from them,” Rubio said of his parents. “But I inherited something far better — the real opportunity to accomplish my dreams.”

Apparently, he also inherited dry mouth as wiped his mouth and licked his lips on a number of occasions.
Midway during his speech, Rubio surprised viewers by reaching for a small bottle of Poland Springs water and taking a swig.
