The Voice: Christina Aguilera Shoots Dirty Look At Justin Bieber/n
By Radar Staff
Justin Bieber has sold more than 8 million albums, has more than 727 million YouTube views (the most ever) for his video Baby and more than 20 million followers on Twitter. 
But Christina Aguilera wasn’t about to give Biebs the star treatment on Tuesday’s episode of The Voice, as the What A Girl Wants singer snubbed the 18-year-old pop star when he made a cameo on her turf — and you can see it all go down on RadarOnline.com.
After Justin emerged to show a clip from his new music video and announce he’d be back in three weeks to perform, he graciously walked up to the four thrones where the coaches hold court.

When he got to Christina’s chair, she gave him a snotty look and extended her hand. He leaned in and planted an air kiss on her, and when he emerged she gave him a Dirrty look. 
To see the snub for yourself, check it out around the 3:20 mark.
Elsewhere on The Voice Tuesday, coach Blake Shelton sent country hopeful RaeLynn home while Christina shocked once more, sending Ashley De La Rosa.
