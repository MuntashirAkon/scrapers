Ben Affleck Spotted Buying Alcohol With GF Lindsay Shookus… But Didn't He *Just* Complete Rehab??/n

Someone alert Bethenny Frankel — Ben Affleck and his GF Lindsay Shookus were spotted buying SkinnyGirl margaritas!
The new couple were spotted in Maine over the weekend purchasing a variety of booze (two days in a row!) including two bottles of rosé and none other than the Real Housewives star's branded beverage.

The clerk from the liquor store documented the A-lister's visit on social media (below), and told Radar Online: 

"He said he and his girlfriend were just up for a couple days."


This usually wouldn't ring any alarms, but the father-of-three *just* completed rehab in May!
And before we jump to any conclusions, we just want to point out that we don't envision Ben relapsing with SkinnyGirl margs, right?? After all, Lindsay is the one seen paying!
What do U think of all this?? SOUND OFF in the comments (below)!
