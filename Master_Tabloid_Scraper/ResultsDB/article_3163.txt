Blac Chyna is returning to her roots!

According to TMZ, she's getting paid $10K for the event, in addition to three bottles of rosÃ©. Oh, and she was the one who thought of the idea in the first place!
Last year, while she was pregnant with Dream Kardashian, the former Rob & Chyna star hosted a gig at Sin City Cabaret in New York.
