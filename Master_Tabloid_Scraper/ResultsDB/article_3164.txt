On Saturday, Roberta Ursey — along with her husband, mother, nephews, and sons — were having some fun in the sun in Panama City Beach, Florida when the entire family nearly lost their lives.

When Ursey left the water, she suddenly heard screams, and realized her sons were trapped by the ocean's rip current. She told the News Herald:

"They were screaming and crying that they were stuck… People were saying, 'Don't go out there."'
When Roberta and her family swam to rescue them, they became trapped as well! 

"I honestly thought I was going to lose my family that day… It was like, 'Oh God, this is how I'm going."'
The mother says a total of nine people were fighting to stay afloat in around 15 feet of water.
That's when Jessica Simmons and her husband — who at the time were enjoying a beach-side dinner — saw the commotion and "knew someone was drowning."
The Alabama-native — who "practically lived in a pool" growing up — grabbed a boogie board and recruited 80 beach goers to form a human chain in order to bring the Florida family to safety.
Simmons told herself:

"These people are not drowning today… It's not happening. We're going to get them out."
While the entire family survived, Ursey's mother suffered a heart attack and is currently in the hospital in stable condition. The brood has set up a GoFundMe account to cover her medical bills.
Ultimately, Roberta is grateful for Jessica and her husband for their quick and courageous thinking.

"These people were God's angels that were in the right place at the right time. I owe my life and my family's life to them. Without them, we wouldn't be here."
Truly a miraculous story!
