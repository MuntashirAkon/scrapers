An exotic dancer named Maliah Michel is putting Drake on blast after the rapper seemingly insulted her profession.

When Drake had basketball jerseys made for her and several of Houston’s famous strippers — including Lira Galore and Miracle Watts — to pay homage and “retire” them from their line of work, Michel took to social media to drag him for the offensive move. Reacting to an article that called the stunt “good-intended,” she tweeted, “No f**king well intentions… eat a d*ck.”
Via Hip Hop My Way:
“Y’all don’t know that n***a been trying to make me stop dancing. Always putting me down about it… Always telling me I’m not better than anyone else in the club selling ass instead of dancing. But n***a can’t stay in the club… Ya’ll just don’t know. My only regret is ever trying to explain how much I love dancing. And thinking so highly of him that I let his opinion of me mold my opinion of myself. F**k that and f**k you if you got a problem… I remember pleading with him to understand. I said Beyoncé wears the same kind of stuff I wear… No matter how light I tried to make things. Just always mean and hurtful. But whatever I’m done,” she wrote.
