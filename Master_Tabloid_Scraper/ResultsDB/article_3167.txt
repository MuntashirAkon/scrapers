People are freaking out amid rumors that Drake is working on a follow-up to Take Care.

Everything started when the Canadian rapper shared an Instagram photo that closely resembled the iconic album cover.
Via Revolt TV:
Pensive, moody, and very Take Care-y, the black and gold toned photo features the 6 God striking a eerily similar stance as the cover to his 2011 opus, Take Care. Sporting all black with gold accents highlighted around him (sans a goblet), the remixed photo struck enough of a clear resemblance to drive fans into believing that a sequel to the album is on the way.
