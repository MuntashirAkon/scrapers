Rosario Dawson is breaking her silence following the sudden death of her 26-year-old cousin.

Fight back tears, the Daredevil star — who found Vanez Ines Vasquez dead inside her Venice, Calif., home earlier this month — broke her silence about the tragedy that struck her family during her latest appearance on AOL’s Build series.
“I’ve been dealing with a lot of loss lately and reconnecting with my family and my friends in a different way. I’m realizing how much I’ve pulled myself back, and I’ve been just really humbled by this opportunity tonight,” the 38-year-old shared, while promoting  The Lower Eastside Girls Club of New York on Wednesday (May 24, 2017). “My cousin just died, Vaneza, and I’m coming up on the six-year anniversary of my grandmother’s passing.”

Dawson admitted the passing made her realize to “never take anything for granted” and “to constantly be working on yourself and take advantage of every moment.” She also explained how she hopes to return to school and “be more organized” to become “a better person.”
“And from 75 to 26, you just don’t know when your time is,” she continued. “I just don’t want to be in any kind of position where I’m looking back going, ‘Ah, I should’ve, could’ve, would’ve, didn’t, damn!'”
Dawson discovered an unresponsive Vazquez, who was said to be suffering from migraines and hypertension at the time of her death, downstairs in her residence on May 11. Autopsy reports indicated she had died from natural causes.
