Us Weekly reports:
In September, Us Weekly confirmed the couple was expecting. Ross, 26, also showed off her baby bump as the duo attended the 2017 Golden Globes in L.A. on January 8, where Gibson’s unimpressed reaction to Meryl Streep’s anti-Trump speech went viral.
Gibson, 61, is already father to daughter Hannah and six sons – Edward, Christian, William, Louis and Milo, from his 28-year marriage to ex-wife Robyn Moore. They divorced in 2011. He also shares daughter Lucia, 7, with ex-girlfriend Oksana Grigorieva.
