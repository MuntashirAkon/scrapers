Shannen Doherty has been battling an aggressive form of breast cancer for the last year, but she’s not letting it get in the way of enjoying the holidays.

The 90210 actress took to Instagram today (Dec. 13, 2016) to share an update with her followers, revealing she brought her mother along to her latest radiation session so that they could go Christmas shopping afterward.
“Another day of #radiation. Today my mom came with me because Even though I’m so tired after, I’m going Christmas shopping!!! Got to get @kurtiswarienko a present!! I love the holidays. @themamarosa,” she captioned the photo.

Doherty, who’s been very public with her battle, recently offered advice to Michael Bublé after learning his 3-year-old son was diagnosed with cancer. “Just trust in your doctors. Make sure you have amazing doctors, a great team, and know that organizations like the American Cancer Society [and] Stand Up to Cancer, they are doing so much good for cancer. And [there is] so much research that we have much better chances now,” she said.
“Stay positive,” she continued.  “That positivity, that outlook on life that you can get through something, it actually does get you through.”
