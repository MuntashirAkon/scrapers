Rosario Dawson Gushes Over Boyfriend Eric Andre/n
In case you needed more proof that Rosario Dawson is dating comedian Eric Andre, the actress gushed over her boyfriend and promised that their relationship was real during her appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.
When the late-night television host asked Dawson about their reaction to people not believing the reality of their relationship, she revealed that Andre took to social media to prove it’s real after Chance the Rapper texted her in disbelief. “He started posting more pictures of like our tongues touching and stuff, like personal pictures,” she said. “I was like, ‘you’re still a millennial man. You don’t post the tongue pictures!’”


He tweeted this because I text Rosario asking if it was a joke 😭😭 https://t.co/UQ2sQZeAPs

She also spoke on how caring he has been as a boyfriend sharing the story of her recovery from an emergency surgery from a ruptured cyst on her ovary. “He took care of me in an adult diaper. That is love,” she said.
Andre also has the Unforgettable star learning healthy habits including meditating and journaling.
The comedian is known for his outlandish pranks which led to speculation about the two being a couple. However, last Valentine’s Day, the two made it official when Eric posted several pictures of himself and Dawson with romantic captions. Rosario retweeted her boyfriend calling him her “main man.”
