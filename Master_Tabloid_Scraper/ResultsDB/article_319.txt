Sarah Palin -- Daughter Slut Shamed During Drunken Family Brawl/nSarah Palin's family threw down in a massive drunken brawl as violent as any wrestling cage match -- with ripped shirts, bloodied faces, and her daughter Bristol getting dragged around a lawn by her legs.The brawl went down last month near Anchorage, Alaska ... when the Palin clan -- Todd and his kids Willow, Track, and Bristol -- went to a friend's house party. According to the police report ... obtained by TMZ ... the violence erupted when Bristol went after a woman who had allegedly shoved her younger sister Willow.Bristol told police the homeowner, Korey Klingenmeyer, shoved her to the ground, dragged her around, and started calling her a slut and a c**t. Korey and several other witnesses at the party saw it differently ... telling cops Bristol punched him in the face -- he says he let her hit him 5-6 times before grabbing her fist and pushing back ... sending her reeling to the ground.That scrap then sparked the all-out brawl -- witnesses say Track and 3-4 other people came running to defend Bristol ... and all hell broke loose ... with the Palins, including dad Todd, taking on all comers.Willow says several people at the party we're chanting,  "F**k the Palins!
