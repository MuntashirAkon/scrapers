Before Rosa Mendes welcomes her baby girl in February, she has another major milestone to cross of her list: meeting her future in-laws! The Total Divas star exclusively tells E! News she will be spending the holidays with fiancé Bobby Schubenski's family in Pittsburgh before their little bundle of joy arrives. And this isn't just a quick trip for the couple either—she also reveals they're moving to The Steel City permanently! "I actually can't fly right now, so we're taking a train and we're going to arrive on Christmas Eve," she says. "I'll meet his family for the first time! I've already met his parents, but not the rest of his family. We get to spend Christmas together with them and build the nursery." Too sweet!

The 36-year-old Diva shares that having a strong support system for her daughter, Jordan, is her motivation for the big move. "My family is scattered all over the world and I never got to be around a lot of family," Rosa confesses. "I want Jordan to have family around her, so she's going to have her grandparents, cousins, aunts and uncles."However, the brunette beauty might have one minor problem with her new address on the East coast. "It's going to be kind of a culture shock for me because I'm used to the warm weather," she says. "But I think it will be so good for Jordan. It's going to be an experience."

As for her WWE family, Rosa explains they've been nothing short of amazing. "It's really cool that all the Divas have been calling me and checking up on me. Everyone's just been so great!"Watch the season premiere of Total Divas Tuesday, Jan. 19 at 9 p.m., only on E!
