The Clippers star chilled with Rick, Wiz Khalifa, Mally Mall, and Ty Dolla Sign. Famous booty model Rosa Acosta,  "Love and Hip Hop " star Sincere, and singer Anjali World (daughter of Kings owner Vivek Ranadivé) were also there.  Earlier that night ... Matt put up a goose egg in 26 minutes on the floor in the Clippers game against the Bucks, but still won ... 106-102. Ricky Rozay makes everything better./n
