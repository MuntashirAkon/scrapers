'Pokemon Go': Atomic Bombing Memorial Wants Off 'Pokestop' List/nThe folks at Japan's Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park have a message for  "Pokemon Go " -- have some damn respect. The memorial sits right where the first nuclear bomb was dropped on a city, and officials are pissed it's currently a  "Pokestop. " Park organizers want the game's developer, Niantic Inc., to remove the landmark from the game by Aug. 6 -- the anniversary of the 1945 atomic bombing. The site's become a go-to spot since the game's release in Japan last week. Niantic -- an American software company -- does have a form to request exclusions, but it makes no guarantees. Games apparently don't respect the dead./n
