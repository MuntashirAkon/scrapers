Michael Jackson will forever be remembered as the iconic musician who changed pop forever. Off the stage, however, the “Thriller” hit-maker led a dangerously fast-paced lifestyle.
As told in the new Reelz episode, Michael Jackson: Man in the Mirror, the late singer’s eccentricities became apparent during his time living in New York.
Rob Cohen, the Executive VP of Motown Records, recalled a time when Jackson bought boxes upon boxes of Perrier sparkling water. When he asked what it was for, the pop star reportedly answered, “I bathe in it. I like the bubbles.”
