She-Devil Heigl's Marriage Rocked By Latest TV Flop!/n
Career-cursed Katherine Heigl‘s new TV series, Doubt, was canceled after only two episodes — and friends worry recent work woes could put her marriage on the chopping block!
Katherine, who married musician Josh Kelley in 2007, “was banking on bouncing back big with Doubt,” a source told Radar.
And so was her hubby!
“Josh was thrilled to play house husband and have Katherine working long hours again. Their marriage has always thrived when Katherine is busy and Josh is holding down the fort.”

But Katherine, who gave birth to the couple’s third child, Josh Jr., just before Doubt aired in February, hasn’t had the career she envisioned.
The beautiful blonde shot to fame starring as Dr. Izzie Stevens on Grey’s Anatomy.
But she bolted after making outrageous money demands and ­butting heads with show creator Shonda Rhimes.
Since then, Katherine’s had a string of flops — and also developed a reputation as a diva off-screen!

“Katherine has been in an especially foul mood since Doubt’s cancellation. She has a wicked temper and takes it out on Josh,” said the insider.
A rep for Heigl denies there’s any trouble in paradise.
But the mole insisted: “They’ve been ­bickering nonstop lately and friends are wondering if Katherine’s latest career setback could wreck their marriage once and for all.”
Last year, Katherine admitted going to ­therapy after quitting cigarettes!
The couple, who have adopted daughters Naleigh, 8, and Adalaide, 4, rejoiced over Josh Jr.
“Josh was breathing a sigh of relief, believing Doubt and their son were marriage-savers. But the honeymoon is definitely over now.”
