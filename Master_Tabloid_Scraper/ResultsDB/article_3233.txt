Cosby, 79, tweeted Friday that emotional distress complaints brought by Joan Tarshis, Linda Traitz, and Therese Serignese had all been dismissed from a lawsuit filed by Tamara Green in Massachusetts.
Green is suing Cosby for defamation, claiming her ruined her “good name and reputation” by calling her a liar when she claimed he’d drugged and groped her in the 1970s.
Tarshis, Traitz, and Serignese have all made similar claims — with Cosby denying each one — and they joined Green’s lawsuit in November 2015.
This comes on the heels of last month’s legal victory for Cosby: As Radar reported, a similar lawsuit brought by Katherine McKee was also dismissed.

McKee, a former girlfriend of Sammy Davis Jr., said Cosby defamed her by denying claims she’d made in an interview with The New York Daily News, describing an alleged sexual assault she’d suffered at his hands.
The judge in that case ruled, “An accused person cannot be foreclosed … from considering the issuance of a simple and unequivocal denial — free from overall defamatory triggers or contextual themes.”
And on Monday, Cosby won again when a judge in his Pennsylvania criminal sexual assault case ruled that he may have a jury comprised of people not from the Philadelphia area.
That case goes to trial on June 5.
