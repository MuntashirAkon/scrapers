After the week we’ve just had, it’s nice to know that there’s still a little magic in the world.

The stars of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them came together in New York City on Thursday (Nov. 10, 2016) to celebrated the world premiere of the latest film from the Harry Potter Universe. Eddie Redmayne, Katherine Waterson, Carmen Ejogo, Zoë Kravitz, Jon Voight, and Ezra Miller walked the red carpet alongside Harry Potter alums such as Evanna Lynch.
Author J.K. Rowling, who penned the script for the new spin-off, was also in attendance. While the author, who’s likened Donald Trump to Voldemort in the past, refused to speak about the new president-elect, she did say the new flick’s script was based on real world events.
“This period was threatening to become very dystopian. You were looking at the rise of a very dark force. I conceived the story a few years ago, and I think I was partly informed by a rise in populism around the world,” she told the New York Times, explaining her decision to set the story in the 1920s. “I hope when people see the movie, they will understand that it grew out of things that are very important to me in the world at the moment.”
Fantastic Beasts hits theaters on Nov. 18.
