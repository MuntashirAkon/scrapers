Katherine Heigl got into the Halloween spirit when she stepped out for lunch on Monday (Oct. 31, 2016) in Los Angeles.

Flaunting her large baby bump in black tunic, the former Grey’s Anatomy star showed off her spooky side with some ghoulish makeup and a black wig as she grabbed a bite to eat at Little Dom’s with husband Josh Kelley.
The couple, who are proud parents to daughters Adelaide and Naleigh are currently expecting their first son together.
