Bikini Mama! Katherine Webb-McCarron Shows Off Toned Bod with Son Tripp/n
It was a splish-splash kind of Tuesday for Katherine Webb-McCarron and her son Tripp!
The former Miss Alabama USA posted new snaps to her Instagram feed and story on Tuesday, giving her followers a glimpse into some outdoor fun she shared with her 11-month-old baby boy.
“No pool no problem ☀️,” she captioned one shot, her super-fit body on display in a navy-blue bikini as she and Tripp enjoy time on a play mat that’s shooting streams of water into the air.

Webb-McCarron’s new photos are only the latest she is sharing of her post-baby body. The model and wife of Cincinnati Bengals quarterback A.J. McCarron previously revealed on social media that she gained 44 lbs. while pregnant with Tripp, losing 20 of those within nine days of giving birth.
“Say what you want, but I feel great about myself even with the extra cellulite on my butt and stretch marks so shoot me if I felt banging for once in this bikini..okkkkk 💅🏼,” she captioned a mirror selfie one month postpartum.
