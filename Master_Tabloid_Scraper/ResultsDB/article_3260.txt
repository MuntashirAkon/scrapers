The wife of NFL quarterback A.J. McCarron said she gained 44 lbs. during her pregnancy, and lost 20 lbs. the first nine days postpartum.
Webb-McCarron said breastfeeding helped her drop the other 24 lbs., and she even did workouts with Tripp.

“Tripp loves helping me get back into shape,” Webb captioned a video of her arm lifts and crunches with Tripp. “Can’t believe how fast he is growing, but the bigger he gets the harder the work outs are!”
