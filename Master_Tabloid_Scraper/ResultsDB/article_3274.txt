Peyton Manning Blows Fan's Mind Outside 'Kimmel'/nPeyton Manning turned a grown ass woman into a full Mary Katherine Gallagher.  It all went down outside  "Jimmy Kimmel Live! " in L.A. -- when Peyton and his brother, Cooper Manning, were leaving the studio after the show and stopped to sign an autograph for a fan who was wearing Peyton's jersey.  The woman absolutely LOST HER MIND -- pumping her fists in sheer excitement after getting #18's signature.  Can't blame her ... signed Manning jerseys can sometimes sell for $1,000 a pop!  Nice pull!/n
