“They broke up when I was six and during that entire time he was married to someone else and had another family,” she explained. “I didn’t know until I was about 12. My dad lived a very split life. We just did not talk about where he came from. He spoke very succinctly about his mum and his dad but I never met my grandparents or saw even a photograph of them together – I always wondered what they looked like.”
She also learned that he was previously married to a woman named Ada Wood Stancliffe and they had a son, Leslie Standcliffe. He also became an actor.
“It makes me wonder for my father, why he chose to keep everything so secret,” she said. “It would have been nice to talk to him about it all.”
