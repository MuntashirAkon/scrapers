 A Family Divided! Bruce Jenner Cousin Says Sex Change Is 'Hard' On Relatives: 'He Has.../n
Kris Jenner isn’t the only one having a difficult time adjusting to her ex Bruce’s transition into womanhood.
The Olympic gold medalist’s cousin Jeffrey Day, 65, exclusively tells RadarOnline.com that the sex change has been “hard” to accept.
“It’s not an easy process to go through,” the California native explains. “Other people would feel the same exact emotions I feel if they had a relative going through the same thing.”

Despite previously claiming he was “disappointed” by Bruce’s big news, Day now says he stands behind his cousin’s shocking decision.
“I want to support Bruce,” he says. “No matter what happens, he’s still my cousin.”
“Bruce is a mature adult, and he has to live with the consequences, not anybody else., Day continues. “He’s going to either be happy or not. Only he knows.”

The Keeping Up With the Kardashians dad, 63, is far from happy these days, however. As Radar previously reported, he put his gender transition on hold after his involvement in a fatal car accident in Malibu on February 7. (Kim Howe, 69, died at the scene of the crash.)
“It’s very tragic,” Day says. “My condolences go out to the family of the person killed. I would tell fans that Bruce really needs their support right now.” /n
