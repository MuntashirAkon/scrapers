Jennifer Connelly's Startling Weight Loss Caused By 'Over-Training,' Says Expert/n
By Debbie Emery – Radar Reporter
Beautiful actress Jennifer Connelly has always boasted a slim figure, but new photos of her looking shockingly skinny have prompted speculation that the avid exerciser has been going overboard in the gym to the detriment of her health.
“She looks far too skinny and that’s not attractive at all,” nutritionist Majid Ali, who has not treated the star, told RadarOnline.com in an exclusive interview.

At 5’6 1/2″, Ali estimates that the Reservation Road actress, “Can’t be more than 100 pounds. It appears that she over-trains.”
Dressed in dark workout clothes, trainers and wearing headphones and a very intense expression on her face, the New Yorker’s face appeared gaunt and sunken, with her legs and arms noticeably thinner than ever before.
Jackie Keller, CEO of meal delivery service NutriFit agrees that 41-year-old Jennifer looks too thin. 
“The legs remind me of some of the recent Olympian runners that I watched on TV,” she exclusively told Radar.
“Many things go into what is considered to be a healthy weight — including previous weight levels, body shape and of course, muscle tone,” she explained. “It is possible that as a regular runner, she has very thin but powerful legs and a long, lean frame. Many runners do and we saw a wide range of body types and sizes at the Olympics.”
Connelly and her British actor husband, Paul Bettany, welcomed their daughter, Agnes, in May 2011. The couple also has a 9-year-old son named Stellan, and Jennifer has a son from another relationship, Kai, 15.
