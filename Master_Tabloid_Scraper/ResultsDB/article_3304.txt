Kate Gosselin Scowls While Picking Up The Kids /n
By Radar Staff
Kate Gosselin did not look like she was in the best of moods Wednesday, wearing a scowl as she picked up her children from school in Reading, Pennsylvania, and RadarOnline.com has the pics.
Perhaps Kate was annoyed knowing she had a dentist’s chair to look forward to, as she tweeted on Thursday that she “just had the privilege of experiencing my very 1st root canal.

“From 2day forward, I vow2 brush&floss every hr on the hr 2 avd that agn!” she tweeted. “For the record, I am an overzealous brusher/flosser but will up my game even more now….not a fun Thursday morning!!!”
As we previously reported, the mother-of-eight is growing antsy at a lack of interest she’s received from the reality TV community since becoming a free agent last month when her TLC show Kate Plus 8 was cancelled, a source told the Huffington Post.

Earlier this month, she told The Today Show’s Matt Lauer she’d like to remain “on TV as a way to provide for my kids.”
In the meantime, Kate is keeping an online presence at kateplusmy8.com.
