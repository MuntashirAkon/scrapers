She was arrested on December 20, 1997, and was served with the citation on the same day. Pettry was fined $10 and paid $80 in costs for the case.
Her case has since been disposed, and a Buncombe county clerk confirmed to Radar that the records have been destroyed.
She was later arrested in 2015 for speeding; that case has also been disposed.
