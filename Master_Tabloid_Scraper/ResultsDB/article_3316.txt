The President and First Lady hosted the Prime Minister of Italy Matteo Renzi and his wife Agnese Landini, and FLOTUS appropriately wore an Italian designer to honor them.
Her rose gold off-shoulder gown was custom made by Atelier Versace and looked magnificent on her! Talk about goddess status!
Donatella Versace offered a statement on how honored she was to dress Mrs. Obama, saying:
"I am humbled and honored to have the opportunity to dress the First Lady of the United States Michelle Obama. Thank you Michelle for all of the things you have done for America and for the rest of the world, for the women in the United States and the rest of the world."
This dress will definitely go down in history!
