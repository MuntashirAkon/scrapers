At 105 years old, the Indiana native threw the first pitch at Sunday’s Padres games at Petco Park in San Diego.   
Ahead of the big game, McKee had been practicing pitching with staffers at her retirement community in San Diego, according to Yahoo.  
The feisty centenarian is not much of a sports fan – she’s more into art, bridge games, dancing and a classic martini – but her late husband was a baseball player, she told KSWB-San Diego.   
“I haven’t been very into the Padres because they don’t ever win any games,” she said with a laugh. “I tried to learn the names of some of the ball players in case somebody asked me that. ”  
The Padres regularly honor the military at Sunday home games and since McKee’s husband, who passed away six years ago, was a veteran, she was an ideal choice, Yahoo reports.   
No matter what anyone thought of her toss, she can take comfort in knowing her pitch will likely be under less scrutiny than rapper 50 Cent’s recent attempt. He notoriously threw a horrendous first pitch at a New York Mets game in May.
