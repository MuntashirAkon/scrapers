Ryan Reynolds & German Model Get Cozy in South Africa/n
Ryan Reynolds, who filed for divorce in December from Scarlett Johansson, his wife of two years, appears to be moving on with his life.  
PEOPLE’s most recent Sexiest Man Alive, 34, has been getting chummy with German model Agnes Fischer both on and off the South African set of the political thriller Safe House, in which the actor stars opposite Denzel Washington.  
Fischer, who reportedly turns 25 next week, has been a frequent visitor to the set and has a small part in the film.

South African GQ first identified Fischer as the woman photographed having coffee with Reynolds at Cape Town’s Old Biscuit Mill, a popular market.  
 Fischer’s own Web site reveals that the blonde model has graced the cover of several European fashion and fitness magazines, and has been featured in various ad campaigns, including one for Bebe.  
 Back in North American, Reynolds’s ex, Johansson, 26, has been spotted around Los Angeles with actor Sean Penn, 50. Earlier this week, the pair took a one-day vacation together in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico.   
 Reynolds’s rep had no comment about his reported relationship with Fischer.
