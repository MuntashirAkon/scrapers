While cosmetics contracts and high-profile runway shows are trophies in the modeling world, one of the rarest honors is to be immortalized. . .as a mannequin! Following in the footsteps of icons Twiggy, Pat Cleveland and more, British It-girl Agness Deyn is being unveiled as Rootstein Mannequin’s latest model on May 20th. Rootstein Creative Director Kevin Arpino explains the choice, “Rootstein has had a long history of predicting the decades most influential visages and we felt that Agyness embodies the look of the first decade of this century. Her style and mannerisms both on and off the runway, as well as her fabulous physique, made her the perfect choice to be immortalized as a mannequin.” We agree — we love the model’s edgy fashion choices and fun personality.
