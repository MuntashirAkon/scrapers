 Too Insane For Justice? Morgan Freeman's Step-Granddaughter's Alleged Killer Plans Psychiatric.../n
The deranged man accused of viciously killing Morgan Freeman‘s step-granddaughter — and alleged lover — plans to use the insanity defense to avoid hard time in prison, according to court records.
The Driving Miss Daisy star did not the attend a pre-trial hearing Tuesday in Manhattan Criminal Court for Lamar Davenport, who was charged in the Aug. 16 exorcism stabbing death of 33-year-old E’Dena Hines.
“We intend to present psychiatric evidence in his defense at trial,” Davenport’s lawyer Annie Costanzo wrote in an October court filing.

In 2009, RadarOnline.com was the first to reveal that Hines and the then-72-year-old Oscar winning actor were involved in an affair that began when she was a teenager. The two are not blood relatives.
Both Freeman and Hines adamantly denied the relationship, but Davenport’s long time pal Edwin Straw told Radar in August that the accused killer frequently complained about the relationship she had with Freeman.
After butchering Hines with more than 15 stab wounds, Davenport ranted to cops about Jesus Christ and the devil. “I don’t even know why I’m here right now,” he told officers afterwards, according to court documents.
