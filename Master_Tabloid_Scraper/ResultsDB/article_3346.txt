Tyler Perry's ... Douchiest Director's Chair Of All Time/nIn case anyone on set forgets, Tyler Perry is the writer ... director ... executive producer ... and Grand Poobah of his new movie -- and if you don't believe us ... JUST LOOK AT HIS FREAKIN' CHAIR!Tyler's currently filming  "Single Moms Club " at Agnes Scott College in Atlanta -- and in typical Tyler Perry fashion, he's gotta make damn sure everyone knows it's his film... starting with his over-the-top self-branded director's chair.Â Filming started yesterday at the college -- a week before finals -- and we're told students are pretty pissed about the distraction.Oh yeah, the film also stars Tyler Perry./n
