Click through these slides to see the Vanderpump Rules star‚Äôs raunchy photo shoot with soon-to-be ex Robert Parks Valletta!Photo credit: INSTAR Images2 of 10    "Bare Tolerance"  Frankie- The things you make me do dad... Thanks Frankie & @robsvalletta, for joining the campaign & going #bareforcare üòÆ! A post shared by Mike King (@1michaelking) on Aug 15, 2017 at 2:58pm PDT
Valletta, 35, and Marie, 32, posted for a series of nude photos to raise awareness for the Bare for CARE campaign. The photographs were shot by Valletta's friend¬†Mike King¬†
3 of 10    "Vanderbare"  Our 1st #bareforcare couple! A huge thanks to @scheana, @robsvalletta & Frankie.  Frankie was such a diva!  JOIN THE FIGHT- Here is how you can help, take a photo with us, your own photographer or a selfie, going Bare for CARE. You can shoot a single, with someone or even better, your own rescue pet. Post it with #bareforcare and tag your friends, challenging them to do the same. Also, make a pledge to donate your time, supplies, or a financial contribution to an animal rescue of your choice. Together we can make a difference. Don‚Äôt just stare, go bare for CARE!  MISSION STATEMENT- Every Year, Approximately 2.7 million dogs and cats are needlessly killed in our shelters. From newborns to seniors and everything in between, euthanasia does not discriminate. Only 10% of animals received by shelters have been spayed or neutered. Overpopulation due to accidental or intentional reproduction leads to millions of animals being killed annually. Perfectly healthy, wonderful animals are murdered all the time, simply because the shelters are at capacity. There are very real problems with very simple solutions if we all helped to raise awareness and shed some light on these issues. That‚Äôs the naked truth.  The Bare for CARE campaign is a platform to fight against the loss of so many innocent lives. It starts with us being a voice for the voiceless. Raising awareness is a huge priority for the Bare for CARE campaign. Ignorance leads to so many animals being killed and abused behind closed doors. We want to help spread the word and help open people‚Äôs eyes and hearts to the reality of what is really going on. These animals need our help and we need yours. Through awareness, we can help inspire change, and through change, we can start to make an impact on the lives of so many precious animals. @carerescuela #carerescuela #rescue #adoptdontshop #animallovers #hope #savealife #dog #hollywood #friends #actors #host #instagood #instalike #photography #photoshoot #inspire #motivation #love #furbaby #instadaily Photo editor- @jmonahanphotos üì∏ by me A post shared by Mike King (@1michaelking) on Aug 15, 2017 at 12:55pm PDT
