Stacey allegedly paid the young girl for sex and made threats if the teen “did not participate in sexual servitude,” reveal the legal documents.
“I was in shock and had no idea something was going on,” Daw’s shocked neighbor, Alene Colbert, told WEAR-TV. “You see the children out playing. I just had no idea.”
Daw, the girl’s grandma, has been charged with first-degree rape and human trafficking. Stacey faces the same charges, in addition to enticing a child and promoting prostitution.
