Lisa Marie Back From the Brink - Doesn't Want To Die Young Like Dad Elvis!/n
Lisa Marie Presley has cleaned up her act — so she won’t die young like her dad, Elvis! She’s kicked her pill habit, she’s doing physical therapy and she’s working on her music — with help from her pal Pink! Lisa Marie has also gotten support from friends like Pink, who’s encouraged her to get back into singing and songwriting to deal with her demons. And there’s been a breakthrough in the contentious custody battle between Lisa Marie, 49, and estranged hubby Michael Lockwood. Sources told Radaronline.com exclusively that Lisa Marie has tentatively agreed to allow Michael unsupervised visitation. She’ll get overnight visitation with their twin girls, Harper and Finley, 8, who are currently with her mom, Priscilla. ‘Everyone feels Lisa Marie’s turned a corner,’ said the source. ‘Now we’ll see whether she can stay on the straight and narrow!’
