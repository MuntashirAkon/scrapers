As Radar previously reported, Bush has been lobbying for a comeback for nearly nine months after he was fired from the TODAY show. He got the ax following the release of an audio recording, in which Bush and Donald Trump were heard making lewd remarks about women.
The TV personality was previously hoping to make a comeback on Dancing With The Stars, but he wasn’t cast.
On GMA with Robin Roberts, the host revealed what happened when he went home to face his wife, Sydney Davis, and daughters Josie, Mary and Lillie, after the scandal broke.

“The initial moments were total chaos,” Bush told Roberts. “The paparazzi were never interested in me before, and now they’re outside the gate and ready to go. But once we settled and got to connect, there was a powerful moment — my now 16-year-old daughter [Mary] called me and she was in tears. She was really upset.”
