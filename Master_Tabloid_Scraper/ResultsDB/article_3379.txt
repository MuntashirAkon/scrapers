It’s official: Selena Gomez’s relationship with The Weeknd has reached annoying levels of cuteness.

The “Bad Liar” singer — who was spotted promoting her new single in Los Angeles Thursday (June 8, 2017) after spending a whirlwind press tour in New York City — just had to show some love for her boyfriend before she headed off to the west coast. Taking to Instagram, SelGo reached peak girlfriend levels when she shared a video of herself canoodling with The Weeknd during a dinner date.

As a good boyfriend would, The Weeknd posted a picture of his #WCW on Instagram, captioning the shot, “Glow.”
Needless to say, the blatant display of social media affection sparked a lot of response from followers — including Selena’s personal assistant Theresa Marie Mingus.
“God!! You guys are so annoying,” she joked in the comments.

“I love being supportive,” Selena recently told Sirius XM. “I love just being there and having someone’s back. It feels good. I haven’t had that feeling in a while.”
