We’re all aware of what happened yesterday, however, we’re less aware of what happened last night given that large quantities of alcohol were consumed either as a coping mechanism or a celebratory gesture based on your political views.

But it’s time to get out of bed and mobilize! You’re a grown human being with things to do, like grocery shopping or shirt-folding or marching for equal rights with Chrissy Teigen. That said, here are thirteen products that will help you get over your nasty hangover, as proven by science and personal experience.
1. Drink More Water
This Camelbak Eddy Bottle will help you restore all of the fluids that you lost while you were drinking those Cranberry Vodkas. Bring it out with you next time as a reminder to alternate alcoholic beverages with H2O.

2. Espresso, Brewed Right in Your Lap
All that you need to make a quick pick-me-up in this MiniPresso GR Espresso Maker is hot water and espresso ground coffee, like Café Bustelo. It’s portable, so you can even bring it on camping trips. This will limit the amount of caffeine that you drink, which is a good thing when you’re trying to rehydrate.

3. Take a Painkiller with that Coffee
In 2011, New Scientist reported that caffeine + coffee fights against the after-effects of pure alcohol. Don’t ask questions. Just do it.

6. Really Pamper Yourself with a Pedialyte Ice Pop
In 2015, Dr. Jeanmarie Perrone, a professor of emergency medicine at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, told the Today show, “Pedialyte and Gatorade, also touted as a hangover remedy, may help you feel better after a serious night of drinking that led to vomiting and the loss of fluid. The salt and sugar in both products help the body absorb water more effectively, which is important if you are dehydrated.”
Be advised that this does not replace the nutritional benefits of a full post-intoxication meal.

7. Eat Eggs
Eggs provide your body with energy and contain large amounts of cysteine, which is a substance that breaks down hangover-causing toxins in your liver. This Dash Go Rapid Egg Cooker makes 6 hard, medium, and soft boiled eggs, individual omelets, 2 poached eggs and scrambled eggs in under 10 minutes. A no-brainer, really.

8. Eat Bread
Toast is easy on the stomach if you’re feeling queasy and would prefer not to eat eggs alone. As it turns out, music by Bread is gentle on sensitive eardrums, too. Speaking of which…

11. But You Should Really Get Out and Exercise
“The qualities that make exercise an effective anti-depressant can help you feel better,” Katarina Borer, Ph.D., professor at the University of Michigan’s School of Kinesiology, told Men’s Health. Moving around will help you release feel-good hormones, like endorphins, norepinephrine, and adrenaline. But if you really can’t get out of bed…
