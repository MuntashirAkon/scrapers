Anne-Marie and Tour-Mate Ed Sheeran Put an Acoustic Spin on Her Dance Tune ‘Ciao Adios’/n
We’ve found your new favorite acoustic remix to put on repeat.
Rising British songstress Anne-Marie gave fans an inside look at her stripped down duet with Ed Sheeran in a new video for her single, “Ciao Adios.” And we must say, this nearly three-and-a-half-minute clip wonderfully captures a casual, relaxed jam session between two friends.
Anne-Marie, 26, is currently supporting Sheeran, 26, on his European headlining Divide Tour, and the label mates filmed the footage in her dressing room before they took the stage at his Newcastle, England, concert.

As for the meaning of the song? The answer is in the words in its title, which are Italian and Spanish for “bye.” The breakup tune, which was released in February, touches on how a protagonist decides to not waste their time any longer after finding out their significant other had cheated.
