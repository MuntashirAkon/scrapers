Ex-WWE Superstar Eva Marie Busts Out of All Red Bikini/nShe may not be in the WWE anymore, but Eva Marie is still  "All Red Everything " ... including her tiny string bikini.  Marie just parted ways with the WWE and is trying to cross over into acting. But in between auditions, Eva hit up Laguna Beach and set the place on fire.  The 32-year-old is a fitness freak -- so is her husband, Jonathan Coyle -- hence the crazy, fit physique.  Eva was with the WWE for 4 years -- after breaking onto the wrestling scene by slapping Jerry  "The King " Lawler in the face during her first appearance on  "Raw. " Best moment of his life. /n
