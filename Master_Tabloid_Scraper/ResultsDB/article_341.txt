 There She Is! Caitlyn Jenner Meets The World On The Cover Of 'Vanity Fair' — Farewell.../n
Bruce Jenner is no more. The former Olympian debuted her new female identity — and breasts — on the cover of Vanity Fair, released today, and RadarOnline.com has all the details.
Jenner, 65, proudly displayed her new curves in a cream satin bustier for the photo, taken by Annie Leibovitz. As Radar was first to report, she had breast implant surgery several months ago, before undergoing a full sex change roughly four weeks ago. Jenner also underwent multiple feminizing facial surgeries in recent weeks.

“If I was lying on my deathbed and I had kept this secret and never did anything about it, I would be lying there saying, ‘You just blew your entire life,'” Jenner told the magazine.
The issue will be released June 9.
