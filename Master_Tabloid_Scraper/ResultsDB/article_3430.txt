Giada De Laurentiis Officially Divorced ... And it Was Expensive/nGiada De Laurentiis is officially divorced from hubby Todd Thompson, but not without cost. TMZ has obtained a copy of the final divorce judgment, which orders Giada to pay Todd $9k a month in child support. Todd gets their $3.2 million house in Pacific Palisades and $300,000 in art and furnishings. He also gets to keep his membership in the swanky Bel-Air Bay Club which overlooks the Pacific. Giada gets all rights to an untitled Italian cookbook and her production company, Linguine Pictures. She also gets all rights to GDL Foods, Inc. In other words, she gets to keep her brand.  And get this ... because there was no prenup, Giada must give Todd 50% of the unpaid advances to various cookbooks that are in the works, including a $2.5 million balance for Giada at Home /Weeknights with Giada, $2.3 million for Giada Feel Good Food, and $757,000 for Everyday Pasta /Giada's Kitchen.  They're dividing up various bank accounts, with a total balance north of $2 million. And of course, he gets to keep his Porsche and she gets to keep hers. No one's getting spousal support, because they're both rich. His estimated worth is $15 million ... hers is $20 million.   They'll share joint custody of their 7-year-old daughter, Jade Marie./n
