Ivanka Trump Tweets Out A Photo With Her Child Fan Mail (?) & Fails To Notice One Hilariously Shady Drawing!/n

Beautiful things have a way of distracting Ivanka Trump from the ugly details!
That became evident when the First Daughter posted a picture with fan mail from children to Twitter and once again found herself the subject of ridicule.
On Thursday, Donald Trump's daughter sat down to marvel over a "beautiful" pile of letters written by elementary school kids thanking the White House aide.
What are they thanking her for? We'll probably never know — but it gets even better!

Several users noticed one of the drawings seemed to poke fun at the greedy First Family, and the political cartoon flew right over Vank's head!
Whichever budding cartoonist was behind that money-eyes smiley face deserves a job at The New York Times. Talk about commentary!

Are they get well cards or something? Or are they encouraging you to take away your fathers phone so he stops tweeting.

Why would anybody, especially children, send thank you letters to Ivanka Trump? https://t.co/cqBCpdKKmY
