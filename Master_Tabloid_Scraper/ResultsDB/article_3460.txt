News flash, Michael Cohen — if you support Donald Trump, you are complicit with racism and bigotry!
On Wednesday, POTUS' personal lawyer, "the son of a Holocaust survivor," sent a tweet with a collage of photos of him posing with his black colleagues… all in effort to prove he's not racist! Real convincing!
He literally tweeted:

As the son of a holocaust survivor, I have no tolerance for #racism. Just because I support @POTUS @realDonaldTrump doesn't make me a racist pic.twitter.com/lfIwdosreE

If you have to show yourself standing next to black people in order to convince yourself you aren't racist, then you are probably racist!

No. You may be worse. You're supporting a racist, anti-semitic, defender of Nazis and white supremacists for the cash.

"Look at these pics of me with people! This means I'm not racist!" No. You support a racist, you ARE a racist. Nice try @MichaelCohen212. https://t.co/66YdXcC7t9
