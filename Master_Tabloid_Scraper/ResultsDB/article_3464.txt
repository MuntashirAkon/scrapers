Miley Cyrus’ brother is out of a job thanks to his sister.

Everything started when the “Malibu” songstress congratulated Braison Cyrus for making his runway debut at Dolce & Gabbana’s Spring 2018 fashion show in Milan on Saturday (June 17, 2017). In her message, Miley gushed about her little bro’s big feat while calling out the founders Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana’s political opinions.
“Congrats @braisonccyrus on walking in your 1st runway show,” she wrote on Instagram, sharing a photo of Braison, 23, on the catwalk. “It’s never been my little brothers dream to be a model as HE is one of the most talented musicians my ears have ever been given the gift of hearing…. BUT it is a Cyrus family trait to try everything once (within reason HA) and to embrace opportunities that encourage you to step out of your comfort zone! We believe in trying something new everyday!”
The 24-year-old added, “PS D&G, I STRONGLY disagree with your politics…. but I do support your company’s effort to celebrate young artists & give them the platform to shine their light for all to see!”

The designers previously made controversial comments about gay adoption and in vitro fertilization, telling Panorama magazine, “You are born to a mother and a father — or at least that’s how it should be. I call children of chemistry, synthetic children. Rented uterus, semen chosen from a catalog.”
Unlike many other designer labels, the Dolce & Gabbana fashion house has also continued dressing First Lady Melania Trump after the 2016 Presidential Election.

“Ignorant!!” Stefano commented on Miley’s photo. He added, “For your stupid comment never more work with him.”
“We are Italian and we don’t care about politics and mostly neither about the American one!” he later wrote on his own account. “We make dresses and if you think about doing politics with a post it’s simply ignorant. We don’t need your posts or comments so next time pleasure ignore us!!”
