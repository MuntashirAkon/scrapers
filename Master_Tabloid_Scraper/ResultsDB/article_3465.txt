Brandon Flynn sure loves the 13 Reasons Why gang!

The actor couldn’t help but to spread the love when he went to see Lukas Graham’s Pepsi Sound Drop concert at New York City hotspot Kola House Wednesday (May 17, 2017). While hanging out with co-star Tommy Dorfman, the 23-year-old received a friendly kiss on the cheek from his pal as they shared a hug and posed for photos.
Previously, Flynn shared a smooch with castmate Miles Heizer while shooting Home Movies, a short film that won Honorable Mention for the Audience Award at Outfest’s Fusion Film Festival.





Though fans were speculating the two were actually an item offscreen at the time of its release, Heizer’s rep quickly refuted romance rumors, telling Page Six, “This is a false report. Miles and Brandon are friends from the show but are not dating.”
Guess the bromance is just strong on the set of 13 Reasons Why!
