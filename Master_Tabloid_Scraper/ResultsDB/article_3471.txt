Gigi Hadid is in hot water with a lot of people after a video of her appearing to make fun of Asians appeared online.

In a now-deleted Instagram clip shared by her sister, Bella Hadid, the model was seen enjoying a meal with friends at Asian restaurant. When dessert came, Gigi held up a cookie made to look like the Buddha and proceeded to mimic its expression, squinting her eyes as if to mock East Asian facial features.

Though some fans initially defended Gigi, saying that she was simply “joking” around with pals, others pointed out that the gesture was inappropriate and offensive to Asians who are often ridiculed for their distinct eyes.

Gigi mocking Asians is offensive af. I’ve been laughed at for having small eyes when I was a kid just like she mocked the Asian features

@camhadid @zainzayns @GiGiHadid the problem is she tried to copy the Asian face thing while mocking an entire race for her own humour. 💀

Some Twitter users also pointed out that her boyfriend, Zayn Malik, is of Asian descent and wondered what he thought about the situation.

Gigi is a hypocrite for making fun of Asian people yet her bf Zayn is part Asian so in a way she’s mocking him too

Last year, fans called out Gigi came under fire for imitating First Lady Melania Trump’s Slovenian accent while making a joke at the 2016 American Music Awards. Following the incident, the 21-year-old issued a handwritten apology, explaining, “I too have been the center of a nationally televised comedy skit that poked fun at my actions, and I was able to find humor in it.”

The words still out if Gigi plans to write a note about this racist snafu.
