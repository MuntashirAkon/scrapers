President Donald Trump Got the Date of His Own Inauguration Wrong/n
President Donald Trump proudly flaunted a photo from his inauguration, but there’s one problem — it has the wrong date on it!

The portrait — by Panoramic Visions Photography — touts “The Ceremony of President Donald J. Trump” going down on January 21st, 2017. Juuust a bit outside. It actually went down on Jan. 20 — as it always has since 1937.
Chalk it up to alternative facts. Maybe that’s why the prez says he’s hanging it in the Press Hall.
See the hilarious flub over at TMZ…
