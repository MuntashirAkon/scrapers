The revolving chairs at ABC News are spinning again, and while Diane Sawyer is the new Charlie Charles Gibson, George Stephanopoulos is the new Diane Sawyer. (And as if that weren't enough, Chris Cuomo is the new John Stossel, but more on that in a bit.)As has been rumored for weeks, ABC News today confirmed that veteran politico turned TV newsman Stephanopoulos will take up the Good Morning America coanchor spot that Sawyer vacates tomorrow. He'll be paired with continuing coanchor Robin Roberts.Stephanopoulos will begin his morning tenure on Monday. After 10 years on the a.m. beat, Sawyer will officially take over as World News anchor in January, but not before a trial run Dec. 21 and 22.For the time being, Stephanopoulos will be pulling double duty, continuing to host his Sunday morning political show, This Week.But those aren't the only shakeups in store for GMA loyalists...

The face behind GMA's news desk for the past three years, Cuomo announced on air today that he, too, will be leaving the a.m. chatfest after tomorrow's era-ending show in order to coanchor 20/20 alongside Elizabeth Vargas, as well as "cover breaking news and get answers for all the shows on the network.""It is a dream job for a journalist like me, but it was also a very difficult decision, because I am leaving a special place and crew and all of you, and you are all part of my family," he said in his emotional announcement."You're not going to see this mug everyday, but you will see it often, especially when it matters."While no official announcement has been made, veteran ABC news reader Juju Chang, a frequent correspondent on GMA, World News and Nightline, is expected to assume his position.
