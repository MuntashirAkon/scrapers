Lindsay Parties With Harrison Ford?/nTMZ has obtained the exclusive VIP keychain membership list at hot NYC nightclub The Plumm, and it's an odd mix of who's who in the Big Apple. A keychain gets you carte blanche access; if you've got one, you and three pals can enter the ultra-exclusive VIP area. The A-list members include Lindsay Lohan, Bill Maher, Elizabeth Berkley, Ivana Trump (!), Tyra Banks, David Schwimmer and Nora Jones. Plumm doesn't discriminate because of age; Harrison Ford and Janice Dickinson also have chains. And we're not yankin' yours. Owner Noel Ashman told TMZ,  "It's not that simple, you must be approved by one of the co-owners, " which include Damon Dash and Joey McIntyre.  "The chain is a VIP membership and it's numbered and matched with the a persons ID at the door. Ashman added,  "I was once offered $25,000 for one. " That's a lotta lettuce for The Plumm, but they're not for sale. Nick Lachey and Vanessa Minnillo had their first public spat at The Plumm. We're in!Â /n
