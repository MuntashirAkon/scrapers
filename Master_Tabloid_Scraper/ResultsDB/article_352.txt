Jim Parsons married his longtime partner Todd Spiewak over the weekend in New York City’s Rainbow Room, and now we have more photos of the event to cherish.

Parsons shared snapshots from his wedding ceremony and reception on Instagram in two sets of photos on Monday night after he and Spiewak were wed on Saturday (May 13, 2017). In one set of photos, Parsons and Spiewak pose with their best friend, wedding planner, and officiant, Melissa McNeely.
“Thank you and love you,” he wrote to McNeely in the caption of the post.



She’s our best friend, she was our wedding planner, she was our officiant and she played all three parts brilliantly this past Saturday: thank you and love you, @melissamcneeley (that Chuppah ain’t bad, either, @doan_ly !) photo cred @ambergressphotography

A second set of photos shows adorable moments from the reception.
“Reception, first dance,” Parsons noted in the caption along with fashion credits for their tuxedoes, which were both by designer Tom Ford.



Reception, first dance… (have to say thank you to #anniepsaltiras who was supposed to just be a guest but worked really hard to help us get the @tomford tuxes we loved so much AND she tied the bow ties of several guests that night. Annie is a champ and we love her ❤️) photos by @ambergressphotography (why can’t I figure out how to tag @melissamcneeley and @doan_ly ??? Oh yeah, cuz I’m old. 👌)

Parsons’ Big Bang Theory co-star Mayim Bialik attended the wedding and shared details from the ceremony in an Instagram post of her own.
“Not a cell phone in sight. Everyone was so present which sounds pretentious but it was truly powerful for us all to just want to be there fully,” she captioned the photo below. “Todd and @therealjimparsons, you are so loved. Also: hands down, prettiest chupah ever. Seriously. #chupahlove #yourlove“
