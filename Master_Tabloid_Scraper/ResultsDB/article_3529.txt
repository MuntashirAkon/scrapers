“A lot of the hospital footage is shot on Kim, Kroy [Biermann] or Brielle [Biermann]’s phones,” the insider added. “Then the cameras were able to make it for the aftermath.”
“Kim has been very vocal to the network that she wants the story told in a way to protect the family dog and herself from any liability,” the insider said.
Kash, 5, was attacked by a dog in April and was immediately rushed into emergency surgery for “traumatic injuries” . Kim, 39, thanked her husband Kroy, 31, for being so supportive at the time.
