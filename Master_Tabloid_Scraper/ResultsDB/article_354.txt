Even though she’s no longer with him, Kourtney Kardashian stills cherishes her memories with Scott Disick.

The Keeping Up with the Kardashians star has once again opened up the doors to her multi-million mansion, giving fans a glimpse at the “most sentimental” pieces she keeps around her home. As expected, some of the 37-year-old most prized possessions are heirlooms from family members — including a special artwork from her ex-boyfriend that she keeps in her living room.
“I love art and décor that reminds me of my childhood, friends or family,” she writes on her app. “Scott gave me this Damien Hirst skull print. I’m a huge fan of Damien’s art, so this was such a thoughtful present!”
Other important keepsakes around her abode are the Yamaha grand piano she took music lessons on as a child, an enormous Annie Leibovitz book from sister Kendall Jenner, Syrian inlaid game boxes and books that belonged to the late Robert Kardashian, and a shoe from singer Elton John.

“These are my dad’s law books and some of the books from his home, along with a costume design history book that I studied in college,” she shares. “The Lucite box holds Elton John’s platforms shoes that he gave to my father. My dad always kept them in his closet, but I had them put into a shadow box, since they are so special.”
The mom-of-three adds that she likes displaying her kids’ artwork as decor, writing, “I love to display the masterpieces that my kids make! The kids and I enjoy seeing it on the fridge all year long!”
