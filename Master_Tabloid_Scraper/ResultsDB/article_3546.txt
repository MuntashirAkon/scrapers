Teresa and Joe’s problems began when Teresa checked in for an 11-month prison stint in 2015 — the same year Joe cheated twice with a much younger mistress. Joe revealed that Teresa “would never leave him” at the time.
Then, Joe was caught cheating again with a strip club vixen, but Teresa denied that an infidelity occurred.
But, she confessed she knew about her husband’s philandering ways at the RHONJ season 7 reunion. The reunion aired after Joe checked himself into prison.
