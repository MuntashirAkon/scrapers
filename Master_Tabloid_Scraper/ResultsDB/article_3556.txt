Chrissy Teigen may be known for her love of food, but she has a slightly dark past with alcohol.

In a new interview, the model gets candid about her drinking habits and opens up about past struggles with alcohol. Though she still frequents parties with open bars, the 31-year-old says she had to cut back on her drinking after she started to not like how she was behaving at Hollywood events.
Via Wet Paint:
“I was, point blank, just drinking too much. I got used to being in hair and makeup and having a glass of wine,” she told Cosmopolitan. “Then that glass of wine would carry over into me having one before the awards show. And then a bunch at the awards show.”
She continued, “And then I felt bad for making kind of an ass of myself to people that I really respected.”
