Adrienne Bailon married her sweetie, Israel Houghton, on Friday (Nov. 11, 2016), in a beautiful ceremony in Paris.
According to People, the couple exchanged vows in front of family and friends at the Hotel Plaza Athénéel. The night before, they celebrated a rehearsal dinner at hot spot Ferdi, where the two first met approximately a decade ago.
“I genuinely just feel so blessed and grateful. I’ve honestly never been happier in my entire life,” Bailon told People. “I’ve never felt what I feel right now. I can’t even describe what it is, but it’s such a peace mixed with total excitement.”

She added, “I’m so glad we chose such an intimate group of who have shared in our journey and know our hearts and that I honestly feel comfortable crying in front of. I didn’t want to invite people I felt I had to put on a performance for. I wanted every moment to be genuine and really special and that’s what it is going to be.”
Bailon’s The Real co-hosts Loni Love, Jeannie Mai and Tamera Mowry-Housley were among the 70 guests in attendance.
In early September, Bailon told E! News that she and Houghton, a gospel singer, were planning on an “elegant and intimate” setting for the dream day. “We agree on everything. That’s weird,” she joked. “He actually has better taste than me, so if I picked something else, I always go with him because he always has better taste.”
Congratulations to the happy couple!
