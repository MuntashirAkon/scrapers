Maynard Johnson can be seen enjoying ice cream with their son, stopping briefly to clink their sweets together in an imitation of a ‘cheers.’
The reality star has three children: Ricki, 12, from a previous relationship, Jennings Tyler and Gibson Kyle, 11 months, whom she shares with Johnson.
In December, the mother of three revealed to PEOPLE that she and her husband were not done having children, expressing a strong desire to have more.

“I definitely think we’ll have at least one more. [Tyler] wants two more,” she said. “[My daughter Ricki] will be out of the house and the babies will still be young.”
The couple welcomed their son Gibson Kyle in September 2016, just 14 months after Jennings Tyler.
“We’re going to plan this one a little better. We’ll space it out a little bit better,” she said. “This has been the hardest thing I’ve ever done.”

Though motherhood can be challenging at times, she has a special helper to relieve her every now and and then: her daughter, Ricki.
“Ricki likes to take him for a walk,” she previously told PEOPLE. “She likes to push the stroller. She likes to pick out his outfits. And she’s really into decorating onesies. She irons on patches. It’s really cute. I love to see [Gibson] and Ricki together. She’s such a little mommy. She’s so protective of both of her brothers.”
