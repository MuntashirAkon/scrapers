Watch Conor McGregor Celebrate After Losing to Floyd Mayweather: ‘We Can Still Party Like’ I Won/n

 
Conor McGregor might not have come out on top in Saturday night’s match against Floyd Mayweather, but it didn’t stop him from celebrating.
In a video posted by TMZ, the 29-year-old Irish pro fighter is in high spirits at Las Vegas’ Encore Beach Club at Night, dressed in a festive suit with his home country’s flag proudly draped over his shoulders.
“It didn’t go our way, but we [can] still party like it did go our way,” McGregor addressed the cheering crowd while tunes like Fat Joe‘s “All the Way Up” and Notorious B.I.G.‘s “Hypnotize” play in the background.

The highly anticipated fight came after a four-day press tour in which both competitors had some choice words for each other, including accusations of racism and various other personal insults.
Held at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, the match was attended by quite the bevy of big names, including power couple Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez, Leonardo DiCaprio and Charlize Theron.
