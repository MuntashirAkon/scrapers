News exclusively. "They aren't engaged, but it could definitely happen. I don't know if she would get married again, but she would get engaged. She loves being in a committed relationship and having a partner. They are a very good match."Kate and Danny, a musician, have not commented about marriage prospects.

Goldie had told E! News' Jason Kennedy at the Snatched premiere that Danny "is a wonderful person."She and partner Kurt Russell, who raised Kate and her brother Oliver Hudson, are unmarried and have been together for more than 30 years.In an interview with Self magazine in 2014, Kate discussed their relationship."If I look at my parents, who've been together thirty-something years, I'd say no matter what they've been through, they share similar values and really like each other," she says. "It sounds easy, but it's not."
