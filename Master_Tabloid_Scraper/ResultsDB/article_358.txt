Lately, Kristen Stewart and singer St. Vincent have been all but inseparable, but whether or not the talented twosome is more than mere friends was a matter of heated speculation until now.

Last night (Oct. 16, 2016), images surfaced of Stewart and Annie Clark (St. Vincent’s real name) sharing a bite to eat at a restaurant in Manhattan’s East Village. And during their meal al fresco, they shared a passionate kiss by candlelight!
Also, throughout the night, the brand-new couple held hands as they strolled around the city together. This sure feels like the cat is out of the bag!
To complicate things, earlier that day Clark was also spotted chatting at an intersection with her ex-girlfriend Cara Delevingne. The duo parted ways in late August, just as Stewart began cavorting around town with Clark.
