Angelina Jolie has been spotted for the very first time since filing for divorce from Brad Pitt.

On Sunday (Oct. 16, 2016), Jolie was photographed touring a new rental unit in Malibu with five of her six children and her brother, James Haven. ET reports the family, who was joined by a security team and the children’s nannies, spent over an hour touring the property.

Jolie wore a long tan cardigan and seemed in “good spirits” as she toured the property barefoot after playing on the beach with her children. “The kids were running around and they seemed happy and to be doing well,” a source said. “Zahara ran out to the beach by the water. The kids were playing on the beach.”
Pitt has yet to be seen since Jolie filed for divorce last month, but he was able to see his children for the first time during a supervised visit last week.
