Kristen Stewart and St. Vincent nailed the punk look from head to toe during a lunch errand in New York City.

Stewart and Cara Delevingne’s ex-girlfriend picked up some sushi and took a stroll around New York City on Tuesday (Oct. 5, 2016). St. Vincent, whose real name is Annie Clark, layered an embroidered zip-up over a vintage David Bowie tee tucked into a simple black skirt. She accessorized with a blue bandana, cat eye glasses, and black loafers. Stewart opted for a checkered T-shirt, styled as a slight crop top, with a bright orange hoodie, reflective sunglasses, and lace-up sneakers.

Stewart and St. Vincent were last seen together at the New York Film Festival premiere of Certain Women. Tabloids are shipping the pair as an item since Stewart and her girlfriend Alicia Cargile haven’t been seen together in public in a few weeks. This could be true, but the weather could have simultaneously called them for udon just as well.
