Matt Damon, Watch Out Alt-Right, March at Your Own Peril in Boston /nMatt Damon clearly thinks everyone has a right to exercise free speech in this country, but the alt-right may be in for a surprise Saturday in Boston. We got the Boston native at LAX Friday and he never suggested the marchers would be met with physical resistance, but listen not just to his words but how he says them.   It's interesting ... organizers of the rally have denounced the Charlottesville violence and racist message, claiming they are a conglomerate of libertarians, progressives, conservatives and independents. But police are worried this will become a rally laced with racism. Matt knows a thing or 2 about being Boston strong, so maybe the marchers should keep that in mind./n
