Tupac's 1996 Hummer Sold for Second Time at Bargain Basement Price/nTupac Shakur's final ride -- a 1996 Hummer he bought a month before he was killed -- has found a new owner once again ... and the buyer scored a pretty heavy discount. We broke the story ... the rapper's vehicle sold for a whopping $337,000 in May 2016 to an Ohio bidder, but got sent back to the auction blockÂ when the guy flaked. RR Auction relisted the Hummer and it sold Friday for $206,531 ... $130k less than last time. Now it's just a matter of waiting and seeing if the anonymous winning bidder pays up. All eyez on him (or her)./n
