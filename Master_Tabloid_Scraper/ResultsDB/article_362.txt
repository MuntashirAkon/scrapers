Catherine Hicks, who played the patient matriarch Annie Camden on the long-running show 7th Heaven, would “love” to get together with her TV family for a reunion, just so long as they kill off Reverend Eric Camden, played by co-star Stephen Collins.
Collins confessed to child molestation in 2014, which caused reruns of the show to be pulled off the air.
TMZ caught up with Hicks to ask about a reunion possibility, and she said, “I think we’d all love to be together,” jokingly adding, “We’d have to open with Stephen’s coffin.”
The actress also joked the show could then be called “6th [Heaven],” saying the show could include “a new boyfriend for Annie.” That could work! Watch the vid below:
