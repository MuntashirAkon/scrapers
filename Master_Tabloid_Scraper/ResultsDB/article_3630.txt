“My will is weak but I can’t stand anything. I sound crazy but I think I’m going crazy,” the Some Like It Hot star wrote on Hotel Bel-Air letterhead stationery to the highly acclaimed method actor and theater teacher.
“It’s just that I get before a camera and my concentration and everything I’m trying to learn leaves me. Then I feel like I’m not existing in the human race at all.”

The beautifully scripted note is expected to fetch $30,000 to $50,000 when it goes up for auction on May 30, along with 250 other historical documents that are being sold by an anonymous American collector.
Among the rare items are a typed, undated draft letter from John Lennon to Linda and Paul McCartney expressing his feelings about the animosity between the two Beatles founders, two large photo albums that Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini exchanged prior to War World II, and a grand total of 58 letters from Dwight D. Eisenhower to his wife, Mamie, during World War II. /n
