"Emily Owens, M.D." Is Just What The Doctor Ordered!/n
Mamie Gummer plays the title character in this sweet new series about a young doctor starting her internship, Star magazine reports. But at the hospital it’s just like high school, when she was the brainy girl with the nickname Pits. 
Even worse: Her former nemesis (Aja Naomi King) also works there — and is hitting it off with Will (Justin Hartley), Emily’s medschool crush.
 It’s smart and funny — but with the life-and-death edge of the best medical shows.
Premieres Tuesday, Oct. 16, at 9PM on The CW /n
