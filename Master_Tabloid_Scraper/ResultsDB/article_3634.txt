Permit Required For Monkeyburgers/n
A Brooklyn, New York, court dismissed the claim of Mamie Manneh that the federal government has engaged in religious persecution. The Liberian native was prosecuted for reportedly smuggling the meat of an endangered African monkey into the country.
U.S. District Judge Raymond J. Dearie did not deny her claim that the meat has “religious significance,” but said that she still should have obtained import permits before having a relative in Guinea send her a dozen boxes full of monkey meat hidden under smoked fish and African dresses.
Hopefully, the dresses were dry cleaned before wearing. /n
