Lance Needs a Bicycle Built for 3/n
Radar obsessively tracks the boldface names in the country’s top gossip columns—Rush & Molloy, Cindy Adams, Page Six, Liz Smith, Gatecrasher, and MSNBC’s The Scoop …
Tory Burch: Two mentions (Gatecrasher, Page Six). Olivia Palermo isn’t the only socialite gracing the rags this morning: Burch got several mentions after her ex-husband, Chris, was spotted sucking face with restaurateur Jennifer Worthington at J-Lo’s album release party. Wonder if Tory’s boyfriend, Lance Armstrong, still feels like a winner? 
Meryl Streep: Three mentions (Rush & Molloy, Cindy Adams, Liz Smith).  La Streep is one busy lady. She was seen checking out a Carroll Dunham show at the Gladstone Gallery last weekend, and she’s also gearing up to star in a Tom Cruise-produced, Robert Redford-directed movie called Lions for Lambs. Not to be outdone, her daughter, stage actress Mamie Gummer, was spotted getting down at The Plumm. /n
