Meryl Streep Continues To Fight For Gender 'Balance' In Hollywood — 'I Am A Humanist'/n

Meryl for President!
In her upcoming film Suffragette, Meryl Streep plays activist Emmeline Pankhurst, and tells the story of how women won the right to vote in early 20th century Britain.
In an interview released Monday, the Hollywood icon opened up about the challenges women continue to face in showbiz. As one of the most respected advocates for gender equality, the mother of four shared:
"I am a humanist, I am for nice easy balance."
We're right there with ya, Meryl!

So what would she change in order to improve the film industry? The Into The Woods star offered:
"Men should look at the world as if something is wrong when their voices predominate. They should feel it. People at agencies and studios, including the parent boards, might look around the table at the decision-making level and feel something is wrong if half their participants are not women. Because our tastes are different, what we value is different. Not better, different."
If anyone knows what they're talking about, it's definitely her!
When questioned if she's frustrated about being paid less than her male counterparts, Meryl quipped:
"Oh darlin', why ever would you imagine that?"
Ha! Um, duh!
Speaking of silly questions, the 66-year-old can't stand when she's asked:
"'You often play very strong women… Why do you choose…? Blah blah blah.' No man is ever asked: 'You often play very strong men. Why?' It would be an absurd question."
After all this time you'd think gender equality wouldn't continue to be such a huge issue — but we're thankful for Meryl who has fought this battle during her nearly 40-year career!
Hats off!!
