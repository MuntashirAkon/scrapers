In this music-packed flick, Streep stars opposite her real-life daughter Mamie Gummer — who just so happens to be playing her daughter in the film — Kevin Kline plays her ex-husband, and Rick Springfield plays a member of her band who's also in love with Ricki.
The rockingly heartwarming dramedy is due out August 7, 2015, but you can ch-ch-check out the trailer (above) in the meantime.
