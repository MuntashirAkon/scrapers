Gerard Darel’s luxe bags are already a favorite with the big screen’s hottest fashionistas like Halle Berry, Eva Longoria and Jessica Alba. And now, WWD reports, the French fashion house is snagging one of Hollywood’s up-and-coming actress to represent the brand. Mamie Gummer, lookalike daughter of iconic actress Meryl Streep, will replace Gallic singer and actress Charlotte Gainsbourg, who has been the label’s face since 2003. As much as we love Charlotte, we can’t wait to see Mamie in action. But we want to know what you think. Tell us, how do you feel about Gerard Darel’s decision to feature an up-and-comer for their campaign?
