Mamie Gummer will cross paths with Sherlock Holmes! E! News can exclusively reveal Gummer will guest star in a season three episode of the hit CBS drama Elementary slated to air later this fall.Gummer, who has appeared several times on The Good Wife and starred in the CW's Emily Owens, M.D., will play Margaret Bray, a New York heiress who runs her family's charitable foundation. After a rare map that belonged to her family leads to bloodshed—and two deaths!—Margaret finds herself a somewhat unlikely aide to Holmes (Jonny Lee Miller) and Watson's (Lucy Liu) investigation…and in danger herself!

Gummer, daughter to Meryl Streep and Don Gummer, and sister to Extant's Grace Gummer, has appeared in The Big C, Off the Map and John Adams, and on the big screen in films such as The Lifeguard and Side Effects. On The Good Wife, she recurs as attorney Nancy Crozier, generally a thorn in Alicia's (Julianna Margulies) side.Other guest stars for Elementary season three include Ophelia Lovibond as Kitty Walkter, Sherlock's new protégé and Mad Men's Rich Sommer as Harlan Emple. Liu will direct an episode of Elementary season three.Elementary gets a late start this year, resuming after CBS' Thursday Night Football wraps in late October. Elementary season three premieres Oct. 30 at 10 p.m.
