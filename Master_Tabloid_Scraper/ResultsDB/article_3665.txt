They showcase colorful styles from Clare Vivier's new Co-Lab collection, which features shoes, bags and accessories and will be made available for purchase on March 5."I was thrilled when &OS enlisted my friends and favorite sisters, Mamie, Grace and Louisa Gummer, to star in the campaign, which was shot by legendary photographer Stephen Shore," the Los Angeles-based designer said on her website. "The shoot took place a few months ago at my home and at CVHQ."In two pics, the three stand in the sun while wearing bright button-down shirts, three types of jeans and three types of handbags.

Another one shows the sisters in the same outfits, sitting on a flight of concrete steps.

The three also pose by themselves.Two of the sisters are actresses Grace, 28, appeared on American Horror Story and Extant and also played media enthusiast Hallie Shea on HBO's The Newsroom.

Mamie, 31, plays Nancy Crozier on The Good Wife and is also known for playing the title role on Emily Owens, M.D.

Louisa, 23, is the professional model among them. She is signed to the prestigious IMG Models agency. 

Even Vivier's dog Paco got to take part in the shoot!

The sisters' father is Streep's husband of 36 years, Don Gummer, a 68-year-old sculptor.

He and his three-time Oscar-winning wife, 65, are also parents to a son, Henry Wolfe Gummer, a 35-year-old musician.
