Apparently another medical drama is not what the doctor ordered.The CW has canceled their freshman series Emily Owens, M.D., which stars Meryl Streep's daughter Mamie Gummer as a nerdy surgeon navigating life at a hospital. Alas, it wasn't all bad news in the TV world today: ABC officially picked up additional episodes of Tim Allen's Last Man Standing and Reba McEntire's Malibu Country. 

Though it's officially been canned, all of Emily Owens, M.D. 13 episodes will be aired. The most recent episode of the series only brought in 1 million viewers and a paltry 0.3 rating in the adults 18-49 demo. The CW gave full-season orders to its other two fall newbies, Arrow and Beauty and the Beast.The Friday night comedy line-up of Last Man Standing, which is in its second season, and Malibu Country has done extremely well for ABC, who ordered five more episodes of each series, giving them their "back nine." (Since Last Man Standing and Malibu Country premiered late, only five episodes were necessary to complete their respective seasons.) Recently, ABC renewed freshman series Nashville and The Neighbors, and gave sophomore political soap Scandal a full season order.
