UPDATE: Kaya Scodelario and Benjamin Walker have tied the knot!The actress posted an adorable shot on Instagram featuring wedding cake toppers with a message that read: "Happy New Year everyone... Here's to 2016 being filled with love, laughter and cake for everyone! And thank you again @okezzer for making our wedding so special and full of your genius craft skills."________People on your Facebook feed weren't the only ones to get engaged over the holidays—Kaya and Benjamin did, too, the actress's rep confirmed to E! News.The Maze Runner star showed off an impressive diamond ring on Instagram Sunday (and yes, it was on that finger), and thanked Meryl Streep's former son-in-law "for making me the happiest woman in the world."And in a very engagement-esque shot, the 22-year-old English star planted a romantic kiss on her 32-year-old Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter beau. She also Instagrammed a picture of herself snuggled up to her probable fiancé with her mother on his other side. "Showing mum around our new home," she wrote, adding, "I [heart] NY."

It would appear that the couple now live together in New York, but this hasn't always been the case. Back in October, Scodelario talked to the Daily Mail about her then long distance romance. "Ben lives in New York and I live in London, so we have to work hard to see each other," she said. "You have to go for it, which I like."This will be the first marriage for Scodelario, who previously dated Shameless' Elliott Tittensor. It will be the second time downy he aisle for Walker, who was married to Streep's daughter, actress Mamie Gummer, from 2011 to 2013.(Originally published Dec. 29, 2014, at 10:53 a.m. PT)
