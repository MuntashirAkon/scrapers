After penning a powerful op-ed in the Huffington Post slamming body shaming and the objectification of women in tabloids, Jennifer Aniston is getting support from celebs left and right – including her husband Justin Theroux, who made her his #WCW today (July 13, 2016).

Providing the link to her article with the cute hashtag #gogirl, Theroux posted this photo of Aniston:

While admitting that she does not like to address gossip, Aniston noted: “For the record, I am not pregnant. What I am is fed up. I’m fed up with the sport-like scrutiny and body shaming that occurs daily under the guise of ‘journalism,’ the ‘First Amendment’ and ‘celebrity news.'”
“The objectification and scrutiny we put women through is absurd and disturbing,” she continued in the Huffington Post. “The way I am portrayed by the media is simply a reflection of how we see and portray women in general, measured against some warped standard of beauty.”

She powerfully added, “We don’t need to be married or mothers to be complete. We get to determine our own ‘happily ever after’ for ourselves.”
Melissa McCarthy is another supporter, who said during an Entertainment Tonight interview that she’s “one hundred thousand billion percent” behind Aniston.
Everybody needs to stop tearing down women. It’s always about the way we look ― saying, ‘He’s very interesting,’ ‘He’s a good writer,’ ‘She’s looking older than she was last time we saw her.’ It’s a ridiculous thing. I just hope it gets to the point where it’s embarrassing for people to have such a shallow thought.
Other celebs like Olivia Wilde and Nikki Reed took to social media to praise Aniston for her honesty on how our culture grossly uses “celebrity ‘news’ to perpetuate this dehumanizing view of females, focused solely on one’s physical appearance, which tabloids turn into a sporting event of speculation.”

To no one’s surprise, Piers Morgan took an anti-Aniston stance and wrote a counter-essay to Aniston’s entitled, ‘My dear Jennifer, if you’re so fed up with having your body judged, stop trying to make it look so Photoshop-perfect on magazine covers.”
Chrissy Teigen and Anna Paquin responded to Morgan on Twitter:


@piersmorgan saw your piece on Jennifer Aniston. Why do you ALWAYS take the road of being the piece of shit asshole?

@piersmorgan particularly with women and people of color. tell me it's just for clicks?? Please tell me you aren't TRULY this vile.

@piersmorgan You missed the point by about a mile. As you aren't a woman in public eye I respectfully suggest you "think and not say"/jog on
