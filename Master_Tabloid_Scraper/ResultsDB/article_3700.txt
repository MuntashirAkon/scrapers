Jessica Simpson Celebrates Her Son Ace's 4th Birthday With An Amazing Moana-Themed Party! Too Cute!/n

Every turn I take, every trail I track
Every path I make, every road leads back
To the place I know, where I cannot go
Where I long to be…
A PARTY!
Jessica Simpson undoubtably shelled out a ton of cash and hired pal Stephanie Terblanche to recreate the fictional Polynesian island, Isle of Te Fete, from Disney's Moana for her son Ace Knute Johnson's 4th birthday party on Sunday.

Complete with an exceptional island vibe, Moana, rooster Heihei, and demigod Maui — this party was so cute! The entire crew wore floral prints and Jess decked herself out in a sexy Dolce & Gabbana dress.
Ch-ch-check out all the pics shot by photographer Kristin Burns in the gallery (above)!
What can Jessica say except you're welcome :) Ace is a lucky boy!
