Well, according to The Sun, it's because she's got a hot new Brit boyfriend — one she's trying to keep secret!
According to The Sun's source, Tay is renting a flat in London to be close to her new guy, a 26-year-old actor named Joe Alwyn! And she's gone to great lengths to keep him out of the spotlight: 

"Taylor has flown in via private jets and her security has made it a military-like mission to prevent her from being seen. She's been walking around with Joe in London using disguises to keep her identity under wraps. Nobody has a clue they've been walked past a music superstar – not even her new neighbours."
While this may be out of the press, the relationship is reportedly the real deal — and has been going on for months! According to someone in Tay's inner circle:

"This isn't a new couple alert or a secret relationship – the only people this has been a secret to is the media because all of us, Taylor and Joe's closest friends and their families, were aware they have been together for several months and have known each other for a long time. After her 1989 tour and all the attention Taylor received, she learned she had to be more protective of her personal life and she and Joe decided early on to keep their private life private."

We're damn impressed she was able to keep it secret so long!
Not to mention we're crazy happy for her — he's a cutie!
