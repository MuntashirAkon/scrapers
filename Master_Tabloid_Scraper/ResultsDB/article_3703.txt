Jennifer Aniston & Justin Theroux Nail It Once Again At Louis Vuitton While Michelle Williams & Cate Blanchett Fall Short/n

Ah, the fabulous ones.
Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux were the king and queen of the Louis Vuitton X Jeff Koons exhibition in Paris Tuesday night. They even posed like royalty!

We're seriously in love with Jen's look â€” she wears that leather Vuitton corset like a goddess. And the blazer and pants work perfectly with such a bold piece!
Justin also rocked leather, wearing a seriously sexy pair of pants with a simple black knit top. He and his wifey are just perfect for each other.
Others at the event, including Michelle Williams and Cate Blanchett, were less fashionably fortunate. Michelle's floral silk dress with lace inserts looked like a cross between a table cloth and a doily, while Cate came just short of nailing it thanks to her horribly fitted pants.
Oh well, not everyone can do it right!
