We still don’t know the exact nature of Rihanna’s characacter in the new all-female reboot of Ocean’s Eleven. We do know that she will disguise herself as a janitor to pull off the heist.

The singer is filming in New York, and was snapped looking determined as she wheeled her trash can through the set, according to The Daily Mail. She wore a jumpsuit, featuring the name “Angela,” with her hair in braids draped over her shoulders. With earbuds in, Rihanna does her best to look inconspicuous.
The film also stars Sandra Bullock, Cate Blanchett, Helena Bonham Carter, Anne Hathaway, Mindy Kaling, and Sarah Paulson. Damien Lewis also appears as the film’s villain.
