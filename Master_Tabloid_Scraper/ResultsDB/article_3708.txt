New set pics from the upcoming all-female heist movie Ocean’s Eight show Rihanna going what we assume is incognito as a building janitor. She still rocks a work jumpsuit, though.
Complete with cleaning cart and headphones for her music, Rihanna filmed the scenes in the lobby of a Times Square building in Midtown Manhattan.
Later, Bad Gal was seen getting warmed up with a big puffy jacket and with the help of a personal assistant. Launch the gallery above!

Although we still aren’t sure what kind of character Rihanna is playing, we do know she is starring with Sandra Bullock, Cate Blanchett, Mindy Kaling, Sarah Paulson, Anne Hathaway and Helena Bonham Carter in a spin-off from the Steven Soderbergh’s Ocean’s trilogy.
In other Rih news, the singer recently denied she threw shade at Beyoncé when she liked an Instagram post that criticized the Grammys for playing favorites with Bey in their 2017 nominations and leaving out Rihanna’s album Anti from major categories.
