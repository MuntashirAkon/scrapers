Sandra Bullock and Bryan Randall, her boyfriend of a year and a half, are just peachy as is and are in no hurry to get married.

A source told E! News that the couple is “doing perfectly,” and even though they have busy lives, they are committed to spending as much time together as possible. “They have been really busy but always make time to see each other. They are very content with how things are going in their relationship.”
Bullock, who has called the photographer and model her “soul mate,” have discussed tying the knot, but it’s not a priority. The insider explained, “Marriage has been discussed, but that’s not something that they need to do. They both have been in serious relationships in the past that they have learned from, so they are aware what they want and why they don’t. They are life partners. They will be spending the holidays together like they always have over the past few years. They are extremely in love.”

If they do wed, we probably won’t know about it until after it’s done. “It will be private and under the radar. That’s just the kind of couple they are, especially since Sandra’s life was so exposed with her past relationship,” the source previously told E!, referring to Bullock’s previous five-year marriage to Jesse James. “Bryan respects that.”
Bullock is currently shooting Ocean’s Eight in NYC, all-female spin-off of the Steven Soderbergh Ocean trilogy that starred George Clooney and Brad Pitt.
