Matt Damon, who starred in all three installments of Steven Soderbergh’s Ocean’s trilogy, will reprise his role of Linus Caldwell in the upcoming all-female spin-off of the iconic heist movies.

“I’m doing a little bit in the movie,” he confirmed to Entertainment Tonight. “I haven’t read it yet, but the cast is phenomenal and I’m excited to see what those women do with it. It’s going to be fun.”
Though Damon will make a cameo in the new flick, George Clooney is said to be staying behind-the-camera as the film’s producer alongside Soderbergh.
Starring Sandra Bullock as the sister of George Clooney’s character, Ocean’s Eight will feature a star-studded cast including Rihanna, Cate Blanchett, Mindy Kaling, Sarah Paulson, Helena Bonham Carter, Anne Hathaway, Dakota Fanning, and rapper Awkwafina.
Ocean’s Eight is currently being filmed in New York City. The movie is slated to be released on June 8, 2018.
