No bra? No problem!

Rihanna was all about that braless life when she went to film scenes for Ocean’s Eight, the female spin-off of Steven Soderbergh’s Ocean’s trilogy, in New York City on Friday (Nov. 4, 2016). Bad gal was seen in a yellow crochet crop top, a pair of denim overalls, chunky brown boots, and a knitted beanie.
