Rihanna, Cate Blanchett, Mindy Kaling, Sarah Paulson and Helena Bonham Carter were all spotted on the set of Ocean’s Eight, the female spin-off of Steven Soderbergh’s Ocean’s trilogy, in New York City on Thursday (Nov. 3, 2016).

Rihanna, who spotted rocking dreadlocks and a Rastacap this week, had her hair in an updo as she flaunted her toned stomach in a crop top, camouflage-printed pants, and a knitted sweater.
Meanwhile, co-stars each wore distinctive, stylized outfits presumably reflecting their respective character’s personalities.
