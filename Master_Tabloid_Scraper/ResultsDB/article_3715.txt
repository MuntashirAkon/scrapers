Rihanna headed to set on Wednesday (Nov. 2, 2016) to film a scene for the upcoming Ocean’s Eight, the all-female take on the Ocean’s series.
Unlike yesterday (Nov. 1, 2016,) when she was spotted in a fur coat, the singer went for a casual outfit, sporting a Rastafarian look with long dreadlocks under a knit hat, an army green jacket, black Bob Marley t-shirt and torn jeans.
Her co-stars Cate Blanchett and Sandra Bullock were also on hand. Blanchett looked cool in a blue blazer and leather pants, while Bullock was spotted dashing from her trailer to film a scene with a coffee in hand. Launch the gallery above!
Helena Bonham Carter, Mindy Kaling, Anne Hathaway, and Nora “Awkwafina” Lum make up some of the other cast members, and Sarah Paulson is in talks to join.

Not much of Ocean’s Eight’s plot has been revealed, but it’s been reported Bullock will play Danny Ocean’s (George Clooney in the recent series) sister, who rounds up a crew to steal a necklace from the Met Gala.
Ocean’s Eight is scheduled for release in 2018.
