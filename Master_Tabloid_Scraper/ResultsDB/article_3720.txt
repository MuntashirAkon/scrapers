FAME PICTURES

Stella? Only if it's ice-cold and applied at regular intervals to Cate Blanchett's bonked noggin.First, the good news: Blanchett is "absolutely fine." The bad news: She was left bleeding from the back of the neck during her Sydney run of A Streetcar Named Desire today (the folks Down Under have got a good 18 hours on us) when a costar accidentally hit her in the head with a prop radio mid-scene."There was a minor incident on stage that unfortunately did injure Cate," Sydney Theatre Company spokesman Tim McKeough told Australia's Daily Telegraph.That "minor" incident made Blanchett fall onstage and enlist the aid of a prop nightie to stem the flow of blood before theater staff evacuated the venue and ultimately canceled the performance.Still, nothing a practiced thesp can't take in stride. Blanchett's Blanche DuBois is expected to return tomorrow night."Everyone is fine," McKeogh said. "Cate was injured, she got a bump on the head, but we're confident she will be on stage."No doubt as an even more blanched Blanche.
