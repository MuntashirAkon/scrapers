Lindsay Lohan -- I'll Flee the U.S. for Monaco Before Going to Jail/nLindsay Lohan vows to become a fugitive from justice and will flee to Monaco if she doesn't complete her community service on time. We know Lindsay is keenly aware of the looming May 28th deadline, and she knows there's a real chance she won't complete her required hours. We also know she's been told she's going to jail if she falls short, and this time she actually believes it. So Lindsay has made it clear to friends and family ... if she doesn't get it done, she won't go back to California for her court hearing. She says a very rich friend has a hotel in Monaco and has given her carte blanche to stay indefinitely, and she'll take him up on the offer. Thing is ... she can't be extradited for a reckless driving misdemeanor, so authorities can't touch her. In the unlikely event she actually completes her community service on time, she says she'll gladly go to court, but then it's definitely off to Monaco for vacation.  Drive safely, Monaco residents./n
