Spotted: Dr. Murray's Wife in Vegas/nWhile Dr. Conrad Murray scrambles to resolve his child support issues in Vegas, his wife -- Dr. Blanche Y. Bonnick Murray -- was out in Sin City running errands today ... looking cool, calm and collected. The Doc (Conrad) has three days to appear in a Las Vegas court before a judge issues a bench warrant for his arrest. He's also still in hot water for fueling Michael Jackson with Propofol ... which the L.A. County Coroner says killed him.  See Also  Doc Murray Lawyers Up/n
