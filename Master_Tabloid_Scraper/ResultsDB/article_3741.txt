Ron White's Former Assistant -- I'm No Embezzler ... Just a Hard Worker/nRon White's former assistantÂ says he's no embezzler, because everything he spent on White's dime was with the comedian's approval. Brendan Vaughn insists White gave him carte blanche to write checks totaling thousands of dollars. White begs to differ ... claiming Vaughn bought clothes, paid for hotel rooms and racked up credit card bills on his dime. Vaughn insists White and his wife knew he was buying all the stuff and never complained, including White's business manager who keeps track of all the bills. And Vaughn says, all of the charges were work-related, and the hotel and clothing charges were purchased for events he attended with the Whites. Cops are investigating./n
