Listen To This: Not Outta Love!/n

It's hard for a diva of a certain age to have great commercial success on the radio, but if this were 2002 this song would be a huge hit worldwide!
We have a soft spot for Anastacia and her latest single is the best she's released in years!
Pop with slight middle-Eastern and rock influences, this is sonically exciting and her distinct and big voice remains stellar!
Check out Caught In The Middle above!
