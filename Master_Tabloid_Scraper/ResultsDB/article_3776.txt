Kristen Stewart Maintains She's Been 'Deeply In Love' With ALL Of Her Exes!/n

Nothing like a good cheese analogy to shine a light on the quirks in someone's love life.
Kristen Stewart turned to dairy products in order to perfectly articulate her open-mindedness when it comes to falling in love. Oh, KStew.

The Twilight alum explained to Harper's Bazaar: 
"Some people know they like grilled cheese and they'll eat it every day for the rest of their lives. I want to try everything. If I have a grilled cheese once I'm like, 'That was cool, what's next?'"
We can see where she's coming from. We mean, the 27-year-old has quite the dating record as she's dated the likes of Robert Pattinson, Alicia Cargile, Soko, and (currently) Stella Maxwell.
And despite her diverse dating history, Stewart maintains that she was "deeply in love" with all of her past partners. The Cafe Society actress noted at one point:
"I've been deeply in love with everyone I've dated. Did you think I was faking it? I've always embraced a duality. And really, truly, believed in it and never felt confused or struggling. I just didn't like getting made fun of."
We're LOVING this VVV open Kristen. Although, we have a feeling the backlash Kristen faced following her scandalous affair with director Rupert Sanders made her shy about discussing her love life in the press.
Nonetheless, it seems as though these days Miz Stewart is done hiding her truth from the public. LOVES it.
