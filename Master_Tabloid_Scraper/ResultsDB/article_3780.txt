Kristen Stewart was recently seen photographing girlfriend Stella Maxwell while hanging out of a moving vehicle. With just an iPhone in hand, the Twilight alum risked her limbs — literally! — as she snapped shots of the model posing from the opposite passenger window.
Via TMZ:
Kristen Stewartenjoyed the benefits of dating supermodel Stella Maxwell by playing photographer for her during an impromptu photo shoot … while hanging out of a moving car … in lingerie.
