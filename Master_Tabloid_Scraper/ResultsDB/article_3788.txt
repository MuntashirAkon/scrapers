Kendall Jenner has worn a lot of outrageous things in the past, but her latest look takes the cake.

While walking the runway at Moschino’s show during Milan Fashion Week on Thursday (Feb. 23, 2017), the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star stepped out clad in a garbage-inspired skirt suit and a cardboard box fascinator. She was joined by Gigi Hadid, Bella Hadid, Stella Maxwell and Elsa Hosk to model pieces from the label’s Fall 2017 collection.
Designed by Jeremy Scott, the line featured an assortment of trash like empty tampon boxes, used plastic bags, old bubble wrap, and paper hangers from the dry cleaner formed and sewn together into clothing and accessories.
Seriously. Someone even wore a garbage can lid as a hat.
