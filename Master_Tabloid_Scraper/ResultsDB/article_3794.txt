In photos obtained by E! News, guests — including Spelling’s 90210 costar Jennie Garth, mother Candy Spelling and brother Randy Spelling — were also treated to face painting, pony rides, piñatas and an elaborately decorated birthday cake.
Stella, whose actual birthday was June 9, celebrated her birth month with all things unicorn. The little girl received a one-of-a-kind unicorn milkshake creation and a large unicorn-themed doughnut cake.





 And the #unicorn milkshake creation @bigdsburgers created for Stella to celebrate her 9th bday ( remember the days when bdays lasted an entire weekend?) This was an edible work of ART!

Spelling and McDermott previously shared with PEOPLE that they have open conversations with their kids about money.
“My husband and I work really hard. I mean, I’m constantly out there working,” she told PEOPLE. “It’s so important for my children to see that both their parents are working, and we talk to them about it.”
Added Spelling, “My kids are like, ‘It’s not fair, why aren’t you home more?’ And I explain [things] to them and we talk about money.”
