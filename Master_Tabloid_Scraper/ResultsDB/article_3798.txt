Kristen Stewart and Stella Maxwell look as affectionate as ever.
The duo appeared cozy while enjoying the warm weather in New Orleans, affectionally wrapping their arms around each other as they explored the city with a group of friends.
Stewart, 27, continued her recent trend of wearing crop tops, opting this time for a white one paired with ripped black skinny jeans. Meanwhile, the 26-year-old Victoria’s Secret model opted for a lace top and black pants.
Although Stewart and Maxwell haven’t publicly addressed their relationship, the two have been spending a lot of time together in recent months. They were first seen together at the Met Gala last May, and were pictured leaving an afterparty in the same car.

A source confirmed their relationship to PEOPLE last December, adding that the pair “are having fun.”
“When Kristen filmed in Savannah, she spent several days together with Stella, who came to visit her,” a second source said. “She was with Kristen on the set most days and seemed to have fun.”
“Kristen also seemed very happy with Stella around,” the second insider said. “They weren’t affectionate, but definitely acted very friendly and like they had the best time hanging out. Stella seems very easy going. She is always very smiley and has a cute personality.”
