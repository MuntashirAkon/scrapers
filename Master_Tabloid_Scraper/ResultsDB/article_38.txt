Proving to be the greatest athlete of our time, Serena Williams nabbed her seventh Wimbledon title and 22nd Grand Slam win overall over the weekend, and she swept the Ladies’ Doubles finals with her sister Venus Williams.

Beating Angelique Kerber 75, 6-3 in the final match on Sunday, Serena is now tied with Steffi Graf for the most major championship wins in the Open era (which began in 1968), and stands just behind Margaret Court’s all-time marker of 24. Serena, who is ranked No. 1, won Wimbledon last year as well.

Serena told reporters, “One thing I learned about last year is to enjoy the moment. I’m definitely going to enjoy this.”
Hours after her big win, the Williams sisters were back on Centre Court where they dominated 6-3, 6-4 over Timea Babos and Yaroslava Shvedova, making their Grand Slam records final 14-0.
“I had just enough time to change and get the ankles re-taped,” Serena commented after the match. “It was fine. I didn’t want to warm down.”
She added, “It was really special to be out there again, to win Wimbledon in doubles. We love it, we love playing doubles, we love being together.”

On the men’s side, Andy Murray came out victorious, beating Milos Raonic 6-4, 7-6 (3), 7-6 (2). It’s his second Wimbledon win in the past four years, after he became the first British man to win Wimbledon (which is hosted in London) in 77 years back in 2013.
Murray noted, “I’m just really proud that I managed to do it again after a lot of tough losses in the latter stages of the Slams over the last couple of years. I’m also aware of how difficult these competitions are to win once. To do it twice here, an event where there’s a lot of pressure on me to perform well, I’m very proud with how I’ve handled that.”
“I feel more content this time,” he said. “I feel like this was sort of more for myself than anything, and my team as well…. Last time it was just pure relief, and I didn’t really enjoy the moment as much, whereas I’m going to make sure I enjoy this one more than the others.”

His opponent Raonic, meanwhile, became the first Canadian man to reach a Grand Slam final as well as the first non-European to get this far at Wimbledon since Andy Roddick in 2009.
Benedict Cumberbatch was super ecstatic for Murray, telling him after his win with a bow, “It was brilliant, it was really inspiring to watch.” Murray replied, “I’m a huge, huge fan,” and Cumberbatch told him he was a huge fan as well.
Both Prince William and Kate Middleton were the first to congratulate Murray post-match, followed by London’s Mayor, Sadiq Khan.
Both Williams and Murray attended the Wimbledon Champions dinner early in the evening, looking glam for the happy affair.
Later that night, Murray celebrated at Drama nightclub with his wife Kim. Some of the One Direction boys were there as well.
