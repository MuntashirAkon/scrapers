Annie's Adorable Little Psychopath on 90210/n
Over on 90210, Annie's lesbian-looking boyfriend Charlie tells her he's having a reading of his hot new play, but that he doesn't want her to come. Of course Annie shows up anyway to see just what sort of adorable, charming little play Charlie has written.

What a sweet boyfriend. He knows the way to a girl's heart is...through her crushed chest cavity and around the little pieces of shattered rib cage.Â
