As the Lord of the Rings actress cozied up to the designer outside on the red carpet, Stella stripped off the star's black coat to reveal her McCartney-designed dress.Liv yelled at her BFF for making her "get naked" before rushing inside the store to warm up."I've seen her get naked," McCartney joked to E! News after their photo op. "I'm done. I wanted you guys to get her."On a more serious note, Liv gushed to us, "Stella, Stella,  Stella—Superwoman. I admire her so much. I've been friends with her for  a really long time.

"Many years ago she invited me to go to the Met Ball with her," she continued. "It was her first Met Ball and my first Met Ball and [since then] I've had the chance to witness her grow and do all these amazing things. I love wearing her clothes, they make me feel sexy and strong."Naomi Watts also braved the cold NYC night to sneak a peek inside the new store."I'm freezing my ass off right now!" the Aussie actress said with a laugh."I have big love for her and her clothes," Watts dished to us. "She's the most innovative young designer who just keeps on expanding."Of course, Watts and Tyler aren't her only famous friends.
