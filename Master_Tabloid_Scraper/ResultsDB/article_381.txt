"Annie" Actors Orphaned/n
It really is a hard-knock life for the orphans in Annie.          The axe is falling on two more moppets in the Broadway musical, according to the New York Post. That means only two of the seven orphans who were originally cast in the revival remain.           The bloodletting began back in February, when producers booted 12-year-old Joanna Pacitti, their first choice for the lead. She had won a Macy's-sponsored talent contest that guaranteed her the role, but, according to reports, producers didn't like Pacitti's prima donna act off the set and felt her parents were too overbearing. She was replaced by understudy Brittny Kissinger three weeks before opening curtain. (Pacitti was last spotted in a regional production of the musical in North Carolina.)          The producers obviously have something against adorable tykes. Their most recent casualties: Christiana Anbri, 6, and Melissa O'Malley, 8, who were canned this week. They follow Mekenzie Rosen-Stone, 9, and Lyndsey Watkins, 10, who had previously decided not to renew their contracts, which expire July 26. All the actresses played Annie's orphan pals.          While Rosen-Stone and Watkins elected not to return (they probably didn't want to tempt fate), Anbri and O'Malley were let go for "artistic reasons," the show's publicist said.         But the Post, citing anonymous sources, said producers thought the girls and their families and managers were a bunch of "troublemakers."          According to those catty sources, O'Malley constantly flubbed her lines and Anbir's mom apparently got into a shoving match with show star Nell Carter.          And no one in the cast is immune to the producers' bloodsport. Earlier this year, Zappa, the pooch playing Sandy, was fired. Arf.
