Gwyneth Paltrow has no shortage of famous friends and luckily for her—and the shopping obsessed!—her powerful relationships can lead to some pretty cool collaborations for her lifestyle site Goop.Case in point: the blond beauty has teamed up with gal pal Stella McCartney to create the Stella McCartney x Goop capsule collection.Though Paltrow has no trouble landing on best dressed lists, she let BFF McCartney take the lead on designing the line's pieces.  "I think of myself as a woman who is a lover of beautiful things," Paltrow explained to Women's Wear Daily. "I'm very specific about my taste. The role I want in a partnership is curating a collection as opposed to taking a designer point of view."

But don't take that to mean that the mother of two doubts her fashion savvy!"I can tweak a blazer and make it the perfect blazer," she went on to say. "It's being able to fulfill what my ideal things ought to be."And fans of her style will get a chance to snap up Gwynnie's idea of the "perfect" jacket, as the upcoming collection, which is set to launch on Sept. 12, will include blazers, as well as black jeans and wool trousers, handbags, and a charcoal knit gray jumpsuit. 

And though Paltrow admits she and her Goop team are still "learning about what people want and at what price point," we're not sure many people could afford the new collection.The lowest priced item starts at $795.But that's not surprising when it comes to Paltrow, who once made $450,000 worth of suggestions for updating one's spring wardrobe.
