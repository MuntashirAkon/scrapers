Madonna Unveils All 6 Children at 59th Birthday Bash/nThis is the first pic we've ever seen of Madonna with her 6 kids. The photo was taken in celebration of the singer's 59th, gypsy-themed birthday party in Italy. Check out Rocco, 17, David, 11, Lourdes, 20, Mercy James, 11, and 4-year-old twins Estere and Stella. The proud mama made a grand entrance, riding a horse into the party but, appropriately -- not in a Lady Godiva way.  Kinda funny ... she forgets the words to the song,  "B-Day Song. " That's what happens when mama sings her own songs at her party.       When you can't remember the words to your own Song.....,..,,.,,,,,,🍷🍷🍷🍷🍷🇮🇹♥️🤡🎂🎉🎉🎉🌈🌈😂💕🦁💃🏻 Still a Happy Girl!
