TV's "Annie Oakley" Dead/n
Gail Davis, the first woman to star in a TV western with the '50s television series Annie Oakley, died Saturday of cancer in Los Angeles. She was 71.A protégé of "singing cowboy" Gene Autry, Davis starred in nearly 20 of Autry's movies and 30 of his television shows before taking the lead in Oakley, which Autry developed for her. Known for her character's pigtails and pistols, the petite 5'2", 95-pound actress really knew her way around a horse and a gun--she also performed in Autry's traveling rodeo shows. "So far as I'm concerned, I'm going to be Annie Oakley for the rest of my born days," Davis once said. In fact, in later years she became a manager of other celebrities.The popular series, which ran from 1955 through 1958 and then in syndication well into the '60s, featured Davis as a crack shot and nemesis of bad guys from her hometown of Diablo, where her character lived with kid brother, Tagg. Davis' character Annie cavorted with Deputy Lofty Craig, uncle Luke MacTavish and a girl's best friend, horse Target. The real-life Davis was born Betty Jeanne Grayson in Little Rock, Arkansas. She studied drama and dance at the University of Texas, where she met first husband, fellow student Bob Davis. They had one child, daughter Terrie, and divorced in 1952. She later married Carl Guerriero, who died in 1982. She is survived by Terrie, who lives in Texas.
