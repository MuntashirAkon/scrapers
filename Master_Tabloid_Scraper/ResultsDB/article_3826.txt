Hilary Duff -- I've Got Cameras On All My Tinder Dates/nHilary Duff is the next 'Bachelorette' ... of Tinder -- she's shooting footage of all her dates setup through the app ... and there's a chance it could turn into a reality show.  Hilary recently copped to right swiping a bunch of guys on Tinder -- 9 at last count -- and even went on a first date this week with one of them. Sources with direct knowledge tell TMZ ... cameras were rolling during the date at a bowling alley. We're told Hilary plans to shoot more footage as she dives into the dating world ... and hopes to use it to develop a reality show -- that would focus on her life as a new divorcée. Think 'Stella' getting her groove back ... but whiter. Hilary's rep had no comment about a potential reality show. Our sources say Hil had a 2nd date Wednesday night -- hitting up a pizza place in the valley, and once again recording the festivities. But after dinner she and the guy grabbed a drink at a bar ... sans camera. Girl needs room to work it. /n
