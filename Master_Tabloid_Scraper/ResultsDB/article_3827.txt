Miley Cyrus – Recycles With Stella At Disneyland (PHOTOS)/nMiley Cyrus and model Stella Maxwell are a sealed deal … because nothing says official like date night at Disneyland. The new couple hit up the park Tuesday and managed to keep their hands off each other as they jumped the lines for Tower of Terror and California Screamin’.  Miley didn't need a map since she was there 4 months ago with a different date ... ex-boyfriend Patrick Schwarzenegger. My how they change with the seasons. /n
