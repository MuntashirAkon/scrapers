As Radar previously reported, the talk show host, 59, and de Rossi, 44, had been fighting, with DeGeneres’ boozy behavior contributing to their problems.
According to a source, however, DeGeneres now has her drinking under control!
“Ellen has always been a drinker, but she does not drink on set or when she is working,” said the source. “That does not seem to be their problem right now.”
