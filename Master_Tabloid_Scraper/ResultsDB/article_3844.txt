Jerome Barson’s daughter Audrey Gassner-Dunayer was set to download the data from Williams’ car, but didn’t give Williams enough notice, the documents filed on July 5 read. Williams’ lawyer asked the court to stop her until Williams and her team could also be present for the data extraction.

Williams’ lawyer claimed that “issues have been known to arise when a vehicle’s data is downloaded” and did not want to risk data loss as it “will result in unfair prejudice against Williams.”
Both sides are due in court on July 7 in regards to the matter.
Radar previously reported that Williams was slapped with the wrongful death lawsuit after she hit Linda and Jerome Barson’s car on June 9. Jerome died 13 days after the crash.
