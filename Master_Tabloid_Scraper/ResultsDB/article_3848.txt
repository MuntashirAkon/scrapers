Making It Work! Inside Ellen’s Desperate Plan To Save Her Marriage To Portia/n
Ellen DeGeneres will do just about anything to save her marriage with wife, Portia De Rossi, RadarOnline.com has learned.
The 59-year-old talk show host and De Rossi, 44, were caught on camera getting into a nasty lovers spat outside of an L.A. restaurant last month. And a source close to DeGeneres told Radar exclusively, “The two of them are not in a good place in their relationship right now!”

Indeed, just this past weekend, DeGeneres was spotted out and about with a mystery brunette – and De Rossi was nowhere to be found!
Despite the tension, “Ellen is trying everything she can to keep Portia from running,” said the source.
“She has been buying her elaborate gifts and recently splurged on this huge vacation to the South Pacific for just the two of them, but Portia did not want to go!”
As Radar previously reported, part of the problem has been DeGeneres’ boozy behavior.

According to the source, however, DeGeneres now has her drinking under wraps!
“Ellen has always been a drinker, but she does not drink on set or when she is working,” said the source. “That does not seem to be their problem right now.”
