Jerry Seinfeld Defends Kathy Griffin: It Was Just 'A Bad Joke'/n
Comedian Jerry Seinfeld has finally spoken out on Kathy Griffin‘s controversial Donald Trump photo: It wasn’t a big deal!
As RadarOnline.com exclusively revealed, the scandal, which has “ruined” Griffin’s career at CNN, exploded on media sites thanks to Anderson Cooper’s hurtful Twitter comment, in which he called her actions “clearly disgusting and completely inappropriate.”
However, on Monday night, Seinfeld defended fellow comedian Griffin, saying that the photo she shared of herself — holding a fake, bloodied prop head made to look like the president — was nothing but a misstep.

“Yes, it was another bad joke. Every comedian tells bad jokes,” Seinfeld said. “We all do it. That’s how we find the good jokes. So someone told a bad joke — so what, I don’t understand the big deal.”
Seinfeld, who’s had his share of public disputes added, “If every comedian got fired for telling a bad joke, we’d all be out of business.”
Other comedians came forward last week to support Griffin. Funny-man Jim Carrey said, “I think it is the job of a comedian to cross the line at all times — because that line is not real.”

As Radar reported, Griffin has apologized extensively for the tasteless photo, which President Trump called “sick.” In a video on Twitter, she even told her followers: “I went way too far. The image is too disturbing. I understand how it offends people, it wasn’t funny.”
She then seemed to retract her regret, angrily admitting the Trump family bullied her and she vowed to “make fun of [Trump] more now” than ever.
