Kathy Griffin DROPPED From CNN's New Year's Eve Spot/n
Radar told you first! CNN has officially cut ties with Kathy Griffin following her controversial Donald Trump photo shoot.
“CNN has terminated our agreement with Kathy Griffin to appear on our New Year’s Eve program,” the network announced Wednesday afternoon.
As Radar exclusively reported, a network insider claimed Griffin’s exit is mostly thanks to Anderson Cooper, who publicly condemned the 56-year-old on Twitter, calling her actions “clearly disgusting and completely inappropriate.”

“CNN is officially saying they are evaluating Kathy’s place on CNN New Year’s Eve, but an insider says it’s OVER and just a matter of time before they announce they’ve dumped her,” a source told Radar exclusively earlier today. “At least if Anderson Cooper has anything to do with it.”
“Insiders are saying [Kathy is] very disappointed with Anderson for not defending her. He ran away. Anderson even publicly distanced himself from her. But Anderson doesn’t want to be seen in public with her ever again.”
As readers know, Griffin proudly tweeted a shocking photo that showed her holding a bleeding beheaded mannequin in the likeness of President Trump, backtracking and begging the world for forgiveness for the “disturbing” image just hours later.

“There are fears CNN would lose advertisers if they go ahead with Kathy on News Year’s Eve,” the source added.
Clearly, those fears were real! Griffin is no longer slated to appear on the special.
