‘I Beg For Your Forgiveness’: Kathy Griffin Backtracks On Beheaded Trump Pic/n
Just hours after Kathy Griffin proudly tweeted a shocking photo that showed her holding a bleeding beheaded mannequin in the likeness of President Donald Trump, she backtracked and begged the world for forgiveness for the “disturbing” image.
“I sincerely apologize,” Griffith said on a video posted to her Twitter account on Tuesday night.
“I am just now seeing the reaction of these images. I’m a comic. I crossed the line. I move the line and then I cross it,” she said.

Nevertheless, she admitted, “I went way too far.”
Even Chelsea Clinton admonished the comedienne for the Tyler Shields photograph, among other celebrities and politicians.
“The image is too disturbing. I understand how it offends people. It wasn’t funny,” Griffin admitted. “I get it. I’ve made a lot of mistakes in my career. I will continue. I ask your forgiveness. Taking down the image. Going to ask the photographer to take down the image.”
“And I beg for your forgiveness. I went too far. I made a mistake and I was wrong,” she said.
