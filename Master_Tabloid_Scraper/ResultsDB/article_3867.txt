Ariel Winter wants nothing to do with her mother.

Just days after Chrystal Workman criticized her daughter’s skimpy fashion sense, claiming she needed to “grow up” and learn how to “dress properly,” the Modern Family star hit back and the parent on blast. Responding to Chrystal in a shady subtweet, Ariel called her estranged mom “toxic” and accused her of using being fame-hungry.
“What’s sad is that you lie consistently,” she tweeted. “Also, why is it that you only choose to talk to me through the press? I’m doing just fine. 🚫Toxic.”

As reported, Chrystal told In Touch she felt uncomfortable with the 19-year-old’s revealing outfits, saying, “I feel sad that she feels the need to expose herself when it’s not necessary. Ariel is smart, beautiful and talented. She is a legitimate actress. She does not need to do this. She is beautiful with her clothes on.”

Ariel was emancipated from her mother in 2015 following a custody battle, in which she claimed she was abused and sexualized by Chrystal. Last year, she credited her sister, Shanelle Gray, for being the one who raised her.
“It’s most definitely hard to grow up in the industry, but just grow up in any instance without a mother from a very young age. And it has been very sad for me, but at the same time it’s been much better for me emotionally and physically to be on my own and have a better, safer household and support system,” she told host Ellen DeGeneres last year. “I don’t really talk about the reason that I don’t speak to my mother. It’s kind of been publicized, but the reason I don’t really share that is because I want to give her the same respect that she didn’t give to me publicly.”
