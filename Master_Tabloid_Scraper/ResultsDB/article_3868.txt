Leave it to Ellen DeGeneres to convince Nicki Minaj to address the dating rumors surrounding her and Nas.

Minaj stopped by to visit the Generous Queen on Tuesday’s episode of Ellen. During their time together, DeGeneres asked Minaj about the breast-baring outfit that she wore during Paris Fashion Week and asked her if she could elaborate on the nature of her relationship with Nas.
“There’s a rumor y’all are dating, and if it’s true, I’m all for it,” DeGeneres said. “I love him so much—ever since ‘One Mic.’ That’s where I first found him. He’s fantastic and a really good guy.”
“He’s so dope,” Minaj responded. “He’s the king. He is the King of Queens, and I’d like to think I’m the Queen of Queens…I have a lot of respect for him. And, you know, he’s kind of cute, too.”
DeGeneres took things one step further by asking Minaj if they’ve had sleepovers yet.
“We have. Yup,” Minaj said. “I go to him. I just thought him coming to me was too forward.”

The singer clarified that they haven’t done “the nasty” quite yet, especially since she only parted ways with her longtime significant other Meek Mill just last year.
“I’m just chillin’ right now. I’m celibate. I wanted to go a year without dating any man. I hate men,” Minaj said, which DeGeneres can relate to—albeit for a different reason. Once the laughter subsided, she said, “I might make an exception to the rule for him, because he’s so dope.”
