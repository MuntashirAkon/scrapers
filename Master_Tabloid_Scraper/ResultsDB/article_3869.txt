You can stop with the baby rumors now. Jessica Simpson has no plans to have a third child — so much so she’s gotten an IUD to prevent another pregnancy.

During her latest appearance on Ellen DeGeneres’ talk show, the singer-turned-designer opened up about expanding her family. Joking that she was pregnant the last two times she was on the show, Simpson, 36, assured fans she’s “not pregnant” and have no plans for another baby.
“We got an IUD, nothing is going to get into that uterus,” she said. “I have two beautiful children and I’m not having a third. They’re too cute! You can’t top that.”

Simpson, who shares 5-year-old daughter Maxwell and 3-year-old son Ace with husband Eric Jonson, added, “We love our kids.”
According to Simpson, her marriage couldn’t be stronger either. In fact, the former NFL tight end always has her back — literally!
“Even if things aren’t going great,” she quipped, “he somehow manages to massage my back.”
