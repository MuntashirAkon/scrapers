Annie Lennox -- Daughter in Kayaking Accident ... Boyfriend Missing/nAnnie Lennox's daughter is ok after a kayaking accident in upstate New York, but her long-term partner is still missing. The 22-year-old model turned artist Tali Lennox and her boyfriend, 32-year-old Ian Jones, apparently fell off their kayak Saturday morning.  Authorities say Tali was rescued by a boat that happened to be nearby, but there was no sign of Ian. Ian reportedly was not wearing a life preserver.  Capt. John Watterson from the Dutchess County Sheriff's Office reportedly said,  "We believe that alcohol may have played a role. " Tali was a very successful model, fronting products for Topshop and Prada, before becoming a portrait painter last year./n
