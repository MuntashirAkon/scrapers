It looks like Gavin Rossdale is off the market again.

A year after finalizing his divorce with Gwen Stefani, the Bush frontman is said to be dating German model Sophia Thomalla.
The couple first sparked relationship rumors in April when they were photographed sharing a kissing in London’s Primrose Hill. According to Us Weekly, Rossdale, 51, and Thomalla, 27, recently took their romance to Indianapolis’ Iozzo’s Garden of Italy, where they were seen sharing a “romantic meal” on May 11.

Thomalla is the first woman Rossdale has been linked to since his split with his wife of 13 years. As previously reported, the singer and Stefani, 47, broke things off in 2015 after it was discovered that Rossdale allegedly had an affair with his children’s former nanny, Mindy Mann.
“[Divorce] was completely opposite to what I wanted. Really not … but here we are,” he told The Sun’s Fabulous magazine in January. “Apart from death, I think divorce is one of the hardest, most painful things to go through.”
Rossdale and Stefani — who has been dating country crooner Blake Shelton for over a year — continue to be co-parents to sons Kingston, 10, Zuma, 8, and Apollo, 3.
