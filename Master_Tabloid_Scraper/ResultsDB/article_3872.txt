Amy Schumer and her furniture designer boyfriend Ben Hanisch broke up after dating for a year and a half.

“Amy and Ben have ended their relationship after thoughtful consideration and remain friends,” Schumer’s rep said in a statement to People.
Schumer and Hanisch were last photographed in public together in January, but Schumer attended the premiere of her new movie Snatched earlier this month without him. Just last week, Hanisch appeared in a silly picture on her Instagram account in which she is eating popcorn with her mouth open.
The actress met Hanisch on a dating app in November 2015 and they made their relationship official to the public in January 2016 after visiting the White House together. A memorable moment from love story was when Schumer and Hanisch were both hit with “violent food poisoning” while vacationing in France together.
“Who can make it through that?” she joked with Ellen DeGeneres. “Under a year, we’re together.”

“We’re in love,” she said. “And we’re still in total honeymoon phase. It’s a real relationship. Who knows what will happen, but we’re real good right now.”
Sending well wishes to Schumer, Hanisch, and his tables during this time.
