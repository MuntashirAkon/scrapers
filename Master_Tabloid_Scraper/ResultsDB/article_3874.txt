Bradley Cooper is a new dad, and he’s as shocked as you are about it.

Given that it was his first TV appearance since welcoming his first child with model Irina Shayk, Ellen DeGeneres just had to ask the actor about his baby when he popped by her daytime talk show this week.
“I know you’re not doing anything and this is the one interview you’re doing, so thank you for being here. It’s very, very nice of you. I don’t know if you know this, but you have a baby,” the comedienne quipped. “And so, I’m just going to let you know you have a baby.”
Acting surprised, Cooper simply responded, “WHAT?!”

“When you get home you should look for it. It’s somewhere in your house,” DeGeneres joked.
Aside from taking on parenting duties, Cooper has been hard at work filming A Star Is Born with Lady Gaga. The film, which will be a remake of the 1954 classic starring Judy Garland and 1976 film featuring Barbra Streisand, will be the American Sniper star’s directorial debut.
“She’s unbelievable,” Bradley said of Gaga. “She really is incredible.”
