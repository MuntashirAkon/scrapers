Chris Pratt Plays Speak Out on Ellen and Things Take a Turn for the Naughty/n
Say what?Funnyman and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 hottie Chris Pratt always did have a way with words. So Ellen DeGeneres put that to the test on her show Friday by having the actor play a game of Speak Out, in which he has to say things with a dental mouth opener in his mouth and she has to guess them."You know, bosses love free doughnuts," he said with the device.It took a few moments for DeGeneres to guess what he said."Yeah they do," he added.Things then took a turn for the naughty. Pratt and DeGeneres both later lost it laughing while reading a rather suggestive phrase.

Pratt is currently working on Jurassic World 2 and has to eat healthy."If I am left to my own devices...you know like if you accidentally dump a whole jar of goldfish food in with the fish, it'll die, it'll like eat all of it, it won't know when to stop? That's me. If I get trapped in a Sizzler for a weekend, I'd be a goner."
