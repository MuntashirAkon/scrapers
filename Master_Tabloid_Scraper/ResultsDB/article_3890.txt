Colin Farrell had a lot to celebrate on The Ellen DeGeneres Show Monday."Congratulations," Ellen DeGeneres told her guest, who is 10 years sober. "You look fantastic."Farrell, who will turn 41 May 31, said he loves "getting older," with one exception: "Getting hair in strange places and losing hair in not-so-strange places a bit. It's kind of an inversion that's unfavorable. I robbed that from Billy Crystal in City Slickers, by the way, for anyone who cares."The actor brought up body hair again while playing DeGeneres' "Celebrity Confession" game.

DeGeneres was near tears from laughing so hard.Farrell's hilarious confession resulted in Shutterfly donating $10,000 to his son's school, The CHIME Institute, which the Beguiled actor described as "an amazing, fully inclusive" institution.
