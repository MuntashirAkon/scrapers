Ellen DeGeneres' Oscar Selfie Has Officially Been Dethroned by This Tweet About Chicken Nuggets/n
Ellen DeGeneres has been dethroned. The comedian was once the queen of Twitter with the most retweeted message in the website's history—until now, that is. While she famously set the record in 2014 with a star-studded selfie at the Academy Awards, her 3.430 million retweets have been exceeded by 3.435 million for a Nevada teenager who made a request to Wendy's for a year of free chicken nuggets. Per the now viral deal, Carter Wilkerson asked the fast-food chain how many retweets it would take to get a year's supply of the signature menu item and Wendy's responded with "18 Million." "Consider it done," Carter responded with confidence. 

While the tweet has not yet reached 18 million retweets, it has officially surpassed Ellen's selfie—and that was good enough for Wendy's. "@carterjwm is now the most retweeted tweet of all-time. That's good for the nuggets, and $100k to @DTFA. Consider it done. #nuggsforcarter," the chain tweeted, noting a donation to the Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption. "He gets them nuggs."Guinness World Records confirmed Wilkerson holds the new record for most retweets as of Tuesday morning. 

DeGeneres even invited Wilkerson on the show to meet him face to face. When she asked him why he was trying to sabotage her hard-earned record, Carter's reasoning was simple: "I just want chicken nuggets."While she tried to bribe him with a year supply of Ellen underwear and a new TV, it sounds like DeGeneres might show up at his house now to take it all back. Not to fret, Carter—you're getting chicken nuggets!
