Ellen Page Receives Death Threats Over Instagram /nEllen Page has been getting death threats on her Instagram and now the LAPD is on the hunt for the culprit. The perp sent several messages, including one calling her a  "lying worthless Canadian " and a  "bitch actress " who  "needs to die in my hands. " It didn't stop there. Another message read,  "I find Ellen and kidnap her and kill her throat and let everyone see it on my Instagram. " Detectives got a search warrant last month so they could trace the IP address of the IG name, but we're told so far no arrests./n
