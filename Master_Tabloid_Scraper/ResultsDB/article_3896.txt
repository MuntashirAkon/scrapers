Kim Kardashian Celebrates Expected $14 Mil Payday/nKim Kardashian opened her home for her KKW Cosmetics launch party, but she shoulda just called the event ...  "I'M RICH(er) BEEATCH!! "  Kim's brand new makeup line goes on sale Wednesday ... so she threw a bash in her Bel-Air mansion, complete with Kanye, North, Kris Jenner and a ceiling lined with white flowers.  Pretty extraordinary for Kim to throw a party at home, especially after the Paris robbery -- but then again ... it's not every day you make the kinda dough she's about to make. Industry experts predict -- probably based on Kylie Jenner's lip kit success -- KKW's opening sales will put about $14 million in Kim's pockets ... in a matter of 5 minutes! Sorry, Wonder Woman ... shoulda got in the makeup game./n
