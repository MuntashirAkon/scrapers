Shaq Shoots His Shot With Ellen Barkin, Proposes Marriage/nShaq shot over 19,000 shots during his NBA career, but none so smooth as this ... 'cause the big fella just totally got his Steph Curry on with  "Animal Kingdom " star Ellen Barkin, and it's pretty awesome. O'Neal was out in NYC when he began to gush and swoon over Barkin to our camera guy -- completely unprompted we might add -- while talking about how much he loves her show,  "Animal Kingdom. " We actually tried to get Shaq back on track and ask him TV questions, but the dude was too lovestruck to talk about anything but the 63-year-old Barkin. Here's the thing ... Shaq seems serious, and actually said he's ready to marry Ellen (okay, so that's a joke) and has loved her since he first saw her in  "Ocean's Eleven. " Bad form, Shaq ... she was actually in  "Ocean's Thirteen " (not even married yet and you're already forgetting your anniversary). /n
