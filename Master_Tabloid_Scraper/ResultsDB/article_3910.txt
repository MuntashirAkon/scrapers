'Saved by the Bell' Star -- Ellen Page Should Play Me ... In New Lifetime Movie/n "Tori Scott " from  "Saved by the Bell " says only one actress is worthy of slipping on her leather jacket and roaming Bayside High for a new Lifetime movie -- and she's an Oscar nominee.  Leanna Creel tells TMZ she'd love to see Ellen Page play her in  "The Unauthorized Saved by the Bell Story " ... but says she realizes it's unlikely since it's not a feature film. A girl can dream, can't she?Â As far as making a possible cameo -- Leanna says no one's called, but even if they did ... it would just be too weird to go back. Still, she says she'll definitely be watching September 1st./n
