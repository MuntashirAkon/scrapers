'Annie' Star Quvenzhane Wallis -- I'm 10 ... And I'm Bigger than Cameron Diaz!/nQuvenzhane Wallis -- the 10-year-old who was nominated for Best Actress this year for  "Beasts of the Southern Wild " -- is going to make a fortune for her next movie ... and that's just for starters.Q is set to star in the movie remake of  "Annie. "  The producers had to get approval from a judge because she's a minor, and we got the legal docs, showing what this little girl will deposit in her bank account.-- $750,000 base salary-- $750,000 bonus if the movie does super good-- 5% of profits-- 5% of all merchandising-- 10% of sound track album royaltiesNow get this ... Q's co-stars are Jamie Foxx and Cameron Diaz.  According to her contract, her name cannot be lower than second position.  Realistically, that means Q will appear above Cameron.Q gets unlimited Wi-Fi in her trailer.  She gets veto power on any bloopers before they're released.When Q promotes the flick ... they have to give her 3 dresses from which to choose and she gets to keep the one she wears.  But one caveat -- she can't sell or lend the garment to anyone.And the best one ... Her image can be used to promote the film but NOT the sale of alcohol, tobacco, firearms, feminine hygiene products and pharmaceuticals.  It also prohibits producers using Q's image for gambling, EXCEPT her punim CAN appear on Pachinko machines (everybody's favorite Japanese arcade game).Not bad for an orphan./n
