Billy Bush Admits Trump Tape 'Brought My Daughters To Tears' On 'GMA'/n
Billy Bush may have publicly apologized for his infamous 2005 Trump tape that leaked last year, but his biggest apology was made to his wife and three daughters, RadarOnline.com has learned.
In a preview clip from an interview on Good Morning America with Robin Roberts, the 45-year-old revealed what happened when he went home to face his wife, Sydney Davis, and daughters Josie, Mary and Lillie, after the scandal broke.
“The initial moments were total chaos,” Bush told Roberts. “The paparazzi were never interested in me before, and now they’re outside the gate and ready to go. But once we settled and got to connect, there was a powerful moment — my now 16-year-old daughter [Mary] called me and she was in tears. She was really upset.”
