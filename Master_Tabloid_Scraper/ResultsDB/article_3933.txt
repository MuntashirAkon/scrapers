Inside Nancy Kerrigan’s Miscarriage Misery/n
America’s Olympic sweetheart Nancy Kerrigan tearfully admits
she has suffered half a dozen miscarriages!
While Nancy is now the doting mother of three children —
Matthew, 19; Brian, 12; and eight-year-old Nicole
– she endured six unsuccessful pregnancies in an eight-year span.
“It was really hard,” says the beloved figure skater, who’s back in the spotlight on Dancing with the Stars.
“It almost felt shameful, I think,  because I couldn’t do it on my own.” /n
