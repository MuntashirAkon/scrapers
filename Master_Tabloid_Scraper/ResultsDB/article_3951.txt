The actress is expecting her first child, according to E! News. An insider tells the publication the baby news is “an unexpected surprise” and will not affect the production of her upcoming projects.

The 38-year-old previously dated Benjamin Nugent from 2008 to 2012 and her Office co-star B.J. Novak from 2005 to 2007.
