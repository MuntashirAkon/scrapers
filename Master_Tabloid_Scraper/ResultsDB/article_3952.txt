Congratulations are in order for Jordan Peele and Chelsea Peretti!

The happy couple welcomed their first child — a baby boy named Beaumont Gino Peele — on July 1, according to E! News.
The two comedians announced the pregnancy news in early February when the Chelsea, 39, shared a photo of her baby bump on Instagram. “Beyoncé schmonce,” the Brooklyn Nine-Nine star quipped, referring to Beyoncé’s pregnancy announcement that happened around the same time.

Jordan, 38, eloped with Chelsea in 2016 after more than three years of dating. They announced their engagement in November 2015 after Peele had popped the question over Thanksgiving weekend.
