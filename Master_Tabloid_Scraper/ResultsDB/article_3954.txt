Jay-Z is getting personal on his new album, 4:44.

In the title track, which is available exclusively on Tidal in conjunction with IHeartMedia, the rapper opens up about his 15-year relationship with Beyoncé and their struggles to have kids. Apologizing to his wife, Jay-Z goes into detail about pregnancy problems while referencing his newborn twins.
“I apologize often womanize / Took for my child to be born / See through a woman’s eyes / Took for these natural twins to believe in miracles / Took me too long for this song / I don’t deserve you,” Jay raps.
He continued, confirming suspicions he had previously cheated on his wife, “And if my children knew, I don’t even know what I would do / If they ain’t look at me the same / I would probably die with all the shame / ‘You did what with who?’ / What good is a ménage à trois when you have a soulmate? / ‘You risked that for Blue?’”


Later in the song, Jay-Z alludes to the couple losing more than one baby prior to welcoming the twins. Though Beyoncé previously mentioned a miscarriage before Blue Ivy’s birth in the 2013 documentary Life Is But a Dream, this is first reference to the loss of children.
“So I apologize / I’ve seen the innocence / Leave your eyes / I still mourn this death / I apologize for all the stillborns / ‘Cus I wasn’t pressing / Your body wouldn’t accept it,” he says.
As reported, Jay-Z and Beyoncé welcomed twins on June 12 in Los Angeles. While the couple have yet to confirm the name and sexes of the babies, rumors say the twins are a boy and a girl.
