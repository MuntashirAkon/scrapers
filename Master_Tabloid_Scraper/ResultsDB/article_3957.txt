Ryan, 32, and Kayla, 25, first met at West Hollywood’s Bootsy Bellows nightclub in 2016. They got engaged after less than a year of dating, before announcing the pregnancy.
“My family says, ‘Don’t you think it’s a little too soon?’ I’m like, ‘Can you put a time on love? Can you?’” Ryan told USA Today last year. “When I realized this was ‘the one’ was when she stuck behind me through this. She still loves me and she’s still right there with me.”
