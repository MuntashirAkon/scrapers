Otis and Hehner married in 2014 after meeting for the first time on Married at First Sight. Otis, 31, revealed her pregnancy to PEOPLE in January, six months after they lost their first child, a son, while she was four months pregnant in 2016.
Earlier this month, the couple revealed the name of their baby girl through a Facebook Live session. In the video, Hehner etched the name of his daughter onto the wall of the baby’s room.

Throughout the pregnancy, Otis also shared adorable photos on Instagram of the couple and her growing baby bump.
