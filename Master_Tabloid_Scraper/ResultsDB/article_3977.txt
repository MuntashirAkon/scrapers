As we learned yesterday, Nancy Kerrigan's father, Daniel, died. And to make matters worse, her 45-year-old brother, Mark, was arrested, booked and charged with assault and battery on an elder person resulting in serious bodily injury.And now Nancy is getting some sympathy from a surprising source: Tonya Harding.Despite all the agony Harding's cohorts caused her fellow Olympic figure skater back in 1994, Tonya wants Nancy to know she feels her pain.

"Tonya feels very sad for Nancy and her family and extends her deepest sympathy and condolences to them," her rep said in a statement to The Insider. "Tonya's beloved dad, Al Harding, passed away this past April, so she understands the grief Nancy and her family are feeling at this difficult time."A few of Nancy's more, ahem, beloved colleagues have also shared their sympathies."I am so sad for Nancy," Olympic and Dancing With the Stars champion Kristi Yamaguchi told People. "Nancy is part of our family and the loss of a parent is devastating. I always smile when I think of Dan because he was a lot of fun and he had such pride for his daughter and her accomplishments. That meant a lot to Nancy. He and [her mom] Brenda were always there for her."Nancy's longtime training partner and Olympic silver medalist Paul Wylie told the magazine that he spoke with her over the phone yesterday."She was really struggling, but she called to thank me for calling," he said.Kristi added that she texted her former teammate and received an appreciative response."Thank you," she wrote. "I appreciate all the support I've been getting."Something tells us Nancy's former rival's comments may not be quite as welcomed.
