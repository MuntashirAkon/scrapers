Nancy Grace Disgusted by Photos of Casey Anthony Holding a Baby/nNancy Grace is repulsed by the pics of Casey Anthony holding a baby ... and pretty much just the sight of her in general. Nancy tells us she was having a pretty good morning ... then she saw the photos of  "Tot Mom " with a 6-month-old kid. Â  As we reported, Casey is holding the grandson of an NBC producer, who has been trying to snag an interview with her for a long time. Nancy's especially upset there's alcohol at the table./n
