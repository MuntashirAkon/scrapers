NBC's Nancy Snyderman Quits After Ebola Scandal/nNancy Snyderman has resigned as Chief Medical Editor at NBC News, but the handwriting was clearly on the wall. Snyderman has been scarcely seen on the broadcast over the last few weeks. Fact is ... her profile has been much lower since her return after the Ebola scandal, where she violated a voluntary quarantine by going to a restaurant near her New Jersey home. There was also an incident a few weeks back, where she appeared live on the air slurring her words and seeming kind of out of it. Snyderman says she's returning to her roots by taking a faculty position at a major U.S. medical school./n
