While the flirty exchange “was all very tongue in cheek,” explained the insider, “they’ve since become firm friends and are planning to go out on a big girls’ night out soon.”
“It’s the most oddball friendship,” said the insider of Kanye West’s ex-girlfriend and his wife Kim Kardashian’s former 67-year-old stepfather, “but Caitlyn’s pretty lonely these days.”
