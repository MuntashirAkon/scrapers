Long before she was traveling the world promoting the record-breaking blockbuster The Hunger Games, Elizabeth Banks was a fresh faced high school girl who went by the name Elizabeth Mitchell.
The actress attended the Pittsfield High School in Western Massachusetts and RadarOnline.com has photos of her drastically different, pre-Hollywood look.

Banks, 38, who plays Effie Trinket in The Hunger Games, graduated in 1992 and won the award for Class Couple. With her brunette hair in a short curly bob, her All-American good looks were evident back then.
She was in the Latin Club and even won the Berkshire Young Woman of the Year Award in 1992.
