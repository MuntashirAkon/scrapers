Boy Scouts Officially Open Membership To Transgender Boys/n

Now THIS is equality!
On Monday, the Boy Scouts Of America announced it will immediately begin accepting members based on the gender indicated in their application, as opposed to the one on their birth certificate.

This means transgender boys are officially allowed to join.
According to spokeswoman Effie Delimarkos: 

"Starting today, we will accept and register youth in the Cub and Boy Scout programs based on the gender identity indicated on the application. Our organization's local councils will help find units that can provide for the best interest of the child."
Zach Wahls — co-founder of Scouts for Equality — believes this decision is "important" for the organization's legacy.

"This is another historic day for the Boy Scouts of America. The decision to allow transgender boys to participate in the Cub Scouts and the Boy Scouts is an important step forward for this American institution."
As we reported in December, an 8-year-old boy was kicked out of the Cub Scouts for being transgender.
We're just glad the BSA is FINALLY doing the right thing!
