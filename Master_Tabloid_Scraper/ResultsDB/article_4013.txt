Elizabeth Banks Is Playing Villain Rita Repulsa In The New Power Rangers Movie! Be Afraid, Zordon!/n

It's Morphin' Time for Elizabeth Banks! (Well, sort of…)
The Pitch Perfect 2 director is set to star as the villain in the upcoming Power Rangers movie!
According to The Hollywood Reporter, the actress has signed on to play the iconic character Rita Repulsa — the alien witch who is bent on world domination!
The 41-year-old will be trying to put a stop to a group of teenagers who are infused with powers — played by RJ Cyler, Becky G, Ludy Lin, Naomi Scott, and Dacre Montgomery!

Rita was the OG villain of the hit 1990's TV series, and we think Banks is an inspired choice to play the campy yet scary character!
Plus, the actress is already used to wearing crazy costumes playing Effie Trinket in the Hunger Games, so pulling off Rita's bewitching wardrobe should be a breeze!
With the addition of Banks, and the fact that the X-Men: First Class writers are penning the script, we're definitely showing our excitement for the Power Rangers movie — and Rita is, too… 

Will YOU be seeing Power Rangers in theaters on March 24, 2017?
