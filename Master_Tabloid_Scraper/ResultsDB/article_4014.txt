Why do all of these songs have to sound so final?!
One Direction may have a highly anticipated album release this Friday… but judging by their constant stream of new music, you'd never be able to tell.
In addition to last week's History and Monday's End of the Day, 1D just dropped yet another song on Tuesday in anticipation of Made in the A.M.!

The boys' latest track, Love You Goodbye, is just as emotional as its predecessors — and we're starting to get scared this hiatus may be permanent after all…
Still, we're not going to turn down new music, so we'll just be over here listening to Louis Tomlinson, Niall Horan, Liam Payne, and Harry Styles on repeat.
Ch-ch-check out what could be One Direction's last sneak peek ahead of Made in the A.M.'s release on Friday (above)!!!
