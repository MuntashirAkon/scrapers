She let her Twitter followers know on Thursday that she would be headed to London and that she’d known since this summer but had kept it a secret.
The Daily Mail reports that Dreamgirls producer, Sonia Friedman, had planned on starting  production last year but was unable to do so because finding someone to fill the role of Effie had proved a challenge.
Hundreds of young women auditioned for the part but it wasn’t until Riley auditioned that Friedman knew she was the one.

Friedman tells the Daily Mail:

I was crying, because I was overwhelmed by the emotion and passion she put into the number. And also crying with utter excitement and pure joy, relief and happiness that this girl was going to be able to give this performance in the UK. Her voice is a gift from God!
