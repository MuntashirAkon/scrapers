Matt Damon admits he wasn’t a fan of Bennifer. 
While promoting his new movie, The Martian with The Hollywood Reporter, the actor defended his BFF Ben Affleck, saying it was “painful” to be his friend during his highly publicised relationship with Jennifer Lopez.
There’s nobody who’s more misunderstood. Ten years ago, the public image of him could not have been farther apart from who he actually is. It was like he was being cast in a role, that he was a talentless kind of meathead, with his whole relationship with Jennifer Lopez.

Considering Damon has come under fire multiple times in the last few weeks, he really wanted to let everyone know that his friend isn’t who people make him out to be. Affleck’s relationship with Lopez (and their awful movie Gigli) gave the Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice star a bad reputation for a while.
He just got cast as this person that he wasn’t. It was just really painful. It was painful to be his friend, because it wasn’t fair, you know? To my mind, nobody really got him at all.
What a good friend! We all need a friend like Matt Damon in our life.
