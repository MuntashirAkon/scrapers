Effie Trinket/n
ELIZABETH BANKS WAS way ahead of the curve in recognizing the genius of The Hunger Games. “I was one of the first people I knew to read the books,” Banks, 38, told PEOPLE’s Aili Nahas. “I would tell people, ‘Set aside the next three days of your life. You won’t be able to do anything else but read.'”
What drew you to playing Effie? The cool thing about the character for me was that she has all of the trimmings of a woman of privilege, but she knows her life could be taken away from her at any moment. I love the complexity of that.
How did you get into character? My mantra for Effie was “Be theatrical without being clownish!” Katharine Hepburn was an inspiration for the voice-the cadence, the wit, the preponderance of etiquette. And we had an a-ha! moment in the hair and makeup trailer. We used to say that Effie had not arrived for the day until her wig went on.
What was the hardest part about the role? For sure it was the shoes (laughs). Like any haute couture outfit, all of my shoes were completely amazing but highly uncomfortable.
