Call it Tara Reid's tribute to The Hunger Games.The American Pie star couldn't resist posting a twitpic of her going the full Effie—Effie Trinket that is.The 37-year-old Reid sports the same outlandish makeup, peach-colored wig, large flower and billowy dress that Elizabeth Banks donned as the Capitol-born chaperone who picks Jennifer Lawrence's Katniss Everdeen at the District 12 reaping in last year's YA sci-fi blockbuster.

The actress showed off the new look, which she revealed she was wearing for her latest production, which we can only assume is a comedy given who's producing it."Today at work shooting my new untitled film produced by Jamie Kennedy its gonna be super cool!," Reid tweeted on Tuesday.She later added: "Anyway good night everyone I have an [early] call time so I'm going to bed! The next day on my way to italy for cipriani's [wedding] then London."
