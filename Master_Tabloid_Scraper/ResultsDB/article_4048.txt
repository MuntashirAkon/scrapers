Matt Damon -- Who Needs Racial Diversity Behind the Camera? (VIDEO)/nMatt Damon says diversity is a good thing to see on the big screen, but it's not really necessary in movie board rooms ... and that has some black filmmakers really pissed off. On Sunday's episode of  "Project Greenlight " -- the show where he and Ben Affleck help guide would-be movie makers into making flicks -- Matt and black filmmaker Effie Brown were discussing a script in which a black prostitute was featured.  Effie said it was important to have diversity among the filmmakers so the character could be accurately and sensitively portrayed. Matt scoffed, saying diversity should only go so far. He's getting hammered on Twitter, with some saying his white privilege was showing. /n
