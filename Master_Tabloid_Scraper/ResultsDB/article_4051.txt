Matt Damon -- I'm All About Hollywood Diversity ... My Show Took Me Out of Context/nMatt Damon is apologizing for his comments about diversity in Hollywood, and he's blaming  "Project Greenlight " -- the show HE produces -- for editing down his comments and making him seem insensitive. Damon says,  "I believe deeply that there need to be more diverse filmmakers making movies. I want every young person watching “Project Greenlight” to believe that filmmaking is a viable form of creative expression for them too. "  He also says the comment he made to Effie Brown -- that films need diverse actors, and not necessarily directors and producers -- were taken out of context.  "My comments were part of a much broader conversation about diversity in Hollywood and the fundamental nature of “Project Greenlight” which did not make the show. I am sorry that they offended some people, but, at the very least, I am happy that they started a conversation about diversity in Hollywood. " It's just a little odd, since Matt is an executive producer of 'Greenlight.' You'd think he'd have a say in how he gets edited./n
