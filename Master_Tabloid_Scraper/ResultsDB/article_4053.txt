Then, when a fan asked why she wouldn’t tag Moore, she responded: “I don’t need to! She stalks me and my mom.”
“Anger is an acid that can do more harm to the vessel in which it is stored than to anything on which it is poured,” the 20-year-old continued.

Finally, Zolciak, 39, got involved, saying on Instagram: “Hmm this s–t is funny!! 6 seasons in on Don’t Be Tardy, multi million dollar skincare line in less then 6 months @kashmerekollections meanwhile you sell your hair care products out of the trunk of your car and paying Sally’s beauty supply to do an appearances there AND you are spending what you do have on your 3rd paid boyfriend. Sweetie don’t try and come for me so you can have a story line for next season.”
Radar reported that Zolciak is set to return as a “friend” to the Housewives this season. She was an original RHOA star, but left for her own spinoff in 2011.
