Kim Kardashian & Kanye West Visit The Palace Of Versailles To Begin Wedding Planning!? See The Picture Evidence HERE!/n

Could this Parisian trip be serving an actual purpose besides sightseeing???
Sources have revealed Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's summer wedding ceremony is going to be extremely lavish…
But we had no idea they were actually considering a PALACE for their location to tie the knot!
The couple was spotted on Saturday and Sunday walking around Paris and having lunch at L'Avenue Restaurant—before heading to the iconic Palace of Versailles for some rumored wedding planning after dark!
Kim documented her trip (and possible nuptial-review sesh) on Instagram, where she posted a nighttime pic (above) of Versailles lit up to perfection!
Now, we know it was reported they were looking at this location back in December, only for the rumors to be shot down a few days later by Kim's rep—but pictures totes don't lie!
If the duo actually has a wedding in Versailles, it's going to be the most royal and glam event ever!
