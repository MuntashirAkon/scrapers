Emma Stone To Make Her Sultry Broadway Debut?!/n

This husky-voiced funny girl is about to get reeaalllll serious — about Broadway, that is!!! 
Emma Stone is reportedly in talks to star in the much-anticipated revival of Cabaret! 
Um, yes please!!!! 
If Emma is in fact cast, she would take on the iconic role of Sally Bowles — the American underground club singer with a drama-filled life that stirs the plot. 
The actress would be filling the glamorous shoes of former Sallies including Judi Dench, Natasha Richardson, and — YES —  LIZA MINELLI!!!!! 
Sounds like a far cry from Gwen Stacy, but we know our uber-talented gurl crush can do it.
Better start resting up those vocals sweetie-pie because they would be crazy to NOT hire you!!! /n
