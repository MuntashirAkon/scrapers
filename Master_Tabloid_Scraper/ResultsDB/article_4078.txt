Adam Lambert Suffers Backlash Over ‘Teen Mom’ Comments/n
Adam Lambert has given birth to yet another controversy—this time over the MTV reality series Teen Mom.
The “Whataya Want From Me” belter has suffered an online backlash in recent days, after calling the series—whose star, Amber Portwood, was recently charged with domestic battery and neglect of a dependent—”depressing.”
The brouhaha began late last week, when Lambert took to his Twitter account and lamented,
“This Teen Mom show on MTV is so depressing. I know it’s “real life” but shouldn’t there be programming that inspires kids to shoot higher? #glorifyingwhitetrash”
This apparently didn’t sit well with many of Lambert’s online fans—and apparent Teen Mom viewers—as the singer was quickly forced to clarify,
“I’m not saying that all teen moms are white trash. Don’t misunderstand. Yet, most of the ones on that show seem to be. I do, however, think they’re are being exploited a bit.”
Alas, Lambert’s mea culpa failed to satisfy the detractors, many of whom rushed for the “unfollow” button in response to his remarks. As Lambert noted,
“Woah I lost some followers yesterday cuz I had a valid opinion about a tv show. Hahah. #sensitivesallies.”
Do you agree with Lambert’s views on Teen Mom, or do you think he was being too harsh? Let us know in the comments section.
