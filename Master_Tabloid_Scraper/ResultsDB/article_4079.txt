Raquel Welch Sallies Fourth/n
Raquel Welch, 58, has married once again, exchanging vows with restaurant owner Richard Palmer, 44. It is her fourth marriage, his second. They were wed Saturday at her Beverly Hills home. The couple had dated for about two years and became engaged last September. “It was a small, private ceremony with only close family and friends,” said the star’s publicist. There was no word on a honeymoon. Welch is due in Vancouver, British Columbia, for several weeks in order to work on a movie called “Bats.”
