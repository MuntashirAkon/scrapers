Hello, Gladiators. Class is in session. Your subject? How to Be a Boss 101, taught by Professor Olivia Pope, Esq. every Thursday on Scandal. Today's lesson: How to Be a Boss, TV News Edition as exemplified in E! News' exclusive sneak peek of tomorrow's episode.Olivia (Kerry Washington) is negotiating terms of a televised debate between her candidate, Mellie (Bellamy Young) and her newly announced competitor for the Republican nomination, Hollis Doyle (Gregg Henry)â€”on Sally Langston's show.Honestly, Olivia's not asking for much: Just a light and a buzzer to help each candidate time their response. Otherwise, it's clear Sally will let Hollis have an edge, biasing the whole thing before it starts. Unfortunately, Sally's producer is not having it. Time for a good old fashioned Olivia Pope smackdown!
