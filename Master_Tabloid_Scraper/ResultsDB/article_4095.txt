Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson recently got emotional making , a special new friend.While on location in Savannah, GA, filming Baywatch the movie, the 43-year-old actor and wrestling star met a fan named Sarah and two of her children, including her baby daughter who had undergone open heart surgery last fall."Shooting on location always draws a crowd and I got word that a mom asked if I would meet her daughter who's celebrating a very special birthday," Johnson wrote on Instagram Thursday, alongside a group photo. "Well, I love me some birthdays, so where is mama and her babies. Was so happy to have met lil' Sally Walker Collins, who just turned 1. When she was 5 months old she had open heart surgery and has been an inspiring lil' fighter since that day." 

Johnson said the child's mother was grateful they had a chance to meet and got teary eyed when talking about her, telling them, "If Sally can fight thru this, then we can do anything.""Amen. Yes you can," the actor said. "Real pleasure meeting this great family and if by remote chance I got teary eyed too when she was talking about her daughter's struggle—it's a good thing I had my shades on so no one would see. But of course I never cry 'cause I'm too tough for that stuff. I'm just sayin' if I did, I was prepared. Stay strong lil' Sally—you're a heart warrior and you have many many more birthdays to enjoy. And remember Uncle DJ is the coolest."Johnson began filming Baywatch in February. In March, he surprised child patients at a hospital in Savannah."To all the kids I met—you guys keep smiling and staying strong," he said. "All the mamas and daddy's I met, y'all stay strong too. Gotta tell ya little stuff like this will always be the best part of fame."
