Oprah Going, Sally Gone/n
Mark your calendar with a big X--or maybe a big O: Oprah Winfrey has announced she's ending her talk show. But, not just yet.        Winfrey, who has agonized over whether to reup her contract in past years, has decided she will call it quits at the end of 2005-06 season. Why then? It will mark the 20th anniversary of The Oprah Winfrey Show's debut in national syndication.        While Oprah gets to pick the time for her departure from daytime, rival yakker Sally Jessy Raphael wasn't so lucky.  Producers announced Monday that The Sally Jessy Raphael Show, which debuted in 1983, will be history after the end of this season--just short of its 20-year mark--a victim of "low ratings, a tough ad market and clearance issues," according to a statement from Studios USA.        Winfrey's long-term exit strategy was revealed Monday by the Hollywood Reporter. The Chicago-based talk show queen had publicly mulled retirement three years ago before signing her current contract, which expires at the end of the 2003-04 season. Now, she has reportedly agreed to extend her run for two seasons beyond that.        Of course, 2006 is a long way off, so don't buy that going-away card just yet.        There was no immediate comment from King World Productions, the CBS-owned distributor of the show, or Winfrey's Harpo Productions, on the purported new deal, or Oprah's planned exit.        If Winfrey doesn't change her mind, her decision to quit could open up a potential gold mine for any syndicator who can come up with an ideal afternoon talk show. That's no easy task--as many have discovered. As Steve Rosenberg, president of Studios USA Domestic Television, noted in saying farewell to Raphael, "It is a testament to Sally's talent and strength that, during her tenure on the air, more than 60 other syndicated talk shows have come and gone. Sally's show will go down in the record books as an    enormous success story and she will always have our sincere thanks and gratitude."                  The famously bespectacled Raphael has been working on the tube for the past four decades. Ranked only ninth among the plethora of syndicated talk shows during the recent February sweeps (Winfrey was tops), the show--currently airing on 190 stations as well as overseas in such venues as the United Kingdom and Sweden--was averaging a minuscule 1.7 household rating. It had been renewed next season in only 70 percent of the U.S, a sharp drop from its current 98 percent exposure. So the plug was pulled        "I've been proud of many of the shows we've produced over the past two decades," says Raphael. "It was my personal statement about the issues facing society and the moral choices that people make. It has been important to me to tackle topics that are meaningful and in good taste."         With Raphael's cancellation and Winfrey eyeing the endgame, the landscape of daytime TV continues to morph drastically. Newcomers like Caroline Rhea, who'll take over for Rosie O'Donnell next season, and Oprah cohort Dr. Phil McGraw, who gets his own syndicated strip in the fall, will be among the latest to step into the fray and seek an audience amid the soap operas, cartoons and female-friendly reality shows already cramming the airwaves.
