She is apologizing to Nettie for ruining a night out, where she stripped off her pants and her shirt in a limousine, but she refuses to stop boozing.
“Don’t you think that’s way out of control?” Nettie asks her, and all Mellie has to say is “NO.”
She then admits to the camera that she has a reason for drinking until she blacks out, and it has to do with her boyfriend Robbie.
