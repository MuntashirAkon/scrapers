Hayden Panettiere Speaks Out On Her Brave Battle With Postpartum Depression — 'I'm All The Stronger For It'/n

It's great to see Hayden Panettiere doing so well!
On Thursday, Hayden took to Good Morning America to discuss where she stands in her battle with postpartum depression.
As you may recall, the 27-year-old actress first announced her condition in October of 2015, almost a year after giving birth to her daughter Kaya.

According to Panettiere, she found strength and comfort in the character she plays on her hit show Nashville — especially since the fictional Juliette Barnes also happens to struggle with postpartum — so it's truly a case of art imitating life.
Hayden explained to the GMA hosts: 
"It absolutely helped me. I think it helped me identify what was going on. And to let women know that it's okay to ask for help and have a moment of weakness and it doesn't make you a bad person or a bad mother. That's a great message… It takes a while and you feel off, you don't feel like yourself. But, you know, women are so resilient and that's the incredible thing about them. And, I think I'm all the stronger for it. I think I'm a better mom for it because you never take that connection for granted."
Hayden's daughter is one lucky girl to have such an outspoken and fearless momma!
Plus, her timing couldn't have been better, considering Nashville returns for Season 5 TONIGHT with a 2-hour premiere at 9 p.m. EST on CMT.
