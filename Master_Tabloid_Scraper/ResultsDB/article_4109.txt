Hayden Panettiere & Wladimir Klitschko Happily Step Out Together For The First Time Since Those Pesky Breakup Rumors/n

We LOVES seeing Hayden Panettiere with this huge smile on her face!
On Tuesday night, the fresh-faced 27-year-old stepped out with her beau Wladimir Klitschko at The Daily Front Row's opening of The Faena Art Dome just months after the actress sought treatment for postpartum depression.
This also serves as the couple's first public appearance together since those pesky breakup rumors circulated over the summer!
As you can see (above), the pair was all smiles as they enjoyed the night out in Miami for the beginning of Art Basel. Adorbs!
