Sorry, ladies. Milo Ventimiglia is taken.

The This Is Us heartthrob is said to be happily dating Kelly Egarian, a marketing coordinator for luxury fashion house Stella McCartney. According to InTouch, the notoriously private Ventimiglia, 39, has been quietly seeing the 31-year-old New Jersey native for five months and trying to keep the romance a secret — until now.
“He is very protective of her and their relationship,” a source tells the publication. “He’s wanted to be private about it because she’s not a celebrity. But this isn’t her first celebrity relationship — she also dated J.C. Chasez.”
The insider adds, “They look happy and very much in love!”
While not much else is known about Egarian, Ventimiglia and his past relationships have certainly been made public. The actor previously dated Isabella Brewster — the sister of actress Jordana Brewster — for a year.  He was also linked to Gilmore Girls co-star Alexis Bledel from 2002 to 2006 and Heroes castmate Hayden Panettiere from 2007 to 2009.
