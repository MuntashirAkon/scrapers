Hayden Panettiere was once the ingénue, lighting up the screen. Now she’s a wife, a mother and the star of a TV show about to make a triumphant return on a new network. In a new interview with Parade, Panettiere opened up about what’s changed and how she manages it all.

“I can’t say that anything is ‘the norm’ about any day of the week now that I’m the mom,” she said of raising her two-year-old daughter Kaya Evdokia Klitschko. “She gets her hands in just about everything, and my biggest job at the moment is keeping her alive!”
Panettiere admitted that through embracing the thrill and responsibility of parenthood she has also discovered who her true friends were along the way.

“My life became all about staying healthy, getting good sleep, finding parks and nature,” she continued. “Now I’m the mother of a two-year-old, I’ve found my pack of solid, loyal, lifelong friends here and am settled into a beautiful routine.”
The 27-year-old bombshell also gave Nashville fans some idea of what to expect when the show debuts on CMT on Jan. 5, 2016.
“Juliette goes through a traumatic experience, which gives birth to a new drive and passion,” she revealed. “She begins a journey of self-discovery from an angle we have never seen before nor would ever expect from her. The transition she decides to make is one that calls for a lot of bravery. She is very aware that the public will either love or hate the new her.”
