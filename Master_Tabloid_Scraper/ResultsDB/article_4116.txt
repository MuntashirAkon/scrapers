Welcome back, Hayden Panettiere!
The Nashville star resurfaced on Wednesday (Aug. 3, 2016) following her recent stint in rehab for postpartum depression. She was spotted out and about New York City looking very happy and healthy as she chatted with her dad, Skip.
Panettiere, 26, wore a colorful jacket with fringe embellishments, jeans, and moccasin-styled boots. She completed her relaxed look by tying her blonde locks up in a topknot and sporting a pink, cross-body handbag.

In May, the actress took to Twitter to tell fans she was seeking help for the second time since giving birth to daughter Kaya in December 2014.
“The postpartum depression I have been experiencing has impacted every aspect of my life,” she tweeted. “Rather than stay stuck due to unhealthy coping mechanisms I have chosen to take time to reflect holistically on my health and life. Wish me luck!”
Now that she’s taken some time off, Panettiere can look forward to filming Nashville, which was cancelled by ABC but later picked up by CMT.
