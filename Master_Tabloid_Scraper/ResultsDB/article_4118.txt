Spotted for the first time since seeking treatment for postpartum depression on Monday (July 4, 2016), Hayden Panettiere was photographed not wearing her engagement ring from Wladimir Klitschko.

Panettiere, who shares a 19-month-old daughter named Kaya with Klitschko, was “seen sitting on a stoop, smoking a cigarette and reading the book Underboss: Sammy The Bull Gravano’s Story of Life in the Mafia” according to Us Weekly. She was dressed down in a plaid shirt, Ugg boots and blue tights.

Back in May of this year, on the same day it was announced that her TV show Nashville was being cancelled, Panettiere announced that she was seeking holistic help for her struggles with postpartum depression. She wrote on Twitter:
The postpartum depression I have been experiencing has impacted every aspect of my life. Rather than stay stuck due to unhealthy coping mechanisms I have chosen to take time to reflect holistically on my health and life. Wish me luck!
She previously sought treatment in October 2015.
Klitschko proposed to Panettiere in October 2013, and their daughter was born in December 2014. She was seen here wearing her huge diamond engagement ring with Klitschko in NYC back in May 2014:
