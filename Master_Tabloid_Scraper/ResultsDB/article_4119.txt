In May, ABC canceled Nashville. Except, unlike most programming cancellations, fans would not take this one lying down! Now, the show has found a new home at CMT, and it’s been announced that the show’s stars Connie Britton and Hayden Panettiere will be returning to the country music-based drama.
According to TV Line, besides Britton and Panettiere, co-stars Charles Esten, Sam Palladio, Jonathan Jackson, Clare Bowen, Lennon Stella, Maisy Stella and Chris Carmack are all slated to return. However, Will Chase and Aubrey Peeples might be returning but not as series regulars.
So, does Panettiere returning mean Juliette survived her flight and got back to Avery safely? We need answers!
