Nashville lives to see another day!

Though it was canceled on ABC last month, the drama starring Connie Britton and Hayden Panettiere has been picked up by CMT for another season. After weeks of negotiations, the country music-themed cable network is ordering 22 episodes, according to Deadline.
The fifth season will also be made available on Hulu to stream the day after the episodes air on CMT.
“CMT heard the fans. The wave of love and appreciation they have unleashed for Nashville has been overwhelming,” CMT president Brian Philip said in a statement. “Nashville is a perfect addition to our evolving lineup of big music specials, documentaries, and original series. We see our fans and ourselves in this show and we will treasure it like no other network. Nashville belongs on CMT.”
In the past, fan-favorite shows like Community and The Mindy Project were able to be saved from cancellation by finding a home on another network.
