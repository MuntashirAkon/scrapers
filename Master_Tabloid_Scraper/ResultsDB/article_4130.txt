Does Robert Pattinson have a new lady love in his life?According to several reports, the 27-year-old Twilight hunk recently got "very touchy-feely" with London-based artist and painter Nettie Wakefield during a date together."They were trying to keep a low profile but Rob teased Nettie by messing with her hair and they had a flirty play fight," a source told The Sun. "Afterwards they were giggling like teenagers."But despite the romance rumors, a source close to R.Pattz tells E! News exclusively that he and Wakefield are "very good friends and are definitely not dating."

Over the holidays, a fan snapped pics of Pattinson supposedly enjoying dinner with Wakefield, 26, while home in the U.K. for Christmas. In the snapshot, the duo seem to being smiling and laughing while enjoying a casual meal together at a local eatery.The Wakefield dating rumors come after Kristen Stewart's ex began romancing Dylan Penn, the daughter of Sean Penn and Robin Wright.A source told E! News at the time that Pattinson and Penn had yet to refer to each other as "boyfriend and girlfriend," "but it is a romance.""Dylan doesn't want to be famous," the source added. "She doesn't want to be an actress. She wants to be a screenwriter. She's been approached about acting work, but it's not her thing."As for Wakefield, she's currently living and working in London. According to her website, she's available for "hand drawn bespoke flyers, posters, invitations, customised greeting cards, personal messages, hand designed album covers, portraits or whatever meets your needs," among other services.—Reporting by Baker Machado
