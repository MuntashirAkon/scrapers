Though Alexis, a former financial advisor for the investment bank Morgan Stanley, showed off her growing belly in private family photos, she kept a low profile whenever she was in public to keep her pregnancy a secret.
“She doesn’t leave the house too often because she doesn¹t want anyone to know,” a source told Radar last spring. “And she wears big dresses to cover it up.”
Billy and Alexis tied the knot in a surprise July 4 ceremony at their Long Island estate. /n
