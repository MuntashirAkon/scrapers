Joe The Opportunist/n
Joe Wurzelbacher may be the first plumber ever to use a publicist for something other than plumbing. The 34-year-old Ohio resident, known as Joe the Plumber, has signed with a Nashville PR firm that typically works with musicians, reports The Washington Post.
“He’s had a deluge of requests for appearances,” said owner of the Press Office Jim Della Croce. “Right now we’re just planning on getting him through the week.”
On Tuesday, Wurzelbacher endorsed John McCain, and yesterday appeared with Sarah Palin at a rally in Bowling Green, Ohio, where he was enthusiastically greeted by thousands. 
Della Croce anticipates, “There’s going to be a life far beyond the election for Joe the Plumber.”
Note to Della Croce: Yeah, but we’re willing to bet most of that life is going to be spent fixing leaks. (Photo: WENN) /n
