Donald Trump May Pursue A Military Intervention In Venezuela & Twitter Is Freaking Out!/n

First North Korea, now Venezuela?? 
On Friday, Donald Trump told reporters he may pursue a "military option" in Venezuela due to their current political crisis.
On July 31, the United States sanctioned Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro after the country illegitimately elected a new legislative body run by his Socialist Party loyalists. In the past four months of civil unrest, hundreds have been killed and thousands have been arrested.

The President said:

"The people are suffering and they are dying. We have many options for Venezuela including a possible military option if necessary."

When pressed further, the businessman declined to give any more details.

"We don't talk about it but a military operation - a military option - is certainly something that we could pursue."

Almost immediately, Twitter erupted with reactions. See the best ones (below):
