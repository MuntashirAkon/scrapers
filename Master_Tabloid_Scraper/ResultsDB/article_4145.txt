A Giant Donald Trump Rooster Has Gone Up Behind The White House! See The Best Twitter Reactions To The Yuge Cock!/n

Donald Trump is only on Day Five of his 17-day golf vacation, and already someone else is ruling the roost.
A giant inflatable rooster has gone up at a park behind the White House, AKA the "dump" they make the POTUS live in.
The chicken was also the mascot of protesters demanding to see the Crook-In-Chief's tax returns in April, so we're guessing it's there for tonight's protest of Trump's ad-libbed nuclear threats.

The real question is, with its coiffed hair and aggressive gesticulations, will the Secret Service know which one to protect?
Ch-ch-check out video of the less foul, more fowl version of Trump, along with some of the best Twitter reactions (below)!
