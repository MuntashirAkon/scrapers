Twitter Reacts To Attorney General Jeff Sessions' Sweaty AF Testimony About The Russia Investigation!/n

Being under oath before the Senate Intelligence Committee really shows your true colors.
While James Comey came across forthright and fatherly in last week's testimony, Tuesday's courtroom drama made Jeff Sessions seem super salty!
Twitter was living for the Attorney General's contentious hearing, where Democrats pressed him on conversations with Donald Trump about the investigation into Russia meddling in the election.
Not only did Sessions call any suggestion that he colluded with Russians during the election an "appalling lie," he said he would not discuss any direct conversations with the President, per his duty "to protect confidential communications with the president."

Sessions made it clear that he was "not stonewalling" after Democratic senators accused him of not fully answering their questions â€” though Twitics couldn't help but point out the Attorney General continued to evde (AKA, "I don't recall that") most of the questions thrown at him.
The Alabama native was visibly on edge throughout the hearing, particularly when being questioned by Senator Kamala Harris, who he admitted made him "nervous" while rambling about never having met with Russian ambassadors at the Republican National Convention.
Orâ€¦ maybe he did? There were a lot of people there, OK?
Ch-ch-check out the best reactions to Sessions' frustratingly non-informative testimony!

In true Trumpian fashion, #JeffSessions claims "I am not stonewalling," then proceeds to do nothing but stonewall questioning.
We see you.

#JeffSessions is either:
A conniving liar
Completely bereft of long and short term memory (selectively)
Neither is acceptable as AG. pic.twitter.com/I9tUX2Qiqs

I can tell you one thingâ€¦
Republicans really really wish Donald Trump wasnâ€™t active on Twitter.
God it makes them look bad.#JeffSessions

#JeffSessions doesn't think it appropriate to ask a cabinet member to sit before multiple congressional hearings unless her name is Clinton.

Wait. Sessions earlier said he has not sought any information about Russia. Now he says he raised concerns about Russia invading Ukraine.

Usually people who can't recall as much as #JeffSessions have the opposite position on marijuana than his.

Ha! We couldn't have tweeted it better ourselves!
And for the icing on the Alabama cake â€” one user finally said the one thing we we've all been thinking about Sessions:
