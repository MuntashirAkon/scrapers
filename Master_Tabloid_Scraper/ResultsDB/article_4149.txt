Twitter Weighs In On Republican Greg Gianforte's Win In Montana Following His 'Body-Slamming' Controversy â€” While He Gives A Weak Apology/n

Another villainous politician is heading to D.C.
On Thursday, Greg Gianforte won the special election for Montana's open U.S. House seat. This update is obviously shocking since the victorious Republican candidate just made headlines for "body-slamming" a reporter named Ben Jacobs. Greg was even cited for misdemeanor assault for his violent interaction with Ben.

Smh. In an attempt to squash the scandal, Mr. Gianforte apologized for his actions during his victory speech. The controversial public servant stated:
"When you make a mistake, you have to own up to it, that's the Montana way. Last night I made a mistake and I took an action that I can't take back and I'm not proud of what happened. I should not have responded in the way that I did, and for that I am sorry."
Ironically, this apology directly contradicts the statement he made on the controversy while the polls were still open. Ugh.
It's said Greg's supporters shouted "you're forgiven" at the new Congressman after his speech. Nonetheless, those following the election were not as kind on Twitter. See the best reactions to Gianforte's win (below)! 

2016: get recorded bragging about assault, win.
2017: getting recorded committing assault, win.

Greg Gianforte would have won #montanaspecialelection by a higher margin had he bodyslammed Wolf Blitzer and Anderson Cooper simultaneously

Repost in honor of alleged criminal Greg Gianforte's election. If he were an immigrant he'd face deportation; now he sets immigration policy https://t.co/vN8QdEU04S
