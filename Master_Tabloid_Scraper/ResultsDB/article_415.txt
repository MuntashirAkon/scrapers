Pop star, fashion icon, actress and bikini babe, there’s no hat — or swimsuit — Rihanna doesn’t wear well. (We’re giving her a mulligan on Battleship!)
The Please Don’t Stop The Music singer showed off her sexy body in a leopard-print bikini by Jungle Gurl, while enjoying the good life in a yacht off the coast of Portofino, Italy on Saturday, and we’ve got the shots for you right here on RadarOnline.com.

On the outing, Rihanna snorkeled, and guzzled sips of mentor Jay-Z’s top-shelf champagne, Ace of Spades.
The enigmatic stunner, 24, is still in mourning for her late grandmother Clara Brathwait, who died this month after a battle with cancer.
The Take A Bow singer tweeted to her 23.3 million followers Monday, “Dolly I could feel you here #Barbados.”
