Awkward friendship alert! Selena Gomez and Miranda Kerr are now apparently best friends, almost one year after their exs got into a fight in Ibiza.
The two gorgeous girls were spotted together at the the Louis Vuitton Cruise 2016 Resort Collection in Palm Springs, Calif. on Wednesday, (May 6, 2015). While some may think this is just a cute photo, there’s actually a lot of backstory to this friendship…

Last summer, Kerr’s ex-husband, Orlando Bloom, threw a punch at Gomez’s ex-boyfriend, Justin Bieber. Why? Well, it was rumored to be about Kerr. There’s been speculation for years that Bieber and Kerr got close at the 2012 Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show, while Kerr was married to Bloom and Bieber was dating Gomez.
Both couples eventually split, and the allegations only came up again when Gomez and Bloom were photographed together in April 2014, sparking romance rumors. Then in July 2014, Bloom and Bieber had the heated exchange in Ibiza.
But, it looks like Kerr and Gomez are classy ladies, putting everything in the past and enjoying the Louis Vuitton show together. Now, if only we could get Bloom and Bieber in a pic together, that would be epic.
