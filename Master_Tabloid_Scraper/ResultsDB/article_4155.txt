 Guess what, guys? Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt were secretly married even before they had their secret wedding!
In a recent interview with Italian magazine lo Donna, the Unbroken director revealed that she and Brad legally wed in advance of her nuptials in France.

“Before the wedding in France with the kids, Brad and I were already married in California,” she divulged in the Jan. 10 edition of the Corriere della Sera via Us Weekly.  “As Americans, we couldn’t legally marry in France.”

I know… Le duh, right?! But it’s really how the civil ceremony went down that’s the best part.
“One day I said to Brad, ‘Let’s meet up at 4:30 p.m.?’ I called a justice of the peace and we signed the documents,” she revealed point blank… A few weeks later they said their “I do’s” at the Château Miraval in Correns, France and it was happily ever after from there!
Meanwhile, the couple were spotted on Friday at the AFI Awards looking like the hottest married couple in town.  Brad went casual in a sweater and jeans, while Angie looked chic in a blazer, skinnies and a pop of red lipstick.
