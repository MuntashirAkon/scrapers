 While actress Kristen Stewart debuted her new hairdo at the Chanel Fashion Show Fall-Winter 20014-2015 during Paris Fashion Week in Paris, France earlier today (July 08, 2014), actor Jared Leto revealed that his fashion sense isnâ€™t always spot on.

Jared made a bold, but odd, statement in a pair of gold frayed trousers and beige Chanel cowboy boots as he arrived for the showcase.
Jared posed with designer Karl Lagerfeld and was joined at the event by such other celebrities as Lily Collins, Isabelle Huppert, Dakota Johnson, Alice Dellal and Nina Dobrev who all watched Kendall Jenner rock the runway.
