Jared Leto and His Luscious Locks Promote ‘Dallas Buyers Club’ in Rome/n
Actor Jared Leto attended the Dallas Buyers Club Photocall during the 8th Rome Film Festival at the Auditorium Parco Della Musica earlier today (November 9, 2013) in Rome, Italy.
Jared, who has been receiving rave reviews for his role as Rayon — a transgender woman living with HIV and struggling with a drug habit — is currently in the midst of a promotional tour for the film.

Dallas Buyers Club is based on the story of Ron Woodroof, a Texas electrician who was diagnosed as HIV-positive in 1986, and who subsequently devoted his life to providing fellow HIV patients with non-FDA-approved drugs and supplements during an era when doctors were still struggling to understand the devastating disease. He then smuggled those drugs into the U.S., forming a buyers club for fellow HIV patients.
He looks ultra hip while meeting the press, wearing a black coat, jeans and a blue and black plaid shirt tied around his waist. At one point, while posing for photos on the red carpet, Leto channeled Ian Somerhalder with his clasped hands “thank you” pose.
