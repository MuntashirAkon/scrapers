Congratulations are in order for Billy Joel and wife Alexis Joel!The newlyweds have welcomed a daughter, their first child together. "Della Rose Joel officially entered the world on Wednesday, Aug. 12, at 2:40 a.m. weighing in at 7 lbs, 6.5 oz.," the musician's rep confirms.Neither the singer nor the equestrian have revealed why they chose the name Della Rose for their baby. Billy, 66, and Alexis, 33, wed in a surprise ceremony on July 4 at their estate in Long Island, N.Y., having been together since 2009.In late July, Billy called his wife's pregnancy "pretty wild," telling Newsday, "I've still got the mojo. I'm excited!" The rocker added that he planned to "spend a lot of time" with this kid. "I'm probably going to be able to spend more time with this kid than most people are able to spend with their children," he said, "because I don't have a regular job. I could be a stay-at-home dad for as long as I can stay alive."

Billy also has a 29-year-old daughter, singer Alexa Ray Joel, from his second marriage, to Christie Brinkley. "I would like to have been around more because I was on the road for years and years when she was a little girl," he said. "And After Christie and I split up, she was in Colorado, so I missed out on some of her childhood, which I would like to have been there for. But now I have a chance to do it better."The six-time Grammy Award winner added, "Here I go again.""She's going to have her dad around a lot," the "Piano Man" singer said of raising Della Rose. "She'll probably be very embarrassed by the time she graduates high school, with kids asking, 'Is that your grandfather? No that's my dad.' But all kids reach that age where everything you do embarrasses them."
