When in Rome...?Kevin Costner was joined by his daughter Lily for the screening of his film Black and White at the at Auditorium Parco Della Musica for the Rome Film Festival today, and the two shared a very tender moment when they seemingly planted a smooch on the lips.Guess the European customs really got to them?Anyway, family PDA aside, the two looked great on the red carpet. Costner was dapper in a three-piece black and white suit, while his lil lady donned a teal jumpsuit with lace detail.

After greeting the crowds with his gorgeous daughter in hand, the actor headed inside where he held a press conference alongside the film's director Mike Binder.Black and White—which also stars Anthony Mackie, Octavia Spencer, Gillian Jacobs and Jennifer Ehle—tells the tale of a grieving widower, who is drawn into a custody battle over his granddaughter, whom he helped raise her entire life.
