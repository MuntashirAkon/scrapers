We doubt Lauren Conrad has plans to return to The Hills, even for the series finale. But maybe a former boss will convince the 24-year-old otherwise."The show gave her a great run," Teen Vogue editor Lisa Love told us last night at Diego Della Valle's MOCA fundraiser at Tod's in Beverly Hills. "She should definitely come back for the finale."Hills creator Adam DiVello told EW.com that his dream is to have Miss Conrad walk down the aisle in the last episode, but Love has other things on her wish list for L.C.'s hoped for return...

"It'd be fun if Lauren and I caught up in Paris," Love suggested. "I think they could find a way to make it work with her coming back."Unlike former Hillster Whitney Port, Love hasn't quite been following the antics of Audrina Patridge and Lo Bosworth since Conrad's farewell."It was over many years ago for me, and I haven't watched it since," Love said. "I never watched it even when I was on. You don't want to watch yourself on TV. I only follow what's going on with the cast when I'm at the airport."Also at last night's Rodeo Drive cocktail soiree, which celebrated Jeffrey Deitch's appointment as MOCA's new director,  were Gwen Stefani, Gavin Rossdale, Halle Berry, Kate Beckinsale, Jessica Alba, Pierce Brosnan, Kate Bosworth and Neil Patrick Harris.
