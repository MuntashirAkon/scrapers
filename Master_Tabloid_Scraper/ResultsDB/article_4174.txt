Justin Bieber can't seem to go anywhere without causing a frenzy these days, but that's nothing new for the pop star.E! News has learned that the Canadian singer was questioned by police early Wednesday at his five-star hotel room in Rome."He was questioned but wasn't as serious as they made it seem," a source tells us, adding that "he is still in Rome and having a great time."La Repubblica and Corriere della Sera are also reporting that the Biebs was interrogated by authorities in connection with an incident in Argentina involving him, his bodyguard and a local photographer.On April 8, an Argentinian judge requested that Interpol issue a Red Notice for the crooner to be arrested for allegedly ordering his security team to assault Diego Pesoa in 2013.Interpol does not issue its own arrest warrants, however, they can send out the notice to warn their member states that a suspect is wanted in one particular country. E! News did not find Bieber's name under the Argentinian Interpol list.

Pesoa claims that Bieber instructed one bodyguard to forcefully take his camera and cellphone outside of a Buenos Aires nightclub.The "Where Are Ü Now" singer has maintained his innocence, and even took to Twitter to address the latest news."Rumors rumors rumors. All good. Comes with the job. Enjoying Italy and appreciate all the kind people here. Thank you. Great food," he wrote.Meanwhile, a source tells E! News that reports of him being arrested or detained are "ridiculous" and "completely false."Bieber is in town to film a cameo role in the highly anticipated flick Zoolander 2. Just this morning, Ben Stiller confirmed Biebs' appearance by posting a hilarious pic on Instagram showing the two doing their best Blue Steel faces.
