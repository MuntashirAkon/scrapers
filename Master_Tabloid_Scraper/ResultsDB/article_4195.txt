Radar told you first!
As Bravo gears up for the tenth season of Real Housewives of Orange County, it was announced that newcomer Lizzie Rovsek would no longer be featured as an official Housewife.
As Radar previously reported, after just one short season, the reality star was axed for “being too boring” and failing to “bring anything to the table.”

During the epic tenth season, according to Bravo, Rovsek will find herself “mixed into the drama as the ladies test the limits of loyalty, the depth of deceit and the bonds of friendship like never before.”
Meanwhile, fellow newcomer Shannon Beader made the cut and will return as an official Housewife for her second season aboard.
