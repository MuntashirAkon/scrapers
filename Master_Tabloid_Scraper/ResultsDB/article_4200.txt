 Vicki Backs Down! ‘RHOC’ Star Vicki Gunvalson Changes Her Tune On Tamra Barney Incident.../n
Real Housewives of Orange County star Vicki Gunvlason seems to be backpedaling on a statement that she made regarding co-star Tamra Barney, which accused Barney of “not reaching out” after Gunvalson’s live-in boyfriend Brooks Ayers was diagnosed with Stage 3 Hodgkin’s Lymphoma.
“Although our relationship has been strained from doing this show, real life still continues and I wish the best for Tamra and her family as I hope she does for me and the people I care about,” Gunvalson tells RadarOnline.com exclusively.
The drama started when Gunvalson, 52, told Us Weekly that she had moved Ayers into her home following his cancer diagnosis and they were dating exclusively, but singled out Barney for “not reaching out” to wish them well.

“Shannon [Beador] was absolutely there for us,” Gunvalson said to the magazine. “Heather[Dubrow] also reached out. And [Heather’s husband] Terry, Lizzie[Rovsek]” supported her and Ayers after his diagnosis. But we never heard from Tamra.”
As Radar previously reported, a source close to Barney, 46, said that Gunvalson’s accusation was “absolutely not true.”
An insider tells Radar, “After reaching out to Tamra on Oct. 10 to wish her well after winning her court battle with Simon, Vicki did get a message from her that said ‘wishing you the best,” referring to Barney’s recent divorce from ex-husband Simon Barney.

“This was immediately following Brooks’ diagnosis,” the insider adds.
“She didn’t see it initially but did when she double-checked her messages., but Vicki has not heard from Tamra since.
