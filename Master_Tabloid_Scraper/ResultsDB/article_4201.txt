Hilary Duff Recreates That Magically Awkward Disney Channel Promo — Watch!/n

Who said being a Disney Channel star was easy??
We're certain Hilary Duff has a few choice words for anyone who implies this, especially after dropping deets about THAT iconic promo filming sesh! You know, the one that went viral at the end of last year.
In case you forgot, unedited Disney Channel commercials were leaked in 2016 which featured Miz Duff and Raven-Symoné looking ready to murder some crew members. Let's just say the videos are magically awkward!

Thankfully, the Lizzie McGuire star has since revealed why she and The View alum looked so miserable while filming the commercials. While promoting the new season of her show Younger, the mother-of-one dished to Buzzfeed: 

"It's so ridiculous. It's so funny though. So we had to do the thing and then they put it in CGI, the mouse ears. And then they made us do it like 900 times. And I think I like lost all personality at that point. Plus, I was, like, a pubescent teen — I was like, What are they making me do, this is invisible! But Raven-Symoné was nailing it!"
HIGHlarious! Apparently, despite doing the wand motion "900 times," the former Disney darling had no clue what she was doing as she continued:

"[I had been doing it] all day! I think I had shot the beginning of Lizzie McGuire with all those bouncy balls, and I was like, What is this-last minute thing? It's so good. It's, like, Hilary with a lot of attitude. Like, What are they making me do? But now I'm happy to do it, because that was hilarious."
AH-Mazing. But Lizzie *ahem* Hilary didn't stop at the confessional as she then recreated the promo — bless! Be sure to ch-ch-check Hilary's explanation and modern wand skills for yourself (below)!
