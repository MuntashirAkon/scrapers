An insider told E! News: 

"[Robbie is a] great guy. They are in an exclusive relationship and Lizzie is excited about him. She deserves it. It's very new though, but they seem to like each other a lot already."
How fab!
Robbie is a singer in the indie band Milo Greene, a group he formed with his college friends. He also really, really, really loves movies, as told by his personal Instagram page.
It's a good thing he's dating an actress!
Best of luck, you two!
