Kendall Jenner and Gigi Hadid were transformed into “humanoid domesticated pets” for the cover of W Magazine.
In the shoot titled “Placebo Pets,” the BFFs were given animal-esque features (which included extra limbs and weird noses) as they posed for the publication’s 10th Anniversary Art edition.
“There’s a certain power that animals have over us when they respond to us in unexpected, friendly ways,” artist Ryan Trecartin revealed to the magazine when asked about the idea behind the shoot. “And it’s really them domesticating us almost more than us domesticating them, because they’re training us to want them.”

In case you didn’t notice, the girls do not have any knees. Now, is it done on purpose? We’re not sure, but it might be considering this was an artsy-fartsy shoot.
