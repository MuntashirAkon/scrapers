This year, take a few pointers from fashionable faves like Irina Shayk and Behati Prinsloo and rock their go-to swimwear brands. Whether you plan to spend your days lounging by the pool or soaking in the surf by the shore, these two-piece will have you looking oh-so fab.
Here are 10 super cute bikinis you should try this summer!

2. Panache Amelia Bandeau Bikini and Gathered Pant, $69 and $38. Need a little more support? Those with a bigger bust will no longer fear bandeau tops. Designed specifically to fit larger chests, this retro-inspired bikini is available in D through G cups.
