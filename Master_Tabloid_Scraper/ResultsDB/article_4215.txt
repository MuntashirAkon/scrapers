Oh, Meryl.

Meryl Streep’s made her views on diversity in the film industry very clear. On Thursday (Feb. 11, 2016), the actress addressed the issue while talking to talking to reporters in Germany, when asked about the all-white jury at this year’s Berlin International Film Festival.
According to the Associated Press, even though Streep insisted she’s committed to including, “all genders, races, ethnicities, religions,” when asked about diversity on the jury, she could only point to gender diversity. “This jury is evidence that at least women are included and in fact dominate this jury, and that’s an unusual situation in bodies of people who make decisions,” Streep said. “So I think the Berlinale is ahead of the game.”

When prompted again, asked whether she understood films from Arab and North African regions, she admitted that while she didn’t know much she’s, “played a lot of different people from a lot of different cultures.” But she didn’t stop there.
“There is a core of humanity that travels right through every culture, and after all, we’re all from Africa originally,” Streep said before adding, “You know, we’re all. Berliners, we’re all Africans, really.”
Yea.
Unsurprisingly, Streep’s comments sparked a racial debate, with the actresses name trending worldwide.

I love Meryl Streep. But ‘we’re all Africans’?! No. Just no. And the woman thinks about what it’s like to be someone else for a living. 😑

This isn’t the first time Streep’s comment’s have come under fire. Last year, while promoting the movie Suffragettes about the beginnings of the feminist movement, the actress refused to label herself a feminist insisting she is a “humanist” instead.
