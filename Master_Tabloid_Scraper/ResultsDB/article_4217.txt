Today shall be known as the day when the redheads prevailed.

Hilary Duff swore off of Tinder as soon as her music video hit YouTube, but that doesn’t mean she can’t play around. Ellen DeGeneres put her celebrity matchmaking skills to the test by giving the Younger actress a shot at choosing between the studliest men in Hollywood, but Duff surprisingly stuck with a fellow of the British variety.
The former Lizzie McGuire starlet passed up a total of 11 men including Nick Jonas, Leonardo DiCaprio, and more obvious choices for Prince Harry “Henry” of Wales.

Duff had no idea that she had a hankering for this royal redhead until DeGeneres made it very clear. “You just taught me something about myself,” she said to DeGeneres.
Duff and her ex-husband Mike Comrie live separately, but work together amicably to raise their son Luca. “We’re both so obsessed with him and we are good friends and we laugh a lot,” she says. “We have a great communication and we share pictures when one is not with Luca … We are great and we keep on trucking.”
