When Hilary Duff goes bowling, it's a very notable event.The actress opened up about her very first Tinder date Tuesday morning, telling On Air With Ryan Seacrest she went bowling with a mystery man named Tom and some friends, but she left out one tiny secret...her date doubled as a Lizzie McGuire reunion! Lizzie, Miranda (Lalaine) and Matt (Jake Thomas) bowled alongside Duff's friends and Tom's friends."So this happened last night... #LizzieMcGuire," Thomas captioned the pic.But we have one extremely important question: Where is Gordo (Adam Lamberg)?!Didn't he and Lizzie fall for one another after she realized Paulo was a scummy pop star? Weren't they meant to be together for all fictitious TV time?! Answer us, nostalgia gods!*Sigh* At least we got these three back together again!It must have been a really fun day for Duff, who seems to be enjoying her new single relationship status. The 27-year-old recently filed for divorce from Mike Comrie but with her gal-pals by her side she seems to be doing OK, especially since she's already back on the dating scene!
