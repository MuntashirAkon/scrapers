The Lizzie McGuire Movie/n
Even as bubble-gum moviemaking goes, this is one thin Lizzie. Hilary Duff, the Lizzie McGuire of the Disney Channel's most popular program, takes her show on the road and heads over to Rome. She's mistaken for an Italian pop star and hooks up with a suspicious singer who wants to put her in his act. But Lizzie's pal Gordo (Adam Lamberg) can smell a rat when all Lizzie sees is stardom and cute boys.

 The Italian scenery is bellissimo, but it adds up to little more than a longer episode with Vespas and better pizza. And besides, the Olsen twins totally already rocked Rome, like, last year.
