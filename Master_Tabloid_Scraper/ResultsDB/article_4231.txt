Bad daughter vs. bad grandma: Who won the ratings battle?Lifetime debuted two of their most highly anticipated original movies this month, with Flowers in the Attic bowing Saturday, Jan. 18, and Lizzie Borden Took an Ax premiering Saturday, Jan. 25. But which of the films failed to ensnare viewers?Flowers in the Attic, an adaptation of V.C. Andrews' best-selling 1979 novel starring Mad Men's Kiernan Shipka and Ellen Burstyn, was the network's most-watched original movie since 2012, locking in 6.1 million viewers.Good news for fans rooting for Lifetime to move forward with their plans for a sequel, less-than-good news for Lizzie Borden, which paled in comparison.

Christina Ricci's Lizzie Borden, which told the true story of a school teacher accused of killing her family in 1892, attracted 4.4 million viewers.However, Lifetime boasts that the flick, which also starred Billy Campbell, was the most-tweeted TV program of the night, while Flowers in the Attic came in second in that measure to the 2014 SAG Awards. Hey, a win's a win, right?!Prior to Flowers' debut, Lifetime announced that they had already begun working on a sequel, based on the second book in the Dollanganger series, Petals in the Wind.Set 10 years in the future (which unfortunately means no Shipka!), writer Kayla Alpert teased that it will be "a juicy revenge drama."
