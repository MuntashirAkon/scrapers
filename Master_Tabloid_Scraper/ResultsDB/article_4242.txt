Naughty Girl! Dad Scolds Elisabeth on 'The View'/nYou've been a very, very bad girl, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, haven't you? "The View's " paragon of prim and proper let her verbal chastity belt slip today, revealing on the morning gabfest that she'd snuck out of the house as a 14-year-old, breaking the family home's electricity meter in the process, and saddling her folks with a crazy-high power bill. Sin Lizzie also admitted that her secret trip was for the express purpose of (gasp!) -- meeting a boy, whom she wouldn't identify.Her father, Ken Filarski, did not think that the statute of limitations on a scolding had passed, calling into the show live, saying he was  "shocked " and that he wanted to be paid back for that electric bill. Elisabeth was suitably mortified when the call came in, looking as though she'd just seen a Hummer flattening a kitten./n
