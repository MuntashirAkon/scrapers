Chloë Sevigny -- You're a 19th Century Dead Man/nChloë Sevigny is so obsessed with a brutal century-old murder in New England -- she slept in the house where the killer hacked up the bodies ... and as the legend goes, the place is haunted.You're looking at pics from the Lizzie Borden House in Fall River, Massachusetts -- named after a woman who allegedly murdered her elderly parents in cold blood, using nothing but a hatchet.Who'da thunk ... the famous house is now a bed and breakfast -- and Chloë was one of its most recent guests ... doing a dead-on corpse impression, and even spending the night in Lizzie Borden's old bed.For the record, Lizzie was accused of the murders but never convicted -- the creepy part ... no one else was ever arrested or tried./n
