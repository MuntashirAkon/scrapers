Hilary Duff -- Buy My Huge House ... for $6.25 Mil/nMom-to-be Hilary Duff is trying one more time to unload the massive crib she bought with all her  "Lizzie McGuire " money -- listing her Toluca Lake pad for a cool $6.25 million. Duff originally listed the 9,277 square foot, five-bedroom, six-bath Mediterranean-style home for $7 million last year ... but couldn't find a buyer.The ginormous home comes with a cognac room, billiard room, wine cellar, game room, gym, gorgeous pool and the best feature of all ... a gift-wrapping room. It pays to be a Disney princess./n
