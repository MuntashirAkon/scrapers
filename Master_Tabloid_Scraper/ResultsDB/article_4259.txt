 WATCH: Warren Jeffs’ Shocking History: ‘Escaping The Prophet’ Claims Polygamist.../n
Warren Jeffs is serving a life sentence plus 20 years for the horrific sexual assault of two young teenage girls he took as “child brides” but an explosive new series has revealed that his victims also included young boys in his Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints polygamist cult.
Escaping the Prophet, the reality show focusing on Flora Jessop as she helps members leave the cult, reveals that Jeff’s young victims were powerless against the leader of FLDS.
Jessop was given the audio recordings from Jeffs’ trial and listening to the tape was a traumatic experience for Brandon, who is no longer living in the cult.

“Listening to that tape of him raping that young girl brought back a lot of painful memories,” Brandon explains after breaking down listening to the tape.
He then reveals the shocking claim that he too was one of Jeffs’ victims.
“That’s exactly how he spoke to me when he did that to me.”
