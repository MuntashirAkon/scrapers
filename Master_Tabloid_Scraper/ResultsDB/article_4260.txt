 Escaping The Prophet: Warren Jeffs’ FLDS Members Trying To Leave Polygamist Cult In.../n
Warren Jeffs’ incarceration has done almost nothing to ease the hold he has over the hundreds of people in his polygamist cult, but one woman is on a personal crusade to help women escape the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and help them regain control of their lives.
In an exclusive sneak peak of the new reality show Escaping the Prophet, Flora Jessop makes it her mission to help families leave the FLDS cult and she shows the emotional bond that Jeffs retains from behind the prison walls.
“Ruth, like everyone in the FLDS, has pictures of Warren Jeffs on her walls,” Jessop explains as they show a woman crying as a group of people take down their “Prophet’s” photographs, tear them to shreds and even burn them.

“This man has so much power over these people,” she explains.
An eerie recording of Jeffs plays with him saying: “This is a revelation from the Lord God in heaven.”
Jessop explains why it is so difficult for people to leave the cult, even with their leader locked up for a life sentence plus 20 years.

“He has absolute control. They fear and obey everything he says.”
Escaping the Prophet airs Tuesdays at 10/9c on TLC.
