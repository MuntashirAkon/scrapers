On Tuesday, the 38-year-old was busy filming scenes for The Mindy Project where she covered up her baby bump with a cute, floral dress.
Although The Office alum "just started telling her friends she is pregnant" she is "not telling anyone, not even close friends, who the father is."
We can't wait to hear more baby news (and see more pics) from Miz Kaling!
