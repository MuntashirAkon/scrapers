As if Beyoncé couldn't get any cooler!

Leave it to Bey to make a fashion statement during a photo shoot for her kids. Apparently, the A-lister selected a flowing, floral patterned jacket from a MENSWEAR line. Yup, you read that correctly, the hitmaker wore a piece designed for men in the family photo. So fierce.
It's said the genius behind the jacket is  Palomo Spain, a haute couture fashion house headed by up-and-coming fashion designer Alejandro Gómez Palomo. Reportedly, Palomo lent the mother-of-three a sample last fall and JAY-Z's wife liked it so much she ordered one she could keep. After taking Bey's measurements, Alejandro's team designed a perfectly tailored piece for her.
On the jacket itself, the designer dished to Vogue:
"It is vintage silk organza from a really old couture textile shop in Córdoba, Spain, which is near where I live. It is circa either the 1950s or the 1960s. I thought, Oh my God, I am so in love with this fabric. It had a midcentury quality — but we changed that. It's exquisite… and I can never find it again, of course."
However, Palomo gifted the jacket to Beyoncé just before she got pregnant, so he assumed she'd never wear it. But wear it she did, and Alejandro couldn't be more grateful, as he added:
"This is a really big surprise, obviously. I love the picture. It's just really beautiful. It's special."
You're damn straight! We're sure plenty of designers are envious of Palomo right now!
