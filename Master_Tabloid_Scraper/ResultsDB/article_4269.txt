Who said paparazzi photos aren't art?

According to Tabloid Art History, "for every pic of Lindsay Lohan falling, there's a Bernini sculpture begging to be referenced." HIGHlarious!
And, to be frank, this user isn't wrong! We mean, the art history fanatic has found works of art to compare to pap and social media pics of celebs like Brad Pitt, Britney Spears, Beyonce, North West, etc.
Be sure to take a moment to appreciate this genius Twitter account (below) because it is giving us LIFE!
