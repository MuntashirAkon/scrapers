Kanye West, master of purposeful floral arrangements, went all out to impress Kim Kardashian and commemorate their third wedding anniversary.

Kim shared a video on Snapchat of the massive arrangements of white flowers that West left for her in their home.
“I mean, how cute that I get to come home and see these gorgeous floating flowers,” Kim said in her video. “Happy anniversary.”
On Mother’s Day 2014, West gifted Kim a wall of white flowers and gave her the same exact gift for Valentine’s Day this year. Perhaps this is why he decided to opt for a different shape that makes the arrangements look like a field of cauliflower from a distance. Don’t get me wrong: they are gorgeous and probably very expensive flowers, but they just happen to look like one of my favorite vegetables. Take a look at the video and decide for yourself.

The couple was married in Florence, Italy in 2014. During the ceremony, their daughter North West served as their flower girl. Kim shared a behind-the-scenes look at her wedding dress fitting with designer Ricardo Tisci plus a special message to West on her app on Wednesday.
“I can’t believe it’s been 3 years! For our wedding anniversary, I wanted to share some BTS pics of my dress fitting with Riccardo Tisci,” Kim wrote.
