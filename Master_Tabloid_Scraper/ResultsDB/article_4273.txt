According to E! News, the campaign was designed by La Perla Creative Director, Julia Haart, and was inspired by the work of artists Georgia O’Keeffe and Peter Max. It was photographed by Mert & Marcus.
“Jenner exudes the certainty and self-assurance of a true heroine—owning her world through confidence and empowered femininity,” reads La Perla’s press release associated with the campaign. “The explosive visual message is intended to shock and transport the viewer to a world of fantasy, color, and art.”
