Is Harry Styles dating Tess Ward? That’s the question on everyone’s mind.

The 23-year-old singer is reportedly dating the food writer, according to The Sun.
“As soon as Harry met Tess there was an instant spark between them,” the British tabloid claims. “They really bonded over their mutual love of quirky fashion and food — and things turned romantic quickly.”

The outlet adds the two have “been on a number of dates” after being introduced by their mutual friend, stylist Lou Teasdale. Styles has reportedly “already introduced Tess to some of his close friends.”
Ward, a Le Cordon Bleu-trained chef who authored The Naked Diet, furthered fueled romance rumor when she was spotted wearing the same Gucci shirt Styles owns at the Audi Polo Challenge in London this weekend. Eagle-eyed Directioners quickly pointed out Styles was seen in the floral button-up earlier in May, suggesting that the two may be sharing wardrobe. (After all, it wouldn’t be the first time a girlfriend was seen wearing something of Styles’!)
