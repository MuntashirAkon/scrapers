In line with recent interviews, Evans continued to praise Slate’s acting talents in a quote to People.
“She’s the best,” he said of the actress. “I’ve never ever ever met someone in my life who has a mastery of the English language the way she does. She’ll give you one sentence and there’s no fat to it. You’re like, ‘You just chose such an unbelievable collection of words that beautifully articulate what you say.’”
Slate told Entertainment Tonight, “[Evans is] just an absolutely, really giving performer and a wonderful actor. It’s a delight, a total delight.”
Slate and Evans met on the set of Gifted before they dated for just about a year. Slate recently discussed the healthy silence between them that followed their split in an interview with Vulture.
“I think it’s probably best. I’d love to be his friend one day, but we threw down pretty hard. No regrets, though. Ever,” she said.
