Suri Cruise is looking more and more like her dad, Tom Cruise, these days.

The 10-year-old made a rare public appearance with mom Katie Holmes at a basketball game in Los Angeles on Sunday (Jan. 15, 2016). Looking fashionable as ever in a pink cardigan and a floral dress with a bow in her hair, the daughter of the Top Gun actor was all smiles as she watched the Los Angeles Lakers take on the Detroit Pistons at the Staples Center with her mother.
Suri’s parents announced their divorce in June 2012 after five years together. In 2016, Cruise acknowledged that he didn’t see his daughter for more than 100 days — from Aug. 4, 2012 to Thanksgiving of that year — following his split with Holmes.

Refuting rumors that he had “abandoned” his child, Cruise explained he spoke to his daughter on the phone, but couldn’t be with her in person due to his filming schedule.
“You have to work at it. I’ve gotten very good at it. I tell wonderful stories,” he said of their phone conversations during a legal deposition in a libel case. “I also find that, you know, Suri is a very happy child, and confident, and has a good sense of herself.”
“Things change and there is different agreements, like in any divorce, where you work out schedules,” Cruise added. “It’s just a different set of circumstances. It certainly does not mean that I’ve abandoned my daughter.”
