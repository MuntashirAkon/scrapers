Remember back in 2014 when Mindy Kaling and The Mindy Project made “Wreath Witherspoon” a thing on social media?

Well, it’s back again two years later with full support from the wreath herself, Reese Witherspoon. The actress has wreath-printed items available for sale as a part of the Draper James holiday collection, including wreath dresses, wreath skirts, and wreath pajamas.

Witherspoon tells People that she was given the nickname when she used to deliver presents from house to house. “Everyone serves hot cocoa, and I always wear my most festive holiday outfit — that’s how I got the nickname Wreath Witherspoon!” she says.
The actress also paid the nickname forward by putting out a short video where she gives other celebrities holiday-inspired names, like Ho-Ho-Ho-wen Wilson and Elf Macpherson. Oh, you sleigh us, Reese. Watch the video right here:
