Mommy and Mini Must-Haves! Pink and Daughter Willow Go All Out Matching in Floral – and We Have the Details/n
Pink is known for her independent spirit, but she’s not above twinning — when it involves her adorable 6-year-old daughter Willow Sage, that is.
The singer shared a cute snap to Instagram Tuesday, showing herself and Willow rocking coordinating floral-printed duds by designer Tysa. Pink, 37, is wearing the brand’s Wrap Skirt in Rise ($196), while her little girl opts for the Mini Sonoma Playsuit in Rise ($65).
“We❤️you Tysa #matchymatchy #ilovethatshewillstillletmedothis,” Pink captioned the shot, in which Willow’s arms are wrapped around her mom’s middle.
