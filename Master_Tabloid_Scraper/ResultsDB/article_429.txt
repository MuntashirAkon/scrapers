On Monday, the Transformers alum took to Instagram to thank the Beverly Hills, 90210 vet for blessing their babies with his "teen heartthrob" DNA. The mother-of-three posted: 




Thank you for donating your DNA to the shared dream of birthing our own colony of teen heart throbs. #mcm #colonymissionA post shared by Megan Fox (@the_native_tiger) on Aug 21, 2017 at 5:34pm PDT


Hey, Megan! You aren't so shabby yourself!
As for the future of their family, Mr. Green made it clear that he's eager to have a baby girl with Megan. During a Facebook live appearance, Brian told Hollywood Pipeline's Dax Holt:
"I have four boys now, a fifth is a basketball team. So that would be kind of awesome."
In case you forgot, Green and Fox have three boys together, named Noah Shannon (4), Bodhi Ransom (3), and Journey River (1). The 44-year-old also has 15-year-old Kassius from a previous relationship.
Since he already has a tribe of boys, Brian would "really" like a baby girl. We mean, he specifically added:
"I want a girl. I really want a girl."
Awwwww. Sadly, this declaration doesn't mean Meg and Brian are actively trying to get pregnant as he quipped:
"I'm worried that if I try I'll just get another boy. Not just because I love my boys, but I'll have another boy and I don't know if I'm ready for five."
Fair enough. But, the MINUTE you're ready for kiddo number five, you let us know — m'kay???
