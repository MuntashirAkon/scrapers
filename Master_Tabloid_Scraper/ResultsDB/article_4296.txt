She also reveals that mother Carole Middleton has a big crush on Roger."Roger is my mother's heartthrob. I don't think she will mind me saying that!" Kate says. "I think he probably knows that too."She also talks about how she missed Andy Murray's 2013 Wimbledon because she was eight-months pregnant at the time with her and William's eldest child, Prince George.

"I was very heavily pregnant with George so I wasn't able to turn up," she recalls. "I wrote to [Andy] afterwards saying sorry for not being there but huge congratulations."
