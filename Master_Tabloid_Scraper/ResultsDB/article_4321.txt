TV Guide Network Adds Curb Your Enthusiasm -- With A New Twist/n
HBO’s hit series Curb Your Enthusiasm is coming to TV Guide Network, and then some. 
Larry David‘s comedy series will be broadcast on the network uncut from its’ HBO versions; following each episode will be a series of seven-to-ten-minute discussions from different four-person panels in which each show will be dissected to its’ very essence.
“There is more than enough to talk about in every episode,” said Curb star Susie Essman, who will host each discussion. “Some issues are silly, like Larry refusing to submit to the etiquette about not leaving a dinner party before dessert. But there are a lot of race questions and gender issues. And there’s a surprising amount about people with handicaps.”
Essman said the panels will be composed of “sports figures, rabbis [and] intellectuals;” already slated to appear are NY Times journalist Randy Cohen, Bravo matchmaker Patti Stanger and rocker Rob Zombie. 
We can’t Curb Your Enthusiasm for too much longer: the show makes its’ TV Guide debut June 2. /n
