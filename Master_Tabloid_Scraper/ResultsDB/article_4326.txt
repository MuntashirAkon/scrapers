Apparently, the twosome exchanged their vows at Caesar's Palace mere days after their joint bachelor and bachelorette parties at  Sin City's Chateau Nightclub this past weekend. Sounds like a good time to us!
As you may recall, The Goonies alum and the Canadian beauty revealed they were planning to get married earlier this month because they feared Donald Trump's immigration plan would separate them. According to TooFab, Feldman is "very excited and happy" about his recent nuptials!
We bet! In fact, the Stand By Me actor even teased his special day on Twitter as he wrote:

Happy 222 Day #EVERYBODY I Hav a feeling 2DAY is gonna B super special! ✌🏼️❤️😇🙏🏼

Sneaky, sneaky! This is the 45-year-old's third marriage as he was previously married to Susie Sprague (with whom he has one child) and Vanessa Marcil.
We honestly couldn't be happier for Corey and Courtney on their recent wedding! Congratulations you two!
