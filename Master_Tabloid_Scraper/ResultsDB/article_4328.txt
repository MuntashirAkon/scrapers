Gwyneth Paltrow's Kids Perform With Dad Chris Martin On Stage At Fundraiser! Watch The Musical Family Moment!/n

The Apple doesn't fall far from the treeâ€¦ and neither does the Moses!
Chris Martin's children showed off their musical talents over the weekend at a fundraiser for the Boys and Girls Club in Malibu â€” and it's clear they take after their rockstar father!
The Coldplay frontman performed alongside his kids on stage, strumming his guitar and playing the piano as his 12-year-old daughter and 10-year-old son belted out their favorite songs!
Looking like a mini version of mom Gwyneth Paltrow, Apple performed Ariana Grande's ballad Just a Little Bit of Your Heart, then Moses rocked out to Twenty One Pilots' House Of Gold.

While they may not be on their father's Super Bowl headlining level just yet, it's clear these budding performers inherited Martin's musical talents!
Is it too much to ask for an entire family performance next time? We're sure Gwyneth can take a break from Gooping to complete the modernized Von Trapp family vibes we're getting from this.
Either way, we're sure momma would be proud! Ch-ch-check out clips of Martin performing with his kids (below)!
