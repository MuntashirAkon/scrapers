Corey Feldman is telling the truth.
In this week's issue of People Magazine, Corey debunked the rampant rumors that he's slipped back into using drugs. The denial comes on the heels of his disastrous Today show performance in September.
According to Corey, he is 100% clean and all the allegations couldn't be further from the truth. In fact, Mr. Feldman insists he has been clean for a whopping twenty-five years.

The former child star argued:
"There's nothing in this world that would ever make me do cocaine or heroin or any of that stuff ever again."
Phew, what a relief!
As for who inspires him to stay sober, Corey revealed his 12-year-old son Zen is a constant pillar of support: 
"That's where my love is and where my heart is. There's no time to mope around or to be depressed, because I have to be a positive influence on him. That's what's most important."
Aww… how sweet!
The 45-year-old went on to add:
"I look at his beautiful smiling face and I say, ‘I've got to stay strong for him'. No matter how mean and awful people can be, I can't let that affect me."
Wow, C.F. sounds like an AMAZING dad! Zen and wife Susie Feldman are lucky to have Corey in their lives.
