During the 3-minute dance fast, grandpa dearest can be seen ditching his canes and rocking out to a few familiar tunes, including “Rock Around the Clock” and “Wake Up, Little Susie.”
Grandpa even dances with two ladies at one point.
The video first appeared on Facebook and has since made its way to Reddit, YouTube and YouTube remixes, because that’s how the Internet works.
Nice moves, gramps. Watch the sweet clip, below.
