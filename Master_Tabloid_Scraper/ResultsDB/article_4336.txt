From High-End to Low-End: Get Selena Gomez’s Boho Summer Look for Less/n
As you guys may remember, I pinned Selena Gomez as one of the Best Dressed at Coachella earlier this year.  I absolutely love the boho chic look of the whole ensemble!
But the best part about this look is that it’s not just something you can wear at a festival… It’s something you can wear all summer, too!

SelGo’s look cost a little too much for me to justify splurging on… But I was able to do some digging around (A.K.A. online shopping) and found a similar look for much less!  Launch the video above to check it out!
