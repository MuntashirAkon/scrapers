Corey Feldman Proud of His ‘Playboy’ Wife/n
Starring in The Two Coreys, arguably one of the biggest reality television trainwrecks at the moment (and the competition is fierce), Corey Feldman gives his wife Susie Feldman’s Playboy photo spread a thumbs-up.
Susie was set to be the cover choice for this month’s Playboy. Then youthful tennis star Ashley Harkleroad agreed to pose for the mag, and Feldman got bumped.
Here’s a clip from The Two Coreys featuring Susie doing her pin-up model thing:





After Susie’s breast-augmentation surgery, Corey was “both pleased and intimidated,” according to the National Enquirer.
As a result, Feldman scheduled an appointment for liposuction. His rep confirmed, “Corey had a couple little trouble spots that he needed taking care of—so he did. And he feels a lot better now because of it.”
