Susie Essman: I Want to Be Reincarnated – as a Dog/n
Comedienne Susie Essman may have played a cat in Disney s Bolt, but her heart is going to the dogs.  
“Dogs, I think, are the greatest creatures in the entire world,” says the Curb Your Enthusiasm star. “The only bad thing about dogs is that they have a short life span.”  


Regardless, Essman believes that dogs make the most of their time on earth, and she d be happy to trade places with them.   
“As a matter of fact, if I were to be reincarnated, I’d want to be reincarnated as a shih tzu of a gay couple with no children,” she says. “I mean, how perfect would that be?”
