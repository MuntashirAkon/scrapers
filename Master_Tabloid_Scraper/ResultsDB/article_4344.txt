With the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards coming up on Sunday and the news about Total Request Live making a comeback in October, MTV has been on our minds quite a bit lately.In fact, we got to thinking about some of the things the network has gifted us throughout all these years: Real World, Cribs, Punk'd, Daria, Jackass, the craze behind famous family reality shows thanks to The Osbournes, the dramatization of being a teen mom thanks to 16 and Pregnant, Lauren Conrad and Kristin Cavallari thanks to Laguna Beach, Nicole "Snooki" Polizzi thanks to Jersey Shore, and SO. MUCH. MORE.However, one gift we may have forgotten about over the years was the massive hype that surrounded MTV's coolest job: video jockeys.

Being a VJ in the late '90s and early '00s automatically catapulted people to a celebrity level of fame. In fact, the role of a VJ became so popular and so sought after, there were even competition series to become one (remember Wanna Be a VJ?).Today, some of the people who started off as a VJ on MTV—like Carson Daly, La La Anthony, Tyrese and Vanessa Lachey—have become household names in the entertainment world. Thus, with TRL making its way back, we thought we'd take a walk down VJ memory lane and find out what they're all up to now...
