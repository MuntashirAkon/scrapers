"The Big Bang Theory family has lost a beloved member today with the passing of Carol Ann Susi, who hilariously and memorably voiced the role of Mrs. Wolowitz," Warner Bros. Television and Big Bang Theory executive producers Chuck Lorre, Steve Molaro and Bill Prady said in a joint statement following Susi's death. "Unseen by viewers, the Mrs. Wolowitz character became a bit of a mystery throughout the show's eight seasons. What was not a mystery, however, was Carol Ann's immense talent and comedic timing, which were on display during each unforgettable appearance. In addition to her talent, Carol Ann was a constant source of joy and kindness to all. Our thoughts and deepest condolences are with her family during this time, and we will miss her greatly."Susi's character was the mother to Simon Helberg's Howard Wolowitz. Her other TV credits include a memorable guest spot on Seinfeld, ER, Marriedâ€¦With Children and Grey's Anatomy. On the big screen she had roles in Death Becomes Her, Just Go With It and Cats & Dogs.No decision about what will happen to her character has been made.
