The Governator Chows Down/nGovernator Arnold Schwarzenegger and toothy first lady Maria hit up Hollywood hotspot Mr.Chow on Thursday night, along with a bunch of other struggling actors. Arnie had his usual smile, Maria -- not so much.  Also out on the town were starlets Angie Everhart, Selma Blair, foxy  "Full Houser " Lori Loughlin, Bai Ling, and racing vixen Devon Aoki. Also spotted: hunky Taye Diggs and Chris  "Mango " Kattan. Our man in Manhattan caught Tara Reid looking shocking -- shockingly demure, that is, at a party celebrating Reebok's 25th anniversary. She was joined at the bash by Britney's new confidante Brooke Shields, Cybill Shepherd, and we got a sweet shout-out from MTV's luminous Susie Castillo.All this and much more in this gubernatorial edition of Star Catcher!/n
