The New Elephant Man/nSportscaster and basketball great John Salley is teaming up with one of the biggest stars in Hollywood to help fight a deadly epidemic. His new co-star? A two ton elephant names Susie. In a new 30-second Public Service Announcement to air on VH1, John Salley and Susie build off of the old adage  "There's an elephant in the room, and no one's talking about it. " Salley walks through an office building with Susie, who wears a visitor name badge marked  "AIDS. " The voice-over reminds viewers that AIDS is still a global pandemic, and it's time to talk about it. The spot kicks the  "Hope Spreads Faster Than AIDS " campaign. The PSA was shot in Los Angeles in July and produced by VH1's creative team. VH1 will begin airing the spot this week./n
