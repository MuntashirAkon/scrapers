Ann Coulter & Good Times Star Jimmie Walker Are Dating â€” Check Out This Crazy Scoop!/n

HOLD THE PHONES.
Earlier this week, Norman Lear dropped a pretty big truth bomb about Ann Coulter. Sadly, it's not that she's a closeted liberal, but rather the longtime industry vet got candid about Miz Coulter's love life.

While chatting with black-ish creator Kenya Barris for the Untold Stories issue of Entertainment Weekly, the celebrated TV writer dished that his close friend Jimmie Walker has dated (or is currently dating) the conservative political commentator. Wait, WHAT???
The topic of Walker's personal life came up when Norman was discussing casting his pal as J.J. on Good Times. According to the 94-year-old, he knew the "role could make [Jimmie] a star." Shortly after this comment Norman casually dropped the Coulter news, as he stated: 

"I love him; he's a wonderful guy, but I'll tell you something about him that'll astound you: He dates Ann Coulter."
Obviously, Barris was in shock. We mean, we're in shock!
Lear went on to give deets about a dinner he and his wife had with the (unconfirmed) couple. The Maude creator defended that Ann is actually "a dreamy, delicious, sweet person." We'll believe that when hell freezes over.
Kenya even quipped:
"J.J. dates Ann Coulter! You couldn't write that! That's fantastic!"
LOLz!
Nonetheless, rumors about a relationship between Ann and Jimmie have circulated around Tinseltown for years. Back in 2013, the In Trump We Trust writer denied the romance gossip and said it was the 69-year-old who was "spreading that rumor." However, she did admit they are close friends. Huh.
What do YOU think?? Are Ann and Jimmie an item??
