The Simpsons Is Riding That Grease Train — Ew, That Sounds Gross — By Doing A LIVE TV Segment!/n

They sure are doubling down on this whole LIVE television thing!
After the success of Grease: Live last month, it shouldn't come as too much a shock that FOX is already planning their next live TV moment.
However, you may be surprised to know that it won't be another musical… it's going to be The Simpsons: Live!

That's right — for the first time in the show's 27 seasons, an upcoming episode of the animated classic will feature an entire segment with Homer riffing off whatever pops up in the news that day.
What makes this even more astounding is not only will Dan Castellaneta be doing the voicework live, they're going to have to animate on the fly as well — gotta love that performance capture technology.
Plus, they'll be doing unique versions for both the east coast and west coast broadcasts!
You won't want to miss this once-in-a-lifetime moment when The Simpsons airs Sunday, May 15 at 8 p.m. EST on FOX!
