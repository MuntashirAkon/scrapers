The future looks ruff for Johnny Depp as he faces repercussions of smuggling his dogs into Australia earlier this month.
The Pirates of the Caribbean star was called out by the Australian government when this photo of his Yorkshire Terriers was leaked on a gr0omer’s Facebook page.





 
Boo and Pistol were illegally flown into the country with Depp on his private jet to film the fifth Pirates installment without official certification and permits. The actor was given a two day ultimatum to return his pooches to the United States before being put down as punishment for breaking Australian quarantine laws.

Although his dogs returned to California with wife, Amber Heard, it is being reported that Depp could face up to 10 years in jail or a maximum fine of AU$340,000 (roughly USD$265,000). The pilot of Depp’s private jet could also face up to two years in the dog pound as an accomplice to the “very serious” crime.
