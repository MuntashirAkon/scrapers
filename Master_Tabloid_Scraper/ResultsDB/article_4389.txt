Shiver me timbers! Johnny Depp has less than 50 hours to get his Yorkshire terriers out of Australia before facing the threat of having them put down.

The Australian agriculture minister, Barnaby Joyce, claimed that Depp snuck his pooches into the country aboard a private jet to Brisbane for production on Pirates of the Caribbean 5.

Boo and Pistol are considered contraband in Australia without proper certification and permits. Joyce explains that the country’s tight biosecurity laws will not be overlooked for “sexy” celebs.
There is a process, you get the permits, they go into quarantine, then you can have them. If we start letting movie stars, even though they’ve been the sexiest man alive twice, to come into our nation, why don’t we just break the laws for everybody?
Depp’s canines were red-flagged by the government when an Australian groomer, Happy Dogz, posted this picture on their Facebook page with the caption, “It’s an honour to be grooming Johnny Depp and Amber Heard’s two Yorkshire Terriers”.





The agriculture minister closed his argument the matter with Kiwi slang, “It’s time that Pistol and Boo ‘buggered off’ back to the United States.”
