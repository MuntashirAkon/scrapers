Lena Dunham and Maude Apatow Dance Like No One’s Watching/n
Which is weird because, like, a lot of people watch Girls, which stars Lena Dunham and (possibly in the future) Maude Apatow. Also someone was clearly watching, hence the photo. That only makes their street dancing braver. Almost as brave as those of you who wrote today’s winning captions.
