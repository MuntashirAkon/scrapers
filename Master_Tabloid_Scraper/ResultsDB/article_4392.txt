The This Is 40 director just sealed the deal on a beachside bungalow in the prestigious Malibu Colony neighborhood, once owned by Pretty Woman producer Laura Ziskin, according to Trulia.
And the hefty price tag comes with some fancy features.

Apatow and his wife, actress Leslie Mann, can now call this oceanfront getaway their home away from home, with plenty of room for their two daughters, Iris and Maude, as it comes with 4 bedrooms, guest house, gourmet kitchen and even a sunroom to take in those California rays. And the two things money can’t by — expansive ocean views and their very own private beach.
