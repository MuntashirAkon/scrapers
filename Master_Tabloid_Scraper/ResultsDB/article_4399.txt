The teenager, who recently turned 17, attended the 2016 Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah with her dad. And this time, she was the star of the show.Maude stars in Other People, her first project Judd was uninvolved in making and her first drama film, which had its world premiere at the festival Thursday.

Other People was directed and written by Emmy-nominated Saturday Night Live writing supervisor Chris Kelly and also stars former SNL Molly Shannon, 51, Fargo and Breaking Bad actor Jesse Plemons, 27, The West Wing alum and Transparent star Bradley Whitford, 56, and Oscar nominee June Squibb, 86.Plemons plays David, a struggling comedy writer who recently broke up with his boyfriend and moves from New York City to his childhood home in Sacramento to care for his mother, played by Shannon, as she battles cancer. Maude plays one of his younger sisters, Alexandra. This marks the first time David has lived with his parents, including his conservative father, and siblings in a decade."Chris Kelly made a beautiful, funny, truthful movie," Judd said on Twitter.

The three also starred in This Is 40 and Funny People, which Judd also directed and wrote.

Maude also guest starred on three episodes of HBO's Girls, in which Judd serves as an executive producer.As her acting career blossoms, Maude, whose sense of humor rivals that of her parents, also plans to attend college.
