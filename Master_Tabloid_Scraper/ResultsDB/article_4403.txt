The British beauty has talked about the lengths she's gone to land a good part...even getting some permanent body art. In an interview with The Guardian, she described how she convinced director Steve McQueen to give her the part of Sissy in Shame by promising to get a seagull tattoo. "He said, 'You're a f--cking artist!' And I said, 'Yeah, I'm going to get a f--king tattoo'," she recalled.

Daisy has to kiss Gatsby, but you don't just kiss Leonardo DiCaprio. We were halfway through the scene and I was close to his face but had to ask the director if I should kiss him. He said yes, so I just did it and I got the job," she added. "That's how you get a job." If only all jobs were that simple.
