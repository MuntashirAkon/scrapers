Lucky Break For Bill? Cosby Accuser Misses Major Deadline In Case/n
Bill Cosby‘s mountain of legal issues may be getting smaller. RadarOnline.com has learned that one of his alleged victims has just missed a major deadline in her case against the TV star.
Kathrine Mae McKee, Sammy Davis Jr.‘s ex-wife, claimed in December 2014 that Cosby raped her back in 1974. Cosby’s attorney accused her of lying, and so she sued for defamation in December 2015.
According to court documents obtained by Radar, McKee had until March 21, 2016, to serve the summons and complaint on Cosby, 78. But on April 5, she filed documents stating that she did not make the deadline because she thought she “had one hundred and twenty days to serve” him, instead of the 90 that is normally allowed.

In addition, she claims the whole process was complicated because she couldn’t find Cosby’s address! McKee, who is serving as her own attorney in the case, claimed, “I made diligent efforts” to find Cosby’s address to serve him. “I researched various internet search engines, blogs, and news stories.”
She claimed she had the right address and sent the summons off, but she said “the US Postal Service failed to deliver my package” and it was marked “returned to the sender.”
McKee said she’s since contacted Cosby’s attorney to get the right address, but still needs additional time to send it off. She asked the court for 60 additional days, “which would extend the final date to serve [Cosby] to May 20, 2016.”
