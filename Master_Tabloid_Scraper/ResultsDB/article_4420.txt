'Vanderpump Rules' Kristen Doute Ditches Sur For Sketch Comedy/n
Kristen Doute may have been fired from Sur last season— but she’s back with two new gigs.
In addition to designing new fashion line James Mae, the Vanderpump Rules star is also a comedienne!
Doute and best friend Rachel O’Brien produced, directed and starred in a live sketch comedy show at the Parlour in Hollywood on August 11.

The Sur crew all supported the ladies offstage: Doute’s rumored ex James Kennedy, Scheana Schay, Jax Taylor and even alum Stassi Schroader stopped by.
“Everyone actually got along well,” an onlooker tells RadarOnline.com. “And Kristen was flirting with a hot new guy!” /n
