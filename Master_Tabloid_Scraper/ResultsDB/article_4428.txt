It was a glam to-the-max evening in New York City at Tiffany’s star-studded ball.

Kim Kardashian experienced another maternity fashion flop this week, wearing a sheer lace camisole that exposed her pregnant belly with blue jeans, while Jennifer Aniston was awkwardly attired in a Christian Dior bustier style short suit at the West Hollywood premiere of Call Me Crazy, also showing off her bizarre cupping marks.
