We haven’t been loving Kim Kardashian’s  maternity a la mode as of late, but we have to hand it to the reality star – she glammed up gorgeously for the show! Flaunting her major baby bump in a black, sleeved dress, she completed the figure-flattering look with a gold tasseled necklace and black heels.
Selena Gomez  looked sizzling hot in a super short, gold beaded Julien MacDonald mini dress, rocking a fierce, fishtail braid.
Zoe Saldana showed off her superior stems in a floral, slitty skirt from Givenchy’s latest collection, which she paired with a tight black top and sexy Jimmy Choos, while Chloe Grace Moretz looked super adorable in a Louis Vuitton denim dress.

Ke$ha definitely sported the most eccentric and bizarre ensembles of the evening, wearing sheer white floral pants, with what looked like a diaper underneath, with a floral top, a fringed thing around her shoulder and a black rimmed hat. She completed the look with jet black lipstick, taking it goth to the extreme.
There was plenty of wacky to be had, with Macklemore in funky blue Thrift Shop duds, Snoop Dogg wearing a red fur coat and an actress named Hana Mae Lee wearing a giant cigarette butt on her head. /n
