Amber Heard’s attorney Pierce O’Donnell filed new court documents last Friday (Dec. 30) condemning Johnny Depp in which Heard states, “I want my life back.”

Heard also claims that Depp and his lawyers “seem to wish to prolong this proceeding as a means of punishing me,” according to the documents that were obtained by Entertainment Tonight. Heard asks the court to deny Depp’s request for $100,000 in attorneys’ fees and says that she should be compensated $36,475 instead. “I want my life back,” she pleads. “I want to be divorced from Johnny now.”
Heard’s attorney added that the actress “wants the prompt dissolution of marriage” and states that Depp has “frustrated the final settlement of this matter at every turn through his relentless, mean-spirited campaign against Heard.”

Heard filed a Request for Order due to her loss of patience with the case. Depp filed a responsive declaration on Dec. 30, in which his lawyer accuse Heard of being “eager to invent reasons to extort funds from Johnny and/or prolong this litigation in order to remain in the public eye.”
A court hearing on the motion is scheduled for Friday, Jan. 13, at 8:30 a.m.
