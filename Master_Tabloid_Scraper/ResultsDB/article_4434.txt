Cersei Lannister may've gotten her revenge, but Olenna Tyrell got the last laugh.
While this week's episode of Game of Thrones, titled The Queen's Justice, might not have had an epic fight scene, there was plenty of blood shed. It's like the GoT creators are on a mission to kill off all of our favorite characters… but let's not get ahead of ourselves.

Sunday night's showing of the HBO drama picked up right where we left off with Jon Snow Dragonstone bound, Sansa Stark ruling Winterfell, Cersei sending Euron Greyjoy's armada to eliminate her enemies, etc. So, obviously, there was a lot to follow up with during The Queen's Justice. Let's not waste anymore time and jump right in… 
A Deathly Kiss

As promised, Euron returned to King's Landing with an epic gift for his (potential) fiancée, Queen Cersei. The gift in question was the woman responsible for her daughter Myrcella's death, the one and only Ellaria Sand. Greyjoy presented the villainous queen with his captives, which also included Ellaria's daughter Tyene Sand and his rebellious niece Yara Greyjoy. The queen was grateful AF for her present, but was still not willing to commit to getting engaged to Greyjoy — that probably has something to do with the fact that she's still screwing her brother.
Nonetheless, Cersei promised Euron that he'll have everything his heart desires once the war is won. She then spent a little one on one time with the Sands where she avenged her daughter's death by killing Tyene with the same poison used on the late princess. However, being monster she is, Cersei informed Ellaria that the poison is meant to bring about a slow death — meaning Ellaria will watch as her daughter rots away. Savage.
