Lorde is sorry.

The “Green Light” singer issued an apology to fans after comparing her friendship with an A-lister like Taylor Swift to an “autoimmune disease.”
While recently speaking with The Guardian, the 20-year-old shared the difficulties in being close with someone who is constantly in the spotlight. “It’s like having a friend with very specific allergies,” she said. “There are certain places you can’t go together. Certain things you can’t do. There are these different sets of considerations within the friendship. It’s like having a friend with an autoimmune disease.”
The comment quickly generated backlash amongst the fandom, especially given Selena Gomez — a notable member of Taylor’s squad — suffers from lupus.  One Twitter user wrote, “I wonder how @selenagomez feels about this. What an incredibly ignorant analogy to make @lorde.”

Lorde apologized for the remark on Monday night (June 19, 2017), explaining she didn’t mean to offend anyone who was suffering from an autoimmune disease.
“Didn’t mention taylor, but regardless, i f**ked up & that was really insensitive. i’m sorry,” the 20-year-old tweeted alongside an emoji of a rose.

Last year, Lorde gushed about Taylor, 20, when the “Bad Blood” songstress threw her a birthday party complete with a star-studded guest list comprised of Lena Dunham, Karlie Kloss, Aziz Ansari, and Mae Whitman.
“Had the best birthday party I’ve ever had tonight surrounded by my nyc family,” she shared on Instagram. “All organised by tay who is as she says ‘a mom with no kids’. I am ur kid and u love me so hard I could burst. Here’s to our 3 magic years of best friendship and more moments like this squished between angels.”
