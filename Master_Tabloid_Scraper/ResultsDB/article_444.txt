People have been skeptical of Blac Chyna and Rob Kardashian’s relationship ever since they took their romance public last year and now it seems Chyna is getting to prove some people right or incredibly wrong.

Just days after Chyna gifted Kardashian with a Range Rover and the couple flaunted some major PDA on SnapChat, Chyna took to Instagram yesterday (Dec. 15, 2016) to drop a major bombshell about their relationship. “I have some things I want to get off my chest about how I truly feel about Rob…,” the screengrab of a note read.

That was a day ago and Chyna has yet to elaborate on her declaration on any of her social media channels.
As fans patiently wait to see just what Chyna means, E! released a new sneak peek clip of the Rob & Chyna Baby Special. In the latest teaser, Chyna breaks down in tears after learning her c-section has been moved up and explains that she is inexplicably terrified of the procedure.
“For some reason, I’m so scared. I just cannot get this C-section off of my mind,” Chyna explains in a confessional. “I just want my baby to be healthy, have all her toes, be able to breathe on her own.”
Kardashian tries to comfort his fiancée, telling her how pretty she is, but it doesn’t stop Chyna from breaking down in tears just seconds later.
Launch the video up top to watch the entire clip.
Rob & Chyna Baby Special airs on E! Sunday, December 18, at 8 p.m. ET.
