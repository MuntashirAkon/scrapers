Forget Kidchella. North West kept things casual for her birthday this year.

The daughter of Kim Kardashian and Kanye West was surrounded by close friends and family when she celebrated her fourth birthday Thursday (June 15, 2017) at a Chuck E. Cheese’s in Los Angeles. Aside from her parents, the low-key guest list included aunts Khloé and Kourtney Kardashian and cousins Penelope Disick and Dream Kardashian.
In a photo shared on Snapchat, the tiny tot prepares to blow out the candles on a purple birthday cake topped with the kid-friendly restaurant’s mouse mascot.

Later that evening, the Kardashian clan enjoyed at yet another laid-back celebration at Ruby’s Diner. This time joined by Kris and Kylie Jenner, Nori was spotted wearing an Snoop Dogg dress and fur slides as she opened presents during the family-only dinner.
According to onlookers, she received a Minnie Mouse-themed bicycle as well as a large bundle of pink balloons. North was also seen playing with a party horn when she left the burger joint with her parents and her baby brother, Saint West.
Needless to say, Twitter’s heart completely melted over North’s very simple birthday.

North West really could have spent her bday anywhere and she chose Chuck E Cheese
