Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom are taking a breather after having dated for just over a year.

Perry and Bloom’s reps released identical statements explaining the couple’s unanimous decision to take a break.
“Before rumors or falsifications get out of hand, we can confirm that Orlando and Katy are taking respectful, loving space at this time,” says the couples’ statement to People.
Perry and Bloom were last spotted together at the Vanity Fair Oscars party on Sunday after spending significant time traveling on their own.

Before that, Bloom was in California attending the 2017 Film Independent Spirit Awards in Santa Monica after he had just completed a UNICEF mission  to Diffa. During this time, Perry has been promoting her new song “Chained to the Rhythm” in Los Angeles and at the BRIT Awards in the U.K.
