Scott Eastwood is currently in Sydney, Australia to shoot his next film, Pacific Rim: Maelstrom, but he already found time to pull on his swimming trunks and soak up the sun at the city’s popular Bondi Beach, where he happily showed off his abs and pecs.

The son of Hollywood royalty kept a low profile at the scenic destination. He and an unidentified friend wandered the beach and swam in the crystal-clear water, offering cameras and locals a glimpse of his muscly, picture-perfect physique.

Very little is known about the sequel, but it’s a safe bet that, like 2013’s Pacific Rim, Eastwood and co-star John Boyega will be piloting giant robots to do battle with a new swarm of Kaijus (huge gnarly creatures) from the depths of the Pacific.
Just yesterday Boyega revealed the follow-up’s title with an Instagram post:



First day on Pacific Rim today. Here’s to a great adventure ahead ✌🏿
