On Tuesday night’s episode of America’s Got Talent, the California native discussed all the challenges that come with growing up these days.   
“I know the day that I crossed over from kid to tween; I’m standing in front of a giant bouncy that made me want to party like I was 5,” she said. “Don’t get me wrong, I still love Disney songs – now I just want ’em sung by hot guys.”  
She added, “My point is, it’s tough being a tween. That’s why I started training. Apparently it’s so difficult to become a woman that you have to train to wear a bra, and if you don’t believe me, ask Caitlyn Jenner.”
“I think it’s great what she’s doing,” Hernandez said. “A dad that would go to that length to teach her daughters how to dress right.”  
After Hernandez first wowed America with her wit and charm, she told PEOPLE she’s already living out her dream that at the young age of 13.  
“When people ask you what you want to be when you grow up, I’ve always said I want to be an actor, I want to be a writer, I want to be a comedian,” she said. “I’ve always said all that crazy stuff, but I want to be happy. This is where I’m happy. I want to make people happy. It’s weird because when people ask me that now, I’m already doing what I want to do.”  
Just in case you missed it, Hernandez did make it to the next round of shows.   
America’s Got Talent airs on Tuesdays and Wednesdays (8 p.m. ET) on NBC.
