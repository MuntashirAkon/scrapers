  Bravermans stick together!  
Mae Whitman had the support of her fictional mother and uncle at the opening night of her play The Mystery of Love & Sex when Lauren Graham and Peter Krause stopped by the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles on Sunday.  
The mini Parenthood reunion prompted Whitman to declare herself “extremely lucky.”  
“We bravermans gotta stick together,” Whitman wrote on Instagram, alongside a photo with the real-life couple. She added, “#supportivefamily.” 
In The Mystery of Love & Sex, Whitman portrays Charlotte, a college student whose longtime friend turns into something more – despite their parents’ unexplained but mysterious objections.

Who Is Lauren Graham’s Favorite Parenthood Costar?

While the reunion was off-screen, some of Parenthood‘s stars have been pushing for a larger-scale Braverman get-together since the show ended in January 2015.  
Sarah Ramos and Miles Heizer told PEOPLE last summer that the cast would be thrilled to film a reunion special together.  
“I think 100 percent, everybody would,” Heizer said, with Ramos adding, “Honestly, who would not want to do that?”
