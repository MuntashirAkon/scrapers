Want a surefire way to get a standing ovation on America's Got Talent? Be a precocious 13-year-old and slay them all with a joke about Donald Trump. Lori Mae Hernandez brought her stand-up comedy act to the America's Got Talent stage and delighted the judges with her take on her babysitting qualifications."My only qualification to be a babysitter is that I used to be a baby," she said. "That's crazy. That's like saying, ‘Hey, you're sick a lot. Do you want to be my doctor?' Or, ‘Weren't you the host of a reality show? You want to be president of the United States?'"The judges, including Heidi Klum and Howie Mandel, and crowd gave her a standing ovation. Hernandez said she's been doing stand-up comedy since she was 10 years old as an effort to help her dad smile after he got Bell's palsy.She ended up receiving four yeses from the judges.
