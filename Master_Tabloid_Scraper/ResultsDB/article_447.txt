Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Richard Burdge Jr denied Brad Pitt’s request to seal court documents pertaining to his custody and divorce proceedings involving Angelina Jolie.

However, the judge did not rule out privatizing specific documents, including those that involve information about Pitt and Jolie’s children, according to the BBC. The former couple was not present for the hearing in which Pitt’s motion was denied.
“I am extremely concerned that if court records regarding custody are not sealed, information contained therein will cause irreparable damage to our children’s privacy rights,” Pitt wrote in a sworn declaration that was filed on Wednesday (Dec. 7, 2016).
Burdge first denied Pitt’s request for an emergency hearing on an expedited basis, which arrived after Jolie’s lawyers filed documents on Friday that laid out the temporary, voluntary custody agreement that Pitt and Jolie signed in October. This agreement granted Jolie physical custody of their children at a rented house in Malibu and allowed Pitt to visit under the supervision of a therapist.

On Dec. 1, 2016, Jolie’s attorney sent an email to Pitt’s legal team that proposed that they “participate in joint sessions with a trauma specialist so that they may learn how to best support and interact with their children.” A source told TMZ that their boys walked out on one session in the past and have refused to attend other therapy sessions.
