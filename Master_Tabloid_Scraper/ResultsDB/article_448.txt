Clara Bow's Watch Yields Confession/n
Call it a confession from beyond the grave, Hollywood style.          Our story begins unremarkably enough at a suburban Simi Valley,     California, garage sale. A bargain hunter combing through the boxes     picks up a watch and anklet--price: $26.          The two pieces of jewelry wind up in the hands of Sig Shonholtz, owner     of a watch shop in West Hollywood, for appraisal. Shonholtz flips over     the Cartier timepiece--designed for a purse--and finds the engraving:     "Clara Bow"; the anklet's     inscribed with the silent screen siren's initials on the front and     "Presented by Warren Burke" on the back.          Turns out both pieces were gifts to the early motion picture actress     from gentlemanly admirers. But that's not all.          Jammed inside the watch is a tiny fragment of paper. Shonholtz manages     to unfold the aged note, but finds the text is nearly illegible. Using     special magnification equipment, he decodes the musty missive--and     discovers a confession to a 70-year-old crime:               Daniel Freeman [gave this watch] to Clara Bow on her 22 Birthday 29th of     July 1928 and I take it as a souvenir from her on Feb. 10, 1929...On the     13th day of February I left 512 Bedford Dr., my little girl's home. God     likes her. She is a girl to feel loving for and she broke my heart the     little darling.          Never in your life I hope you feel as bad than I did when I was leaving     your house. Bye bye.               The note's signed by one N. Park.           Seems would-be paramour Park swiped the jewelry--gifts from rival     suitors--after Bow rejected his advances. He then penned his confession     and placed it in the watch's cavity--a mini time capsule of sorts     (pardon the pun).          Shonholtz says he's "thrilled" and "ecstatic" to have unearthed Park's     note, and solved a crime that Bow apparently never reported.          Pegged as the "It Girl" and known for her frequent portrayal of     floozies, Bow had many suitors along with the forsaken Park. She was the     top screen draw of the 1920s, starring in the first Oscar-winning film,     Wings, but saw her     career fade with the advent of "talkies."         Her Hollywood life was over by     the time she was 26. Her real life, checkered with financial, physical     and mental problems, ended in 1965.           The watch, as they say, keeps ticking.
