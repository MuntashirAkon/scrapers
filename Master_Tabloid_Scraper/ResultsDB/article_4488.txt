American Idol: Which Singers Were Called ‘Ridiculous’ & ‘Sickening?’/n
By Radar Staff
Jessica Sanchez has delivered a series of inspiring performances this year, but might have outdone herself Wednesday tacking Jennifer Holliday‘s And I’m Telling You I’m Not Going and Etta James‘s Steal Away.
Said judge Randy Jackson: “She’s 16 and singing Etta James … the blues is all about pain … your vocals are ridiculous!”
And Joshua Ledet continued his run of sensational outings, excelling on Josh Groban‘s You Raise Me Up and absolutely championing James Brown‘s It’s a Man’s Man’s Man’s World, which judge Jennifer Lopez called “sickening.”

“Neither man nor woman has sang that good or with more compassion on this show ever,” judge Steven Tyler said. “I can go home right now! I’ve never heard anything like that in my life!”Randy called Ledet’s “one of the best performances in the history of any singing show — including ours — any show!”
Phillip Phillips held his own performing Creedence Clearwater Revival’s Have You Ever Seen the Rain and Damien Rice‘s Volcano.

“I’d never heard you sing like that before,” Tyler told him in regards to the latter. “That was beautiful!”
Hollie Cavanagh stumbled some singing Journey’s Faithfully and Bonnie Raitt’s I Can’t Make You Love Me, as the judges said her performance lacked spark and was unsuited to her singing style.
Someone’s getting eliminated when American Idol‘s 11th season continues Thursday at 8/7c on Fox.
