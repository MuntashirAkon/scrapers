The self-described FFP (former fat person) brought up Christina as part of her DO’s and DON’Ts of Body Confidence feature.  
“Sometimes it’s other people’s voices you have to shut out. That’s what happened with me and Christina Aguilera, which people don’t understand. She called me fat for years,” Kelly explains.

“One night on Fashion Police I said, ‘F—k you. Now you’re fat too.’ I didn’t say I wasn’t fat. I said, ‘Now you know how it feels.’ And I’m sorry, but I stand by that. I make a point on the show never to say anything about anybody that I wouldn’t say directly to their face. I’m famous, and she’s famous; it doesn’t mean I can’t stand up for myself.”
“I took it for 10 years and finally decided to be like, ‘You know what? I’m done.’ And that’s the last thing I will ever say about it.”

“Even now I don’t consider myself skinny,” Kelly also admits in the article.  “But I have put a lot of hard work into my body over the years, and in the process, I’ve really learned to love myself.”
