Fergie Drops TWO New Singles With Nicki Minaj & Rick Ross — And You Already Know Which One We Love More!/n

Pop overload!!!!
With the highly anticipated but kind of underwhelming return of Taylor Swift (and Demi Lovato, in case you blinked and missed it), it's been a busy week in the world of pop music.
As if that wasn't already enough, we were also blessed with new music from Fergie!
A month before her second L.P. Double Dutchess drops, the songstress released two new collaborations with Rick Ross and Nicki Minaj — and we're loving one WAY more than the other!

Tbh, we could live without Fergie's hip-hop heavy single Hungry — the music video is just as forgettable — as it only reminds us that Fergie-ferg is best served pop.
That realization made listening to the songstress' upbeat, horn-filled track with Nicki that much more of a treat — You Already Know it's gonna be a hit!
Which song do you like more? Take a listen to You Already Know (above) and Hungry (below)!
