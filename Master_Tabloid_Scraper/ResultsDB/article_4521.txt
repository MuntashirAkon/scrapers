Fans of the late R&B legend Etta James will have a chance to say their last goodbyes.A public viewing for the iconic songstress, who died last week at 73 from complications from leukemia, will be held this Friday at Inglewood Cemetery Mortuary in L.A. It'll take place from 5 to 10 p.m. at the mortuary's Manchester Chapel.A private memorial is scheduled for Saturday in Gardena, Calif., and the Rev. Al Sharpton is expected to deliver the eulogy.Who else is scheduled to attend?

According to reports, the funeral will include  celebrity performances, but the lineup is currently being kept under wraps.Although the funeral will be a private affair, the public is invited to the viewing on Friday. The chapel itself can seat up to 200 people, but Nancy Ellington, a receptionist at Inglewood Cemetery Mortuary, tells E! News that the number of attendees they're expecting is "undetermined" at the moment."We're just going to do our best to accommodate everyone who comes in for her viewing," she says. "Huge is putting it mildly."The outpouring of love for the late "At Last" songbird has been massive. Adele wrote on her website yesterday, "What a lady Etta James was. She was the ultimate original. Her voice was  breathtaking and her songs are reflections we all recognise in some  way or another." Beyoncé (who memorably sang her own version of "At Last" at President Obama's inauguration) also gave props to the icon on her blog, while Kelly Clarkson paid tribute to James during her recent New York show.Judging from all that affection, Manchester Chapel better brace for a massive turnout on Friday.
