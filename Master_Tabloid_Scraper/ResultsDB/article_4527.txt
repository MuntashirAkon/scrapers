Etta James has once again proved herself a fighter.The "At Last" singer was sent home Thursday afternoon after spending two weeks in a Los Angeles-area hospital, where she spent the majority of the time breathing with the help of a respirator.When she first entered the hospital, shortly before Christmas, those close to her worried that she would never leave. But friend and manager Lupe de Leon said that James' blood pressure stabilized and her breathing improved last week, allowing for her release today.

The six-time Grammy winner, who is suffering from terminal leukemia and dementia, has been receiving care at her Riverside County home for some time.De Leon says that James is back home now with her husband of 41 years, Artis Mills, and other family members. She and Mills have two sons together, both of them musicians who have performed with their legendary mom.
