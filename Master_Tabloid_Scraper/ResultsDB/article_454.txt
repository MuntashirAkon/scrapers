For more than 20 years, Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith have kept the spark alive in more ways than one.Sure, there are those hot and heavy smooches on red carpets. And sometimes these two can't help but display some PDA at award shows.But even as their love story plays out in the public eye, the pair has kept fans gasping, laughing and cheering them on thanks to their honest—and sometimes outrageous—quotes about love and marriage.Thursday night was no different when Jada appeared on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen.When asked by a caller to share the wildest rumor she's heard about her family, the actress didn't hold back.

"The craziest rumor? That Will and I are swingers," she shared on the Bravo show. "I'm like, 'Yo, I wish! I wish.'"Jada added, "I really think that Will and I just have amazing chemistry on a lot of different levels. We love to laugh together. We love to learn together and we just love each other. We just have a good time together. I guess that's the secret. We just really like each other."Before we get our tickets to Jada's new movie titled Girls Trip, we decided to take a look back at some of the wildest quotes both she and Will have shared about each other.

After 23 years together and two talented kids together, we'd say these two are more than just couple's goals.Keep it real, Jada and Will. We love you for it.

Watch What Happens Live airs Sunday-Thursdays at 11 p.m. only on Bravo.(E! and Bravo are part of the NBCUniversal family)
