Beyonce's Keepin' It Real ... Expensive/nSo much for doing it for the fans. Tickets for Beyonce's four night  "intimate " appearance at the Wynn Hotel in Las Vegas are going fast -- but only to rich people. Fans have to buy their tickets along with a two night stay in the hotel -- packages range from $450 and $850 per person -- and that's just for starters.If that's too rich for your blood and you want to skip the hotel, a limited number of tickets are selling for $250, $500, $750, and $1000 (again, per person).Â Our source at the Wynn tells us that ticket-only seating cannot exceed 1% of total ticket sales. That means in the 1500-seat Encore theater, only 10-15 tickets will be available without hotel fees.FYI ... the world record for the number of people stuffed into a phone booth is 22.
