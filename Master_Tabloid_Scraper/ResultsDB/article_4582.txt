Rape Center Tells Kristen Stewart: 'Poor Choice of Words'/n
Rape crisis groups are not happy with Kristen Stewart‘s bizarre comment that being famous is almost like being “raped.”  
“What you don’t see are the cameras shoved in my face and the bizarre intrusive questions being asked, or the people falling over themselves, screaming and taunting to get a reaction,” the Twilight starlet told the latest issue of Britain’s Elle Magazine.

“The photos are so … I feel like I’m looking at someone being raped.”
Not surprisingly, the analogy has drawn stiff criticism from rape support groups around the globe.
“Clearly that kind of violation is not the same as rape… it’s just not the same,” said Harriet Lessel, the executive director of the New York City Alliance Against Sexual Assault.

“I understand that Kristen Stewart was expressing that she feels violated. 
“Sure violation is a form of sexual assault, but it’s the most serious and the most personal. It’s clearly a poor choice of words.”
Stewart also used the interview to admit it is “annoying” when she is relentlessly asked if she and Twilight co-star Robert Pattinson are an item.

The 20-year-old said: “What I say is, that, why would I want anything that’s private to become entertainment for other people? … People say that if I just tell them everything I’ll be left alone, but God, you think if I tell people they’ll leave me alone? They pick up every little scrap, and that’s much worse.” /n
