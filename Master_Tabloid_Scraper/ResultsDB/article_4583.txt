VIDEO: Wanda Sykes Slams NBC For Black History Month Menu/n
The new year hasn’t been kind to NBC: After it came under fire for the shakeup of The Tonight Show in January, comic Wanda Sykes, appearing on The Jay Leno Show Thursday, took the Peacock Network to task for its culinary celebration of Black History Month, which kicked off this week. 
Sykes told Leno she was dismayed by the menu the network is serving in their Burbank, California cafeteria to commemorate the occasion: fried chicken, collard greens, cornbread and black-eyed peas.

“That’s how they celebrate!” Sykes said. “Oh no, no, y’all don’t need to know about Harriet Tubman or Frederick Douglass — here’s some fried chicken!  I’m
scared to know what they are having for dessert.  I hope they at least took it off the rind!  Watermelon!”

“Jay, what is happening at NBC?” Sykes said. “Is the whole damn network on medical marijuana? What the hell is going on over here?”

When Jay tried to change the subject, Sykes would not let go of the subject, “I want to talk about crazy a** NBC”  and continued her tirade on NBC for the Leno/Conan late night debacle.  While she stated she was not taking sides, she did welcome Jay back to the Tonight Show.
