Out And About: Star Sightings/n
    JLo & Marc are back in LA. They don’t look too happy here! 
Don’t despair that you’re sitting behind your desk pretending to work while watching the clock. The important thing is that celebrities are out having a great time! C’mon live vicariously. We’ll help by telling you where everyone is.
Luke Wilson is in Hawaii playing golf in a tournament. (That’s right, Luke Wilson, not Owen, gets to go to Hawaii, while you don’t.)
Anthony Anderson from Law & Order is also there. Will Smith is in Germany while Steve Martin and Martin Short are swimming in St. Barts (as we showed you yesterday). David Letterman was at the Rangers game in New York.
Jessica Simpson and Tony Romo arrived together in LA and Jlo and Marc Anthony are back in LA as reports continue to circulate that their marriage is not exactly Ozzie & Harriet. More reports are out this week about the couple fighting, including one accompanying this photo of the cover of the new issue of the National Enquirer. Is Marc wagging his finger in Jlo’s face? Woo, he really is a brave guy! We know women – lots of women – that would cause you to lose a finger if you did that. /n
