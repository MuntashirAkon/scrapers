Harriet Tubman is set to replace Andrew Jackson as the face of the $20 bill, and celebs could not be more thrilled.
She will be the first African-American woman to appear on U.S. currency. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew had initially announced plans to put a historical woman on the face of the $10 bill, but instead he has decided against.
“The decision to put Harriet Tubman on the new $20 was driven by thousands of responses we received from Americans young and old,” Lew wrote in a statement (via EW). “I have been particularly struck by the many comments and reactions from children for whom Harriet Tubman is not just a historical figure, but a role model for leadership and participation in our democracy.  You shared your thoughts about her life and her works and how they changed our nation and represented our most cherished values.”
