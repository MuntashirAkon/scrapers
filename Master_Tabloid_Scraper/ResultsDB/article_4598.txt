Although she might be catching your eye for taking home an historic Emmy on Sunday night, Viola Davis has been escalating in the acting world for quite some time.

You probably know her as Annalise from the ABC drama How To Get Away With Murder, but Viola is no stranger to the game. After graduating from Juilliard in 1993 she won an Obie Award for her role as Ruby McCollum in Everybody’s Ruby. She has two Tony Awards and a SAG to her name. She’s also been nominated for various Golden Globes and Academy Awards, which makes for quite the resume!
One of her most empowering roles was perhaps as Abileen Clark in the 2011 film, The Help. She captivated audiences all over the world in sharing the true story of the African American maids point of view in the 1960s civil rights movement. Six years prior, Viola had a small role in 2005’s 50 Cent biopic, Get Rich or Die Tryin’. For this week’s Throwback Thursday, we’re going back to the night the film held its L.A. premiere, complete with questionable bangs and Viola’s signature smile.
