Viola Davis made history over the weekend.
The actress took home an Emmy for her role as Annalise Keating on How to Get Away with Murder, marking the first time in the Emmys’ 67-year history that the award for Best Actress in a Drama went to a black woman.
So, for that reason and more, she’s Celebuzz’s Woman Crush Wednesday this week. But, not only did she win an Emmy, Davis gave an acceptance speech that will have people talking for a very long time. She started her speech by paraphrasing something Harriet Tubman said in the 1800s:
In my mind, I see a line. And over that line, I see green fields and lovely flowers and beautiful white women with their arms stretched out to me, over that line. But I can’t seem to get there no how. I can’t seem to get over that line.

This isn’t even the first time Davis has delivered such an inspirational speech. However, when the 50-year-old isn’t absolutely slaying all of her interviews and speeches, she busy being a mom to her daughter, Genesis Tennon.
On Tuesday (Sept. 22, 2015), Genesis logged into her mom’s account and posed a sweet video congratulating Davis. “I love you mommy and I hope you win another Emmy,” she can be heard saying. “You’re my favorite girl and I love you.”
