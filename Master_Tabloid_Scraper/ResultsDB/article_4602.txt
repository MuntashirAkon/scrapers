As Americans, we are granted three basic rights: Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of paying for groceries with currency that features Joan Rivers on its face.

The U.S. Treasury announced that Alexander Hamilton will be replaced by a woman on the $10 bill by the year 2020. The deliberately chosen year marks the 100th anniversary since women were given the right to vote.
Treasury Secretary Jack Lew expressed that the focus of this shift will be placed on democracy. The public will be able to decide on which prolific female will earn the coveted spot by voting on the New 10 website or using the hashtag #theNew10 on Twitter.
This change comes pushed after an unofficial “Women on 20’s” campaign came to the attention of President Obama where more than 100,000 people voted to see Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill instead of Andrew Jackson.
The Treasury attributes the seeming downgrade from the $20 bill to the $10 bill to a much-needed redesign.
“While many factors are taken into consideration, the primary reason for redesigning currency is to address current and potential counterfeiting threats. In addition to featuring a woman, the new $10 note will include a tactile feature that increases accessibility for the visually impaired.”
