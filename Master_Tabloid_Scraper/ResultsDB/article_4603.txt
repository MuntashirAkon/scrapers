There has been a lot of casting shakeups for the daytime talk show over the last couple years. This year, the show lost Rosie O’Donnell. In 2014, Barbara Walters parted from the cast, and in 2013 both Elizabeth Hasselbeck and Joy Behar bid their adieus.
However, it looks like things could be taking a turn for the better. Veteran co-host Whoopi Goldberg announced during Thursday’s show that Raven-Symoné and comedienne Michelle Collins might become permanent co-hosts.

“We love saying it, but Raven and Michelle will be back tomorrow,” Goldberg said. “We’re trying to make it permanent, so write in to everybody.”
The two ladies could join the other newcomers: actress Rosie Perez and Republican campaign activist and commentator Nicolle Wallace who both joined the series last fall.
Raven-Symoné consideration for the position makes sense considering who continuous appearances on the show as well as her outspoken, often controversial demeanor.
Earlier this month, the 29-year-old stirred up criticism when she told The View’s audience she did not like the idea of Harriet Tubman on the face of the $20 bill.
