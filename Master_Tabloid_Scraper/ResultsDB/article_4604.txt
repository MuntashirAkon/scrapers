Raven-Symoné says she would have chosen Rosa Parks instead of Harriet Tubman. 
Although Tubman was the people’s first choice — based on the results of Women on 20s’ unofficial online poll — when asked what female should be on the the $20 bill, the former Disney star disagrees.
While guest-hosting Wednesday’s (May 13, 2015) episode of The View, Symoné said she’d prefer someone “closer to the progression that we’re doing now.”

No offense to everyone that’s going to be mad at me for saying this, I don’t like that idea. I don’t like it. I think we need to move a little bit forward. Let me just preface that I understand the history, I get it, trust me, I was taught, I’m in that culture. I would have chosen someone that is closer to the progression that we’re doing now. And I know you have to understand history so that you don’t repeat it, but that doesn’t really happen in our world, because we still repeat history of hating other cultures over and over again. So I would choose a different one, no offense.
The 29-year-old has once again found herself at the center of a controversy. Her comments from the show are even receiving some backlash on Twitter.

Raven Symoné needs to be as silent as the fake accent mark she added onto her name.

I’m not sure what Raven Symone is trying to say. Harriet Tubman guided 300 slaves to freedom. How is that not a history that evokes pride? — Charles Clymer (@cmclymer) May 14, 2015



Raven Symone should just stop talking.
