Your Daily #CaptionContest Winners Are…/n
I mean, look, we all strive for things, right? We strive to be better at our jobs, better to our friends, and better spenders of our own money. And some of us, those of us who are Justin Bieber, simply strive for a better look, one that says “Santa Claus meets Rugrats.” And we refuse to judge him, because humanity is a diverse rainbow.
Right. Anyway. I have to say, the results of this Facebook #CaptionContest are, perhaps, my favorite #CaptionContest results ever. You guys are funny! This picture is funny! Everything is funny!
Without further delay, the winners:
