Women Who Fit the Bill: The Most Likely Female Candidates for the New $10 Note/n
A woman will grace the redesigned $10 bill in 2020, U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew announced on Wednesday.   
The decision on which woman will break the “paper ceiling” won’t be made for several months, and Lew will make the final call – but he wants the public to weigh in via a planned website and on social media with the hashtag #TheNew10,  CNN Money reports.   
Many people on Twitter have responded to the call, throwing out names including Harriet Tubman, Eleanor Roosevelt, Rosa Parks, Sojourner Truth, Wilma Mankiller and more. Here are some of the Tweets:

The woman who fits the bill must, by law, be no longer living, and she should represent the theme of American democracy.  
Alexander Hamilton, the nation’s first treasury secretary, has been on the $10 bill since 1929, after replacing President Andrew Jackson. The last woman to be featured on U.S. paper currency was Martha Washington, who was on the $1 Silver Certificate between 1891 and 1896.

The female financial takeover may not stop with the $10 bill. After an online campaign to feature a woman on the $20 went viral a few months ago, lawmakers in the House and Senate introduced legislation to make that hope a reality, according to Business Insider.

Earlier this year, the nonprofit group that launched the campaign, Women on 20s, released a nationwide online survey asking people to vote on which woman should take Jackson’s face on the $20. More than 600,000 people voted, and Tubman was announced the winner in March, with Roosevelt coming in a close second. Parks and Mankiller also earned high rankings. Other contenders included Susan B. Anthony, Clara Barton, Betty Friedan and Elizabeth Cady Stanton.
