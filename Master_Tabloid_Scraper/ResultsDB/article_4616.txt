92-Year-Old Harriette Thompson Becomes Oldest Woman Ever to Finish a Marathon/n
Harriette Thompson has done it again! The 92-year-old cancer survivor just ran her 16th marathon and broke another record.  
Thompson, of Charlotte North Carolina, completed the Rock ‘n’ Roll Marathon in San Diego on Sunday, making her the oldest woman to finish the 26.2-mile race, NBC Washington reported. (She snagged the title from Gladys Burrill, who was a younger 92 when she completed the Honolulu Marathon in 2011.)  
“I’m amazed that [people are] interested,” Thompson, who is a two-time cancer survivor, told reporters after her race. “I just feel I don’t deserve this, but I’m enjoying it.”  
According to Runner’s World, she crossed the finish line with a time of 7 hours, 24 minutes and 36 seconds – and lots of supportive cheers from a crowd of race-watchers.   
“Every year I write to my friends and say, this is my last year,” she said. “And then I do another one.”  
Thompson told the press that she ran it for her son, a captain in the Navy who was recently diagnosed with cancer. She also explained that she trained beforehand, while keeping in mind, “If I did it before, maybe I can do it again.”  
“I just don’t think of myself being that unusual. I have a lot of people saying what an inspiration I am. That’s nice to hear, good for something at this age,” she said, adding that she hopes she can continue running.  
Thompson has now run the San Diego race 16 times. Last year, at the age of 91, she set a record for a woman 90 or older when she finished in 7 hours, 7 minutes and 42 seconds. (She said the attention made her feel like a queen for a day!)

After her completion of the 2014 Rock ‘n’ Roll run, Thompson told Newswire that there is no age limit when it comes to physical activity.  
“You’re never too old to do it,” she said at the time. “I started my first marathon at 76.”
