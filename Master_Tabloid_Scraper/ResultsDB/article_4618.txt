Ozzie and Harriet Son David Nelson Dies/n
Even before Ozzie and Harriet ended its run on ABC in 1966 (it was in color by then!), David had started a solo acting career, appearing in the classic 1957 film Peyton Place, as well as B-movies like -30-, Day of the Outlaw and The Big Circus.In addition to the occasional TV and movie role, he also worked as a director and producer in the 1970s and 1980s.His final film role, meanwhile, might be the one he's most known for among non-Baby Boomers. In a nod to the 1950s prissiness that John Waters was spoofing, David and fellow cult figure Patty Hearst played Traci Lords' blissfully clueless parents in Cry-Baby.David is survived by his second wife, Yvonne, four sons, a daughter and seven grandchildren. Brother Ricky Nelson died in a plane crash in 1985. A funeral service is planned for Thursday in L.A.
