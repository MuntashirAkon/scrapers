Raven-Symoné Doesn't Want Harriet Tubman to Be the Woman on the $20 Bill: Find Out Why/n
She ran through some of the other options Women on 20s provided as ideal candidates, including Eleanor Roosevelt, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Patsy Mink and Rosa Parks. "Me personally, I would have chosen Rosa Parks," said Raven. "I would have chosen someone that is closer to the progression that we're doing now. And I know you have to understand history so that you don't repeat it, but that doesn't really happen in our world, because we still repeat history of hating other cultures over and over again. So I would choose a different one, no offense."

If you don't agree with Raven's opinion or the results of the aforementioned poll, don't fret:  Since its inception, the Women on 20s campaign has been determined to get one of 15 distinguished women to replace U.S. President Andrew Jackson on the $20 bill by 2020, the 100-year anniversary of the passage of the Constitutional amendment granting women the legal right to vote. As the campaign's mission statement notes, "the process of commissioning, designing and minting a new bill takes years," so they're trying to generate "an overwhelming people's mandate for a new $20 bill" now.So regardless of which woman you wanted to see win this unofficial vote, at least we can all agree it's started a conversation!
