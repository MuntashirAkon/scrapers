You certainly all remember Harriet Talons, right? Our Blind Vice maven was just inducted into monikered infamy and is already back for another round of d-r-a-m-a. Would you expect anything less from someone wanted killed off her own show?Well, apparently, horrible Harriet isn't as confident in her job security as we think she should be, because the boob-tube broad has been secretly trying to book another gig...ya know, just in case!

READ: The Hunt for Harriet Talons: Is a Mad Men Vixen in Danger?

Apparently Harriet is supremely nervous about her futureâ€”or so say people within her camp.While we already told you Ms. Talons probably won't be canned from her juicy hit series anytime soon (or ever), she has caught whiff of the hostility directed her way and is worried that sooner or later her attitude may lead to her demise.

Hey, we're just shocked she had enough self-awareness to realize everyone thought her stuff actually did stink.But instead of, we don't know, simply being nicer to her costars and hard-working crew, or being less of a diva at the office (that would make far too much sense), H.T. has been aggressively pushing her agents to find other work.That way she'll stay one step ahead of any potential firing. We told you she was a crafty devil, didn't we?Here's the thing: She can't find any jobs!You might think producers would be eager beavers to book the seemingly so talented Harriet for their gig, but her pushy reputation precedes her. And no one wants to have Harriet's talons unleashed on their set, heaven forbid!But really, can you blame them?!AND IT AIN'T: Naya Rivera, Eva Longoria, Kristin Bauer
