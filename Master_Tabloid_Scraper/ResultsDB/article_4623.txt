Then comes baby in a baby carriage?!Grey's Anatomy fans, don't put away the baby clothes just yet because it seems like another couple may be expecting a bundle of joy soon. Warning, spoilers ahead!In an emotional moment in tonight's episode, Owen (Kevin McKidd) and Amelia (Caterina Scorsone) both opened up about traumatic experiences from their past, and Amelia expressed concern that it could impact their children. By the end of the intimate scene, filmed in "one shot" (per Shonda Rhimes' tweet), it was clear they were going to start trying to have a baby. Like right now. "Let's not wait," Owen tells his wife.And based on the promo, it seems like the couple may not have to wait long, as Meredith (Ellen Pompeo) congratulates Amelia on her pregnancy. Except there's one problem: She hasn't exactly taken a test yet. 

"I'm never late," Amelia tells Mer in the promo. "Never." Meredith, of course, has doubts. "I hugged you and you haven't even peed on a stick yet?" Note to selves: Ask questions first, hug later. In the Oct. 20th episode, Owen needs help from the other doctors when he's asked to babysit Harriet, April (Sarah Drew) and Jackson's (Jesse Williams) baby, for the day, while Amelia struggles to tell Owen something important. Hm...we wonder what it could possibly be.

In August, Scorsone announced she was expecting her second child with husband Rob Giles, so this could be Grey's Anatomy's way of handling her real-life pregnancy. However, in interview with Entertainment Weekly, Scorsone expressed doubt that they would write her pregnancy into the storyline, saying, "I think they don't want to burn through all that story."Grey's Anatomy airs Thursdays at 8 p.m. on ABC.
