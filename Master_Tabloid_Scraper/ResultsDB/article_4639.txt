Ne-Yo: 2 Homes Better Than 1 For My Mom/nSome people give Mom flowers and jewelry, but Ne-Yo gives homes. TMZ has learned the singer just handed over a $300k townhouse in Mableton, Georgia to his mother, Harriet Loraine Burts. It's not the first crib he's gifted to dear ole mom. She already has a $550k mansion in nearby Alpharetta ... which Ne-Yo bought in 2012.  The Mableton home is smaller -- only 3 bedrooms compared to 6 in the Alpharetta pad -- but it's closer to Atlanta.  Ne-Yo's becoming ATL's mini-Donald Trump, as real estate goes anyway -- he dropped $1 mil last year for a downtown ATL condo for his baby mama and 2 kids./n
