U.S. Treasurer Rosa Rios Goes Hollywood ... Silent On Future Obama Currency/nPresident Obama handpicked Rosa  "Rosie " Rios to be the 43rd Treasurer of the United States ... so you'd think she'd have a quick answer when asked if BO's got a shot at being on U.S. currency. We got the treasurer out at Craig's where she was Hollywood hobnobbing with legendary songwriter Diane Warren and 'Sopranos' star Lorraine Bracco. Rios was appropriately proud when we asked her about Harriet Tubman getting on the $20 bill -- she spearheaded that movement, after all. Our follow-up about our current prez possibly making it onto a bill ... didn't go over that smoothly.Â  Watch, it seems like she's trying to blow off the question. As for why she's hanging with celebs? Rosa's days in D.C. are likely just as numbered as her boss'./n
