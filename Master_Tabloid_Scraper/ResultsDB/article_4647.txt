The Dog, The Carrot & a Couple of Melons/nDuane  "The Dog " Chapman isn't letting his legal woes get in the way. Still out on bail, Dog was spotted partying like a rockstar in Las Vegas this weekend. Chapman and stacked wife Beth ate dinner at Stack in the Mirage -- next to Carrot Top, of all people, who now looks like a grownup musclebound Harriet from  "Small Wonder. " The unlikely threesome took in Jay Leno's standup act before hitting Vegas hotspot JET, where they were joined by pudgy party pal Andy Milonakis, who was working the door at the nightclub.  The table was served Skyy 90 Vodka and partied into the wee hours of the morning. We'd tell you the rest, but what happens in Vegas ... thankfully, stays there./n
