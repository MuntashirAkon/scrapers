Meanwhile, Robertson’s family members haven’t been shying away from their fair share of drama this year.
As Radar previously reported, the star’s mother Korie Robertson had been hiding a shocking medical secret until recently.

In a new advice book, the mom-of-five confessed that she had a hysterectomy, invasive surgery to remove a woman’s uterus and sometimes other reproductive organs, at just 41-years-old.
Already frustrated with her limited ability to move following the procedure, Robertson said she burst into tears when she realized her children— Rebecca, 27, John Luke, 20, aspiring fashion designer Sadie, 18, Will, 13, and Bella, 13— failed to help out around the house during her time of need.
