The incident involving the catwalk crawler, a passenger on the flight identifying herself as “Emily” told Daily Mail.com, erupted after the staff denied her alcohol.
“She called the pilot a ‘basic b****’ as police led her off the plane, she was a little drunk and had a disagreement with another passenger on the flight as she was refused alcohol,” a passenger told the outlet, “and then went to serve her own vodka from her cabin luggage.
“But she was not aggressive to anyone and was funny really … the easyJet crew was acting out of proportion.”
