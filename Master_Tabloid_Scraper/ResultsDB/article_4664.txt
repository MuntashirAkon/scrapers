Jude Law continues to be fruitful and multiply.
That was the official word from The Talented Mr. Ripley star’s camp Thursday, validating reports that the Alfie star is excepting a child with ex-lover Catherine Harding, a 23-year-old Irish singer-songwriter who uses the stage name “Cat Cavelli.”
The English actor’s rep told People Thursday, “I can confirm that Jude Law and Catherine Harding are expecting a child together in the spring,” adding that they “are no longer in a relationship” and “consider this a private matter.”

“They are both wholeheartedly committed to raising their child.”
A Harding source told the Daily Mirror the pair’s romance “all happened very quickly.
“They met a little while ago and fell for one another, then Cat told friends that she was going out to Prague, that’s when it emerged that she was in a relationship with Jude.”
The Cold Mountain star, 41, has three kids with ex-wife Sadie Frost (Rafferty, 18; Iris, 13; and Rudy, 12) and one with Samantha Burke (Sophia, 5), who he was also not involved with when the two became parents of the girl. /n
