Luke Bryan Thanks Fans For Support Following The Death Of His Baby Niece/n

Our thoughts and prayers are with Luke Bryan, whose infant niece passed away this week after battling undisclosed cardiac and health issues.
Sadie Brett was born over the summer to the country singer's wife Caroline's brother Bo Boyer and his wife, Ellen Boyer — who have been open about their daughter's ongoing battle on social media.

Most recently, Brett had contracted some sort of infection over the weekend, and the Crash My Party singer's rep confirmed on Tuesday to The Boot that the little angel had passed away.
Taking to Twitter the same day, Luke thanked his fans for all of their support during this difficult time: 

We thank all of you for your prayers. Love y'all.

We cannot imagine what they're going through. Sending all our love!
