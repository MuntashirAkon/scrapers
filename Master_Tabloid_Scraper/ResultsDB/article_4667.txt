Iris Law, daughter to Jude Law with ex-wife Sadie Frost, continues to come up in the industry and is the new star of the Burberry liquid lip campaign!
The teen joins older brother Rafferty Law in the modeling game, turning it into a real family business. We bet The Young Pope, AKA their dad, is really proud!
Speaking of her budding career, she said:
"I've been modeling for under a year, now. I was always intrigued by the process and in being involved either behind or in front of the camera, but I only recently started seriously thinking about it properly."
Awesome!
