In the surprising snap, the momma poses in front of a green screen as she flaunts soft waves and a new shade of brunette. From Chyna's nude pout to her perfectly manicured brows, we're totally getting Kim Kardashian West vibes here.
Not to mention the model's face appears pretty expressionless in the photo — nothing says Kim more than a dead in the eyes selfie!
Shortly after posting the pic, many fans took to B.C.'s comments section to point out the similarities between her and the Kardashian gals: 
"Halensadie: She looks like a Kardashian lol

itslisamercer: She starts to look like a kardashian 🙈👍🏼


jreggie9: Slowly but surely turning into one of the kardashians lolllll."


Yep! It's pretty clear how fans feel about this transformation!
On a kinda creepy side note, we can't help but wonder how Rob Kardashian feels about this makeover. We thought Ms. Chyna's appeal was that she WASN'T like his famous family….
Anyways, check out the baby bumpin' momma's Kardashian look-alike pics (below) and let us know what you think in the comments!
