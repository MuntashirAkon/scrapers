While dishing out advice to her younger self in the mag's September issue, the actress admitted that she should have thought before making such a long-lasting decision, saying:
"You're never going to be in the same place emotionally and mentally at 18 that you are at 20 or 25 or 30. Something that's meaningful to you when you're younger is not going to be meaningful to you five years later. Understand that tattoos are forever. I have a few tattoos. I'm not into them now the way that I was."
The momma-of-two also frowned upon some of the more temporary decisions she made when she was younger, like using a tanning bed: 
"I did it a little bit as a teenager and a young adult. I remember it was a trend, and we all used to do it. You put the sticker on to see how dark you got. I would go to my cousins' dances, like the Sadie Hawkins dance, and we would get a fake tan before. I would never do a tanning bed ever [now]."
The 35-year-old also admitted to plucking her eyebrows too much:
"I got really excited about hair removal when I started shaving. I plucked the crap out of my eyebrows. I wouldn't recommend [doing] that because it really is hard for your hair to grow back, if it ever does."
And while her hair grew back and her fake tan faded, Miz Alba still has those tattoos that she's no longer in love with.
She wouldn't be the first A-lister to regret her ink though! See them all (below)…
