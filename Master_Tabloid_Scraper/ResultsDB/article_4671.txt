You may recall her brother, Rafferty Law, has also dipped his toes into modeling, so sure, why not Iris too!
The young woman makes her debut with a spread in Teen Vogue, and talks about her mother's fashion influence:
"I like looking at pictures of my mom when she was around my age and seeing her makeup and little dresses. I was always really interested in what she was wearing growing up and did quite creative things with how I dressed myself."
