As we previously reported, newcomers Sadie Sink and Dacre Montgomery will also join the cast, and of course, the most of the regulars will be returning, including breakout stars Millie Bobby Brown, Finn Wolfhard, Gaten Matarazzo and Caleb McLaughlin.
“There’s definitely a handful of really compelling new characters this season, but absolutely servicing the core group first and foremost,” executive producer Shawn Levy told THR. “Like the show itself, it’s multi-generational new characters and really, really intriguing ones.”
