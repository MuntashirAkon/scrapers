Here is THR’s official description of the new character:
Sink will play Max, a tough and confident girl whose appearance, behavior and pursuits seem more typical of boys than of girls in this era. She has a complicated history and is generally suspicious of those around her.
Montgomery will play Billy, Max’s hyper-confident and edgy older step-brother. He steals girlfriends away from their boyfriends, is great at drinking games and drives a black Camaro. But lurking under his apparent charisma, is a violent and unpredictable nature.
Breakout stars Joe Keery (Steve Harrington) and Noah Schnapp (Will Byers) have also been promoted to regular series players.
