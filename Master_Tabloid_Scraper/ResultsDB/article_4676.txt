Holy man cleavage.
Jude Law shows off his tanned chest (+ chest hair), proving that there can be something very sexy about your regular old brown long-sleeved v-neck shirt.

Law strutted about Rome, Italy with his 29-year-old lady friend Phillipa Coan, together making quite an attractive pair of tourists just, you know, walking around, holding hands, eating delicious food, drinking fine wine, and sightseeing all that the beautiful city has to offer.

The 42-year-old actor is currently in the Eternal City filming The Young Pope, an HBO mini-series also starring Diane Keaton. Luckily, it looks like he’s getting plenty of spare time to spend with his new love.
Daily Mail reports that Law is very taken by Coan. Sources say,
Even though it’s early days, Jude has already introduced Phillipa to the family, and even Sadie. He’s serious about her. He loves how intelligent Pippa is and finds it refreshing to date a girl who is not from his showbiz world. He’s pretty smitten and doesn’t want to mess it up.
You may remember that Law welcomed his fifth child into the world 5 months ago with former girlfriend, 23-year-old Catherine Harding. Law also has three children with his ex-wife Sadie Frost (18-year-old son and model Rafferty, 14-year-old Iris and 12-year-old Rudy) and one child, 5-year-old Sophia, with model Samantha Burke.
