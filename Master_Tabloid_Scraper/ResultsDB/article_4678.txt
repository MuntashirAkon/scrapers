Miley Cyrus misses her beloved blowfish Pablow — so much so that she wrote him a song. 
On Monday (May 18, 2015), Cyrus posted a video where she shared her track written in honor of her late pet. In a unicorn onesie, the 22-year-old sat solemnly at a keyboard for the song, which is part of her Backyard Sessions. She can barely get through the song before breaking down into tears. Actual tears.

“Some of you may remember a few months ago my dear blow fish Pablow past away,” she wrote on her Facebook page. “I wrote this song for him…He made me so happy and I miss him everyday…. But now he is with Floyd and Melanie’s sweet Sadie”
While the singer’s voice sounds beautiful in the clip, the lyrics are pretty insane.
On Saturday night we all went out to eat
But I can never decide so someone chose sushi
I got soup and I ordered rice
But watching my friends eat my friend ruined my appetite
Oh Pablow the Blowfish if they only knew you like I do they’d love you too
And Pablow the Blowfish I miss you so bad
I won’t forget even one second we had
Cause you might be gone but you could never be dead



I hate goodbyes
