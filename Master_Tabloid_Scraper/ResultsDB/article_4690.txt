All season-long, we've been bringing you exclusive first looks at Sadie's costumes, which must always get the seal of approval from the teen's father, Willie Robertson. So far, he's yet to veto any of her daring looks, including one of her dresses for tonight's show!We have your exclusive first look at the costume Sadie will be rocking tonight, which is modest teal number featuring black lace. It's sophisticated and very age-appropriate, no?  And it also happens to be perfect for the style of dance Sadie will be tackling while wearing it.

For the night's "Pluggled/Unplugged" theme, Sadie and Mark will be dancing the Argentine Tango to Ariana Grande's hit song "Problem," which will be performed by Noah Guthrie.This dude @only1noah and I got something special ready for ya'll Monday night," Mark tweeted, along with a photo.Sadie and Mark will also be performing another routine, a quickstep, during the semi-finals, which may find Alfonso Ribeiro pulling out of the competition after suffering a serious injury. I'm working really hard to be able to dance Monday," he tweeted. "Keep the prayers coming. Love you all."The other remaining couples competing on Dancing With the Stars include Pretty Little Liars' Janel Parrish and Val Chmerkovskiy, Tommy Chong and Peta Murgatroyd and YouTube star Bethany Mota and Derek Hough.DWTS airs tonight at 8 p.m. on ABC.
