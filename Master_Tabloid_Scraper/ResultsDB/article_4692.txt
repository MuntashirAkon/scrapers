However, Sadie isn't the first Duck Dynasty cast member Liam has come across: After Phil Robertson's controversial GQ interview, in which he equated homosexuality to bestiality, made headlines, Liam, a big fan of the A&E reality show, tweeted his support to Sadie's father, Willie Robertson. "Huge love to you/your family huge respect for your business prosperities and the family values you still all behold. big fan," he tweeted to Willie. After receiving some backlash, he clarified his comment, tweeting, "Being a fan of someones show and the way they still hold a family together doesnt mean i am ok with all they say."Liam also spent time with Willie and Sadie's Uncle Si back in September, shooting clay pigeons with them when One Direction was on their world tour. Sadie was not around when Liam visited, filming for DWTS, so when he was rehearsing for the 2014 AMAs and filming at the studio next door, he decided to pop in and surprise Sadie. Yep, seems like Liam is officially a member of the Quack Pack!DWTS airs tonight at 8 p.m. on ABC.
