Sadie Robertson's Dancing With the Stars costumes are sometimes a little too risqué for her Duck Dynasty dad's liking.When that's the case, Willie Robertson makes his 17-year-old daughter cover up and wear something more conservative. That's not just TV talk either, according to Sadie's 19-year-old brother, John Luke, who confirmed to E! News Friday that Willie really does have a strong say in Sadie's wardrobe!John Luke, author of the Be Your Own Duck Commander book series, acknowledged that his little sis and pro-partner Mark Ballas have "been doing really well" in the dancing competition. "We're so proud of her," he said.

Members of the Duck Dynasty family always have each others' backs, though, he said. "Even when my grandpa's said things that were pretty controversial, we've all just stuck with him," said John Luke. "But that's what we've said: I'll stick with the family, we'll stick with the business [and] we'll stick with God."So how have the Louisiana natives stayed true to their values—and each other—despite being thrust into the national spotlight? "Every opportunity that came up, or every temptation that came up that was tempting us to compromise, we said, 'Well, If we have to do that, then we're not doing the show," he said.

So they "stuck together," said John Luke, "and that's worked out."So what is it about Sadie's DWTS performances that has, as John Luke put it, "surprised us all"?! And what do the Robertsons think about her chances of winning the Mirror Ball Trophy?!
