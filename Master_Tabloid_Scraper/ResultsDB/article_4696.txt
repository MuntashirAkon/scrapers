EXCLUSIVE! Mark Ballas, Not Willie Robertson, Was Actually Behind Sadie's Tamer Dancing With the Stars Costume!/n
Sometimes it's your professional dancing partner, not your father, who really knows best!Since her journey on Dancing With the Stars began, Duck Dynasty star Sadie Robertson has had to have each and every single one of her costumes approved by her father, Willie Robertson, including her wild feathery frock and her vintage-inspired yellow number for her waltz. And the first costume she wore during the show's Halloween-themed episode was no exception!But for the 17-year-old's circus-themed look during the ABC reality hit's group dance on Monday night, it was her partner Mark Ballas making sure her costume was age appropriate!

When we asked Sadie if her father, Willie, had approved the whimsical dress, which was a bit tamer than the rest of the costumes worn by the ladies in the #TeamCreepy group dance, Mark said, "No, that was me. We wanted to create, for each character, something memorable from the circus...she was like a female version of the jester and I think this is really appropriate and cute."But the DWTS dresses aren't the only ones on Sadie's mind as she revealed to us she went shopping for a very important gown recently for her BFF Mary Kate McEacharn's upcoming wedding to Sadie's brother, John Luke Robertson. "We actually just looked at wedding dresses yesterday, which is so weird!" Sadie told us. "I can't believe it. It's crazy."Watch the rest of our interview with Sadie and Mark above to get more DWTS and Duck wedding scoop!DWTS airs Mondays at 8 p.m. on ABC.
