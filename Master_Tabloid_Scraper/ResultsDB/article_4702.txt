Law Lashes Out at Paparazzi/nJude Law reacted like any father would when he spied a cameraman filming him with his ex-wife, Sadie Frost, and three kids at two separate locations around Los Angeles on Saturday.   In the video, Frost seems to spot the cameraman and points him out to Law. Later, Jude decides to confront the cameraman, apparently not happy about the fact his children were being photographed.  After threatening the photog ( "I'll have you up for pedophilia! "), Law questions the cameraman about filming his kids, and the cameraman claims he didn't realize he was filming them. Law then appears to slap the camera, saying,  "Look in your f***ing camera! " "You don't film my f***ing children! " Law says again before hurling a few more obscenities, then leaving.  Did the cameraman do anything wrong? Or was Law simply protecting his kids? Celebrity spotlight Jude Law/n
