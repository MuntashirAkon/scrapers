Kennedy Drug Horror Lingers As Bust Case Drags In Court/n
Connor Kennedy scored a legal win over his boozy arrest this week, but RadarOnline.com can exclusively reveal that his famous cousins aren’t catching a break in the case involving their home.
A Barnstable, Mass. court clerk confirmed to Radar exclusively that the men who used the Shriver’s summer home to traffic drugs had the court dates rescheduled to March 8.
Trevor Rose and Troy Monteiro were charged with the crime in January, and both pleaded not guilty at the time.

Radar previously reported that Barnstable police raided the Shriver home and found that it used as a drug den. Local police wrote in a statement that “the property caretaker was responsible for allowing the suspects to use the residence.”
Aspiring politician Caroline Kennedy — nor her famous cousins — were involved in the matter.
