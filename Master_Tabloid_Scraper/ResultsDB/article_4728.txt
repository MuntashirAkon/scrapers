Lights, Camera, Action! Danielle Gearing Up For Epic ‘RHONJ’ Return/n
Danielle Staub is making her Real Housewives of New Jersey comeback, RadarOnline.com can exclusively reveal!
“The big news is that Danielle Staub is back, officially,” an insider revealed to Radar. “Whether it will be as a full-time housewife or a friend remains to be seen, but one thing’s for certain: She will be on the show this season!”
Staub, 54, departed the show at the end of season 2. She was on the outs with Caroline Manzo, Jacqueline Laurita and Teresa Giudice at the time — and caused Dina Manzo to leave Bravo at the end of the season as well.
Rumors of her return began in October after she was pictured taking a yoga class with Giudice. The women previously had a tumultuous relationship — and Giudice even flipped a table on her in the show’s first season.
