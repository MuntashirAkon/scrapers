Caroline Kennedy has her eye on the White House, but a new family scandal threatens to torpedo her political career, RadarOnline.com has learned. According to new reports, a Cape Cod home owned by her family members has been exposed as the center of a massive drug ring!
Barnstable police raided the stately Hyannisport home, which is used by the Shriver family (Kennedy cousins) as a summer pad, on Wednesdsay.
Located near the Kennedy’s Hyannisport compound, the house was taken over by a ring of druggie lowlifes in recent months – and the Shrivers were none the wiser. (The home is reportedly owned by a Shriver family trust.)
