Fire, Fury, & FEAR ‚Äî Twitter Freaks Out Over Donald Trump's Latest Message To North Korea!/n

Donald Trump may have been comfortable threatening "fire and fury like the world has never seen," but the rest of us are not.
After the odious POTUS seemed to lay out a huge ultimatum to North Korea, the nation threatened the U.S. once again, this time saying they were considering attacking Guam with a missile strike.

Trump seems to be steering us taxpayer first into nuclear war, and Twitter is understandably freaking the fuck out about it.
From the gallows humor to the scarily somber, see how celebs, politicians, and American citizens are reacting to the escalation (below):

This North Korea thing is really scary, but don't worry ‚Äî we have our worst people on it.

WE HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR - BUT TRUMP HIMSELF

No idea what the right military strategy is in North Korea, but I worry that Trump might think it's good politics to provoke a conflict.

Reckless for @POTUS to make provocative statements about North Korea & back US into a corner. We need de-escalation, not a miscalculation. https://t.co/AhBmm9PHN3

Last summer I reported that Trump asked a foreign policy leader three times why the US had nuclear weapons if we couldn't use them. https://t.co/w4JskMPNdl

.@rianjohnson under current circumstances, could you maybe give us all a quick recap what happens in The Last Jedi?

No joke: I read Trump's statement on North Korea and thought it was a North Korean statement on Trump.

You know what would reduce the threat of nuclear war with North Korea? A fully-staffed State Department that actually cared about diplomacy.

Guys, remember when the biggest American threat to North Korea was that Seth Rogen/James Franco movie. Good times.

Anyone in favor of saber rattling against North Korea, please find a Korean War vet and have a conversation about their experience.
