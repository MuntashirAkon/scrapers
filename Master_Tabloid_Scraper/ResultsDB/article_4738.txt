What happens in Ibiza, most definitely does not stay in Ibiza!!
On Sunday, Paris Hilton was clearly thinking about her old pal Kim Kardashian West when she reminisced about the 2006 girls trip she took with her and DJ Caroline D'Amore!
Can you believe it's been 11 years?

From the pics, it looks like they enjoyed a whole plethora of activities, including eating ice cream. Guess that would make for an amazing trip??
Although, we're secretly hoping something crazy went down in Ibiza considering how many times the reality TV stars bring it up!
