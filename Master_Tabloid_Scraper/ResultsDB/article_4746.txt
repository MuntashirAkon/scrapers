Right now, Prince William and Kate Middleton are visiting Canada where they’re exploring the country’s rich history including witnessing a traditional welcome ceremony in Carcross Commons and meeting some locals. The prince even got the chance to help paint a totem pole!

But, during a visit to the town of Whitehorse, they toured a museum that educates visitors on the gold rush. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge also go some face time with some of the country’s Royal Mounties! You know…the police who wear red and ride horses in Canada.
For the first part of the day, Kate opted for a prim crimson CH Caroline Herrera knee-length frock. But afterward, she tossed on a pair of jeans, gray cardigan and cowboy boots for the rest of the day’s festivities!
Check out their visit in the gallery above!
