Beyoncé came out to support her honorary hype girl Serena Williams, who crushed it at the U.S. Open.

Jay Z was there, too, but you know how it is when you just need a wingman to fetch you some popcorn while your best friend’s in the middle of a heated match (even though domination is well within her grasp). Bey and Jay sat a few rows behind Williams’ family on Thursday night (Sept. 1, 2016) as the tennis pro defeated Vania King with a final score of 6-3.

As you may recall, Williams was featured on Beyoncé’s visual album for LEMONADE. Her sister, Venus, told Us Weekly that she only learned of Serena’s appearance when we did: at the time of LEMONADE’s HBO premiere.
“[Serena] didn’t tell me she was in it,” said Venus. “She said, ‘Hey, you wanna watch the Beyoncé special? I’m in it,’ and it was that day!”
Serena is continuing her side hustle as a dancer in a new ad for Delta Airlines with dance pro WilldaBEAST Adams, which makes us wonder if there’s anything that she can’t do when you consider that she can speak French and was the first black female athlete to have a solo cover of Vogue.
Go bestie, go best friend.
