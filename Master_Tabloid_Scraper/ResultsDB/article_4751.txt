Vreeland recently opened up to GQ last month about things like topless selfies, her favorite book (it’s Crime And Punishment by Fyodor Dostoyevsky), music, and her greatest kiss. GQ also asked her to rank “in order of priority” red wine, sex, pasta, music, fashion. Her response?

Sex, pasta, music, wine, fashion.

In the past year alone, Vreeland has done a number of high-fashion spreads in between singing gigs, oftentimes traveling the world to do so.
For example, she recently did a shoot for Santoni Official with Bret Easton Ellis, in which they channeled iconic couple Arthur Miller and Marilyn Monroe. In June, she covered Harper’s Bazaar Russia. Vreeland has also appeared in Carine Roitfeld’s CR Fashion book, and most recently was featured in the CR Girls 2016 portfolio.

Aside from her gorgeous singing voice, she’s got major presence and is super witty especially on her true love, Snapchat. That’s where she gives her follows a behind the scenes look to her photoshoots, takes numerous sips of wine (with friends), occasionally gets fed pasta by other people (you think she feeds herself?!), and shows off what book she’s reading.
Come for the singing, stay for the food/wine/bae.
