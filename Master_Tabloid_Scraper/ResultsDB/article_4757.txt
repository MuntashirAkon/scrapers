Caroline Rhea’s New York City home is absolutely bewitching.
The Sabrina the Teenage Witch alum, 53, welcomed PEOPLE into the bright abode she shares with her 8-year-old “miracle baby,” daughter, Ava, and from the whimsical collectibles to the artwork from her former TV flame, Martin Mull, there are plenty of magical moments to enjoy.
“I’m very into color,” she says. “And it’s because I’m from Canada and the winters are too depressing so I have to be around bright colors to cheer my soul.”

A purple couch packed full of Peeps and “Emoji poop” pillows captures Ava’s youthful aesthetic, while a cabinet of antique head vases speaks to Rhea’s nostalgic sense of design.
“My mother was an antique dealer, which is another word for hoarder, and that’s what I am too then,” she jokes while referencing a display case stocked with the unique containers. “This is my collection because I started liking them and then I was like, ‘Oh, I have to have all of them in the world.’”

After casually mentioning an art swap she has with Whoopi Goldberg, she shows off Ava’s room which she describes as her, “favorite little girl room ever.”
“This is a happy room,” she adds.
