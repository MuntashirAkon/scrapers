In all seriousness, we don't know a ton about Caroline's romantic life post-Rory. She did recently open up to The Independent about the pain that followed the split, saying, "It feels like someone close to you has died."She learned from the loss, though. "I think that taught me so much. I think I grew up so much in that short amount of time," she said of the breakup. "I also realised who is always there for me and who is just there when things are good.""And you learn just about life," she told The Independent. "You have to enjoy it while it's there. You have to enjoy all the great moments. I think now when I look back I wouldn't have been without it. Because now I really know that I'm strong, I know what I want, I know what I can accept, what I can't accept, what I need, what I don't need.""I think those are all things that I can bring with me in the future," she said. "And if I meet another guy who I think is great, then I also know what I can expect from myself and from him."
