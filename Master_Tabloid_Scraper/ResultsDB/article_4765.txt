Caroline Wozniacki better be joking!The 24-year-old athlete made a shocking announcement via Twitter Wednesday."As of today I am officially announcing my retirement from tennis and I am going to focus on TV and modeling. I want to thank all of you for the amazing support over the years," Wozniacki informed her 829,000 Twitter followers. "It's been truly amazing! It wouldn't have been the same without you!"The announcement was made on April Fools' Day, so take the "announcement" with a grain of salt.Most of Wozniacki's fans didn't fall for her joke, but a few did:

Just to be sure, E! News reached out to her agent John Tobias. He confirmed she "is not retiring."If she ever does decide to leave the sport behind, Wozniacki could easily make it as a model. After all, she was featured in this year's Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue, following in the footsteps of other No. 1-ranked singles tennis stars Steffi Graf (1997), Serena Williams (2004), Venus Williams (2005), Maria Sharapova (2006) and Ana Ivanovic (2010). Even Rafael Nadal made it into the magazine's 2012 issue!"I've always wanted to do a Sports Illustrated swimsuit [shoot]," Wozniacki told The New York Post in February. "It's amazing. Very few people get this opportunity, and I loved every minute of it. It was so much fun to shoot, and [Walter Iooss, Jr.], the photographer, was amazing. I'm happy with the results."Wozniacki's "retirement" announcement comes two days after her Venus Williams beat her 6-3, 7-6 (7-1) to reach the Miami Open quarterfinals. Seeded 16th, Venus is a three-time Key Biscayne champion. Unfortunately, she lost in Tuesday's quarterfinals to No. 12-seeded Carla Suarez Navarro 0-6, 6-1, 7-5.
