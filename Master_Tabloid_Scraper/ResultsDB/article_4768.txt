The future spouses began dating in the summer of 2011, shortly after McIlroy won his first major title with a record-setting performance in the U.S. Open at Congressional. The power couple confirmed they were dating a few months later and were falsely rumored to have broken up in 2013.Pro golfers Ian Poulter and Graeme McDowell were among the first to congratulate McIlroy on his engagement via Twitter. "Congrats Rory! Great start to the new year!" Francesco Molinari tweeted.
