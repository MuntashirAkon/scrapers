Rory McIlRoy -- Ditching Caroline Wozniacki Made Me Number One/nThe reason Rory McIlroy is kicking every other golfer's ass is simple -- he unloaded that ball and chain, otherwise known as Caroline Wozniacki ... that's how Rory sees it anyway, and he had the cajones to say it out loud.McIlroy fired the shot at his ex-fiancee while talking to reporters at the PGA Championship -- which of course he won this weekend. Rory talked about the break-up, saying ...  "I think what happened has been for the better in terms of my golf. " BOOM.The 25-year-old ... #1 ranked golfer in the world ... said, “I’ve put a bit more time into it and it has refocused me. I mean, what else do I have to do now? I go to the golf course, I go to the gym and it’s just my life at the minute. " Ballsy for Rory to say it -- and crappy for Caroline to hear it -- but hard to argue with the stats ... 3 consecutive tournament wins, and 2 majors in a row since he killed the engagement in MayFor what it's worth ... Caroline is currently ranked #12 in tennis.We got Rory out in NYC Monday morning, and he attempted to back pedal from his weekend comments, but c'mon ... we know what he's saying, right?/n
