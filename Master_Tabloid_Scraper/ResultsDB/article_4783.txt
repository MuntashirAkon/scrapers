Blake Griffin: Toronto PD Not Investigating Fight ... 'No One Filed Report' /nThe Toronto Police tell TMZ Sports they are NOT investigating the reported Blake Griffin restaurant fight that went down during the Clippers' recent trip to Canada ... because no one has filed a report.  We spoke with Toronto Police Service media relations officer, Caroline De Kloet﻿, who says Blake's name is not in their system which means there's nothing actively underway.  According to several reports, Griffin punched the team's equipment manager during an altercation at a Toronto restaurant ... and broke his own hand in the process.  The other person involved in the fight was reportedly hospitalized for his injuries.  But just because there's no current investigation doesn't mean Griffin is in the clear -- the Toronto PD says if someone files a report, they will open an investigation ... but until that time, there's nothing to investigate. /n
