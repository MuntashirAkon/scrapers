Paris' Buddy -- Very Bubbly/nTMZ spotted Paris Hilton hanger-on, the very cheerful Caroline D'Amore -- driving away from Joseph's last night.The sometimes model /DJ was spotted making an unsteady walk to her car (high heels?), rambling as she screamed for her  "gay boyfriend, " then was gigglingly ecstatic about Paris being released from jail. Clearly, Paris is her inspiration. Caution advised./n
