Paris Leaves Town -- Leaves Brandon To Nicky/nParis Hilton was spotted yesterday afternoon with bff Caroline D'Amore and Kimberly Kardashian at LAX en route to Spain - and with the looks of the trio's luggage - we're hoping it's for more than a week. For Brandon Davis the party must go on, so he parties it up with the next best (Hilton) thing - Nicky!Nicky and Brandon arrived arm in arm together last night at the hip Chateau Marmont in Hollywood. The duo later ducked out together and headed to another trendy hangout, Hyde.Hopefully partying sans Paris won't put too much of a damper on Brandon's wild evenings./n
