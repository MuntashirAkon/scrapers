We meet up at a bar my friend works at. Said friend proceeds to text me telling me this guy sucks and I should run

I show up and he sucks but I figure I'll stay because my friends are working at the bar

So 45 mins in his next date shows up because he double books himslef and he decides he's going to friendzone me to get out of the situation

I decide to play the friend in order to help the girl feel less awkward until he exits for a moment and then I tell her what's up

We'll call this girl katie - katie gets in on my quest to make this guy feel like the fucjboy he clearly is and we chat for 30 mins

The two girls and I have now gotten both bartenders and the bouncer in on this and are taking this guy for all he's worth over here
— Lisette Pylant (@LisettePylant) August 7, 2017


He's now explaining why he broke up with his ex and Riley asked if he also met her on a "group date" 😂
— Lisette Pylant (@LisettePylant) August 7, 2017


Don't worry - we already asked if there's going to be a rose ceremony
— Lisette Pylant (@LisettePylant) August 7, 2017


The two girls and I decided to be best friends, left together to go get drinks and dinner at another bar and left homeboy with the bill 👌🏽

You guys girl number FIVE just showed up BEFORE going to meet him because my friends intercepted her and told her not to waste her time
— Lisette Pylant (@LisettePylant) August 8, 2017


My friend is now arguing with said guy and his current date (#4) about why she shouldn't waste her time and just leave

— Lisette Pylant (@LisettePylant) August 8, 2017


Tell him if he should just fuck off. I tell him there's a difference between being efficient and being an asshole and he goes into "well im
— Lisette Pylant (@LisettePylant) August 8, 2017


"…A project manager, I manage my time efficiently." And I say there's no way to know someone in 40 mins of you have 5 dates lined up
— Lisette Pylant (@LisettePylant) August 8, 2017


He didn't seem to like that and resigned himself to the fact that I wanted to walk away laughing at him
— Lisette Pylant (@LisettePylant) August 8, 2017


My friend walked over and told #5 what was up, got her number and this was their convo pic.twitter.com/y30UP261d5
— Lisette Pylant (@LisettePylant) August 8, 2017


He tried to say he was looking for love and his future wife. These "weren't dates" they were apparently "pre-date conversations"
