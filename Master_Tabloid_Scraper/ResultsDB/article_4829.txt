Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell’s love has been immortalized.

The couple received their respective Hollywood Walk of Fame stars in a special joint ceremony on Thursday (May 4, 2017). Joined by Kate Hudson, Reese Witherspoon and Quentin Tarantino, Hawn and Russell celebrated the honor with a sweet kiss at the podium.
“Can we just get married? We’ve never had a celebration like this before,” Hawn, who has been with the Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 actor for 33 years, joked.
“This means more to me as I start reflecting on things,” she told the crowd gathered on Hollywood Blvd. “That star is part of ‘yes.’ I really went through something then because I didn’t know what it meant to be a star when people didn’t know who I was. I didn’t get my white picket fence but I got a beautiful house.”

She continued, “I said yes to Kurt Russell. I said yes to Bill Hudson, and without Bill I wouldn’t have had Katie and Oliver [Hudson]. I wish my mom and my dad could see me.”
Russell echoed the sweet sentiments, thanking his longtime love for all the support over the years.
“Goldie to you, I owe my wonderful life,” Russell said. “Simply put Goldie, I cherish you. All of the stars in the sky or the boulevard don’t hold a candle to that. There’s no one else I’d rather be next to than Goldie Hawn.”
Russell started dating Hawn in 1983 following his divorce with actress Season Hubley. He starred in two films — 1984’s Swing Shift and 1987’s Overboard — with her.
