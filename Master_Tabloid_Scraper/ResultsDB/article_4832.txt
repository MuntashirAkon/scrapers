Amber Portwood’s Fiancé Accused of Cheating: See the Alleged Texts From His Mistress/n
Amber Portwood may break things off with fiancé Matt Baier for good after he was allegedly caught flirting with another woman in a string of leaked text messages.

A Twitter user identifying as Katie Rowe released several screenshots of messages shared between Baier and an unnamed friend, claiming the Teen Mom OG star has been chatting up other ladies and telling them his upcoming wedding was canceled. Rowe also apologized to Portwood for sharing the damning texts, tweeting, “Amber, I am genuinely sorry. Nobody wants to hurt u but we can’t keep other women who r hurt quiet to ‘protect’ u. It’s not even protection.”
In one text exchange, Baier questioned the unidentified woman’s sex life before asking if she loved him. Via Teen Mom Talk Now:
The woman attempts to deflect Matt’s advances by reminding him of Amber, but he doesn’t seem interested in talking about her. The woman says, “She definitely loves you – tho anonymous tip, she’s gotta find a new news source to talk to. In Touch is not her friend.” Matt replies sadly about the woman not saying she’s in love with him, “Ok well you seem to have made up your mind.”
She says, “It’s not my mind. As long as you have a fiancée what am I supposed to do?” He callously replies, “You could be honest and admit your in love with me.”
Matt then offers the woman information about his wedding to attempt to get her to say that she loves him. He writes, “Ok fine you win. We postponed (and probably canceled) the wedding. Are you happy now? Please answer the question.”
