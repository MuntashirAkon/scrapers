Chrissy Teigen sure knows how to ring in Valentine’s Day.

Clad in Agent Provocateur lingerie, the model stars in a new sexy video for LOVE magazine. Directed by Rankin, the steamy visuals feature Teigen modeling various skimpy outfits — including garters and heart-shaped nipple pasties — as she lip-syncs John Legend’s “Ordinary People.”
Needless to say, her husband is thrilled. Just look at that face!

“I love ‘Ordinary People’ so much, so when [editor-in-chief] Katie [Grand] asked me to shoot Chrissy for Valentine’s, the idea of her doing a lip-sync version immediately jumped into my head,” the director explains press release. “Katie wasn’t so keen. Then when Chrissy came up with the idea on set, and with John, I was like, ‘Erm…yes, please. ‘ When they sang it together at the end, I got goose bumps.”
