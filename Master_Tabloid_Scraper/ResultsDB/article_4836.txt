President Donald Trump spoke out about his feelings on Madonna’s Women’s March speech in which she said, “Yes, I’m angry. Yes, I am outraged. Yes, I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House, but I know this won’t change anything.”

During a visit with Sean Hannity on Fox News, President Trump condemned Madonna’s choice of words with which she addressed the crowd.
“Honestly, she’s disgusting. I think she hurt herself very badly. I think she hurt that whole cause,” said Trump. “I thought her, and a couple of others. But I thought she was in particular — I thought what she said was disgraceful to our country.”

Trump also expressed his disdain for Saturday Night Live after Katie Rich, a staff writer on the show, wrote on Twitter, “Barron [Trump] will be this country’s first homeschool shooter.”
“I don’t mind some humor but it’s terrible,” Trump said. “For them to attack, for NBC to attack my 10-year-old son…it’s a disgrace. He’s a great boy. And it’s not an easy thing for him. Believe me.”
Trump echoed his past statements about SNL being a “failing” show and said that Alec Baldwin’s impersonation of him was “terrible.”
