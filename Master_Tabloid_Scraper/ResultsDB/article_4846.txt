Katie Cassidy has been struck by cupid's arrow.The 30-year-old Arrow actress announced her engagement to Matthew Rodgers via Instagram Monday, where Cassidy flashed her diamond ring as she gave her fianc√© a big kiss. The couple has been vacationing at The Oberoi Mauritius, a five-star hotel on an island in the Indian Ocean."I can't wait to spend forever with you my darling!! I'm the luckiest girl in the whole world," the beaming bride-to-be gushed on Instagram. "I [love] YOU to the moon and back @mattyice432.""Thank you for a magical evening I will forever remember," she added."We were friends at first," she later told E! News exclusively. "He surprised me during a romantic dinner and dropped to a knee! It was so perfect!"

Cassidy and Rodgers took a private plane to the East African island six days ago, just after she appeared at Heroes and Villains Fan Fest in London with her Arrow co-stars Stephen Amell, John Barrowman, Emily Bett Rickards, Colin Donnell and Josh Segarra. Since then, she has shared several photos from her beach vacation with her 2 million followers.

This will be the first marriage for Cassidy, whose exes include Jerry Ferrara, Jason Garrison and Jesse McCartney."He is an amazing man and she is so happy," a source tells E! News. "He is a good man who loves her so much. Katie is so happy!"
