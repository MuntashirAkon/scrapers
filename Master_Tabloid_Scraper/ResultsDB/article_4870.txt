Jamie Foxx -- Guys, I'm Not Banging Katie Holmes (VIDEO)/n / /   Jamie Foxx was more than happy to stop for photogs Friday so he could shoot down stories that he's dating Katie Holmes. Foxx was at an ATM in Westlake when he was asked about the reported relationship, and he joked that the tabloids have been trying to make that a story for 3 years. Jamie said -- and we've independently confirmed -- he was around Katie quite a bit recently for an animation project they are doing with  "CSI " creator Anthony Zuiker. The one thing that's clear ... there's no way Jamie drained his bank account at that ATM./n
