Lydia McLaughlin and Shannon Beador won’t be making up anytime soon, RadarOnline.com can exclusively reveal!

“So I don’t really know where my relationship right now stands with Shannon,” she added. “I know where it was the last time I saw her, but things change and people say things in the press and it’s just like constantly evolving. So ask me again in 10 minutes and it may be different! Who knows?”
McLaughlin, 37, and Beador, 53, have been feuding since Tamra Judge’s granddaughter Ava’s birthday party when the Nobleman Magazine maven compared Beador to Vicki Gunvalson.
The “friendship whisperer” told Beador that she was acting like Gunvalson — and Beador immediately stormed off camera.
