RadarOnline.com previously reported that Judge, 49, and Sidney, 18, have been at odds since Judge split from Simon Barney in 2011. They briefly reconciled after the season 11 reunion, but their mended relationship didn’t last long.
She revealed on the season 12 premiere that she was heartbroken she hasn’t spent holidays with Sidney, and felt empty that she couldn’t go formal dress shopping with her like Shannon Beador did with her daughter Stella.
