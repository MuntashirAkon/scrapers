 Shannon EXPLODES In New ‘RHOC’ Season 12 Sneak Peek: 'I Will NEVER Be Like Vicki!'.../n
Vicki Gunvalson and Shannon Beador have been butting heads since last year on The Real Housewives of Orange County, and the feud between the two is heating up like never before as the ladies gear up for another drama-filled season. But with Lydia McLaughlin back in the mix, it’s only making matters worse.
In a new sneak peek for the premiere, Beador faces off with McLaughlin over — you guessed it — Vicki Gunvalson, and the results are nasty!
“I was upset when you said that I was just like Vicki. That’s what set me off,” Shannon snaps at Lydia. “So let’s be clear when you said I was just like Vicki. You don’t know me, and I’m nothing like Vicki Gunvalson. I have a four-year history with her… I’m nothing like Vicki.”

As fans know, Beador, 53, had a falling out with Gunvalson, 55, last season when the RHOC veteran alleged that Shannon’s cheating husband, David, was abusive — a claim both Beadors deny.

Since then, Shannon has packed on the pounds, and blames her weight gain on stress caused by Vicki. “Vicki is telling friends that the fact that Shannon has been blaming her for getting fat is the most ridiculous thing that she’s ever heard,” a RHOC insider previously told Radar. “Vicki basically does not care about Shannon at all anymore and she lost all respect for her when she stayed with David after he cheated on her,” the source added. “It’s actually quite sad to watch her self-destruct, but Vicki is not about to let Shannon blame her for any of her issues. She created them herself,” continued the snitch.
