McLaughlin first appeared on season 8 of the hit show alongside her husband Doug and their sons Stirling and Maverick (now 8 and 5). She welcomed a third son, Roman, two years ago.
“I think my soul was just empty,” she told Radar of why she left the show in 2015. “I needed to refill it….I was depleted. I needed to go back to my faith…rather than constantly being around negativity.”
