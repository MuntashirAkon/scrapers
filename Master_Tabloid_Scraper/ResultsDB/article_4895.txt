'You're A F***ing B***h!' Meghan Edmonds Explodes In 'RHOC' Season 12 Trailer/n
The Real Housewives of Orange County is back for it’s most dramatic season yet! Bravo has released the official season 12 trailer, and nothing is off limits with the ladies.
“Lydia is back!” Lydia McLaughlin exclaimed in the clip, announcing her return to the series. (Radar exclusively reported that she was coming back after her abrupt season 8 exit).
McLaughlin proceeded to introduce the ladies to her friend, Peggy Sulahian — who Vicki Gunvalson deemed a “princess” because of her over-the-top lifestyle.

Meanwhile, Meghan Edmonds struggled to capture her husband’s attention.
“Am I turning you on right now?” she asked Jim Edmonds as she shimmied for him.
“No,” he coldly responded.

“Being a new mom has been extremely difficult,” she confessed in another clip as she needed assistance holding a crying Aspen.
“You should be taking care of your baby instead of worrying about gossip!” Kelly Dodd hurled at her in another scene.
“I’m not gonna sit there and have her tell me I’m a bad mom!” Edmonds proceeded to cry to McLaughlin.

Dodd also started a fight with Sulahian in another scene, as she asserted that she would “throw a nuke” at her.
Edmonds also had a war of words with Sulahian. “You’re a f***ing b***h!” she screamed.
Then, Shannon Beador proclaimed that all she wanted to do was eat before blaming Gunvalson for her weight gain. Radar previously reported Beador checked into a “fat farm” ahead of taping and may have gotten a plastic surgery makeover afterwards.

“I just don’t understand how I let myself go,” she cried as she appeared shirtless in the gym.
The girls then traveled to Iceland together — but someone got injured!
