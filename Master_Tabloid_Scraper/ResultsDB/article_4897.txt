And according to a production insider, it was all caught on camera.
“Vicki is so angry about Kelly betraying her by making up with Tamra this season,” the source revealed. “Kelly said that she just does not want to be fighting Vicki’s battles anymore, and wants to be neutral from now on.”

Prior to the Dodd’s shocking decision to befriend her former enemy, she was an outspoken warrior for Gunvalson, 55.
At the same time, the other cast mates, including Shannon Beador, 53, and Meghan King Edmonds, 32, have made it clear that they are taking Judge’s side this upcoming season.

“Of course, this has made Vicki so upset because Kelly was the one who was starting all the fights last season, and now she doesn’t want to finish them,” said source, adding that returning housewife, Lydia McLaughlin, is also playing Switzerland in the blond divas never-ending duel.
