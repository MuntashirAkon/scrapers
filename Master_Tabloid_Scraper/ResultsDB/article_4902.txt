In the following sneak peek, the 36-year-old and fellow cast member Shannon Beador get into a heated argument when Lydia compares Shannon to her nemesis Vicki Gunvalson!
Miz Beador fights back by saying:

"I was upset when you said that I was just like Vicki. That's what set me off… So let's be clear when you said I was just like Vicki. You don't know me, and I'm nothing like Vicki Gunvalson. I have a four-year history with her… I'm nothing like Vicki."
