Watch As Moment Of Silence For Manchester Victims Becomes A Spontaneous Emotional Sing-along/n

You know why we love this? Because it tells terrorists they will never break us.
The crowd gathered at Albert Square, a kilometer away from where the bomb went off at Manchester Arena, probably expected to pay their respects to victims with a moment of silence.

But as that moment ended, a new one began. Someone in the crowd started singing the Oasis classic Don't Look Back In Anger, which began an impromptu sing-along.
See the stirring moment (below)!

Why Don't Look Back In Anger?
Lydia Bernsmeier-Rullow told The Guardian she was the one who started the song, and that it came to her for a reason:

"We can't be looking backward to what happened, we have to look forwards to the future. We're all going to join together, we're all going to get on with it because that's what Manchester does."
Liam and Noel Gallagher started Oasis in Manchester, so it's no surprise everyone knows the words.
Music is something no attack can ever take away.
