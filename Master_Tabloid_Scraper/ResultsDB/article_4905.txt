Listen To This: Thicker, Dimmer!/n

Lydia Ainsworth is Canadian, but she has a real European sensibility!
Sonically, she reminds us of Oh Land and Kiiara.
And, visually she reminds us of Lady GaGa early in her career, when she was creating on a very small budget.
Check out her artful pop song and video The Road above!
