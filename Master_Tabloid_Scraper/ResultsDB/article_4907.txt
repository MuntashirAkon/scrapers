Dylan O’Brien will indeed be back for season six of Teen Wolf, showrunner Jeff Davis confirms.

Fans were worried O’Brien, who plays one of the show’s lead characters, Stiles, wouldn’t be able to return due to his on-set injury while filming the third installment of the Maze Runner trilogy.

Production for The Maze Runner: The Death Cure was initially delayed indefinitely after O’Brien was run over by a car and suffered severe injuries, including multiple broken bones. The release date has since been pushed back until January 12, 2018, over a year after the film’s original slated release.
According to the Huffington Post, the work-safety agency in British Columbia (where the movie was being filmed) blamed the film production company for failing to ensure the safety of workers on the set.
Davis says this development will not affect his return to Teen Wolf. He told EW:
Stiles is a big part of the season because a lot of this season’s mystery revolves around him. We’re going to see just what Stiles’ friendship means to Scott [Tyler Posey], Lydia [Holland Roden], and Malia [Shelley Hennig]. We’re going to see why exactly he’s Scott’s best friend, what it means that he’s Malia’s human anchor, and what his will-they-or-won’t-they relationship is with Lydia.
