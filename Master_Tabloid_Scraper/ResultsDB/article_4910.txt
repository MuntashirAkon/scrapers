Katy Perry Wore a Pizza and She Liked It/n
Katy Perry’s love of pizza is now well-documented, just as my love of all winning captions, a few more of which you’ll find below, is well-documented.

“ONE, slice of me. Just ONE!” – Cristina
“Stay… Don’t bite” – Michelle
“Don’t pizza me off!” – Stephanie
“But first… let me take a selfie ” – Sharon
“Hold on I’m trying to get some fans back by being pizza. Just cause I wouldn’t die for them doesn’t mean they can’t eat me a little.” – Lydia
“There’s no “we” in p[i]zza” - Josh
“She wants me to sausage her Pizza” – Dan
