Nigel Barker To Naomi Campbell: ‘Too Bad’ You Don’t Like Kimye On ‘Vogue’/n
Season 2 of The Face is back and we had the opportunity to chat with the show’s host, and fab photographer, Nigel Barker.
Nigel chatted with Celebuzz about everything from Kim and Kanye’s Vogue cover to Naomi Campbell to the concept of the supermodel.

As for season two of The Face, Nigel revealed how this season is different from the first.
“It is great to be back. season two of The Face and of course it is bigger and better. we are back for ten episodes this season and we have got Lydia Hearst and Anne V. two incredible super models joining the legendary Naomi Campbell and myself. I am back as a host and a confidant this season. which is a little different. You may wonder ‘what exactly does that mean?’ well it means that I have sort of got commission to go into the scene when I see something happening between the girls and ask pertinent. Kind of find out whats going on; perhaps be a shoulder for them to cry on but more than anything the eyes and ears of the audience. This season is full of really great things.”

The Face airs every Wednesday at 8/7c on Oxygen.
