NEW PICS: Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez Reunite in Texas/n
Justin Bieber is following the “most elegant princess in the world” to Texas.
It’s a long way to go for some coffee and shopping, but what’s a couple thousand miles when these young on-again, off-again lovebirds just can’t seem to break away from each other. They’re going the distance.
And CB! has the pic to prove it.

After he was spotted dropping by his attorney’s office in Miami on Thursday, JB made a pit stop in McAllen, Tex. to visit a special someone. The bad boy and Selena Gomez were snapped in McAllen, Tex. early Friday morning grabbing a cup of Joe at a local Starbucks and hitting up a fragrance shop, clearly so Biebs can impress the songstress with his newly-minted 20-year-old manly smell.

Doing a bit of recon, Celebuzz was informed that Gomez, who tried to go undercover in a hoodie, tagged along so the “Boyfriend” singer could pick out a couple scents. Royal Parfums owner Lydia Gonzalez told us Bieber bought medicine cabinet staples, Obsession by Calvin Klein and Pour Homme by Givenchy, to add to his collection of hit-making perfumes, which obviously Gomez wears on a regular basis.
Hence, why she picked out nothing, but as lookie-loos gathered, Bieber made his $100 purchase within five minutes and the twosome got out of there with a quickness, said Gonzalez.
And because that crowd just wasn’t big enough for them, the couple went to Foot Locker and Dillards at La Plaza Mall, which was shut down because of the chaos, according to eyewitness Luis Alejandro, who told Celebuzz people were running and screaming inside and outside the shopping center just to get a glimpse of the stars.

The 21-year-old singer is scheduled to perform in the area at State Farm Arena in Hidalgo, Tex. on Saturday.
