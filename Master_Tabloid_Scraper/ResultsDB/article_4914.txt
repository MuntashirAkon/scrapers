Kim Kardashian and Kanye West are Suing YouTube’s Founder/n
The revolution will not be televised. Nor will it be Vined, YouTubed, Instagrammed or MixBitted (whatever the hell that is). Not, at least, if Kim Kardashian and Kanye West have anything to say about it. West and Kardashian are apparently furious that Chad Hurley, who founded YouTube, posted video from their ceremony online and now they plan to sue him.
TMZ claims that Hurley was in violation of a non-disclosure agreement he signed before attending the lavish proposal ceremony. TMZ also claims that “[t]he couple thinks they know who did it” which, yeah, I think I know who did it too:
So this happened last night. Congrats Kim & Kanye! https://t.co/o1FKsB87He

Anyway, Hurley posted some blurry video of two Kanye and Kim-shaped blobs getting engaged and now they’re getting litigious about it. It’s just one of those run-of-the-mill engagement party squabbles. Like the time your great aunt scolded your weird cousin Lydia for eating too many breadsticks at your skinny cousin Sandra’s Olive Garden engagement dinner. Just like that.
