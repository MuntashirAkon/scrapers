Kendrick Lamar’s Austin City Limits Sign Language Interpreter is the Best Sign Language Interpreter/n
Move over Lydia Callis, because there’s a new ASL sheriff in town. Meet Amber Galloway Gallego, the woman responsible for interpreting Kendrick Lamar’s “P&P” into American Sign Language.

Thank you to Instagram for introducing us to this flame-haired, fire-tongued phoenix who’s stolen our hearts and interpreted our dreams. We are all Amber Galloway Gallego, ACL ASL lady; the ACL ASL lady is all of us.
