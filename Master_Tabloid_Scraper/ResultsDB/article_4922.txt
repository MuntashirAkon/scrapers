Hurricane Sandy's Sign Language Sweetheart: Lydia Callis!/n
That kind of signing breaks down all language barriers. But if you hablas espa√±ol and are still feeling a bit lost in translation, Mayor Bloomberg is here for you. Or at least his alter ego, El Bloombito (who even has his own Twitter!).During those same press conferences, after Mayor Bloomberg finishes his announcements in English, El Bloombito surfaces to deliver the same announcement translated into Spanish. Or something that kinda sounds like Spanish.A for effort. And T for Twitter, because the parody account of the Spanish-speaking Bloomberg is serving up comedy gold during the storm.
