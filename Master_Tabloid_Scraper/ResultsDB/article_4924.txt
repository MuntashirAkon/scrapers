Looks like Kevin Connolly is back to hangin' with his boys.The Entourage star and has split up with girlfriend Lydia Hearst after about a year of dating, a source confirms to E! News.We're told that there was no drama behind the breakup. Rather, "they were just done," the source said.The couple had met in the the most modern of ways: Hearst revealed to Access Hollywood last month that she and Connolly first hooked up via "mutual friends and Facebook."

"Actually, I might've hit him up," said the model-actress, who is currently a coach on Oxygen's The Face. "It was a while ago. It's been over a year. But I love him to death and I'm very happy."But Hearst actually hadn't yet seen her man in action as E, the managerial glue holding VIncent Chase's life together on Entourage."I have to admit I have not seen Entourage, but I know they're filming an amazing movie right now," she said. "And he's a huge fan of The Face."Well, maybe he was...This hasn't been the greatest spring for Connolly, who broke his leg in March playing football with Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson in a scene for the Entourage movie, which is due in theaters June 12, 2015.And so, may a different sort of healing begin.Us Weekly was first to report on their breakup.
