The-Dream -- Wanted by NYPD After Allegedly Attacking Pregnant Baby Mama/nPolice in New York are on the lookout for music producer The-Dream after he allegedly punched, kicked, and strangled his ex-girlfriend, who was pregnant at the time, law enforcement sources tell TMZ -- but the producer insists the allegations are bogus.According to law enforcement, the alleged incident took place in April 2013 at the Plaza Hotel, roughly three months before Dream's ex-GF Lydia Nam gave birth to his infant son. It's unclear what prompted the alleged attack and if Nam ever sought medical attention -- but for some reason, she didn't file a police report until November, which is when she described the alleged assault to police.Law enforcement sources tell us, Dream (real name Terius Nash) is now wanted for questioning by police in connection with Nam's allegations -- which means if they find him ... he'll be taken into custody.For The-Dream's part, he not only insists Nam is lying -- sources close to the producer tell us, he thinks she's a vengeful woman who's plotting to use this alleged crime as a way to extend her visa in the U.S. (Nam is Canadian.)According to law enforcement sources, Dream was already arrested in connection with a separate domestic violence incident (also involving Nam) last June in Newport Beach, CA  ... but Nam refused to press charges, so the D.A. rejected the case.We reached out to Nam for comment -- so far, no word back./n
