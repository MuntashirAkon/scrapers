Kate Moss Gathers Stranger for Protection/nJessica Simpson got the National Guard to help her through the airport, Keira Knightley got this bruiser, but Kate Moss had to settle for a totally random stranger for security assistance.  Arriving at JFK airport last night, the model-mess had an unsolicited dude come up to her and offer his services. And who is this driver guy, anyway?
