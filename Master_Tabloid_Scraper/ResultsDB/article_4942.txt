Kanye, Carmen and Cognac at Capitale/nIt was a miserably rainy night in Manhattan last night -- the kind of evening that makes rogue taxi drivers want to wash all the scum off the streets. And yet a bulb-popping trove of stars braved the deluge for the Hennessy Artistry soiree and its main musical attractions, Kanye West and The Strokes, all assembled at that evergreen redoubt of New York nightlife, Capitale.TMZ spotted Carmen Electra, Rosie Perez, Diane Kruger, and Kirsten Dunst (and their respective hair) looking splendid and frizz-free despite the downpour, as well as the luminous Susie Castillo and Vanessa Minnillo, who was rushed into the party past reporters. Speaking of hair, Lydia Hearst showed off her new 'do to our cameras, while artist-of-honor Kanye,  "30 Rock's " Tracy Morgan, and '90s TV heartthrobs Danny Masterson and Joshua Jackson made their appearances as well. Ewan Mcgregor was joined by a heartily hirsute pal. Inside, guests quaffed signature cocktails mixed with the host-brand cognac, and grooved to the tunes of not just Kanye and Julian Casablancas and Co., but Goldfrapp and legendary DJ Carl Cox as well. An evening to soften even Travis Bickle's heart./n
