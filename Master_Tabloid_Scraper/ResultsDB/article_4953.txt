Lydia Pirates Paps from Keira/nThe paparazzi tried to get a shot of the elusive Keira Knightley's face at JFK yesterday, and while she paid them no attention, the spawn of Patty Hearst just couldn't get enough! Keira hid from photogs, but Lydia Hearst seemed giddy to pose for pix and signed autographs -- someone even sent a press release to TMZ describing her outfit in detail -- she just loooooves her Blue & Cream hoodie! Now she's gone and kidnapped our hearts! Thanks, Liddy!  Related Articles      Keira Bandaged Up/n
