Accused Madonna Stalker In Court After Mansion Break-In/n
A 29-year-old Polish-born man who allegedly broke into Madonna‘s London mansion over the weekend will appear in court Monday to answer to the accusations, RadarOnline.com has learned.
Grzegorz Matlok, according to the Sun, was caught inside the 52-year-old Material Girl’s 10-bedroom, $16 million townhouse on Saturday and wrestled to the ground by guards on the premises. Matlok, who the singer’s security staff said has stalked her before, reportedly got in after smashing a side window.

The Lucky Star singer and her four children were not at home at the time of the break-in, as the family traveled to to Bay City, Michigan for the funeral of Madonna’s grandmother Elsie Mae Fortin, who passed away last week at the age of 99.
