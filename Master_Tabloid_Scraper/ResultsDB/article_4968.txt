At Least Nine People Are Dead, 13 More Still Missing After Fire Rips Through EDM Party/n

This is so sad — and very much still developing.
At least nine people have died, and there are reports of as many as 13 more still missing, after a Friday night fire at a rave in Oakland, California.

The party, dubbed the "Rave Cave" with EDM performers there like Golden Donna, was interrupted at about 11:30 pm last night when the fire started and spread. 
The fire was so strong — and there was apparently no sprinkler system in the building — that by even five hours later, firefighters were unable to contain the blaze.
As you can see (below) the fire looks both massive and imposing:

Wow. 
And concertgoers at the party and around the scene have been sharing photos and videos themselves, to let loved ones know they made it out of the fire, or to inform people they are searching for those still unaccounted (below): 

So, so sad.

For now, with at least nine confirmed dead and many more updates no doubt coming, this is a very tragic story.
Our thoughts are with all those involved, and the families, friends, and loved ones of those killed. 
R.I.P.
