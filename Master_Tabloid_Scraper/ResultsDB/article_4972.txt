As far as celebrity baby names go, this one’s pretty cute.
Some three months after giving birth to her first child, Zooey Deschanel has finally revealed her daughter’s name: Elsie Otter.
“We just really liked the name Elsie, and then we both love otters because they’re so sweet and also smart,” the 35-year-old actress explained on Tuesday morning on The Today Show.
“They use tools, they keep their favorite tools, they hold hands while they sleep, they are so many amazing things about otters. They’re wonderful animals.”

The New Girl star and her husband Jacob Pechneik welcomed wee baby Elsie, their first child, over the summer. The couple first talked about Elsie’s name last week at the New York premiere of Rock the Kasbah.
