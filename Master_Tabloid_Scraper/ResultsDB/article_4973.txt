Shia LaBeouf is in trouble again. 
Just one year after getting arrested in New York City outside a Broadway theatre, the actor was arrested on Friday evening (Oct. 9, 2015) outside of a bar in Austin, Tex. for public intoxication. According to TMZ, the 28-year-old was either very drunk or high on drugs because he was acting very weird.

His arrest comes months after his very public fight with ex girlfriend Mia Goth. The two got into an explosive argument in Germany. However, since then the Transformers star has been keeping a very low profile, spending time with his new girlfriend, Sasha Lane, and even shaving off his disgusting rat tail.
More details of his arrest are to come.
