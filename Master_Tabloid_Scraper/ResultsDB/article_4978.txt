Dancing With the Stars pro Anna Trebunskaya and her husband, fellow DWTS dancer, Jonathan Roberts, recently announced their decision to end their nine-year marriage.
“I’m surviving,” Trebunskaya told Celebuzz at the launch of Assassin’s Creed III in Los Angeles Wednesday night.
“I’m living life and just trying to be thankful for every day that I have and the things that I have: My great family, my wonderful friends.”

Some of her closest confidants are her fellow Dancing With the Stars pros. “Kym Johnson, Chelsie Hightower and I had a girls’ night out a few days ago,” Trebunskaya added.

Despite being eliminated in third week of competition, this Dancing With the Stars: All Stars castoff will make a triumphant return to the ballroom soon enough. “I’ll come back for a couple of the performances on the results shows,” she said.
But who is Trebunskaya rooting for now that her and her celebrity partner Drew Lachey are out of the competition?
“I’m rooting for the best dancer,” she revealed. “There’s so much talent there. I think the athletes are doing fantastic and so I think they’re going to kill it.”
Dancing With the Stars: All Stars airs Mondays at 8PM ET on ABC.
