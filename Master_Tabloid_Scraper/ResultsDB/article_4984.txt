Romeo & Chelsie Hightower: Why We Kissed on the Lips  /n

They could have saved the smooching for after the judging – when they received their first perfect 10 of the season. But Romeo went in for a liplock with his Dancing with the Stars partner Chelsie Hightower right after completing their waltz Monday night.  
“What I said tonight, basically, was, ‘If you want to [kiss me], go ahead,’ ” Hightower told PEOPLE after the show. “You can do it on the cheek, forehead or lips – but you don’t want to plan it too much.”  
The pair, who danced to “My Heart Will Go On” from Titanic, said the kiss added to the drama and intensity of the moment. 
“I think it was emotional,” said Hightower. “I felt it.”  
“I was in character,” Romeo said. “I was feeling like Jack from Titanic.”  
Added the rapper of the experience, which ultimately landed the pair in a tie for first place with 28 points: “It definitely put the icing on the cake for our dance.”
