Chelsie Hightower Reveals Her Top 3 Holiday Health Tips/n
Ever wonder how the pros on Dancing with the Stars get such amazing bodies? Lots of work, of course!    
With the holiday season in full swing, pro Dancing stars Chelsie Hightower, Edyta Sliwinska and Kym Johnson teamed up for two exercise DVDs that will help stave off those unwanted holiday pounds.   
“Honestly, I was huffing and puffing the whole time,” Hightower tells PEOPLE of the DVDs, Fat Burning Cardio Dance and Ballroom Buns and Abs.   
While many would find it hard to believe that any of these women have trouble maintaining their figures, Hightower says that there’s a huge drop-off in their activity levels at the end of every season.

“When we’re on the show we’re rehearsing eight hours a day, so it’s not a problem,” Hightower says. “We’re human and we have to watch what we eat – well, I definitely do!”   
Hightower says she follows three basic rules in between seasons:   
• Eat what you want – in moderation: “It’s unrealistic to not eat the good things around the holidays. If you deprive yourself, you’ll want something even more, give in and then feel bad about it later.”   
• Do something active every day: “Every single day I do at least an hour of something – DVD workouts, dance, I use stretch bands.  And when I’m traveling, I work out at the hotel.”   
• Don’t go it alone: “Anytime I want to buckle down and do something, my mom and I do it together.  When you have a buddy, you have someone to talk to, to motivate you.”
