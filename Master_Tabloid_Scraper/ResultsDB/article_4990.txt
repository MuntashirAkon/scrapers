Prior to her Today appearance, E! News caught up with the actress at the Rock the Kasbah premiere at AMC Loews Lincoln Square 13 in New York City Monday night, where she admitted to suffering from restless nights at home with her mini-me. "Jacob might be more sleep-deprived but better able to function," Zooey said with a laugh. "I'm a better sleeper than Jacob, but I still am sleep deprived nonetheless."Even on date nights, Jacob said, "I hear the baby all the time."In Rock the Kasbah, Zooey plays an aspiring musician whose manager (Bill Murray) decides to take her on a USO tour of Afghanistan. "I was so lucky to watch him work. He's amazing and so much fun. He's kind one of those actors that's always fun to watch," Zooey raved of the comedic actor, adding, "He's the king!"Kate Hudson also stars in the comedy, though she does not share any scenes with Zooey; The same was true of their star-making turns in Cameron Crowe's 2000 comedy-drama Almost Famous. "We also went to high school together, too. She was a year older than me, so we definitely saw each other in high school, but never since then," Zooey told E! News of her co-star. "We are just trying to build up the interest and eventually we'll do a movie where we have a scene together."(E! and NBC are both members of the NBCUniversal family.)
