Yara Shahidi is just like any other teen—her bedroom is her safe haven. As she juggles college prep, senior year of high school, homework, chores, her role on Blackish (plus, a potential spinoff with a starring role) and public appearances, this 17-year-old needs a place of refuge more than the average person. "My room is really the center of how I run my personal empire. It's the center of it—the kingdom and the castle," she said.The actress enlisted help from PBTeen and the Laurel & Wolf online interior design service to create a room fit for a queen...or a Harvard student. The designers prioritized a place to study, while keeping the interiors youthful and lively. The result: a functional, cool-toned space that represents Yara's authenticity and interests.

"It was a room just to basically go to sleep in and then wake up and do other things in. But now, [with the help from Laurel & Wolf], I can LIVE in my room," the actress said.
