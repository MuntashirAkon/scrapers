Katy Perry didn't get paid to sing Saturday night.Instead, the pop princess freely shared her talents with the rest of the attendees at Shannon Woodward's birthday party at Blind Dragon in West Hollywood. Joined by boyfriend Orlando Bloom—plus actress Kate Micucci—Perry rocked out to Alanis Morissette's "U Oughta Know."According to MSNBC personality Ronan Farrow, who shared pictures from the party via his Instagram account over the weekend, Woodward's friends were "killing it" with the '90s cover.

One of Farrow's photos showed Perry performing as Bloom rocked out near Delilah owner Markus Molinari. "When your friends commit to the Karaoke," Farrow wrote in the caption. Perry also documented the sing-along on Snapchat, sharing a video of Bloom and co. singing Avril Lavigne's hit "Complicated." She added the caption, "This is what the holidays looks like."Hours before the party began, Woodward celebrated her birthday on Twitter. "32 years ago today, my mom had the most painful night of her life," tweeted the actress, who plays Elsie Hughs in the HBO show Westworld. "Thanks for letting me grow inside you like a tumor, mom!"

Jokes aside, Woodward tweeted, "Thanks for all the bday wishes, tweeps!"One can only imagine what will go down when Bloom turns 40 on Jan. 13, 2017.

The party continued into Sunday when Perry and Bloom visited Disneyland in Anaheim, Calif.—less than three months after the couple toured Tokyo Disneyland with the actor's 5-year-old son. "Hyperspace Sundaze w/ these goof balls," Perry's stylist, Johnny Wujek, wrote in an Instagram caption. "@disneyland thanks for the ride. #tistheseason #sundayfunday WE OUT."
