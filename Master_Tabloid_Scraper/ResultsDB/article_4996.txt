It's a girl!Ioan Gruffudd and Alice Evans just welcomed their second daughter last month, a few days before the little one's actual due date!The couple said in a statement to E! News exclusively, "We are beyond thrilled to announce the arrival of our daughter, Elsie Marigold, on September 13th. A little sister for Ella Betsi. We both feel very grateful and very blessed."Gruffudd originally revealed to Us Magazine that his wife's due date was on Sept 25, but it looks like their new bundle of joy just couldn't wait any longer to meet her family.The couple met on the set of 102 Dalmatians back in 2000 and became husband and wife seven years later in an intimate ceremony in Mexico.

So how will their first daughter handle being a big sibling?"She'll be 4 by the time the baby arrives, so I think she'll cope quite well with it," Gruffudd told the magazine over the summer."She's very excited about the idea. I'm sure there will be jealousy and envy and all that stuff, but more than anything, she's really excited about it."The actor seems to be taking some time off to spend with his newborn but he most recently appeared on an episode of Glee this season.Congratulations to the new family of four!â€”Reporting by Ruth O'Neill
