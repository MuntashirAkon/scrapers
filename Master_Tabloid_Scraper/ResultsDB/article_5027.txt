Orlando Bloom may be off the market again.

The Pirates of the Caribbean hunk recently ignited reconciliation rumors when he was spotted riding off on a motorcycle with ex-girlfriend Katy Perry after an Ed Sheeran concert in Los Angeles. The couple — who dated for 10 months but broke things off this spring to take “respectful, loving space” — were photographed looking awfully cozy in the crowd, sparking speculations that the relationship is on again.
While the actor kept quiet as her jetted out of Los Angeles Tuesday, August 15th, amid reports of a rekindled romance, word has he is hoping to get back together with the “Swish Swish” singer.
“They have never cut communication since they broke up,” an insider told E! News. “They just took a break because it was the best thing for them at that time, [but they] are seeing each other again.”

“Katy and Orlando want this to work this time, so they are working on mending their relationship,” the source added. “They’ve had some really good talks and have a better understanding on their needs. Time will tell at this point, but [things are] looking very positive.”
Of course, both stars are no strangers to hooking up with an ex.
Katy famously broke up and reconciled with John Mayer for three years. After several splits, they called it quits once and for all in July 2015.
Meanwhile, Orlando was on and off with Kate Bosworth from 2002 to 2006.
