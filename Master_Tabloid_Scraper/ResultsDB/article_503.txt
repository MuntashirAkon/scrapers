New Dad George Raises Stink Over Dirty Diaper Duty!/n
The thrill of being first-time parents after the birth of their twins is over for movie hunk George Clooney and his wife Amal — who are now bickering over the stinky job of changing diapers, sources say.
Shortly after welcoming daughter Ella and son Alexander on June 6, the power couple began trying to dodge diaper duty, an insider claims.
“George considers changing diapers beneath him,” blabs the insider. “In his mind, it’s not his job.”

But Amal has told him it’s what he signed up for, so deal with it!”
With George at 56 and Amal at age 39, the two are latecomers to the parenting game. When they wed in 2014, human rights lawyer Amal was still insisting on continuing her career. George was busy producing and acting.
But when the twins arrived, the couple was gushing the babies were fine and joked their father “is sedated and should recover in a few days.”

Now, they’ve got delightful double trouble on their hands, but are still trying to figure out who does what.
While George is OK with feeding the kids when the nannies aren’t around, the source says, “He’s not so keen on wiping the kids’ butts and cleaning up after them when there’s throw-up.”
Meanwhile, Amal doesn’t want to just leave the kids with the nannies 24-7, “and it irks her that George won’t get his hands dirty.”
Says the source, “It will explode into all-out war if they don’t compromise!”
