Kate Hudson has bid farewell to her signature blonde locks.

The actress recently shaved off all of her hair for an top secret project. She looked nearly unrecognizable as she was photographed getting a buzz cut — à la Britney Spears circa 2007 — in Los Angeles.
Via TMZ:
Kate Hudson has pulled a G.I. Jane (and countless other badass Hollywood heroines) by completely shaving her famous golden locks … and like all of them, she looks great.
Kate was seen on set Tuesday in L.A. for a new flick she’s working on with Sia, and she’s rocking a new shaved ‘do for the role.
Gotta say, as well as she wears it … we almost didn’t recognize her here at first.
See her dramatic transformation over at TMZ…
