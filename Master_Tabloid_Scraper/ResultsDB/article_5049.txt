Kate Middleton Stuns Again in Alexander McQueen Dress She Wore to Princess Charlotte's Christening While the main piece was the same, Kate wore a different fascinator and added a poppy broach, as well as grey pumps and matching purse.  .../n
Kate Middleton may be royalty but she's certainly not above wearing the same outfit twice, and why should she be? The mother of two's got one of the most fabulous wardrobes in the world—so it's no wonder that the 35-year-old would choose to rewear some of her favorite pieces time and time again.Earlier today, the Duchess joined her husband in Belgium for the official commemorations marking the 100th anniversary of the Battle of Passchendaele. At the event, Prince William spoke to a crowd at the Menin Gate monument in Ypres.For the ceremony, William wore a regal blue suite and red and blue tie. Meanwhile his lady love opted to wear a stark white Alexander McQueen coat dress, the very same one that the Duchess of Cambridge wore to daughter Princess Charlotte's christening on July 5, 2015.

While the main piece was the same, Kate wore a different fascinator and added a poppy broach, as well as grey pumps and matching purse. The event today was in honor of three months of conflict in 1917, which resulted in more than half a million casualties, 325,000 Allied soldiers and 260,000 to 400,000 Germans, in the Belgian battlefields.According the BBC, William said in his speech, "Members of our families; our regiments; our nations; all sacrificed everything for the lives we live today. During the First World War Britain and Belgium stood shoulder to shoulder. One hundred years on, we still stand together, gathering as so many do every night, in remembrance of that sacrifice."

Alexander McQueen is a favorite designer of the Duchess'—her wedding dress was also designed by the label.
