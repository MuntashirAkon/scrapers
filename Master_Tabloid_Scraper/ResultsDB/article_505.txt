Billion Dollar Babies! Inside The Lavish Lifestyles Of George & Amal's Twins/n
George and Amal Clooney might be worth a combined $260m, but insiders say their newborn twins will be worth four times that by the time they turn 21.
“Ella and Alexander are going to be heirs to an insane amount of money – and not all of it from their parents either,” an insider told RadarOnline.com
Amal’s folks are extremely wealthy, as are George’s, whose dad boasts a successful career as a broadcaster.

George is no bum either, having just sold his tequila business for a cool $1 billion. Not to mention being one of the highest paid actors in Hollywood.
The happy couple have reportedly already overhauled their finances, with a string of clever trust funds that will maximize the kids’ fortunes, as well as new wills, insurance and even investments.
And when it comes to the safety and comfort of the twins, they are sparing no expense.

As Radar revealed, papa and mama Clooney have hired each of the twins their own bodyguards to follow their every move — inside and outside the house.
The new “baby bouncers”, who were even ordered to stand guard in the nursery, are reportedly costing the couple over $318,000 a year. But that’s chump change considering the windfall headed the twins’ way.
“They’re easily going to be worth a billion bucks by the time they’re old enough to inherit,” the source confided. “But Amal’s insisting they get one chunk at 21 and another at age 30.”
