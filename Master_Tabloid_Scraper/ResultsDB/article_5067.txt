SNL's Trump Team Sings 'Hallelujah' for Season Finale Cold Open/nDonald Trump, Kellyanne Conway and the rest of the White House team sang a song of hope to fire up the season finale of SNL ... just like Hillary Clinton did 6 months ago. Alec Baldwin as Trump began playing the opening chords to  "Hallelujah " during the cold open, and was soon joined by Conway, Mike Pence and a good chunk of his WH staff. Melissa McCarthy's Sean Spicer was noticeably absent. Anyway, the sing-along might ring a bell -- Kate McKinnon did the song as Clinton the weekend after the presidential election ... telling America she wasn't giving up and they shouldn't either.   Baldwin's Trump has a similar message, but a different (and hilarious) rationale. /n
