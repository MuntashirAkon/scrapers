 The Truth Behind Mika & Joe’s Mar-a-Lago Visit- ‘They Were All Over Each Other'.../n
Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough finally came clean about their relationship when they got engaged last month in France, but RadarOnline.com has learned exclusively that the Morning Joe couple had been romantically involved with one another long before they officially came out as a couple.
In the several months leading up to their engagement, the duo worked hard at hiding their relationship, “pretending” they weren’t “together.” But, according to an insider super close to the situation, the co-hosts of the politically charged MSNBC morning show couldn’t contain themselves during their visit to President Donald Trump’s Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago, this past New Year’s.
An eyewitness, who was at Mar-a-Lago at the time, reveals to Radar exclusively, “Joe and Mila were all over each other!”

“They were not hiding the fact they were in a relationship,” our informant snitches, noting, “It was sickening to see, especially because they were pretending at that time they weren’t together.”
Brzezinski divorced her husband of 23 years, James Hoffer, in January 2016. But the divorce wasn’t without scandal, as many believed her romantic involvement with her Morning Joe co-host had caused the split.
Scarborough was divorced from his wife of 10 years, Susan Waren, in 2013.
