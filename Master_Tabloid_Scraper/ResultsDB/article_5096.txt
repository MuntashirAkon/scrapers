Heather Heyer's Mother Tells Good Morning America She Has 'No Interest' In Speaking With President Trump/n

Heather Heyer's mother couldn't be more disappointed in Donald Trump.
As you surely know, Susan Bro lost her daughter on Saturday after a car rammed into a crowd of counter-protesters at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. While Bro initially thanked POTUS for condemning those who promote violence, she has since changed her opinion of the president following his controversial press conference this week.

Susan explained to Good Morning America's Robin Roberts:
"I hadn't really watched the news until last night and I'm not talking to the president now, after what he said. It's not that I saw somebody else's tweets about him, I saw an actual clip of him at a press conference equating the protesters … with the KKK and the white supremacists…. You can't wash this one away by shaking my hand and saying, ‘I'm sorry.' I'm not forgiving for that."
Hear! Hear!
Although POTUS and his team have reached out to Susan on a number of occasions, Susan feels this outpouring of support is simply a part of a "political agenda" and she is "resistant to that." Now that Susan has laid her daughter to rest, she hopes to "forward Heather's mission." We're sure Heather would be so proud of her mother.
