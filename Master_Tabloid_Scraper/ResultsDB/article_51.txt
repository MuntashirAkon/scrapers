The Kate Effect has no affect on Margaret Atwood.We know this to be true because during a Fashion and Fiction panel at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London on March 13, the Canadian author expressed how unimpressed she is with Kate Middleton's style."I think she dresses quite uneventfully," the 75-year-old said.  "I think she's watching her back. I think she probably has people who pretty much tell her what is appropriate for her to wear. I don't think she'll become the fashion plate that [Princess] Diana was, and I think she's probably doing that advisedly, would you say?"

Oooh, burn! Except not.The poet went on to say that she not exactly an expert on the Duchess of Cambridge's fashion, mainly because she doesn't care that much. "To be honest with you, I haven't paid that much attention. But why would I, really? Too old."That's OK, Margaret. We'll be obsessed enough for the both of us.
