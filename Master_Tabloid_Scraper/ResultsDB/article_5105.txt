Lady Gaga will replace Beyoncé as this year’s headlining act at Coachella after Beyoncé postponed her performance next year due to her pregnancy.

Gaga will perform both weekends of the festival on Saturday, April 15, and Saturday, April 22 at Empire Polo Grounds in Indio, Calif. According to Billboard, the festival organizers are “finalizing plans” to bring Gaga’s large production to life.
The “Million Reasons” singer officially announced the news on social media on Tuesday night (Feb. 28, 2017). “Let’s party in the desert!” she wrote, sharing the updated poster below.

Last week, Beyoncé, who is pregnant with twins, announced that she would be dropping out of this year’s festival based on advice from her doctor.
“Following the advice of her doctors to keep a less rigorous schedule in the coming months, Beyoncé has made the decision to forgo performing at the 2017 Coachella Valley Music & Arts Festival,” read the official statement. “However, Goldenvoice and Parkwood are pleased to confirm that she will be a headliner at the 2018 festival. Thank you for your understanding.”
