Lindsay Lohan claims she was “racially profiled” in London’s Heathrow Airport while wearing a headscarf.

The actress, who said that she is studying Islam but did not confirm if she is converting to the religion, explained the incident to Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid on Tuesday’s Good Morning Britain.
“When I was flying to New York recently, I was wearing a headscarf and I got stopped at the airport and racially profiled for the first time in my life… at Heathrow Airport,” said Lohan. “She opened my passport and saw ‘Lindsay Lohan’ and started immediately apologizing but then said, ‘Please take off your headscarf’.'”

Lohan was reportedly wearing a headscarf because she was returning from a trip to Turkey, where she wore one as a sign of “personal respect.” She said that she obliged by taking it off when the airport employee asked her to do so.
“But what scared me at that moment was, how would another woman who doesn’t feel comfortable taking off her headscarf feel? That was really interesting to me,” Lohan continued, saying that she was “in shock.”
“It was jarring. I got double checked until she realized,” said Lohan. “It was strange.”
