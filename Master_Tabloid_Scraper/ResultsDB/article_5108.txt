Last year, the subject of HBO’s The Jinx, Robert Durst, admitted in an interview that he was high on meth throughout the taping of the shocking docuseries. Now it’s been revealed that the real estate mogul also admitted that his health is failing.

“I’m told my life expectancy is about five years,” he mentioned during the jailhouse interview, via People, in March 2015.
Since 2007, Durst has attempted to recover from esophageal cancer, but sections of the interview’s transcript continue to reinforce that his time is limited.

“There’s not much that I could agree with with anybody that somebody could offer me, unless they could offer me more life,” he stated before adding, “I just have no idea how we could reach an agreement on something.”
In The Jinx, it is implied that he had a hand in the disappearance of his first wife Kathleen Durst in 1982 and a friend named Susan Berman, who was found shot to death in her L.A. home in 2000.
Durst was arrested in New Orleans the day before the docuseries’ finale aired and is now awaiting trial for Berman’s death.
