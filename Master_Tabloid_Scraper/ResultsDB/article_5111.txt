Susan Olsen, who is most well-known for her role as Cindy Brady on The Brady Bunch, has been fired as the co-host of “Two Chicks Talkin’ Politics” after homophobic comments she made recently surfaced.

Page Six reports LA Talk Radio announced they wouldn’t tolerate hate speech and decided to part ways with Olsen on Friday (Dec. 9, 2016) after comments the radio host made to openly gay actor Leon Acord-Whiting surfaced online. UsWeekly reports the confrontation began after Acord-Whiting criticized Olsen after being a guest on the show on Dec. 7, 2016.

After the show, Acord-Whiting took to Facebook and accused Olsen of spreading “outrageous misinformation” after a heated debate about politics and urged the station to fire the co-host for being unprofessional. Olsen responded a day later on her Facebook page writing, “This is the little piece of human waste. He blocked himself from me before I could even get one hit in. If you can find him, please send him my love.”
Even though Olsen claims not to have been able to contact Acord-Whiting, soon after the actor shared screenshots of the hate filled message the co-host sent him in which she openly used an offensive term for gay men.
