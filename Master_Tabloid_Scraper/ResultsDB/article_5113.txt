On Sunday night (Dec. 4, 2016), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced that the Dakota Access Pipeline will be rerouted, away from Lake Oahe in North Dakota.

The decision was a cause for celebration for the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and their supporters, who have camped out and protested against the pipeline project with the argument that it would threaten the water source of the tribe’s nearby reservation. According to ABC News, authorities will not forcibly remove the protesters despite the government’s deadline to leave on Monday (Dec. 5, 2016). It is uncertain as to what the next steps in the project will be when pipeline supporter President-elect Donald Trump takes office in January, which is why protestors refuse to leave just yet.
Shailene Woodley, who was arrested on-camera in October while protesting DAPL, reacted to Sunday’s news on social media when it was announced.

Per U.S. tradition, took WAAAY too long for gov't leadership to stop this disgusting, tyrannical violence. UNITY still has value. #NoDAPL
