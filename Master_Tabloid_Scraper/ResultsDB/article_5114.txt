Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom are standing with those who are protesting the Dakota Access Pipeline.

Adding their famous voices to the conversation against the controversial project, the couple threw their support for the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation and argued against the construction of an oil carrying pipeline that will cross ancient burial grounds and put water supply at risk.
“Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with what is going on in North Dakota. While it may not be on your front pages, this is not a frightening series of events for ‘them’, it is frightening series of events for all of us,” Perry wrote in a lengthy Instagram post over Thanksgiving weekend. “The pipeline in question, would carry crude oil through land sacred to indigenous peoples and put a crucial water supply at risk. We have seen the results of unintended oil spills before and they are crippling to the health of the surrounding people and environment.”
She added, “To all those peacefully protesting to protect history, to protect that which is personally sacred and to protect our life sustaining water sources, we are here shoulder to shoulder with you across this country. We cannot afford to be complacent with our rights and we cannot afford to be complacent with the rights of our neighbor.”



On #Thanksgiving, a day with complex origins, I want to speak up in support of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation and their protest of the Dakota Access Pipeline. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with what is going on in North Dakota. While it may not be on your front pages, this is not a frightening series of events for “them”, it is frightening series of events for all of us. The pipeline in question, would carry crude oil through land sacred to indigenous peoples and put a crucial water supply at risk. We have seen the results of unintended oil spills before and they are crippling to the health of the surrounding people and environment. To all those peacefully protesting to protect history, to protect that which is personally sacred and to protect our life sustaining water sources, we are here shoulder to shoulder with you across this country. We cannot afford to be complacent with our rights and we cannot afford to be complacent with the rights of our neighbor. Testimonies from the protests alarm me and should alarm all of us: Some 400 people who were held in detention during demonstrations have suffered what Mr. Kiai (UN Special Rapporteur) called “inhuman and degrading conditions.” He is concerned over both the scale of arrests and the conditions in which American citizens are being held.“ Marking people with numbers and detaining them in overcrowded cages, on the bare concrete floor, without being provided with medical care, amounts to inhuman and degrading treatment,” he said. Protestors have reported facing rubber bullets, teargas, mace, compression grenades, and bean-bag rounds while voicing their concerns over the environmental impact of the pipeline and throughout their attempts to protect burial grounds and other sites that are sacred to the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. – UN.org During this holiday and beyond, let us stand in solidarity with all those who are trying to protect it.

Echoing her sentiments, Bloom also shared a message of his own protesting the pipeline. On his own Instagram, the actor wrote:

This #thanksgiving we cannot stand idly by while so many stand in solidarity on the front line to protect the most essential of human needs on sacred land. USA pls text WATER to 82623 to donate whatever you can. Be on the right side of history.

Perry and Bloom were later seen boarding a private jet together on Sunday (Nov. 27, 2016) in Van Nuys, Calif.

The duo now join the likes of Mark Ruffalo and Susan Sarandon as celebrities who’ve publicly condemned the construction of the pipeline. As previously reported, Shailene Woodley was arrested in October over trespassing charges after she was found participating in a peaceful protest.
