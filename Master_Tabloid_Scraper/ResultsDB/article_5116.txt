Susan Lucci is living the Hamptons dream, complete with a heavenly ceiling.
The TV veteran, 70, who starred as Erica Kane on All My Children for over 40 years, opens up the elegant beach house she shares with her husband, Helmet Huber, on the next episode of Open House.

Of the living room’s stunning double-height windows offering picturesque vistas out to the Atlantic Ocean, Lucci notes, “we didn’t want to put anything on the windows. We didn’t want to distract from that beautiful view.” And just in case there wasn’t enough blue sky visible in the space, Huber brought a little extra inside.
On the ceiling of the soaring room, a scene of clouds and sky mimics the one outdoors. The decorative painting was a gift from Lucci’s husband of 48 years. “I went away to do a movie for TV, I came home, and Helmut had an artist come in and paint all of that on the ceiling,” she explains. “He took my breath away.”
