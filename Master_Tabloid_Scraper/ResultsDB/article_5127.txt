Susan Sarandon Is Having the Worst Time at the Democratic National Convention/n
Sarandon is a known Democrat and Bernie Sanders supporter, who has criticized Hillary Clinton throughout her campaign, calling her more "dangerous" thanÂ Donald Trump, especially following the DNC email leaks."That's so disgusting," Sarandon said in an interview with Jordan Chariton of The Young Turks, a popular progressive online network (via The Hill)."The critical question is, does it matter? Nixon resigned when they broke into the [DNC] headquarters...and now you found out all this tampering went on. What does this really say about us if all of this goes by unattended?"She went on to explain why she understands voters are so inclined to stick with Sanders or Trump. "A lot of people felt disenfranchised. A lot of people are working so hard and getting nowhere. A lot of people are sick with politics the way it is," she said."And Bernie and Trump spoke to those people."
