Let us not forget: Susan Sarandon has street cred. The 68-year-old Academy Award winner, who is a staunch supporter of marijuana legalization, took to Twitter on Wednesday after listening to A$AP Rocky and Action Bronson's hit "1Train," in which the Thelma and Louise star receives a shout-out. "Hey @asvpxrocky & @ActionBronson thx for the shout out on "1Train," the Tammy star, who also happens to be a grandmother, wrote. "Not sure what it means, but let's blaze one & talk about it some time." Coolest grandma ever?!

Sarandon also said marijuana is far more effective than alcohol as a means to relax. "That's the great thing about smoking weed: if you lead a very, very busy life, for me, it really makes the most of your weekend," she said. "It like, triples, your weekends. If you only have certain windows to get high, it allows you to slow down and really be there...Smoking helps you to connect again–to be present and conscious." She added: "As I've explained to my kids, weed helps you take a break from a very busy life. But you'll never have a really full life if you are stoned constantly from a young age."
