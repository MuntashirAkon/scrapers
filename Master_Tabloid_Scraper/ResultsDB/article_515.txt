Say What? Learn Teen Slang With Iggy Azalea!/n
Ready to get lit with your on fleek squad and goals ship? If that sounds like gibberish, Seth Meyers and special guest Iggy Azalea may just be the help you need!
The “Fancy” rapper, 25, appeared on the show last night to help Meyers, 42, understand the latest in modern slang.
During the bit, Meyers would introduce a word and its definition, and then Azalea would provide a sentence. 
One hilarious example was the word “Brooch-ella” which Meyers defines as, “a concert attended by mostly middle-aged ladies.” 
Then Azalea provided a sentence with the word in it. “My mom and Aunt Cathy are dragging me to a Celine Dion concert this weekend. #Brooch-ella.”
