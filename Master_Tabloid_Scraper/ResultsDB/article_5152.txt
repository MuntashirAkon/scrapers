Robert Durst -- Police Raid Houston Home/nCops are tearing through Robert Durst's Houston home right now ... possibly seeking evidence in the Susan Berman murder case. Several marked and unmarked Houston PD cars pulled up outside Durst's high-rise complex Tuesday afternoon. The subject of HBO's  "The Jinx "Â docuseries is still sitting in a New Orleans jail following his weekend arrest, and awaiting extradition to L.A to face a murder one charge. It's unclear if the search warrant relates to the murder case ... or if cops in NOLA are trying to build a separate case. Cops there say Durst had a gun and drugs when he was arrested -- and there's a possibility he could face charges./n
