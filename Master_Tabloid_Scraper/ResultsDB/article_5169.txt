Making final wedding plans today bf she takes off for Spokane today.  Can't believe my girl is going to be married in about 20 days.

This isn't the first time Amy has shown us her wild side. As previously reported by Radar, the reality TV matriarch's gal pals threw her a lavish ‚ÄúGrandma Shower‚Äù ahead of the birth of her two grandchildren where she downed champagne while opening X-rated gifts, including a risque pink thong!Photo credit: Instagram/@amyjroloff

I think wine tasting is my new favorite hobby. üíõüç∑üíã A post shared by Tori Roloff (@toriroloff) on Jul 16, 2017 at 2:49pm PDT
Because what's a party without spirits to sip on? The ladies made sure Molly's cup was always full. "I think wine tasting is my new favorite hobby," Tori posted alongside an Intagram shot of the bride-to-be posing with a big glass of ros√©. Photo credit: Instagram/@toriroloff
