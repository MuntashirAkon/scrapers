In a statement to the Associated Press, Cole’s family shared that when the “Unforgettable” singer underwent a kidney transplant in 2009 after struggling with problems related to Hepatitis C, she was also diagnosed with pulmonary arterial hypertension, a rare lung disease causing shortness of breath, dizziness and sometimes chest pain.
“(Cole) responded well to pulmonary arterial hypertension-specific agents over many years, during which she performed many concerts world-wide, but eventually succumbed to intractable right heart failure, an outcome that unfortunately commonly occurs in this progressive disorder,” the statement read.
The legendary singer’s years of drug use caused many health problems later in life, leading to her untimely death.
