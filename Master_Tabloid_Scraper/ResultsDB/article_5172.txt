Inside ‘Little People’ Star Molly Roloff’s Low-Budget Wedding Registry!/n
Little People star Molly Roloff is gearing up to get hitched come August 5, and RadarOnline.com has the exclusive first look at Matt and Amy’s daughter’s wedding registry! Unlike her reality star family, Molly leads a much more private and humble life so it comes as no surprise that the 23-year-old is requesting modestly priced gifts as she prepares to walk down the aisle to wed her mystery fiancé, Joel Silvius.
Molly will tie the knot surrounded by her friends and family this summer, but in the meantime, they can help her set up her own house with a variety of down-home gifts from Crate and Barrel as well as Bed Bath & Beyond.
The reality star is staying true to her humble ways, with most gifts under $100. The least expensive item on the list is a $0.99 glass spice jar from Bed Bath & Beyond. On the other end of the spectrum, the most expensive gift is a $399.99 10-piece nonstick ceramic-coated stainless steel cookware set.

Her wedding attendees can also purchase a insulated lunch bag for $19.99, an 11-bottle graphite wine rack for $49.95, a $7.95 butter dish or $14.99 oven mits. Molly has also requested bath towels and place settings — in sets of four! We wonder who else might be joining them?
The couple met while attending Whitworth University, and currently resides in Spokane.
