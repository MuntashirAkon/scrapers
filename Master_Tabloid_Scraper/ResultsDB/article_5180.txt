Not surprising anyone, the businessman held firm on his crazy policies including building a wall on the U.S./Mexico border, eliminating Obamacare, and his belief that waterboarding is an effective form of torture. Yes, you heard that right!
During the hour-long special, people couldn't help but give their two cents on Twitter. Whether they support Drumpf or not, they were definitely tweeting away!
See all the best reactions (below)! 

It feels like @DavidMuir is interviewing someone in a mental health facility who thinks they are President w/ this rambling. #POTUSonABC

Trump repeats a series of lies saying "#Obamacare is a disaster."
He says it does nothing for anyone.
