All The Best Moments From Ben Higgins & Lauren Bushnell's Vegas Bachelor & Bachelorette Parties!/n

When going on The Bachelor goes right!
Season 20 winners Ben Higgins and Lauren Bushnell may not have a wedding date set in stone yet, but that didn't stop them from celebrating with all their pals from Bachelor Nation!
The 28-year-old and the former flight attendant — who met just over a year ago — are in Vegas this week (together, but separately, it seems) to have some Sin City fun ahead of their upcoming nuptials.
Whether the reality TV squad was hanging by the pool, singing karaoke, or busting out the dance moves, it looks like a fun time was had by all!

Although love doesn't often last on the ABC hit show, it certainly looks like some strong friendships were made!
Congrats, Ben and Lauren!
