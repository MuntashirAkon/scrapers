Listen To This: Caught Up In All Of Her Feelings/n

In the history of music, there's just always been a shelf life for boy bands and girl groups.
Sadly, one of our faves - The Saturdays - have gone on a "break". A long and indefinite break!
But, from the ashes of that girl group rises Mollie King!
The blonde British beauty has struck out with her debut solo single and it is destined to be a huge smash in the U.K.!
Back To You sounds like a great single from Cheryl - and we mean that as a huge compliment!
Will the U.S. receive her warmly? Will she even try to crack America? We hope the answer is yes for both!
Check out Back To You above!
