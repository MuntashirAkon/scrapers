Prince Harry might seem like a party animal, but he longs to settle down and start a family — once he finds the right woman.
During Katie Couric’s ABC special The Jubilee Queen Tuesday, the single 27-year-old revealed:
“I’ve longed for kids since I was very, very young. And so I’m just waiting to find the right person, someone who’s willing to take on the job.”
Does the sexy prince have any suitors? 

“I don’t have anyone,” he told Couric during the interview.
He and Chelsy Davy, 26, ended their five-year relationship in 2009, but have remained amicable since the split. Harry has also been linked to several British women including The Saturdays singer Mollie King.
