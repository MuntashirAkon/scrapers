Healthy Sexy Hair Soy Tri-Wheat Treatment: An  intense hydrator with natural emollients from pure cocoa beans, plus  strengthening soy proteins. When used weekly, this treatment revives  each strand and locks in moisture, making hair instantly healthy  looking, shiny, more manageable and less prone to breakage.
