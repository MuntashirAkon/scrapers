Mollie King of The Saturdays Won't Have a One Night Stand/n
She’s laughed off reports that she’s dating Prince Harry – and now the The Saturdays’ Mollie King says she’s still reveling in the single life. But there is one thing she’d like prospective dates to know about her.  
“I’ve never had a one night stand or sex on the first date, and I don’t think I ever would,” the music artist tells British Cosmopolitan in its March issue.  
“It’s important for a guy to know and understand me before he can even think about taking things to the next step,” King, 25, continues. 
Already a star in the U.K., the singer and her bandmates are making a splash stateside thanks to their new E! reality show, Chasing the Saturdays.  
And King has no qualms about being real – or candid – about her life off-camera, as well.  
“I’m enjoying being single,” she tells Cosmo, “and I’m definitely not gagging to be in another relationship. When I go out, I’m not going out to find a man; I’m going out to dance the night away with my best friends.”  
But if she were looking for a guy, he’d need to possess a sense of humor.  
“The most attractive thing in a man is the ability to make me laugh,” King says. “He has to be spontaneous, fun and able to banter – it’s not a job interview, it’s a date! I like day dates, and I like throwing the ball in his court.”
