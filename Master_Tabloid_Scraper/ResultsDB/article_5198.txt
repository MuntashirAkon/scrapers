Mollie King Laughs Off Prince Harry Dating Rumors/n
Prince Harry‘s rumored love interest, British pop star Mollie King, has coyly denied rumors that the two are an item – but one of her bandmates is pressing for a connection to the Royals for a different reason.  
“No, no,” King, laughing, told a BBC reporter when asked if she were dating the prince. (Watch the interview here.)  
But as King, 24, demurred, Rochelle Wiseman, one of her bandmates in girl group The Saturdays, jumped in and said she’d support the relationship.  
“This story, I’m more excited about than Mollie is, because I’m like, if this is true, I wanna meet Kate,” Wiseman gushed, referring to Prince Harry’s sister-in-law, the Duchess of Cambridge. “Forget the rumor. Kate is like … oh my God, she’s up there. Beyoncé and Kate for me are the one.”

Still, even Wiseman knocked down the rumors about King and Prince Harry, 27, saying that her Kate obsession would bar her from hanging out with the pair if they were a couple.  
“I’d be locked away if it was true,” Wiseman told the BBC. “[Mollie’s] invited me out, so that’s how you know it’s not a big deal.”
