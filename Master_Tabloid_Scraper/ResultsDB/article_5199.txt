Prince Harry Dating Mollie King, Pop Singer: Report/n
Has Prince Harry found himself a pop princess?  
The prince, 27, just back from an Easter break in Transylvania, is being linked to Mollie King, 24, a member of an all-girl group called The Saturdays.  
Harry is described by the Daily Express as “smitten” with the blonde, and, despite this still being “early days” in their relationship, the couple are said to be “head over heels” after recently spending time together in some London nightspots.   
They also reportedly shared a karaoke session with friends at London’s Bunga Bunga bar – and Ladbrokes, the betting parlor, is giving 5:1 odds that King will become Harry’s next girlfriend.

When Harry Met Mollie
It is believed King first met Harry – who’s just moved into his own bachelor pad at Kensington Palace – at a polo game a few years ago.  
And the royal links don’t end there. King’s bandmate Una Healy was at that other royal wedding last summer – that of Harry’s cousin Zara Phillips. Healy is engaged to Ben Foden, an English rugby teammate of Phillips’s husband, Mike Tindall.  
A spokesman for Prince Harry said that his office never comments on his private life. A rep for King was not available.
