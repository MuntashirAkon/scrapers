The View: Margaret Cho Openly Gay? Case Closed/n
Aging does have certain advantages. One being that, if you remove your dentures, it's so much easier to get an orthopedic shoe-clad foot into your mouth. Just ask Regis, who may have a serious contender in the boner pulling department in Barbara Walters. Seems the aging news vet watched her first DWTS, and couldn't wait to tell The View girls what she thought about Margaret Cho. And her sexuality.

In Bab's defense, it is utterly logical that, since Cho was talking about gay suicide, she therefore must be gay, because only gay people talk about that. Right? Look, last night Larry King was discussing it. And we all know what a queen he is.
