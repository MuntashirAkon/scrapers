Picks and Pans Review: Mollie Katzen's Vegetable Heaven/n
by Mollie Katzen
Even in the dark of winter, Mollie Katzen can find something to celebrate. This time, the exuberant author of the Moosewood Cookbook—one of the 10 bestselling cooking guides ever—explores the glories of vegetables in a jauntily illustrated volume influenced by cuisines around the world. Sprightly and inspired, dishes like Asparagus in Warm Tarragon-Pecan Vinaigrette, and Coconut Rice with Ginger, Chiles and Lime are within reach of even harried home cooks. A bonus is the warm advice and commentary from Katzen, a Bay Area resident who always sounds like a talented chum sharing her family favorites. (And now, she’s plying her trade on public television—in a 26-part series called Mollie Katzen’s Cooking Show: Vegetable Heaven.) (Hyperion, $27.50)
