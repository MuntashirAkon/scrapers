Twitter compliments? Mutual Brit-pop admiration? Could it be that there is a The Saturdays and One Direction cross-over romance brewing?Not so fast. True, fans of 1D and The Sats got excited when Niall Horan and Mollie King interacted on Twitter, but we can't read into it too much.When Niall caught the UK premiere of Chasing The Saturdays, he tweeted his support to the girls: "Watching 'chasing the @thesaturdays' good show! Smashin it girls," he wrote.

In response, Mollie King retweeted Niall's compliment and added her own flattery: "Thanks Niall!! Lots of love to you and the boys xx," she wrote.Naturally, since Mollie is the only single Saturday, fans were hoping that a little pre-Valentine's Day love was in the air. But Frankie Sandford has put down any hope of that."We love One Direction but they are like little brothers," she told The Sun. "I think we're a bit old for them." Hey, take it from Taylor Swift : age is just a number!Tune in this Sunday for an all-new episode of Chasing The Saturdays, 10/9c on E!
