Cosmopolitan UK

On last Sunday's episode of Chasing The Saturdays, we watched Mollie King try surfing, clubbing and everything in between to meet a new guy. But hey, if that fails she can always just try looking amazing on the cover of a magazine!Our favorite blonde Saturday is on the cover of Cosmopolitan UK in March, and along with the great pics, she also provided a peek into her personal life.

"I've never had a one-night stand or sex on the first date, and I don't think I ever would," she told Cosmo. So don't get any ideas, fellas.As for how to woo her, Mollie offers this advice: "For me, the most attractive thing in a man is the ability to make me laugh. He has to be spontaneous, fun and able to banter."Cosmo was kind enough to provide this behind-the-scenes video as well, so we can see how Mollie got all dolled up for the shoot.
