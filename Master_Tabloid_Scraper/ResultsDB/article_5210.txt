Ladies (and gentleman), it seems that Prince Harry is still up for grabs.Some of you may have felt saddened to hear that the Royal bachelor was rumored to be seeing the Saturdays singer Mollie King, but this blond bombshell just set the record straight for all of us.And it turns out, they're not linked at all!

During an interview with BBC, King was asked about whether or not all these romantic stories connected with Harry were true. Her response?A lot of laughter with a straight up, "No."But her bandmate had a lot more to say about that topic..."This story, I'm more excited about it than Mollie is, because I'm like, 'If this is true, I wanna meet Kate!' Forget the rumor. Kate is likeâ€”oh my god, she's up there...I'd be locked away if it were true. We're still cool, she's inviting me out, so that's how you know it's not true."
