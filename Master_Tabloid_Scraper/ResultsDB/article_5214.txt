Molly Sims is more than ready to welcome baby No. 3. The model-actress, now just a few weeks away from giving birth to her and hubby Scott Stuber's newborn son, stopped for a chat with E! News Friday at the sixth annual March of Dimes Celebration of Babies charity luncheon in Beverly Hills. Sims dished on all things baby, offering some insight into a recent blog post in which she teased herself for becoming a "crazy bitch.""I've just been a little bit irritated I think because I'm tired," Sims explained. "I feel like [the baby's] on my knees about to give, come out of me."As for how the 43-year-old has dealt with her "crazy hormonal" changes, Molly shared that she's kept herself busy with tidying up around the house. "I have been cleaning that effing house; I have thrown everything away," she told us, adding, "My husbands like, 'We're not going to have anything left... I did nine big trash bags of clothes out of my closet last week."

"They're so excited," Molly shared, joking, "They want him to come out just for Christmas and meet Santa then he can just go back with him. They made him a stocking even though we don't have his name yet... So it's sweet!"Sims also explained that adjusting her little ones to the forthcoming arrival has "definitely [gone] better than what I thought." She continued, "I am always worried, especially for Scarlett, but I don't know! I'm like, 'Gosh, [Brooks] has been the oldest for so long and everything revolves around him.' Like a gift came this morning for the baby and he's like, 'Is this for the baby?! He's so lucky!' I'm like, 'Are you OK?'"

Sounds like the countdown to baby is officially on!
