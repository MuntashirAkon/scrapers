Peyton Manning Slammed In New Sexual Harassment Lawsuit/n
Peyton Manning‘s squeaky-clean image has taken a serious hit. The Super Bowl-winning quarterback has been named in a new sexual harassment lawsuit against the University of Tennessee, his alma mater.
According to reports, the 39-year-old was cited in the new suit, filed by six “Jane Doe” women last week, arguing that the university allowed a “hostile sexual environment” to endure on campus.

As for Manning’s possible participation, documents reveal that the Broncos player was involved in a disputed incident back in 1996.
As Radar previously reported, while Manning insists he simply “mooned” a teammate at the time in question, then-trainer Jamie Naughright claims that the athlete placed his genitals on her face as she examined his foot.
Naughright sued Manning in 1997, but the case was later settled with an agreement that she leave the university altogether.

The most recent suit, which also accuses 10 other athletes of similar behavior, asserts that the university practiced “deliberate indifference and a clearly unreasonable response after a sexual assault that causes a student to endure additional harassment.”
Manning has yet to comment on the most recent claims against him. /n
