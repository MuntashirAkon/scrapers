Bob Saget Says Bill Cosby 'Has Been Tarnished' By Rape Allegations/n
Fuller House star Bob Saget said his one-time comedy mentor Bill Cosby “has been tarnished” permanently by accusations from scores of women claiming he drugged and sexually abused them.
Saget, 59, told HuffPost Live Tuesday how Cosby “was a mentor of mine” when he attended the star’s alma mater Philadelphia’s Temple University in the late 1970s, adding that the disgraced TV star “changed stand-up comedy” with his irreverent brand of humor.
“It’s very sad,” the former America’s Funniest Home Videos host told the outlet. “You do find out the people you look up to, unfortunately, they’re down off their throne when things like this happen.”

Saget said, “I think any human being that does things that are despicable to other human beings will be slightly tarnished by history … the man has been tarnished.
The actor said that the entire situation is “just sad for all of the people involved.” /n
