Unfortunately, actor brother Mark Wahlberg was unable to make the festivities, but sent his congratulations in an adorable Instagram video with his wife and four children.
“The national news is reporting they are in New York,” Greater St. Charles Convention and Visitors Bureau executive director Amy Egolf told the newspaper. “We are delighted to have them in St. Charles.”
McCarthy grew up outside Chicago, and after years of living in Los Angeles, she moved back to the Windy City while dating former Chicago Bears linebacker Brian Urlacher in 2012.
