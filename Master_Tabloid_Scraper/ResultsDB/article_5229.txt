 Back To His Old Ways? Scott Disick Pours Vodka Shots Over College Students, During Raucous.../n
Scott Disick looked to be back in party man mode Monday in Tucson, Arizona, as the “Lord” poured vodka over college kids as he and Kourtney Kardashian were in town to film Keeping Up With The Kardashians.
The 30-year-old hunk stood by the 34-year-old beauty as she returned to her alma mater, the University of Arizona, and received a huge response from the student body, insiders told RadarOnline.com.
“You wouldn’t believe the madness that went on last night,” a source at the bar told Radar. “The students were ecstatic and it was complete chaos.”

In one shot, we saw “Lord Disick” dispensing the booze from an upper terrace at Gentle Ben’s, the watering hole Kourt frequented as a student majoring in Theatre Arts and Spanish.
The disconcerting social media shots dovetail with recent reports that Disick has been boozing to dull the pain of his mother’s recent death.
As we previously reported, an insider told Life & Style “Scott is devastated,” and Kourtney has taken a soft-shoe approach to help him during the tough time.

“Kourtney sees him heading down a bad path again,” the source said. “She’s trying to help him through this [and] giving him the sympathy he needs.” /n
