The hundreds of people in attendance sang songs, marched against hate, and held a moment of silence for the three lives lost — counter-protester Heather Heyer, and State Troopers Jay Cullen and Berke Bate.
The school's alum Katie Couric honored the evening on Instagram, sharing: 




Never been so proud of my alma mater. I wish everyone there a wonderful year full of friendship, compassion and enlightenment. Some traditions-but not all-deserve to be preserved. #Charlottesville #uva #HoosTogetherA post shared by Katie Couric (@katiecouric) on Aug 16, 2017 at 7:41pm PDT
