The remaining dates of Ariana Grande’s Dangerous Woman tour have been suspended following the horrific suicide bombing at Manchester Arena on Monday night.

“Due to the tragic events in Manchester the Dangerous Woman tour with Ariana Grande has been suspended until we can further assess the situation and pay our proper respects to those lost,” Grande’s management told E! News in an official statement. “The London O2 shows this week have been canceled as well as all shows through June 5 in Switzerland.”
“We ask at this time that we all continue to support the city of Manchester and all those families affected by this cowardice and senseless act of violence,” the statement continued. “Our way of life has once again been threatened but we will overcome this together. Thank you.”
The tour was intended to continue through June 17, ending with a concert at the Pala Alpitour in Turin.

Live Nation is offering to reimburse tickets for concerts in England for artists including Katy Perry, Iron Maiden, KISS, Depeche Mode and others. According to TMZ, this decision came as a result of the attack at Grande’s show. U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May also fears that another attack is imminent.
