Kim Kardashian will be flying solo this year at the 2017 Met Gala, without her husband Kanye West.

Though Kardashian and West have had a trying year, West’s decision to skip Anna Wintour’s annual event is one that was made to benefit their children. A source tells E! News, “Kanye will not be attending the Met Gala and will be staying in L.A. with their kid. He and Kim are doing fine. He has been taking time off and is totally supportive of Kim attending.”
Another source added that he originally planned to attend, but later changed his mind.
“He and Kim are fine,” the second source echoed. “He will be in Los Angeles.”
