“With the daily routine of life, family and work I’m distracted all day long,” wrote Gadot. “Today I had a moment with myself when I was looking out the window at the beautiful clear blue sky and realized that I’m 9 months (!!!) pregnant and soon will have a new lovepup as an addition to our family.. could not be more grateful to the universe.”
