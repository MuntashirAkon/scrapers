The royal couple's pit stop at the Taj Mahal was very sentimental for Prince William.

Almost 20 years later, Prince William is finally ready to visit the place where Princess Diana died.

The 34-year-old stepped foot in Paris for the first time since his mother’s passing on Friday (March 17, 2017). He was joined by wife Kate Middleton as he met with French President Francois Hollande at the Elysee Palace on the first day of his two-day tour.
That same night, the royal couple hosted a black-tie dinner at the British embassy, where they dined on langoustine and roast lamb alongside guests such as Oscar-winning actress Kristin Scott Thomas and Givenchy designer Clare Waight Keller. William opted for classic black suit, while Kate wore a silver, floor-length gown.

William and Kate, 35, are in the City of Lights acting as goodwill ambassadors for Britain just as the sovereign state prepares to leave the European Union. Though the parents-of-two will continue to visit landmarks around the city this weekend, officials say they have no plans for William to stop by the site of his mother’s fatal car crash at the Pont de l’Alma tunnel.
Princess Diana passed away in 1997 when William was just 15.
