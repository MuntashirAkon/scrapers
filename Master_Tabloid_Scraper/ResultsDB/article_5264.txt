They're back!After their temporary shelving late last year, the Latino-honoring entertainment awards are back, slightly retooled and better than ever for another go this year, with nominees for the 2011 NCLR ALMA Awards announced bright and early this morning.Back as always to host the do is Eva Longoria, who'll be joined this year by George Lopez. And—perhaps in an attempt to make it up to fans who missed out last year—this time, the public is king. To say nothing of the Hollywood royalty that made the nomination cut…

Leading the spicy pack this year are Christina Aguilera and Selena  Gomez, each of whom scored three nods for their triple-threat work on  the big, small and musical screens, getting pitted against each other  for Favorite Female Music Artist and Favorite Movie  Actress—Comedy/Musical, for Burlesque and Monte Carlo, respectively.Up against them in the former category is Jennifer Lopez, Naya Rivera and Shakira; in the latter category, they face off against The Other  Guys' Eva Mendes and Bad Teacher's Cameron Diaz.Making the cut for Favorite Movie Actress—Drama/Adventure is Machete's Jessica Alba, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides'  Penélope Cruz, Unstoppable's Rosario Dawson, Battle: Los Angeles'  Michelle Rodriguez and Takers' Zoe Saldana.As for the small screen nods, it's a battle of the Lopi. In addition  to Aguilera, honored for her Voice work, and dog whisperer  extraordinaire Cesar Millan, nominees for the Favorite TV Reality,  Variety or Comedy Personality or Act include George Lopez, Jennifer  Lopez and Mario Lopez.As for other hot battles, the Favorite TV Actress—Leading Role in a  Comedy category sees Disney besties Gomez and Demi Lovato face off,  alongside Modern Family's resident hot tamale Sofia Vergara, Glee's Naya  Rivera and Victorious' Victoria Justice.Other big name nominees include Grey's Anatomy's Sara Ramirez, Parks  and Recreation's Aubrey  Plaza, The Office's Oscar Nuñez, Antonio  Banderas, Enrique Iglesias, Taio Cruz, Bruno Mars, Ricky Martin and  Pitbull.In any case, there's more changes in the works: as of now, the awards  will officially be playing favorites. Literally. Starting this year,  rather than value one performance over another, the organizers have  finally given in to the popularity contest that these things are and  decided to name all categories "Favorite" instead of "Best." It seems  particularly appropriate, given that this year fan votes will help  determine the winners of the annual show (incidentally, preferences can  be logged through Sept. 5).The winners will be revealed in an hourlong special airing on NBC Sept. 16.
