Ugly Betty had a beautiful night at the 2008 ALMA Awards.Not only did the recently relocated series take home the award for best Latino-led ensemble cast at the Sunday ceremony, but star America Ferrera walked away with the top prize of the night, Entertainer of the Year.Ferrera earned the accolade not only for her work on the ABC hit, but for her offscreen efforts to encourage youth to become politically active.The 24-year-old star also brought her magic awards touch to La Misma Luna, an indie film in which she had a small part. The movie took home the Special Achievement Award for a Spanish-language motion picture.
