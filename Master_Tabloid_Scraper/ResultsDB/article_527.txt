Bella Hadid isn’t shy about showing a bit of skin. After all, it’s all part of the job description when you’re a Victoria’s Secret model!

The 20-year-old flashed a bit of nip on Monday when she arrived to her wardrobe fitting in New York City for the upcoming Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show. Clad in a skintight bodysuit and short denim skirt, the brunette beauty was all smiles as she sashayed into an office building with her fellow models.
Bella, whose sister Gigi Hadid was also spotted at the fitting as one of VS vixens to participate in the show, accessorized her revealing look with strappy satin heels, brown shades, hoop earrings, and a gold Dior chain.
