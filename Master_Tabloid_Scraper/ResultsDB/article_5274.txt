DeMarcus Cousins Disses Lonzo Ball, Praises De'Aaron Fox & Malik Monk/nDeMarcus Cousins just threw some shade at ex-UCLA star (and possible #1 NBA pick) Lonzo Ball ... hitting him with the dreaded  "never heard of him " when we got Cousins out in L.A. We asked Boogie for his top NBA draft prospects, and he went with De'Aaron Fox & Malik Monk ... two 1st round locks from his alma mater, Kentucky, the team that ousted UCLA in the tourney. But it was when our camera guy asked about Ball -- the most talked about player in the draft -- that the shot came ... and it was a clear one. Wake up,Â LaVar ... this is gonna get good./n
