Michael Irvin -- I Relate to Diddy ... Cops Called On Me at Son's Game/nMichael Irvin says he completely understands Diddy's situation at UCLA -- 'cause the cops were called on HIM at his son's high school football game ... when #88 got a little too heated over a call.  The NFL Hall of Famer appeared on  "TMZ Hollywood Sports " to talk about his football phenom son Michael Irvin II ... who just committed to play at his dad's alma mater -- the University of Miami.  And since Irvin is such an involved father, we asked if he was worried about getting a reputation as a  "helicopter dad " ... a la Diddy.  That's when Irvin explained that he's got a lot more in common with Diddy than an athletic son -- telling us how things got so crazy at a recent game, the high school called the police on him.  In fact, Irvin says he was approached by a MASSIVE musclebound guy who tried to escort him out ... but didn't go as quietly as he had hoped.   "I said, 'Hey man, let me tell you something. Them muscles you got, I now they're not functional 'cause I would have seen you in the league somewhere.' " He continued,  "'If you don't get out of my face, I'm gonna hurt you so bad! That's for talking about my son!' So, I understand P. Diddy. "/n
