Bill Cosby -- Alma Mater Runs for the Hills ... Amid Testimony of 'Enquirer' Trade-Off/nOne of Bill Cosby's alma maters cut all ties with him on the same day it was revealed that Cosby struck a 2005 deal with the National Enquirer to stop it from publishing a rape accuser's story.The University of Massachusetts Amherst -- where Cosby received his masters and doctorate in education -- announced Cosby agreed to step down Wednesday as co-chairman of the school's fundraising campaign. A UMass rep said he now has zero connection with the university. Late Wednesday ... previously sealed court docs were released from Cosby's molestation case involving a staffer at his other alma mater, Temple University. The docs include Cosby's sworn deposition, during which he said he agreed to give the National Enquirer an exclusive interview -- and in exchange it killed a story about a rape accuser named Beth Ferrier. In the depo, Cosby said he was afraid Ferrier's story would bolster the extremely similar accusations being made by the Temple staffer, Andrea Constand. Cosby reached a confidential settlement with Constand in 2006./n
