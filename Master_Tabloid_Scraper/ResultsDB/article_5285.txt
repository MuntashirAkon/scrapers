Shareef O'Neal: Sorry LSU Fans ... No Chance I Go There/nShaquille O'Neal's superstar son ShareefÂ isn't sure which college he'll take his hoops skills to, but he knows one he WON'T ... his father's Alma Mater LSU. We got Shareef out in L.A. and wanted to know if he was leaning any particular way for the next level -- being that he's one of the best prep players in the country. Cover your ears Baton Rouge ... Shareef says he's visited a couple of schools and has a bunch of offers but there's no chance that he ends up down on the bayou. Fine, more gumbo for us (written by an LSU fan)./n
