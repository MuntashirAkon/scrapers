Merv Griffin Visits His Calif. Alma Mater/nBy THE ASSOCIATED PRESS  Merv Griffin paid a visit to his high school alma mater Friday as the school dedicated its quad to one of its most prominent donors.  The 80-year-old entertainer and game show executive, who graduated from San Mateo High School in 1942, was honored by students and faculty in the new  "Merv Griffin Quad. "  The San Mateo Union High School District decided to rename the school after Griffin made a $250,000 donation to the school. He asked that $125,000 of his donation be used to support the school's performing arts program.  Griffin appeared to be in good spirits as he chatted up staff and students Friday. He even remembered details about many teachers from his high school years.  San Mateo High Principal Jacqueline McEvoy told the San Mateo County Times that it was obvious Griffin was still dedicated to his high school.   "When I was talking to him on the phone, he started singing the fight song and he still knew all of the words, " McEvoy said.  Griffin is best remembered as the host of  "The Merv Griffin Show, " and later became a top entertainment executive, creating TV game shows such as  "Wheel of Fortune " and  "Jeopardy. "/n
