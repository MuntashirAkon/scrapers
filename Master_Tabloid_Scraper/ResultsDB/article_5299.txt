Leah Messer‘s amicable co-parenting relationship with Jeremy Calvert may be in trouble! The Teen Mom 2 star blasted her ex-husband for ditching their daughter to spend time with his girlfriend’s child.
In the Teen Mom 2 season finale sneak peek, Calvert informed Messer, 25, that he’s dropping off Adalynn at his mother’s home because he has to pick up girlfriend Brooke Wehr‘s daughter.
“I’m going to have to figure out something with his mom to get Addie,” Messer complained to her sister. “He needs to stop worrying about someone else’s child and worry about his own!”

Messer explained how Calvert knew about the schedule a week ago.
“Arrangements should have been made where he could care for his child and she take care of hers,” she said. “That’s not fair. You see this little girl all week. You don’t see Addie all week.”
She ended the rant with, “That’s what breaks my heart for this kid.”

While Messer has spent months battling for custody and fighting with her first ex-husband Corey Simms, she has commended her second ex-husband for their co-parenting relationship up until now.
“@Calvert505 is hands down one of the best dads that I know,” she tweeted in July. “Couldn’t imagine co-parenting with anyone else. Addie ALWAYS comes FIRST!”
