Jeremy Calvert may want to follow Corey Simms‘s lead when it comes to custody! Leah Messer came under fire after she fed her 3-year-old daughter icing on this week’s Teen Mom 2.
During the episode, Adalynn asked her mother if she could eat a container of chocolate frosting.
“Is it bad that I’m going to let Addie eat icing?” Messer, 25, asked her mother, as she replied, “Just have her sit at the table.”

While Adalynn ate the sweet treat by the spoonful, Messer discussed receiving 50/50 custody of her twin daughters with Simms.
