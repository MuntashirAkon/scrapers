Single Leah's Heartbreak: Ex Jeremy Is Back With Girlfriend Brooke!/n
After nine months together, Leah Messer has split from boyfriend T.R. Dues. But her timing is terrible: The Teen Mom 2 star’s ex-husband, Jeremy Calvert, is back with his girlfriend Brooke Wehr, RadarOnline.com has confirmed.
“They are really happy together,” a source tells Radar.
The pipeline engineer, 27, took to Twitter to gush about his girl, whom he met last spring following his split from Messer, 23. (The parents to 3-year-old Addie finalized their divorce in June 2015.)

As Radar exclusively reported, Calvert met Wehr while he was working near her hometown of St. Clairsville, Ohio.
She was injured when Calvert flipped his four-wheeler last Memorial Day weekend, but the couple stayed close through the wreck’s aftermath.
During a break from Wehr, Calvert started texting his ex Messer, sources claimed. But the flirty messaging seems to have ended.
