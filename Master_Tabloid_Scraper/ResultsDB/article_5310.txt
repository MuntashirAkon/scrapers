 Leah Messer Tells Pals She Dumped Boyfriend T.R. Dues — But Sources Say They're Still.../n
Leah Messer is telling friends it’s over with her boyfriend of nine months, T.R. Dues— but the Teen Mom 2 star isn’t being honest, RadarOnline.com can exclusively reveal.
“Leah said they broke up a little while ago,” one source told Radar. “She said it just didn’t work out. He wasn’t a good boyfriend.”
However, other insiders close to the twice-divorced mother of three, 23, insisted she and Dues, a 32-year-old father of two, are still living together in their Charleston, West Virginia, home.

“They are very much together, and live as a family with her daughters and his sons,” the insider said.
So why is she telling conflicting stories? The source believed Messer is desperate to downplay her new romance for the sake of her ongoing custody battle with ex-husband Corey Simms.
“Leah knows it doesn’t look good for her to have a new man in the house already,” the source revealed. “She wants to look like a stable single mom to the judge in order for her to get her girls back.”
As Radar previously reported, Messer lost primary custody of 6-year-old twins Ali and Aleeah to Simms in October. However, sources exclusively told Radar that the MTV star scheduled a new hearing in the case later this month.

When Ali and Aleeah are with their father, Messer and Dues care for her 2-year-old daughter Addie (with ex-husband #2 Jeremy Calvert) and his two sons Tyshawn, 8, and Angelo, 4, a few days a week.
“Leah can’t wait to have her twins home more often,” a source said. “She’ll do whatever it takes.” /n
