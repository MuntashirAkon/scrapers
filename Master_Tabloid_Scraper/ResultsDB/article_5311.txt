Could another Teen Mom 2 baby daddy be headed for the slammer?
Earlier this week, Leah Messer‘s ex-husband Jeremy Calvert posted a photo of himself sitting in the back of a cop car, his wrists in handcuffs.
“Uh oh,” he captioned the shot, seemingly taken at night.

But the father of Messer’s youngest daughter Addie, almost 3, took to Twitter to calm fans who assumed he had gotten arrested.
“Friend of mine is a cop so in return I got a dirty joke played on me years ago after turning 21,” the 26-year-old pipeline engineer wrote.
Calvert has been the subject of other wild rumors in the past week.
On December 22, a report claimed he had gotten back together with his 23-year-old ex-wife following sightings of the former couple at Messer’s older daughter Ali‘s dance performance.
“Jeremy was shocked by the story, because it couldn’t be further from the truth,” a source close to the MTV reality star told RadarOnline.com. “He and Leah are definitely not together.”
He later assured fans on Twitter that he was still broken up from Messer six months after Radar first reported that they had finalized their divorce.
“It’s pretty sad that you cannot co-parent like mature adults for the children without being accused of being back together,” he wrote. /n
