Jamie Lynn Spears spoke from the heart in an Instagram post celebrating her daughter Maddie’s speedy recovery from an ATV accident that left her in critical condition.

Spears posted a photo of Maddie holding her relative Kylie Blair at her baptism on Sunday (Mar. 5, 2017). In the caption, she wrote about how miraculous it felt to see Maddie celebrating life just a month after she was accidentally pinned underwater for two minutes by an ATV.
“A month ago, at this time, I was living a mothers/anyone’s worst nightmare happening right in front of my eyes, helplessly,” wrote Spears. “Fast-forward — Today, we were able to celebrate the baptism of our sweet Kylie Blair.”
I’m not one to preach, but we were shown God’s grace, and we still feel undeserving of His mercy. I’ll never stop thanking each of you for your prayers, because we recognize the miracle it created. We are beyond blessed, and we will NEVER forget y’all, and God’s unbelievable mercy. #Godisgood.”
