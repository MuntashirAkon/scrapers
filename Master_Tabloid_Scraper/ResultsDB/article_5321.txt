Britney Spears is still out here showing off her abs like it’s 1999, and we will do everything in our power to support it.

Spears posed for a set of photos in the great outdoors wearing nothing but a sports bra, some rolled-up gym shorts, Hoka One One workout sneakers, and bright blue sunglasses. She wrote in the caption of her Instagram post, “Blessed day 💜💜💜”

Later, Spears shared a video of herself in the same outfit working out at the gym with a trainer. She shows off her strength moves, doing some standing one-legged crunches on an aerobic stepper.
“Staying motivated,” she captioned the video with a muscle emoji.



Staying motivated 💪

Strength certainly runs in the family as Britney’s niece Maddie (Jamie Lynn Spears’ daughter) made a speedy recovery after being involved in a nearly fatal ATV accident in February. Jamie shared a video of Maddie’s impressive moves at her first basketball practice since the incident. Click here to check it out.
