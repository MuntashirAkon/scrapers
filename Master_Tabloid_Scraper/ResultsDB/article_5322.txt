Just two weeks ago on Feb. 5, Maddie was riding her ATV on Spears’ and Jamie Watson’s property in Kentwood, Louisiana when she accidentally diverted the vehicle into a nearby pond. She was submerged underneath the water for several minutes before first responders were able to free her from the seatbelt and safety netting. Thereafter, Maddie was airlifted to the Children’s Hospital in New Orleans, where she was in stable but critical condition for two days until she regained consciousness. The doctors said that she was talking and didn’t show any signs of neurological damage and released her on Feb. 10 to go about normal life.
“When she woke up, they said that it was obvious that she recognized them all,” a friend of Maddie’s father told People at the time. “Everybody was crying because it was such a miracle.”
