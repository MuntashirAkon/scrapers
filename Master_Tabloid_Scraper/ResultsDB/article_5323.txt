Maddie Aldridge is still on the mend.

According to Jamie Lynn Spears, her daughter still has ways to go before resuming back to her regular schedule. In an Instagram post shared on Tuesday (Feb. 14, 2017), the singer gave fans an update on her 8-year-old following the ATV accident that resulted in Aldridge’s hospitalization.
“Maddie isn’t quite ready to return to school, but her doctors did clear her to bring in her Valentine’s Day treats to her class today,” she wrote. “Thanks to @avery and @hersheycompany for making these treats for her to pass out, since I didn’t have the time to make any myself this year. It made her so happy to see her friends, and be able to give them such cute treats. It was a great moment for us after everything that has happened.”

Spears added, “We are so thankful to celebrate Valentine’s Day with the ones we love, and we don’t take a second of it for granted.”
As previously reported, Aldridge was rushed to a New Orleans hospital on Feb. 4, 2017 after her Polaris off-roading vehicle flipped over into a pond at her family home in Kentwood, La. Aldridge was reportedly unconscious and submerged under water for several minutes before help arrived.
Last week, Aldridge was released from a treatment facility after regaining consciousness. Local authorities said in a statement that the child didn’t suffer any neurological consequences from the accident.



Thanks to the amazing first responders, and medical teams at University and Children’s Hospital in New Orleans, LA, we are headed home with our baby girl as she continues to recover. Above all else we are so thankful for each and every prayer, because we know that is what truly made the difference. Thank you again to everyone. We are truly blessed🙏
