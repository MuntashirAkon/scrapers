Maddie was driving an ATV on Sunday (Feb. 5, 2017) with Jamie and her husband Jamie Watson watching nearby when she made a hard right to avoid running over a drainage ditch, causing the vehicle to turn over into a pond.
The police report read:
“The ATV and child were instantly submerged in the water right before their eyes. Within seconds the child’s mother, stepfather and other family members reached the pond, dove in and attempted to rescue the child to no avail. The child was trapped and secured by the seatbelt and the ATV’s safety netting. Within two minutes, Acadian Ambulance Services arrived and assisted in freeing the child from the cold waters.”
Maddie regained consciousness mid-day on Monday and doctors were able to remove her ventilator.
“Maddie continues to receive oxygen and is being monitored closely but it appears that she has not suffered any neurological consequences from the accident,” the hospital said in a statement.
