Jamie Lynn Spears’ daughter, Maddie Aldridge, was rushed to the hospital over the weekend after sustaining serious injuries from an ATV accident.

The 8-year-old fell was riding on a Polaris off-road vehicle this Sunday (Feb. 5, 217) when it flipped over, according to TMZ. Maddie was reportedly flown from her ride and submerged under water in a lake for several minutes. She was unconscious when she was airlifted to a New Orleans hospital, where she remains in critical but stable condition.
Jamie Lynn, 25, was not with her daughter at the time of the accident.
The younger sister of Britney Spears, the former Zoey 101 star welcomed Maddie with then-boyfriend Casey Aldridge in 2008 when she was just 16. Jamie Lynn married Jamie Watson in 2014.
Spears’ father, Jamie Spears, told Entertainment Tonight, “All I can say is pray for our baby Maddie.”
