Kourtney Kardashian has Scott Disick on a short leash.

The former couple are said to be back on good terms again as co-parents after Kardashian laid out some ground rules for the father of her three children. According to TMZ, the 38-year-old mom has forbid her ex-boyfriend from hard partying and interfering with her love life — like how the Disick followed her and Younes Bendjima to Cannes in May — if he is to continue seeing his kids.
To try their hand at co-parenting again, the duo recently went on a family vacation to Nantucket with their two sons, Mason and Reign, and daughter Penelope.
Sources close to the situation claim the two are “done romantically,” but are willing to put up a united front for the sake of their children.
