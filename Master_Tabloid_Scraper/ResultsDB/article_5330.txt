Hairspray Live! premiered Wednesday night (Dec. 7, 2016), and some reviews are already calling it the best NBC live musical yet and a great message about love trumping hate.

The live production, based on the 1988 John Waters film, boasted an A-list cast, including Derek Hough, Kristin Chenoweth, Harvey Fierstein and Martin Short, and newcomer Maddie Baillio as Tracy Turnblad.
Then there was Jennifer Hudson, as Motormouth Maybelle, and Ariana Grande, as Penny Pingleton, who stole the show with their closing number, a duet called “Come so Far (Got so Far to Go).” Watch the clip below!





Hudson also slayed with “I Know Where I’ve Been,” a powerful ballad about love and acceptance. Not a dry eye in the house.





Other highlights included Hough as TV host Corny Collins, showing off his triple-threat dancing, singing and acting skills for fans.





Fierstein reprises his Broadway role as Edna Turblad and killed it once again.





Also, Ricki Lake, who originated the role of Tracy in Waters’ cult classic, and Marissa Janet Winokur, who played the original Tracy in the hit Broadway show, both made cameos.
