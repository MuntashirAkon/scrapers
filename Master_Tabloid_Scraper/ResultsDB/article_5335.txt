Tyra Banks‘ son York has praise for all the dads out there – but his own papa gets the most love.

“To all the amazing daddies out there that love their kids unconditionally like my mommy’s daddy and my daddy, too,” the caption read. “HAPPY FATHER’S DAY!”

York has quickly become “Mommy’s little helper,” the 43-year-old star told PEOPLE earlier this month.
“He’s in love with his baby-sized broom,” Banks revealed. “Right now, he is into everything and anything, especially stuff he can push or move, so his curiosity is constantly making me laugh.”

And York is already well-traveled: he often joins mom on the AGT set, where he’s been “making friends with the crew.”
