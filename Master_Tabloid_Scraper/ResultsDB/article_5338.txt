“We’re feeling both excited and exhausted at the same time,” the couple tells PEOPLE. “We’re looking forward to having a family. Now that he’s here we excited to grow our family a little bit more and spread our love even more.”

“The whole family is excited. In fact the biggest trick will be giving Maddie her rest because there’s going to be this long line of parents and siblings that will be continuously wanting to hold the baby.”
In November, the couple happily announced the pregnancy exclusively with PEOPLE.
“We are both really excited and anxious,” Maddie, 21, said at the time. “I think every soon-to-be parent is anxious, but we have so much support from both sides of our family.”
“I think I’ll be the disciplinarian parent just because Caleb already has such a soft spot for the baby,” she added. “He already has so much love for the baby.”
In January, Maddie announced they were expecting a son, sharing a photo on Instagram featuring the duo kissing while surrounded by blue balloons.
