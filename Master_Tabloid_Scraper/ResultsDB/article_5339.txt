Are They a Thing? Corinne Olympios Gets Real About Whether She's Dating Bachelorette Baddie Chad Johnson

They’re a match made in reality TV villain heaven — so it’s no surprise that Bachelor Nation is hoping for romance to spark between Corinne Olympios and Chad Johnson.
But is there any truth to the rumors? According to Olympios, who rose to fame as a contestant on Nick Viall‘s most recent season, absolutely not.
“Chad is a great guy,” Olympios, 24, told Bachelorette alum Jordan Rodgers, who was covering the premiere of Unforgettable in Los Angeles on Wednesday as a special correspondent for Extra.

“He’s really nice,” she added. “I met him one time at a party, and that’s really it.”
Of course, Rodgers, 28, probably doesn’t feel the same way about notorious bad boy Johnson: The two famously clashed while vying for JoJo Fletcher‘s rose on The Bachelorette last year. (Rodgers ultimately won, and the two are now engaged.)
Johnson, meanwhile, has previously made it very clear that he’s #TeamCorn, telling Entertainment Tonight in February that he was interested in the star and that the two had “texted a little bit.”

As for Olympios? She’s just doing her own thing.
“I think we can all agree that I’m the best,” she told Ellen DeGeneres in February. “I think they’re a little jealous of me being a little bit better than them at ‘it,’ whatever ‘it’ is — whether it’s being a villain, or saying what you want to say, or just going after what you want.”
