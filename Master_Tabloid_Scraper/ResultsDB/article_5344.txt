And to think Elton from Clueless now has two kids.Suburgatory's Jeremy Sisto and wife Addie Lane welcomed their first son on Friday.

"Unnamed boy is healthy as is Mom. Thanks for your wishes," Sisto tweeted on Saturday. "Don't tell my wife I had two glasses of wine while she had an epidural."Our lips are sealed.The new baby boy is little brother to Sisto and Lane's first child, 2-and-a-half-year-old daughter Charlie-Ballerina, who received a special gift from her new sibling...well, kinda."Just bought a teddy bear to give to my daughter 'from' her new-born brother," he tweeted, "considering drizzling some placenta on it for believability."Leave it to a former Law & Order star to cover all his tracks in any way possible.Congrats to the growing family!
