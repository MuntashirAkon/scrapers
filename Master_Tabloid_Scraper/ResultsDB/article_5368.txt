“I cannot wait to start a family with my wife once we are all settled in. She is my best friend and is going to make a great mother,” he added.

As Radar has reported, Kyle’s relationship with his self-made millionaire father, Todd, took a beating in 2013 when Kyle was hospitalized after a police report claimed he’d threatened to kill his dad during a crack binge!
As a result, Kyle lost custody of daughter Chloe Chrisley and was fired from the family TV show.
Now, however, Kyle says all that is behind him too.

“I do not talk to my family but I wish them nothing but the best. I have moved on with my life I am just going to be the best father and husband that I can be,” he explained.
“I have an amazing career and a wonderful life today and would not change a thing.”
