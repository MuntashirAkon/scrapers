 Bobbi Kristina Ex Nick Gordon Pleads Not Guilty To Domestic Violence & Kidnapping.../n
The late Bobbi Kristina Brown’s former boyfriend Nick Gordon has entered a not guilty plea to charges of domestic violence and kidnapping, RadarOnline.com can exclusively reveal.
Shortly after the hearing, which took place on June 21, the star also filed court documents requesting a jury trial — clearly readying himself for an upcoming legal battle.
As reported, Gordon was arrested earlier this month on charges of domestic violence and kidnapping after his new girlfriend claimed he beat her so badly she had to be hospitalized.

Gordon denied the incident to police, stating his plans to press charges against his girlfriend. He was ultimately arrested, paying a $15,000 bond shortly thereafter.
Upon his release, Gordon was ordered to wear a GPS monitor and explicitly warned against going near the alleged victim.
Meanwhile, the Fulton County District Attorney in Georgia said Gordon’s recent legal trouble would be taken into consideration in the investigation of ex Bobbi Kristina Brown’s mysterious death in 2015.
