Not ‘Tardy!’ Kim & Kroy Fire Back In Holiday Decorator Lawsuit/n
Kim Zolciak and Kroy Biermann aren’t coughing up any cash for their holiday decorations, RadarOnline.com can exclusively reveal!

But Kim, 39, and Kroy, 31, finally claimed in Fulton County, Georgia court documents filed on June 19 that they want to “dispute the total amount charged.” However, the Don’t Be Tardy stars did not say how much their bill should have been for.
They also asked the court to dismiss the lawsuit, and to have their decorator pay for their legal fees.
