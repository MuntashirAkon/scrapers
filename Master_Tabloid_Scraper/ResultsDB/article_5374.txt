Inmates Responsible For Killing Two Officers Caught After Two Days On The Run/n
Two escaped inmates sought in the murder of prison guards were captured in Tennessee on Thursday, RadarOnline.com can reveal.
Fleeing criminals Donnie Rowe and Ricky Dubose were wanted for brutally overpowering and killing Sgt. Christopher Monica and Sgt. Curtis Billue on a prison bus in Georgia, as the two officers were driving 33 inmates between facilities.
Officers claim the escaped inmates had been inside a secured area of the bus, so it is unknown how they managed to empower the guards.
“Protocol is to have two armed corrections officers on the bus, but the officers don’t wear bullet-proof vests during transfers,” Corrections Commissioner Greg Dozier said.

Both runaways have committed armed robbery and other crimes in the past.
The Department of Corrections said, “Rowe, 43, has been serving life without parole since 2002, and Dubose, 24, began a 20-year sentence in 2015.”
The two had been on the run since Tuesday, when they escaped at about 6:45 a.m. After fatally shooting both guards, they jumped out, carjacked a driver and fled in his car.

The criminals then travelled to Madison, Georgia, where they ransacked a house, stole food and clothes, and later stole a pickup truck to continue their escape, Putnam County Sheriff Howard Sills said.
The two men were taken into custody after a car chase, assured Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal on Thursday evening.
