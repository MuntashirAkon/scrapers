Anna finally dropped her first Unqualified podcast since the split announcement on Tuesday, and though she doesn't mention the breakup in the conversation — that had already been taped — she does have a quick pre-show message to all her fans who have sent their love and support, saying: 

"Hey, dear listeners: I just want to thank you all so much for all the love I've been receiving, and I truly love you."
Listen to Anna's words — and the entire episode featuring My Favorite Murder hosts Karen Kilgariff and Georgia Hardstark (below)!
