It all started back in December, when the girl met R. Kelly back stage at one of his shows; she was 20 years old at the time.
She began to exchange calls and texts with him, and the 50-year-old singer reportedly told her he'd help with her modeling and acting career. Eventually, he invited her to his Georgia home with orders:  wear something sexy.
Immediately, she was whisked into R. Kelly's bedroom and asked to pose like a model, after which Kelly gave her $200 to buy black lingerie, heels, and red lipstick.
The girl apparently went through with that, and came back for a second visit, where R. Kelly got more and more aggressive with her, eventually convincing her to pose nude. She claims they never had sex, though.
Then, three months later — back in February — Kelly sent her a one-way ticket to El Lay, and told her not to bring any friends.
