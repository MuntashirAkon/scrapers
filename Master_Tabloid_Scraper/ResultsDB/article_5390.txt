Over the weekend, the stars and planets somehow aligned in such a way that transformed the Backstreet Boys’ Howie Dorough into Britney Spears’ pet for the evening.

Dorough made a special appearance during Spears’ Las Vegas show at Planet Hollywood on Saturday (Apr. 1, 2017) during her performance of “Freak Show.” The Backstreet Boy was ushered out on stage by male dancers and was strapped to a leash before he crawled on all fours under Spears’ control. At the end of the song, he received the consolation prize of a souvenir T-shirt that was signed by Spears.
