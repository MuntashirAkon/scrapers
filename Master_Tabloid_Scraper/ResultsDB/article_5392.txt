Mama June Shannon’s trainer Kenya Crooks offered a look at the workout routine and the diet changes that helped the Here Comes Honey Boo Boo star slim down to a size four.

Mama June, who underwent bariatric weight-loss surgery after losing some weight on her own, enlisted the help of Crooks to make positive improvements in her day-to-day lifestyle. The trainer told Women’s Health that he began by asking the reality star what she wanted to improve and “make sexier.”
“I believe language is very important when trying to help a client. I never say ‘What don’t you like about yourself?’ because that’s negative and defeated language,” Crooks said. “Mama June wanted to lose weight and tone up at the same time, so that was the mission.”
They worked out together two to three times a week, either in person or via Skype. Elbow crunches, reaching sit-ups, and Russian twists with a medicine ball were some of the key core exercises that were included in the routine, which you can find at the top of the page.

As far as Mama June’s diet was concerned, Crooks said that he stressed lean meats, vegetables, and fruits.
“When you decide to lose weight, you have to be a little selfish and focused all the time,” Crooks adds. “Mama June is a giver, and it’s hard for her to say ‘no’ sometimes. I had to remind her that this is her time. I had to say, ‘You can’t be everything to everybody else and be nothing to yourself.’ Once she gave herself permission to put herself first, she was fine.'”
