During the party, guests were able to enjoy a delicious cake from Nashville's Crumb de la Crumb. And for those wondering, blue frosting was definitely inside.It's been a big week for the couple who recently enjoyed a date night at the 2017 CMT Music Awards . In fact, Hayley got to watch her man perform a special collaboration with The Chainsmokers.As for the couple's pregnancy announcement Wednesday morning, Tyler was more than happy to share the good news with his fans.

"I'm pretty stoked. I'm just really excited that we can officially talk about it now and get it out there and not have to keep a secret anymore," he explained to E! News. "But next year is going to be a lot of fun. I think we're having a Christmas baby."Until then, Florida Georgia Line has a full summer tour schedule that will include performances with the Backstreet Boys and Nelly in select cities.Perhaps they will have some time to cheers for all the good news, with their own Oldcamp Whiskey of course.
