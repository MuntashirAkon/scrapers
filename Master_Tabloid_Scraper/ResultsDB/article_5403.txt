Our hearts are exploding with joy. When I was newly pregnant, I had contaminated progesterone and almost lost the baby. The song ‘Georgia on My Mind' kept playing everywhere I went."

She added, "I knew it was my amazing aunt and my husband's best family friend, both named Georgia, saying, ‘We are your angels in heaven. Don't give up.' We knew from then on her named had to be Georgia." Cue the tears!

Pulos and Nassos welcomed their first daughter back in 2013, Alianna Marika, and the new mama of two had been documenting her journey to conceive a second child on both her Bravo reality show and on social media.Congratulations to the happy parents on their exciting family news!(E! and Bravo are both part of the same NBCUniversal family.)
