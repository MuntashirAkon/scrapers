Jane Fonda: No Georgia Peach/n
It's been a long time since Jane Fonda caught foot-in-mouth disease. The last few years, it seems, hubby Ted Turner has taken up that cherished role.         But now, the exercisin' activist actress has come under fire for dissing the state of Georgia.        Appearing at a United Nations meetings Wednesday, the retired thesp compared her adopted state to a Third World nation, saying the northern part of the state was full of "starving children" and people living in "tar-paper shacks."         Fonda was participating in a roundtable discussion, addressing her work with the Georgia Campaign for Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention, when she recalled an earlier U.N. conference on populaton in developing countries.         "It's what makes working in Georgia very interesting, because we are, in some ways, like some developing countries."         "There is a lot of rural poverty. In the northern part of Georgia, children are starving to death. People live in tar-paper shacks with no indoor plumbing, and so forth.         "I love Georgia. I'm proud to be living there, and that's the truth...But we have very special problems," she added.         Needless to say, the woman once known as Hanoi Jane for her Viet Nam War protests, has become public enemy No. 1 in the Peach State.        No one's more ticked off than Governor Zell Miller, who says Fonda's comments were way off-base. He's fired off a letter to Fonda, in which he vents: "Your remarks paint a grossly inaccurate picture of the state of Georgia. Your comments will do great harm to the state you claim to love...Maybe the view from your penthouse apartment is not as clear as it needs to be."        Ouch. (Fonda and Turner live in a penthouse apartment in Atlanta's CNN Center.)        In a statement Thursday, Fonda said that although her words were taken out of context she was sorry for badmouthing the state.      "I was wrong. I should not have said what I said...My comments were inaccurate and ill-advised."   (UPDATED 9:45 a.m. PT 4/17/98)
