Jason Derulo Says New Country Music Collaboration Is Coming/nJason Derulo is going to be doing a lot more rhyming with  "drinkin' " and  "thinkin' " because he's got a big country music project in the works. Derulo's already got several country music collabs in the can. He won a CMT Music Award this year for his crossover duet,  "Want to Want Me, " with Luke Bryan, and is working with Hank Williams Jr. and Florida Georgia Line on the new  "Monday Night Football " opening theme. Those are some big projects but, when we got Derulo at LAX Monday, he teased something even bigger./n
