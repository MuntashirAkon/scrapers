Nikki Bella Says She Has a ‘Special’ Bond with Sister Brie’s Daughter Birdie: ‘She Laughed for the First Time with Me’/n

 
Twin sisters Nikki and Brie Bella may have a tight-knit relationship, but there’s still room for one more little diva in there — Brie’s baby girl Birdie Joe!
The 33-year-old Total Divas and Total Bellas stars visited the PEOPLE Now studios to talk about their bond with each other and the 3-month-old newest addition to Brie and husband Daniel Bryan‘s household.
“I was nursing her, and she looked up at me and she gave me this smile — and babies can’t fake smile. They don’t fake anything, right? They let you know how they feel,” Brie recalls.
“And this genuine smile just came on, and it literally makes me want to tear up right now, but it was just like, ‘Whoa,’ ” she continues. “How I felt in that moment, I was just like, ‘This is the most incredible thing in the world.’ ”

“She laughed out loud for the first time with me, and it was just so cute to hear that laugh out loud,” Nikki adds. “And then she giggled for the first time with me! And seeing her giggling and how happy … I was melted. Fully melted.”
“[Nikki]’ll leave the room and I’m like, ‘Birdie,’ and I’ll try to mimic [Nikki], but she won’t laugh hard at me and I’m like, ‘Ugh,’ ” Brie says. “She only laughs hard at [Nikki]!”





 The happiest late night I have ever had in NYC! (Well of course besides John taking me to Time Square and kissing me!) She laughs for her Coco! Legit steals my heart! First time Birdie has giggled so hard! ❤️💛❤️💛❤️💛❤️ #birdieandcoco @thebriebella @bryanldanielson
