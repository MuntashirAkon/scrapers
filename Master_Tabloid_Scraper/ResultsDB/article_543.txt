This Greek Island Has Lured Celebrities from Jackie O. to Bella Hadid/n
The Greek island of Mykonos has drawn celebrities from all over the world since Brigitte Bardot, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, and Grace Kelly visited in the 1960s. But over the past few years, its star power has increased as celebrities have returned to the island via helicopter, yacht, and private jet.

In 2016 alone, Leonardo DiCaprio, Alessandra Ambrosia, Paris Hilton, Gerard Butler, Ariana Grande, and Mariah Carey were all spotted on the island. And ever since Lindsay Lohan opened a nightclub in Athens last year, she has been frequently photographed on the beaches of Mykonos.

Last month, Bella Hadid and Kendall Jenner went on vacation together to Mykonos — and they are far from the only ones. From 2013 to 2016, the number of international arrivals at Mykonos Airport almost doubled.

Some now view the island as an alternative to Ibiza. Afrojack, one of the world’s highest paid DJs told the BBC that the Spanish island had become too expensive and “too focused on the VIP.” He now prefers attending cheaper parties in Mykonos.

Despite an economic recession in Greece, Mykonos is packed with five-star resorts. The Santa Marina has hosted celebrities like Mel Gibson, Sharon Stone, and Linda Evangelista. But a great many celebrities (notably Stefano Gabbana of Dolce & Gabbana) choose to dock their yachts in Mykonos and sleep onboard.

During the summer (Mykonos’s peak season), the island becomes a non-stop party for international jetsetters. Travelers to Mykonos can either partake in the world-famous all-night parties or choose a low-key resort for a more laidback experience.
Either way, there’s likely to be celebrity spotting involved.
