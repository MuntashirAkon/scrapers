Shareef O'Neal Teams with Migos' Quavo for Crazy Dunk Sesh /nHere's Shareef O'Neal busting out some insane alley-oop dunks ... courtesy of rap superstar Quavo.  ﻿The Migos member lobbed up a pair of dimes for Reef before a pickup game on Friday -- and the 17-year-old threw it down hard both times, including a pretty sick reverse jam. Quavo ain't half bad either -- in fact, the dude was a star athlete back in Georgia and balled out as the QB on his high school football team.  As for Reef, he's already committed to U of Arizona. Sucks for ASU. /n
