Brooks Koepka's Model Girlfriend Jena Sims Wins U.S. Open/nBrooks Koepka won his first major at the U.S. Open Sunday ... but it's his super hot model girlfriend who's the REAL winner. Meet 28-year-old Jena Sims -- former Miss Georgia Teen USA -- who joined Koepka to receive his shiny Championship trophy after beating out stars like Rickie Fowler and Hideki Matsuyama. She's alsoÂ an aspiring model /actress who was in 'Sharknado' and an episode of  "Entourage. " And her social media photos are insane. Here's hoping Koepka keeps winnin' majors ... 'cause we'd love to see some more of Sims. Congrats!!/n
