By Radar Staff
We’re hoping three times a charm for actress Kate Winslet, who we just learned has tied the knot for the third time.
Kate earlier this month wed Ned Rock’nRoll, the 34-year-old nephew of billionaire Virgin founder Richard Branson, “in a private ceremony attended by her two children and a very few friends and family,” her rep said.

Kate and Ned (who was born Abel Smith) had been dating since autumn 2011, and got engaged this past summer, her rep said.
Kate, 37, was given away by her Titanic co-star Leonardo DiCaprio in the super-secret ceremony. Neither set of parents knew about the hush-hush nuptials, according to reports.

Rocknroll was married to stunning British socialite Eliza Pearson from 2009-2011.
