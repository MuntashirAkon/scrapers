Prince Philip is in the hospital with an infection.

The 96-year-old was admitted to a medical center in London Tuesday night (June 20, 2017), the Buckingham Palace confirmed.
“The Duke of Edinburgh was admitted to King Edward VII Hospital in London last night, as a precautionary measure, for treatment of an infection arising from a pre-existing condition,” a statement from the royal house read. “Prince Philip is in good spirits and is disappointed to be missing the State Opening of Parliament and Royal Ascot.”
Prince Charles will fill in for his father and join Queen Elizabeth II at the State Opening of Parliament Wednesday.
“Her Majesty is being kept informed and will attend Royal Ascot as planned this afternoon,” the statement added.
Earlier this year, Prince Philip announced his retirement from public engagements. “Prince Philip will attend previously scheduled engagements between now and August, both individually and accompanying the Queen. Thereafter, the Duke will not be accepting new invitations for visits and engagements, although he may still choose to attend certain public events from time to time,” Buckingham Palace said at the time. “Her Majesty will continue to carry out a full program me of official engagements with the support of members of the Royal Family.”
