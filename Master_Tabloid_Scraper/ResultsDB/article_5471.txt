Anna Wintour was made a dame at Buckingham Palace on Friday (May 5, 2017) by Queen Elizabeth II while wearing Chanel.

Wintour was recognized in the New Year Honours list for her services to fashion and journalism as the editor of American Vogue for nearly 30 years. Footage from the ceremony shows that the Queen experienced some difficulty in finding the correct place on her jacket to pin the brooch.
Wintour told the press what she said to the Queen in their brief exchange.
“I congratulated her on Prince Philip’s service because obviously that’s so remarkable and such an inspiration to us all,” said Wintour [via BBC].
Also in attendance was Wintour’s daughter, Bee Shaffer, who shared a congratulatory post for her mom on her Instagram account.
“Dame AW,” she captioned her photo.
