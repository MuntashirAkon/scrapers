If her modeling career hasn’t already tipped you off, Kendall Jenner’s new video for LOVE magazine certainly cements her bombshell status.

In a freshly released clip directed by Rankin, the 21-year-old channels the biggest sex symbol in Hollywood history, Marilyn Monroe. Clad in skimpy lingerie and swimsuits by La Perla, Jenner happily dances around as she lip syncs along to come of the famous blonde’s signature hits, including “Diamonds Are a Girl’s Best Friend” and “I Want to Be Loved by You.”
Fittingly, the model is also seen wearing Monroe’s signature rouge in the video. According to a recent post on Jenner’s app, red lipstick is a beauty staple on her vanity.
“A red lip is always my beauty go-to, no matter what occasion—it’s just so classic and timeless (as Marilyn Monroe, Audrey Hepburn, Jean Simmons, Sophia Loren, Debbie Harry, Kate Moss and Elizabeth Taylor prove). My fave red right now is Estée Lauder’s new Pure Color Love in Bar Red!”
