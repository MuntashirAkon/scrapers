Eliza Dushku & Rick Fox Are Shacking Up!/n
It's getting serious between Eliza Dushku and Rick Fox!The lovebirds are setting up house, Fox told E! News at InStyle's Summer Soiree yesterday. "I'm moving out of my place. We live together in the [Hollywood] Hills."So how's the cohabiting going so far?

"It's good, better than good," tiny Eliza dished. "The dogs haven't peed on me yet!" Rick joked.Eliza even helped dress her honey for last night's party when he came downstairs in a less than stylish outfit."I realized we made an error when my dear came down the stairs in a real clashy outfit, two toned shoes, green shirt," said Dushku. "I have never redressed someone in my life and if it was a year ago…but it's at that point where I'm like, ‘Yeah, we got to go upstairs and change.'"As for who's in charge in the kitchen, the actress admits she can't cook. "I have one staple...French toast!" Fox adds.And while there's no wedding bells ringing for this twosome, it seems Dushku is already fitting in with his family."I took Rick and the kids camping a few times," she said of their recent summer trips. "Yeah, we did family this summer," Fox added.
