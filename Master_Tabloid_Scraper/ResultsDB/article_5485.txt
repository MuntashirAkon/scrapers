Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Dollhouse alum Eliza Dushku says she was forced to leave the place she called home for two months due to...One Direction.The 34-year-old actress said on Instagram on Friday afternoon that she had to vacate her room at a Pittsburgh hotel to accommodate the popular group, which is set to perform in the city on Sunday. The band members, who performed that night in Indianapolis, have not commented."#DragMeDown Don't worry @OneDirection...It was super chill movin outta my hotel room so u can have the ENTIRE FLOOR I've been staying on for 2 months," Dushku wrote. "#OnLocationLife #HotelWars #ActorProblems #WhatHaveYouDoneForMeLately #OneDirection Took 2 hrs this Friday afternoon before work Enjoy #Pittsburgh #PA!"She included a photo of a luggage cart filled with two suitcases, four boxes, a pillow and a plastic bag.

Dushku, who is in the city shooting the Cinemax show Banshee, later appeared to take a more forgiving tone."Ha! I'm laughing, it's all good @onedirection," she said on Twitter. "Assuming...: Tix or pix for my friends kid..?!!""And for the record, I absolutely love my #Pittsburgh #PA hotel & each & every staff member there," she added. "Was no fault. Recommendation coming soon:)"She received a slew of mixed reactions."Blimey the world has gone mad when a boyband from The X Factor gets better treatment then a Buffy legend," one person wrote."To be honest, I would be honored to have to switch hotel rooms for the boys," said another user.
