In the future, our robot masters will weary of their campaign for world domination and human enslavement. They will build hotels and casinos for leisure time spent away from the War With the Humans.At InStyle magazine's summer soiree, Eliza Dushku modeled the cocktail waitress uniform that our robot masters will require females of our species to wear as they forcibly serve frosty blended drinks of gasoline and human tears. The uniforms are meant to be drab in color, restrictive in form, and embarrassingly revealing in order to break the human spirit.Eliza, whose side are you on?
