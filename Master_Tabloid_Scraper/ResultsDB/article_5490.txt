Wedding bells are getting louder for Rick Fox and Eliza Dushku.The former Dancing With the Stars contestant and the 29-year-old actress have been dating for almost two years now, so we have to wonder if it isn't getting time to pop the question.Right?

"You don't go 20 months...without talking about marriage," Fox told us at TV Guide magazine's Hot List party in Hollywood. "I've been married before, so we definitely talk about the truth of what marriage is about."Fox, 41, was married to Vanessa Williams for almost five years before they divorced in 2004. Even so, he says, "I'm not gunshy about marriage, even though I failed. I failed at it the first time, so my next opportunity will be one where I'll be honestly more experienced and intelligent about it."Fox and Dushku have been living together since August and he says that his other half couldn't be happier to have him home since his shocking DWTS elimination."[She] missed going on dates and having me home and doing different things together," he says. "We built a doghouse the day after I was eliminated. The doghouse has been sitting in the garage for months.  So it's just one of those things where you get your life back."
