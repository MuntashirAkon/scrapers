Did Rick Fox & Eliza Dushku Boo Sarah Palin at DWTS?/n
Dancing With the Stars' Rick Fox may not be a huge fan of Sarah Palin's politics, but he doesn't think the booing on Monday's night show was aimed towards the Alaskan mom."I think it was the scores," he explained at the Arcade Autumn Party at the London last night. "I'm sure not everyone in the audience sees eye to eye with Sarah's political views...""Like me!" girlfriend Eliza Dushku (who was on-hand at the taping) piped in. When asked if she booed Sarah specifically, she first said, "No comment." But later...

She clarified that she did not in fact boo the former governor of Alaska."I did not boo Sarah Palin," she added. "I can have respect for her as a mom. We may have different political views but I'm not really a booer. I think that's kind of a cowardly thing to do."Luckily, there was no booing last night at the London during the runway show featuring designs from Arcade boutique, where Eliza and Rick sat front row next to Demi Lovato and Paris and Nicky Hilton Rothschild.
