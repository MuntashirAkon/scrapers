Michael Madsen Brings Yakuza to Life/nWhen he's not chopping off the ears of police officers or treating Hanso swords with disrespect by leaving them in golf bags, Micahel Madsen is bring Sega's newest video game  "Yakuza " to life with his unique voice. The  "Kill Bill " star is the voice of Futo Shimano, a vicious yakuza boss who uses brutality to achieve his selfish goals. Madsen isn't the only Hollywood star lending their voice to this visually spectacular game. Rachel Leigh Cook of  "She's All That " fame plays Reina, the owner of a hostess bar whose secret love leads her down the road of betrayal. Michael Rosenblum and Eliza Dushku have also joined the  "Yakuza " fray.Our favorite is of course Luke Skywalker himself, Mark Hamill, whose take on Goro Majima is a far departure from the Jedi we have all come to love.  "Yakuza " is available in stores now./n
