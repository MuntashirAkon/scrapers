'Happy Endings' Star Eliza Coupe -- First My Show, Now My Marriage ... /nIt's been a rough year for  "Happy Endings " star Eliza Coupe -- 'cause 2 months after ABC canned her show, her marriage is following suit. TMZ has learned the actress has been hit with divorce papers by her husband Randall Whittinghill -- a puppeteer and acting coach.In the docs, Randall says they're working out the division of property in mediation ... but he IS asking for spousal support. Makes sense since, ya know, he's a puppeteer. The two married back in 2007 after 7 years of dating. They have no children together.Â  According to the docs, Randall blames the split on irreconcilable differences. Fun Fact -- Coupe has previously said that she only started dating her husband because he looks like Johnny Depp. We kinda see it .../n
