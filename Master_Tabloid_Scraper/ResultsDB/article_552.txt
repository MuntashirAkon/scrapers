French Montana just moved next door to Scott, and they are pretty close and hanging out." 

Scott and Ella were photographed together soon after E!

"Scott doesn't like Kourtney dating Younes at all," the source added. "He doesn't want to see photos of them or know about it. Kourtney has tried to give Scott a heads up that he might be seeing photos, but Scott can't stand seeing her with someone else, especially Younes."Another insider close to Scott said the reality star "gets really jealous when he sees or hears about Kourtney with anyone," adding, "He'll always love her, regardless of their status."
