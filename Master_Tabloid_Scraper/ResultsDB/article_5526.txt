Style Radar: Faboo or Faux Pas? International Fashion Fabulosity/n
Chic styles adorned our favorite style trend setters, spanning the globe in sophisticated locales such as Monte Carlo, London, Dublin, New York, and more!
Heather Graham stepped out for The Hangover premiere in Dublin flauting her figure in a curve-clinging Herve Leger strapless black mini-dress with cutouts. Also in black, fashion plate Kim Kardashian took a classic (yet flirty) approach in a ruffle hem Rachel Pally sheath dress for day three of the Monte Carlo Television festival. Katy Perry‘s fashion is as contemporary as her music. The girl-kissing pop diva did it up in yet another fab, colorful ensemble in an orange pencil skirt and floral-print zippy vest for designer Lulu Guiness’ 20th anniversary bash in London.
Across the pond in New York for the Webby Awards (which honors Internet innovations), Victoria’s Secret model/ extremely hot mama Alessandra Ambrosio was angelic in a white Balmain studded mini number, while model-turned-actress Molly Sims went for a shocking pink-printed Paris Hilton-styled Marchesa sleeveless dress.
On the topic of Paris, the Hilton Heiress was spotted at Eva Longoria Parker‘s restaurant, Beso, and while she wasn’t in her signature pink, the teal tones of her outfit and accessories complemented the socialite’s early summer look all the same.
