Susan Boyle Gets Some Retail Therapy/n
Fresh from her stint in a clinic where she was being treated for an acute anxiety attack, Susan Boyle decided some new clothes were the order of the day.
The “Britain’s Got Talent” runner-up yesterday hit up the Lulu & Fred boutique just north of London in the village of Radlett, where she smiled for fans and looked cheerier than she had since starting her ride to world-wide superstardom.
Susan’s brother Gerry Boyle told AP Susan has recovered from her exhaustion and anxiety.
“She’s a lot more like herself,” he said.
