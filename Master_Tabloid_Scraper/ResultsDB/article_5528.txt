Anderson says she and Carradine had still kept in touch over the years despite their split.  “We stayed on good terms since our divorce and I can’t believe that he is gone – I’m in a state of shock at hearing this news.

Anderson told RadarOnline.com that Carradine had many sides to him.
“He was a very complicated man who had a flip-side to his personality but I fell in love with the caring and sensitive part of him.

He will always have a special place in my heart and we met on the set of Kung Fu Legend back in 1995.”
