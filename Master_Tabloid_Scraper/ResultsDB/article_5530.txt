The band said of the clip on Facebook: 

"We are so happy to share our new video for 'I Dare You'. Our love letter to Los Angeles, a city close to our hearts, where we wrote and recorded parts of our album â€˜I See You'. This is the third video, our friend, the wonderful Alasdair McLellan has directed for us. He collaborated with a hero of ours, Raf Simons on the creative concept and direction. It was amazing to work with both of them and such a pleasure to meet and work with Millie bob, Paris Jackson, Ashton, Lulu and Ernesto! Thank you to Calvin Klein and everyone involved. We hope you enjoy watching! xx The xx"
