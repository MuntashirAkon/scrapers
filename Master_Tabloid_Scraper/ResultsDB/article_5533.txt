Kim, Khlo√©, & Kourtney Kardashian Face Major Backlash From Fans For Flaunting Their 'Disgusting' Furs!/n

We have a feeling these aren't faux‚Ä¶
On Monday, sisters Kim Kardashian West, Khlo√© Kardashian, and Kourtney Kardashian decided to flaunt their wealth in grossly extravagant fur coats while visiting Cleveland.
Guess they're back to doing that again. Smh.

Not only is real fur gross, but did we mention it was hot as hell in the Ohio city (which they were visiting to support Khlo√©'s man Tristan Thompson?? There's absolutely no excuse!
Khlo√© posted the snap (above) to Instagram, along with the caption: 

"Mix tape dropping in 2018"
We're not the only ones offended by the amount of stripped animal skin in this one pic. Many IG commenters went in on the trio for their fashion choice:

lulu040:"I'm not into bashing at all‚Ä¶.but please lose the fur. There are so many better options. It's enough already. :(((((("
odettabuttlex: "So incredibly stupid to wear fur! Shame on you!"
hannahjsharris: "'We all need to practice what we preach. I will still continue to NOT wear fur' @khloekardashian üôÑ"
eme.lina: "Wear your own skin,@khloekardashian and the rest"
americajuju: "Sad to see kardashians use their platforms for nothing more than money, its disgusting"
In case you don't remember, Khlo√© actually used to be a PETA spokeswoman until she cut ties with the group in 2012. Releasing a statement on it, she still vowed to never wear fur‚Ä¶
Well, it wouldn't be the first time she's gone against that.
Thoughts??
