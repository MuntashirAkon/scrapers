Fifth Harmony's Lauren Jauregui Stars In 'Sensual' 'Coming Out' Photo Shoot With Ex-GF Lucy Vives!/n

So stunning!
As you may already be aware, Fifth Harmony's Lauren Jauregui came out as bisexual last year — and even though she's since split from ex-girlfriend Lucy Vives, the two sure do make some pretty pictures together!
For the collection called Bare With Me, Malibu-based photographer Nicole Cartolano said the former flames had insane chemistry on set.

The artist told MTV News:

"Both girls trusted me to photograph them together as sort of a coming-out, but they were nervous how their families would respond and the publicity they'd attract, especially from the Latin American community. ‘Bare With Me' is a compromise which allowed us to describe what Lauren called ‘love in the 21st century.' We felt like the way that these photographs are presented are very disarming, sensual, and empowering all at once. And they're not provocative or with ill intent. … It was important to use their voices to show the world that this is OK, this is acceptable, in the gentlest way possible."
Adding:

"You could tell that they've been best friends for a very long time. They've known each other since high school. And they dated on and off for a few years. So they're good friends over everything else."
Without further ado, ch-ch-check out some snaps from the steamy photo shoot (below)!
