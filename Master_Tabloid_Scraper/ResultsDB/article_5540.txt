The model also recently clapped back at a mommy shamer who criticized Teigen for how she held Luna. “Let me know how you hold your baby when she’s about [to get] into a stroller and there are 20 camera flashes at night,” she replied. “Photos are literally split-second moments in time that evolve. I despise mommy shamers. I am a proud shamer of mommy shamers.”
