This Thanksgiving, islanders in Hawaii are going to be feeling especially thankful! This year, Grammy-winner Mariah Carey is headed to Honolulu for a series of concerts. And if that isn’t exciting enough, Empire star Jussie Smollett will be joining her on stage!
The 33-year-old actor talked with Entertainment Tonight about working with Carey and the unreal chance to perform with her in the coming months.
“Mariah is amazing,” he said backstage at the IHeartRadio Music Festival in Las Vegas. “The support she’s shown me so far, she absolutely did not have to be as supportive as she is but she has been.”

Smollett went on to explain how he landed the gigs alongside the iconic songstress in Hawaii: “It was supposed to be one night only, that sold out in like a couple of hours so they added a second show. That sold out so now we’re gonna do three shows!”
The 33-year-old actor also got a chance to weigh in on the death of his character’s sister-in-law on Empire, which rocked viewers.
“I was sad because I love Kaitlin [Doubleday] personally, outside of the show,” he said. “It’s always tough when you lose a character.”
