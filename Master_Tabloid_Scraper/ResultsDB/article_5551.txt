LuLu’s Lemon/n
LuLu was taught to dream big in hopes that her aspirations would match her voluminous, big-boned spirit.Her performance, though compelling, didn't win her the chance to work in Vegas, but judging by the bikini top made solely from electrical tape, I have a hunch she can accomplish that one on her own.
