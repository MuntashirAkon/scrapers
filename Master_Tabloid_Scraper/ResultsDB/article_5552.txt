America's Got Talent: Meet Lulu the Plus-Size Pole Dancer/n
There's no question that America's Got Talent introduces us to very interesting people, and tonight was no exception in Austin.Aside from the adorable 10-year-old Sebastien and his mariachi band and the daredevil David Smith—who credits himself as the human cannonball—America got to meet Lulu, a 27-year-old office clerk who was anything but clerical when she walked onstage.Bow chicka bow wow. 

Lulu—ladies and gents—is a mom, wife and plus-size pole dancer.The fiery redhead showed up on stage wearing a teal bikini, ready to manhandle the large pole behind her. Once Etta James' "I Just Wanna Make Love to You" started playing, the soft-spoken young lady became a fierce and seductive temptress...well, she tried.Her moves weren't amazing, but her attempt at climbing and sliding down the pole were admirable. Plus, she ended her act with a drop-split, which was pretty impressive.Sharon Osbourne and Howard Stern buzzed Lulu right away, but Howie Mandel seemed like a huge fan of her talent.Nick Cannon also hopped on the pole to show off his moves, and we gotta say, there's something promising there.
