We know we're supposed to be writing about Britney Spears' dress, but her legs are driving us to distraction.They're all oiled up and hyper-tanned, like Mr. Universe legs. In fact, she's too orange all over, and with the hair, the whole effect is very much like Hulk Hogan in a Japanese cosplay outfit.But we must press on. We must concentrate.

We like the Lulu dress. It appears to be part of a trend involving floating collars that look like they belong on other outfits altogether, but it pretty much works here. And we love scallops on everything, as they're a nice substitute for lace.Now, if only she'd lay off the tan in a can...
