“She is more determined than ever and feels inspired by having her babies recently. Beyonce has hired nannies to help with the twins and she’s been writing and recording new material while working hard to get back in shape.

The 35-year-old Lemonade performer was inspired even more recently when she watched Missy Elliot at the recent FYF Festival in Los Angeles that she attended along with her sister Solange.
