The reality TV couple fought over their tots since their 2016 split, and Dennis accused Ravenel of dating his nanny’s teenage daughter during the battle.
She also claimed he “encouraged the underage drinking of the nanny’s daughter [redacted] in front of the children” and used mushrooms and cocaine in front of the children.
Dennis alleged that he “encouraged” their children to call their nanny “mother” and told them to call her “’Kathryn’ instead of ‘mommy’” as well, and that the nanny kicked her out of her son’s christening reception on April 16.
