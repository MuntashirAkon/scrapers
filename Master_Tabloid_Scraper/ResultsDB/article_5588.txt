Rob Kardashian & Blac Chyna's Feud Hasn't Affected The Day-To-Day Care Of Their Daughter Dream!/n

Rob Kardashian and Blac Chyna might hate each other, but they're not letting their feelings get in the way of Dream Kardashian's happy life!
As you surely know, things have been tense between the Rob & Chyna stars after Kris Jenner's son went on a social media tirade to share some revenge porn of the former video vixen. Not to mention, the mother-of-two has since clapped back at Kardashian by hitting him with abuse allegations and a restraining order. Yikes.

Nonetheless, the ex-lovebirds are VVV dedicated to co-parenting their 8-month-old daughter. While we knew  Chyna has no intention to take Dreamy away from the sock designer, we're surprised to learn they're being so cordial following their blow up.
Although there is no written agreement, Rob and Chyna share the young Miz Kardashian 50/50. A source close to the situation explained to Us Weekly:

"They coparent pretty well in terms of scheduling. They split the time pretty equally based on each other's schedule. They have two nannies that alternate, so that also makes it incredibly easy. A nanny is with Dream 100 percent of the time, even when she's sleeping. It's 24-hour care for Dream."

Looks like Rob's daughter is well looked after. Still, all this tension can't be good for the little one. Hopefully, the former flames can get back on friendly terms for the sake of their baby girl!
