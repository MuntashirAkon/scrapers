Here's How Blac Chyna's Temporary Restraining Order Against Rob Kardashian Affects Dream Kardashian!/n

Despite the drama, Blac Chyna and Rob Kardashian are doing what's best for their daughter.
As we reported, on Monday, a judge granted the model's request for a temporary restraining order against the KUWTK brother after Chyna accused him of physical abuse.
Rob also landed in hot water after he accused his ex of cheating and drug use, in addition to uploading nude photos of her on social media.

Even with the mudslinging, this latest legal development between the former Rob & Chyna stars will NOT affect each parent's guardianship of Dream Kardashian.
A source told TMZ the two are abiding by an unwritten agreement where both parties are granted 50/50 physical custody. Recently, Rob had Dream four days out of the week, while Chyna had three.
Surprisingly, the reality TV personalities are totally cool with this set-up, and seemingly have no issues co-parenting with each other.
While they have no plans to establish a formal custody agreement in front of a judge, they will most likely do so in the future.
Regardless of who has Dream, a staff of nannies and nurses is always present during these meetings.
