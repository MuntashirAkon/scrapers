This conversation went off the rails (on a crazy train)…

Because of the recent controversy surrounding Eva Amurri sharing that she fired a nanny because they were angling for her husband Kyle Martino, the ladies of The Talk decided to discuss the problems that arise with nannies in the house.
Sharon Osbourne, being the honest and cavalier sort, admitted that she also struggled with nannies making trouble in her home back when Aimee, Jack and Kelly Osbourne were young.
“We used to have four nannies, because I had three children,” Sharon said. “I would work five days a week, I would travel… I’m telling you, they were the bane of my existence. They were all wanting to be celebrities. They were all wanting money … I caught two of them in bed with Ozzy!” 
Apparently it was two separate instances, not a ménage à trois, and they occurred when Ozzy was deep in the throes of drug addiction; Ozzy was “out of his mind.” But still…
“Different times,” Sharon continued. “But it goes on and on…”
Moral of the story: Never trust a nanny!
