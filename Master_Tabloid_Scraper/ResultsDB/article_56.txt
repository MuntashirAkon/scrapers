Matt Damon's Six-Year-Old Movie Margaret Finally Coming to Theaters/n
In the flick, Paquin plays a teenager who's on her way across town to lose her virginity when some flirting with a passing bus driver (Mark Ruffalo) leads to horrifying consequences.And that's just the start of it.Things begin to spin wildly out of control for everyone involved. Next thing you know, she's lying to the police, screwing up at school and kissing her teacher.Directed by Kenneth Lonergan, who previously did You Can Count on Me, the film has a great cast, impeccable pedigree and one of the strangest time lapses between filming and release in recent memory.Interested?
