WATCH: Tina Fey and Amy Poehler’s Dope Squad on ‘SNL’/n
Last night’s Saturday Night Live had former Weekend Update co-anchors, Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, returning to take on hosting duties.

The two women were there to promote their comedy, Sisters.
One of their best sketches included a parody of Taylor Swift’s Bad Blood music video, entitled Tina and Amy’s Dope Squad.
The video kicks off with the two funny besties giving an “interview” to a web journalist, played by SNL cast member, Aidy Bryant.
From there, the ladies transition into a video about their “dope squad,” which include, nannies, Gayle King, Amy Schumer and their shared gynecologist.
The highlight of the bit is Amy Schumer doing her best to handle nunchucks.
