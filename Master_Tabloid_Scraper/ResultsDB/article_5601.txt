The new mom just can’t catch a break.

Coco has been dealing with haters ever since she announced she was expecting earlier this year. She’s been criticized for her pregnancy style, the size of her baby bump, and now she’s getting hate for her parenting style.
On Monday (Dec. 14), the TV host finally had enough and took to Twitter to let her many critics know just what kind of mother and wife she really is.

Some comments really frustrate me at times..some assume since u have money and live in a “celebrity world” that you don’t do shit!

Let me add, I don’t have nannies or babysitters. I’ve been 100% hands on w/Chanel. I also clean my own house & do my own laundry #100%wife

I’m totally serious when I say I love being a wife.I like the role I play..I can be crazy coco at times but I have a good heart — Coco (@cocosworld) December 14, 2015

Even though she was clearly frustrated, the new mom didn’t let haters completely ruin her night. A few hours after her rant, Coco shared a picture of her outfit as she stepped out for dinner for the first since since giving birth.
