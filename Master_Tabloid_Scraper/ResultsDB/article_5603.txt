Here’s a thought: let’s all be a little bit nicer to Chrissy Teigen.
The 29-year-old model and cookbook author is under fire for saying something in public again, this time concerning any future nannies she may or may not have in her household.
Earlier this week, Teigen revealed that when she and John Legend have (what will obviously be beautiful) offspring, “no hot nannies” are allowed.
Instead of moving on and laughing at and with her, the beast that is the media came crashing down on Teigen and called her out for making such a remark. Enter Teigen and the power of Twitter:

just like low carb diet of licking chips, my “no hot nannies” comment was a joke, clearly lost upon many. what is life. why must i type this

I don’t just go into random rants about hot nannies. The post asked, I jokingly answered. It isn’t that fucking deep. — christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) September 11, 2015

The non-issue comes just weeks after Teigen clarified that her comment on licking Doritos seasoning meant that and only that:

i can’t believe i have to address this but my quote about licking the seasoning off doritos isn’t “promoting eating disorders” it’s a hobby

Never change, Chrissy Teigen. Never change.
