“No hot nannies, drivers or maids,” Teigen said at Lauren Conrad‘s New York Fashion Week show on Wednesday night. “It’s an ongoing joke in my house. I do want kids one day, so it’s something that I have to think about.   
“But the rule is no hot nannies. I trust John, but you never know with these men.”  
While Teigen seemed adamant about not having any desirable women around her hubby, she may have already broken her own rule. The 29-year-old quickly remembered her “hot assistant.”  
“It’s too late for me though, because I have a hot assistant – she is cute,” the Sports Illustrated cover girl said.   
Good looks aside, Teigen joked that in the end there might be no stopping some guys.   
“These days, it doesn’t really matter what you look like – sometimes cabin fever just strikes and men do the do. I have to keep an eye on my assistant. No, damn,” she said. “Christine, you’re done!”
