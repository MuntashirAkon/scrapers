15-Year-Old New Yorker Makes $300K+ Per Year with Babysitting Agency/n
Noa Mintz is 15 years old. She’s got three younger siblings, and she grew up on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, New York. That’s about all that’s standard in Mintz’s life story.   
Three years ago, she had the idea to start her own babysitting agency after finding flaws with the babysitters and nannies her parents used. She started matching her parents’ friends with caregivers she found through her local SoulCycle class and college-prep websites, making more and more connections through word of mouth. She charged clients $100-$200 for each match.  
Today, Nannies by Noa boasts 25 full-time nannies and 50 babysitters. Mintz charges a standard 15 percent of a nanny’s initial gross salary, which can range anywhere from $50,000 to $80,000. The New York Post did the math on those numbers and suggested that Mintz is making around $375,000 in revenue, though she told the paper she doesn’t draw a salary “for now.”  
Mintz hired a CEO in July: Allison Johnson, 26, who initially applied to be a nanny. Taking orders from Mintz, Johnson said, was “a little bit of a challenge at first,” though she says of Mintz, “I really support women who do things for themselves and get their visions out there.”  
Mintz “was always trying to start these mini-companies,” mom Meredith Berkman told The Post. But she’s quick to point out that Nannies by Noa is “not a hobby for her. This isn’t a lemonade stand.”
