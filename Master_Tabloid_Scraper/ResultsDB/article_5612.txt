Charlie & Denise Battle Over Child Visitation, Nannies/n
The amicable co-parenting between Charlie Sheen and Denise Richards appears to have turned sour.    
The Two and a Half Men actor is requesting more visitation rights of his two kids with Richards, according to legal documents filed in a Los Angeles court Friday.  
“What I am doing is pursuing a relationship with my daughters that is unpolluted,” Sheen tells Entertainment Tonight, referring to the filing.   
Among the provisions Sheen wants to amend is Richards’s authority to select which nannies accompany daughters Sam, 3, and Lola, 2, on visits with their father.  
“It is not necessary, appropriate, or in the best interest of the children that [Richards] selects child care providers for my custodial periods,” Sheen argues in the legal filing.  
He also tells the court that he and his new fiancée Brook Mueller, who got engaged last month, “have a strong relationship with the children … and provide them with a structured and safe environment.”  
In addition, Sheen also claims that Richards makes “unnecessary phone calls to me and my home” and asks the court to forbid calls between them except in emergencies.  
Richards, 36, filed for divorce from Sheen, 41, in March 2005, when she was six months pregnant with their second child. In November of last year, a court legally ended their status as a married couple, however, their divorce is not yet complete.  Still at issue is the final division of assets and custody arrangements over their daughters.
