George & Amal Clooney Welcome Twins!!! /nGeorge and Amal Clooney are officially parents after she popped out twins ... a girl and a boy! Their rep says the birth went down Tuesday morning ... and the lil Clooneys are named Ella and Alexander. The high-profile couple had actually been keeping a low-profile lately in England. The last time Amal was out in public was at  "The Promise " premiere on April 6 in London. You'll recall, George showed up to an event 20 days later in London ... with no Amal in sight. Amal did throw George a surprise birthday party last month in London. Their reps says mom and the kids are  "healthy, happy and doing fine. George is sedated and should recover in a few days. "Â  More like 18 years. Congrats!/n
