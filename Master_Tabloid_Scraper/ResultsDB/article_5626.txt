Louis Tomlinson Puts Those Fake Baby Theories To Rest With A New Pic Of Freddie Reign â€” Too Cute!/n

All tuckered out!
On Tuesday, Louis Tomlinson took to Instagram to share an adorable new pic of his son, Freddie Reign, while he was fast asleep. LOVES it!
Although, we have a feeling that the Night Changes singer shared this snap in order to squash the bizarre rumors that claim the British cutie and his baby momma, Briana Jungwirth, faked the birth of their son. That's just nuts!

That baby looks pretty real to us. It's hard to believe it's been around 12 weeks since Louis welcomed his little one into the world!
Not to mention, it seems like the father/son outing was a full family affair as the X Factor vet's sister Lottie Tomlinson is seen in the pic (above).
The new father later took to IG again to share a particularly brooding selfie (above) â€” perhaps to hint at his followers that he was NOT thrilled with their conspiracy theories?
Regardless, we're LOVING these baby Freddie updates. Keep 'em coming, m'kay?
