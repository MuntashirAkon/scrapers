There's a certain amount of debauchery expected at any bachelorette party.
Wild dancing? Sure. Drinking? Expected.
But face plants and puking? Umâ€¦ no thank you.
On the new episode of My Big Fat American Gypsy Wedding, bride-to-be Lottie is going to regret having friend Dallas at her bachelorette party!
Ch-ch-check out the EXCLUSIVE video above! 
Dallas drinks, strips, and painfully trips her way into reality TV infamy. The best part? Dallas' mom Nettie is there to reprimand her on camera.
Things get so bad Lottie reconsiders having her friend attend her nuptials:
"Dallas needs to straighten up before the wedding because I can't have her walking down my aisle twerking."
Wise words!

Did we mention Dallas is only 19? Just because you're a gypsy doesn't mean you can drink underage!
Watch everything fall go down Thursdays at 9pm on TLC.
