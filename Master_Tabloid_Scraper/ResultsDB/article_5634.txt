Little sister prodigies Kylie Jenner, Bella Hadid and Lottie Moss channel “Little House on the Prairie” in a spread for Vogue’s January issue.

The three gals play a round of “Shag, Marry, Kill” with fictional characters Aladdin, Batman, and Harry Potter. “Harry Potter is pretty cool,” Jenner rationalizes over Gryffindor’s main man. “But I don’t think I could be with a sorcerer.”
