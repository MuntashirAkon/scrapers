Lottie Moss, Kate Moss' 18-Year-Old Sister, Lands First Vogue Cover: A Look Back at Her Biggest Model Moments So Far/n
When you share the same genes as Kate Moss, you’re bound to be a model — and nab a Vogue cover before the age of 20. The supermodel vet’s little sister Lottie Moss just landed one of her biggest honors yet, the cover of 
Vogue
 Paris.

She fronts the May issue alongside fellow up-and-comer Lucky Blue Smith in a feature highlighting the “runway stars of tomorrow.” So to commemorate her modeling feat, we’re looking back at her rise from little sis to high-fashion cover star.

At just 16 years old, Lottie made her first official modeling appearance in Teen Vogue‘s April 2014 issue. She told the magazine until then her parents turned down all modeling requests so she could focus on school. “Teen Vogue is my first proper job! I’d really like to work at Teen Vogue,” she said. (Though she admitted that may just be because she’s a fan of old episodes of The Hills!)
Calvin Klein, July 2014
Later that year she landed a Calvin Klein campaign for the limited-edition line with Mytheresa.com, which brought back nine of the most iconic pieces. And clearly, she got a few pointers from her sister, mimicking Kate’s iconic poses from her time modeling for the brand in the ’90s.

And just a few later she graduated to 
Vogue
 status, landing her first editorial for the magazine with Kylie Jenner and Bella Hadid for a supermodel’s mini-me spread. The trio served up 
Little House on the Prairie
 style vibes with their floral frocks and boho braids.

Her dream in 2014 was to earn enough to have a closet full of Christian Louboutin shoes, but said she couldn’t afford any because “I don’t have a job, and I can’t make my parents pay for that.” Looks like she’s well on her way to getting all the shoes she wants.
