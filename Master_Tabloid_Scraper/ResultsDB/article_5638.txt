Kate Moss's Little Sis Lottie Turns 18, Parties in a See-Through Dress/n
Lottie Moss has been following in her 41-year-old big sister’s runway-model high-heeled footsteps for years now (maybe you’ve heard of her: Kate Moss?). First, she mastered her high-fashion editorial ways (working with Vogue and Calvin Klein) and now it looks like she’s raiding Kate’s closet with her sexy, see-through outfit she wore to ring in her 18th birthday. Let’s just say, it’s giving us major ’90-Kate-Moss flashbacks!

The model partied at Wyld Bar in the W London hotel wearing a sheer, cage-motif Balmain long-sleeve dress, completely exposing her black bra and high-waisted briefs underneath. (Anyone else thinking about Kate’s infamous underwear-showing sheer dress?)

Then at some point throughout the night she slipped into something a little less sheer (but just as leggy!) in an orange mini dress.

Lottie has been landing major modeling gigs lately, most recently starring in a Vogue editorial alongside Kylie Jenner and Bella Hadid (a.k.a. the coolest younger sibling model squad ever).

The up-and-coming super made her modeling debut in Teen Vogue in 2014, and solidified her mark with her moody Calvin Klein campaign (at just 16 years old!).
And she told the magazine of her natural skill in front of the camera, “Well, it kind of runs in the family. Kate was a massive part of why I started.” And judging from her edgy, daring personal style, we have a feeling Kate’s influence may be at play there, too!
