Lottie Moss Follows Big Sister Kate's Modeling Path and Slips Into Some Calvins/n
She made her modeling debut in Teen Vogue, so we knew Lottie Moss’s next step would be something big — and we were right. The 16-year-old sister of Kate Moss has landed a Calvin Klein campaign of her own, and it’s clear she’s received some pointers from her big sis.

Lottie fronts Calvin Klein’s new limited-edition line with Mytheresa.com, which will bring back nine of the brand’s most iconic pieces — overalls, sweatshirts and of course, some great cutoffs. The clothing will be made with some updated fabrics and sold in multiple colors. 
The black-and-white ads were shot by photographer Michael Avedon, grandson of famed fashion photographer Richard Avedon, who filmed the famous 1981 Calvin Klein Jeans campaign with Brooke Shields. 
“Lottie truly represents the essence of the Calvin Klein girl,” Avedon said in a statement. “Intriguing innocence with utter beauty — it was wonderful to photograph this beautiful young lady!”

The rising style star told Teen Vogue that her famous sister did influence her decision to pursue a career in modeling. 
“It kind of runs in the family,” she explained. “Kate was a massive part of why I started.” 
She also opened up about her love of fashion. “My dream would be to have all [Christian Louboutin] shoes, but I can’t afford any because I don’t have a job, and I can’t make my parents pay for that.” 
If she keeps nabbing high-profile campaigns like her latest Calvin one, Lottie will be well on her way to a closet full of Loubs. What do you think of her new campaign? Should she star in her next ad with Kate? Share your thoughts below.
