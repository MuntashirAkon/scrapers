Stallone’s daughter has been in the spotlight recently after she and her sisters served as joint Miss Golden Globes at this year’s ceremony. The three helped hand out trophies at the telecast, as their parents proudly watched from the audience.
Last December, Sistine walked in Chanel’s annual Métiers d’Art show, as Vogue named her one of fashion’s fresh faces to watch. The model also appeared as part of Love‘s advent calendar, posing and strutting in black, lacy unmentionables for a new video.
