Gigi Hadid, Kendall Jenner and Kate Moss are all stars in the modeling industry, but now it's the younger sisters who are taking a stab at it.Bella Hadid, Kylie Jenner and Lottie Moss appear in their own spread in Vogue's January issue, looking angelic as ever in floral prints. Although Bella has already nailed several modeling campaigns, Kylie and Lottie are both following in the footsteps of their older siblings."I wouldn't be who I am today if it weren't for all my sisters," Kylie tells the magazine, which is probably true. The Kardashian-Jenner women all have become successes in their own rights, developing apps, designing clothing lines, opening boutiques and appearing on their hit reality series Keeping Up With the Kardashians and all its subsequent spinoffs.Bella is the brunette to Gigi's bombshell blond, making her own statement on the runway and even dating pop star The Weeknd. She recently appeared in his sexy and steamy music video for "In the Night," where she is undoubtedly the star. But if she ever runs into trouble, she'll have her older sister to protect her.
