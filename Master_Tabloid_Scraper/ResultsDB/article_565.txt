Scott Disick's New Girl Ella Ross Hitches a Ride from S.D.'s Driver/nScott Disick's new lady friend had a really hard time finding her ride Tuesday night -- but luckily Scott's private driver happened to be Johnny on the Spot and whisked her away ... maybe to Scott's. Scott's rumored boo -- British model Ella Ross -- simply could not find her Uber after leaving Avenue in L.A. -- going left, right and around to find some kind of help getting home. Then, out of nowhere, Lee Weaver appeared and offered Ella a ticket out of the paparazzi chaos ... for a price, of course. Turns out the dude is Scott's personal driver ... and he says something that may be a clue as to Ella's final destination. The whole thing seems too perfect to be a coincidence./n
