Happy Sweet 16 indeed!Lottie Moss, the half-sister of supermodel Kate Moss, received quite the birthday present on Thursday, Jan. 9, when Storm Model Management officially announced her as its newest member."Now that she has turned 16 we are pleased to welcome Lottie onto our client roster on our News Faces division at Storm," a spokesperson for Storm Model Management told E! News in a statement. The same agency also represents Kate.One day earlier, Lottie actually tipped off her followers of the big news when she tweeted a picture of her portfolio page with the caption, "Wot u sayin."

But it seems the gal is more than just a pretty face.The statement added, "However, as she is in full time education she is concentrating on her exams and this is her focus."Of course, if her sibling's career is any indication, Lottie is destined for success.Speaking of Kate, she recently made modeling headlines of her own.Last month, we not only got our first glimpse of her new Stuart Weitzman spring 2014 campaign photographed by Mario Testino, but the gorgeous gal also appeared in Playboy's 60th anniversary issue.—Reporting by Ruth O'Neill
