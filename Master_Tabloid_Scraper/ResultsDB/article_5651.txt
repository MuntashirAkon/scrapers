Audra McDonald had an extra special Mother's Day this year.The 45-year-old Broadway veteran revealed this morning that she and husband Will Swenson are expecting their first child together."Who knew that tap dancing during perimenopause could lead to pregnancy?" McDonald tweeted. "Will and I are completely surprised – and elated – to be expecting a new addition to our family. I am so very grateful to everyone in New York and London for allowing me to rearrange my schedule to accommodate this little miracle. While I'm disappointed I have to postpone my West End debut in Lady Day, I'm glad I'll be able to spend a little more time in Shuffle Along this summer."

After her full-time run on Private Practice ended, the six-time Tony winner picked right back up where she left off on Broadway and has remained center stage ever since. She's currently leading the hit revival of the musical Shuffle Along, or, the Making of the Musical Sensation of 1921 and All That Followed.Try saying that six times in a row—while tap-dancing.
