Looks like major modeling agencies like to keep it in the family.Joining the ranks of Kate Moss and Lottie Moss, as well as Gigi Hadid and Bella Hadid, Immy Waterhouse is the latest little sister to get in on the modeling game. Older sis is 22-year-old model-turned-actress Suki Waterhouse, who has been dating actor Bradley Cooper since 2013.Immy, 20, signed with Next Model Management, the group that also represents Suki. The older Waterhouse has starred in a major Burberry campaign alongside Cara Delevingne, and also appeared in campaigns for Italian sneaker brand Superga. Immy, meanwhile, has her eyes set on Topshop and Chelsea FC—her football team of choice.

"Suki has shown me that hard work pays off and rejection is a big part of it," Immy revealed to Vogue.com in a post-announcement interview. "Like Suki, I'm not typical height-wise for a model—so she advised me to just forget about those stereotypes."

It seems that having a supermodel older sister doesn't hurt when breaking into the fashion game. Lottie Moss, 16, landed a Teen Vogue spread earlier this year, telling the magazine: "It kind of runs in the family. Kate was a massive part of why I started."And speaking of well-known sister pairs in the modeling world: Cara D now commands magazine spreads and major campaigns as one of the most in-demand models in the business, while older sister (and model) Poppy Delevingne has recently launched a capsule collection with swimwear brand Solid & Striped.   Well, here's to another sister act on the catwalk.
