Did Kanye West Date Transgender Star Amanda Lepore Before Kim Kardashian?/n
Transgender model Amanda Lepore just unleashed a memoir called Doll Parts in which she reveals she once dated a rapper who later ended up marrying a woman “shaped like her.”
Although the voluptuous model does not release the rapper’s name, the internet has gone crazy over speculation that the person in question is none other than Kanye West since Kim Kardashian has a similar body shape.
The New York Times profiled Amanda this week, saying: “Ms. Lepore describes having an assignation with a famous rapper whose songs often play in the clubs she frequents. Soon after, she writes, he got married, and ‘I couldn’t help but think that his wife had a similar body type to me.’ ”
