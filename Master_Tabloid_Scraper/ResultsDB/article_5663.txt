“He better be married! I mean it. He better have a ring on his finger and he better be married,” Matt’s brother Bear sighs while waiting for Matt.
Meanwhile, rebel Matt — who, as fans of Alaskan Bush People know, has battled with alcohol problems, and was even recently admitted to rehab — is in town trying to pick up a pretty brunette wearing a polka-dot dress!
“I do like the polka dots that’s pretty cool,” he flirts. “Did you know that they invented the polka dots in the 1950’s at the same time that they invented the hula hoop? It was named after polka music.”

Later, Matt drops the bomb on his hopeful new lady, Amanda, and asks, “Would you like to do something sometime? Maybe go fishing or watch a movie?”
As Radar first reported, Ami’s family began panicking as rumors swirled this spring that the matriarch had been diagnosed with cancer.
“If you hear that your mother has cancer, it’s going to shock you,” said Ami’s daughter Rain on a recent episode of ABP. “I just wish I could change it somehow. I’m very scared for her.”
