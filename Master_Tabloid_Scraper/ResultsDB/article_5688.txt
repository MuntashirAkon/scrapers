Take a chill pill, everyone. Demi Lovato isn’t bothered by the alleged nude photos of her that have made their way around the internet.

Earlier in the week, it was reported that hackers released two naked photos showing Lovato “in various states of undress.” In the first photo, the person who is thought to be Lovato is seen lying in bed nude, wearing an Adidas sweatshirt unzipped to her navel to show off cleavage. The second photo shows a “faceless woman” who is “exposing the lower half of her body.”
Lovato took matters into her own hands on Tuesday night (Mar. 21, 2017) by briefly responding to the leaked nudes.
“I love how everyone’s freaking out about one picture. It’s not nude and it’s just cleavage,” she wrote, before citing her naked 2015 spread for Vanity Fair. “Besides the world has seen me nude BY CHOICE before.. #vanityfair #nicetry #cleavagegameonpoint #myboobsarenteventhatbig #angles“
