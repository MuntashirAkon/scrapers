Is Gigi Hadid engaged? That was the question on every fan’s mind when the model stepped out sporting a suspicious ring on that finger this weekend.

All throughout Paris Fashion Week, the 21-year-old was spotted with serious bling on her left hand, promoting rumors that boyfriend Zayn Malik had recently popped the question. Hadid further fueled engagement rumors when the “Pillowtalk” singer joined her in the City of Love.
So, what’s the deal?

According to People, Hadid’s new bauble isn’t one from her Malik, but rather the fashion It-girl’s newfound favorite jewelry from designer Amanda Marmer. Retailing at $1,250, the stunning piece features five blue diamonds surrounded by a 14k rose gold band. (Basically, it costs as much as some people’s engagement rings.)
Though Hadid and and her beau aren’t aren’t, things between the couple couldn’t be better. On Sunday (March 5, 2017), Malik shared a video of them packing PDA following his win at the iHeartRadio Music Awards. Opting to skip this year’s ceremony to spend time with his girlfriend in Paris, the 24-year-old thanked fans in the video before sealing the message with a big kiss.
