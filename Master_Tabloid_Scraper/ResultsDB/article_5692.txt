Amanda Seyfried isn’t like regular bride. She’s a cool bride.

The pregnant actress, who was spotted grabbing a drink at Starbucks in Los Angeles on Friday (Jan. 20, 2017), told Vogue Australia that she would never wear a traditional wedding gown her wedding day. Currently engaged to Thomas Sadoski and expecting her first child, the Mean Girls star explained she had no plans to be normal bride because she’s played one so many times onscreen.

“I don’t want to be the centre of attention,” she said. “I get to go to premieres and get dressed up all the time. I went to the Met Gala last year in a wedding gown designed by Riccardo Tisci; I’ve played a bride a billion times.”
As for motherhood, the 31-year-old is confident in taking on the new role. She gushed, “I’ve never been excited by anything more in my life. And ready.”
Seyfried and Sadoski first met while co-starring in the 2015 off-broadway play, The Way We Get By. They started dating after reconnecting on the set of their upcoming movie, The Last Word.
