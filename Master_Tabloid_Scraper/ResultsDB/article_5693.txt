Earlier today (Dec. 19, 2016), we reported that Camila Cabello has officially decided to leave Fifth Harmony. And if her departure isn’t tragic and shocking enough, a new clip has been leaked in which Lauren Jauregui says she and the rest of the group are overworked and treated like “slaves.”

“…To fuck us over, to make us literal slaves, like literally slaves, Ally,” Jauregui claims on the recording. “We’re doing fucking labor everyday and we see nothing.”
Here’s the clip:

It’s hard to guess what the future holds for the group’s four remaining members, including Ally Brooke, Normani Kordei, Dinah Jane and Jauregui, in light of today’s startling revelations.
This is the second week in a row that Jauregui has found herself at the center of a damaging headline. She was arrested at Dulles Airport in Washington D.C. on Dec. 14 for possession of marijuana.
