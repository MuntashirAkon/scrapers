Lingerie Football Fight Ends in 1-Punch KO/nEver see a chick in a thong knock another chick out on her ass with one punch?!  Well, good news ... it finally happened during a Legends Football League game. The bad ass with the iron fist is Amanda Hogan -- a defensive back for the Omaha Heart who just got burned for a TD by the Pittsburgh Rebellion. For some reason, injured Pittsburgh RB Sonia Osselborn -- leg brace and all -- came limping over to get in Hogan's face ... and that's when Hogan unleashed the fury. The Omaha slugger uncorked a straight right, planting a disoriented Osselborn square on her butt.  It's violence meets sexy meets athleticism. Enjoy./n
