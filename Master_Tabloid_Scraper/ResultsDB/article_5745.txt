 Work It Out! ‘VPR’ Couple Jax & Brittany Forced To Fix Relationship For Cameras.../n
Jax Taylor and Brittany Cartwright are on the outs, and RadarOnline.com can exclusively reveal that Vanderpump Rules staffers aren’t tolerating their drama!
“Brittany and Jax are being forced to work on their issues for the show from producers,” an insider told Radar.
Radar previously reported that Taylor, 38, and Cartwright, 28, have been in “rocky territory” after filming their spinoff, Vanderpump Rules: Jax & Brittany Take Kentucky, as Cartwright’s family “pressured” Taylor to propose to their southern belle.

“He said he wants to marry her, but he’s not ready,” an insider said at the time, noting that Taylor told her he would propose soon at Tom Schwartz and Katie Maloney’s wedding last summer.
Since then, Taylor was caught having a boozy night out without Cartwright — and “had his hands all over almost every single pretty girl at the club” he was at!
He went on a guys’ trip shortly after, and Cartwright couldn’t be found on his social media accounts.
