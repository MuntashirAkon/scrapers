Better Call Saul Star Mark Margolis Undergoes Emergency Brain Surgery/n
Better Call Saul star Mark Margolis has undergone emergency brain surgery after suffering a fall off set during filming, and it has thrown his 40-year career — and the show — into doubt!
The veteran actor, 77, plays drug cartel leader Hector “Tio” Salamanca on Saul — the same role he played on Breaking Bad.
“He’s one of the finest actors alive, regardless of whether the role requires him to speak or remain silent in a wheelchair, ringing a bell,” said Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan.

A rep for Margolis said: “Doctors discovered minor brain swelling and performed a routine procedure to reduce it.”
Margolis has already pulled out of the mob film The Neighborhood, claimed a source, and his condition could affect story lines for the upcoming season of Saul.
