HBD, HP! Celebrate Harry Potter's 37th Birthday By Seeing What The Cast Has Been Up To!/n

Yer in yer late 30's, Harry.
Harry Potter fans take any excuse they can get to celebrate the renowned wizard. If it's not the anniversary of J.K. Rowling's books, it's some holiday within the wizarding world.
And no holiday is greater than the birthday of the Boy Who Lived! (Not to mention, the author's birthday!)
So to celebrate the protagonist turning 37, we thought it would be appropriate to take a look at what the Harry Potter cast has accomplished in their years since starring in the blockbuster series!
Surely, most of us have seen Emma Watson as Belle in Beauty and the Beast – but some fans may have missed Daniel Radcliffe playing a magical farting corpse in Swiss Army Man.
See what other popular and obscure projects the cast has taken in recent years (below)!
