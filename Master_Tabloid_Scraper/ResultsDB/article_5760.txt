EXCLUSIVE! Wish Uponâ€™s Mitchell Slaggert Teases Some Deadly Repercussions AND A Killer Smile In This New BTS Look!/n

If you needed a reason to watch the upcoming horror/thriller Wish Upon, let us introduce you to Mitchell Slaggert, one of the super hot stars!
The Calvin Klein model (no joke!) turned actor plays the role of Paul Middlebrook AKA everyone's dream guy, but mainly the longtime crush of Clare Shannon (played by Joey King). While he seems pretty clueless about her existence, when Clare is given an old music box by her dad (Ryan Phillippe) that grants wishes, it's no surprise she'd wish for his affection.
