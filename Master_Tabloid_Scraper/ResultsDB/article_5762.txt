Bernie Sanders Responds After Learning Virginia Shooter Volunteered On His Presidential Campaign/n

This is such a terrible situation.
As we reported, a 66-year-old man named James T. Hodgkinson from Belleville, Illinois opened fire at congressional baseball practice outside of Washington, D.C. on Wednesday morning, injuring many and wounding House Majority Whip Steve Scalise in the hip.
Turns out, not only did Hodgkinson have a history with violence, but he had volunteered for Bernie Sanders during the 2016 presidential election.
After learning this news, the 75-year-old politician immediately made an address to condemn Hodgkinson's actions.

Bernie somberly said:

"I have just been informed that the alleged shooter at the Republican baseball practice is someone who apparently volunteered on my presidential campaign. I am sickened by this despicable act. Let me be as clear as I can be: Violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society and I condemn this action in the strongest possible terms. Real change can only come about through nonviolent action, and anything else runs against our most deeply held American values."
