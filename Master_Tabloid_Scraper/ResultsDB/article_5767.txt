There’s a reason why the woman who robbed Drake’s home couldn’t find anything expensive to steal. It’s because he’s too busy living it up elsewhere.

Just a week after his home was burglarized of $10 worth of water and soda, Drake has holed up inside a $10,000-a-night rental courtesy of Airbnb. Since wrapping up his Boy Meets World Tour in Amsterdam, the “Fake Love” rapper has set up camp at this six-bedroom, seven-and-a-half-bathroom home located in ritzy Beverly Hills.
Dubbed the Villa Grande Bellezza, Drizzy’s temporary digs comes in at more than 11,000 square feet and boasts lavish amenities such as an in-home theater, a wine cellar, an elevator, and a games room complete with its own poker and pool tables. If that’s not swanky enough, an infinity pool, hot tub and outdoor barbecue area are also on premise to ensure that Drake can properly unwind in style.
“Thank you for the gift of this home @airbnb. Great stay!” Champagne Papi recently wrote alongside an Instagram photo of the massive mansion.

However, this is all chump change compared to the $29 million estate he rented out for then-girlfriend Rihanna last year. In September, Drake splashed out big bucks for a romantic hideaway, shacking up with the “Work” singer inside a six-bedroom, 10-bathroom property overlooking Malibu’s Zuma Beach.
Basically, Drake really knows how to live. See his crash pad — below!
