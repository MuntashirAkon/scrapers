Emma Watson is getting quite the paycheck for her role as Belle in the live-action adaptation of Beauty and the Beast.

The actress is reportedly pulling $3 million upfront as bookish heroine, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Sources tell the publication that the 26-year-old is estimated to make five times that — almost $15 million — from the Disney film’s worldwide box office gross.
Watson previously made $60 million combined for her work in the eight Harry Potter movies.
According to industry insiders, Disney is hesitant to offer actors a hefty payday because the studio knows it “has the luxury to not have to put a star in there.”

“The IP is the star of the movie,” a producer tells the magazine. “If you hired Jennifer Lawrence as Belle, would it really make a difference in the opening [of Beauty and the Beast]? Unlikely.”
A lawyer with a client in one of Disney’s upcoming films adds, “They are cheap with everyone.”
While the studio may not be so keen on spending money, it’s certainly making a lot of it. The 2017 remake of Beauty and the Beast has already earned $16.5 million in advance screenings for Thursday night alone. It’s also reported to have made at least $11.5 million overseas on its opening day.
Experts are saying the movie is posed to rake in between $120 million to $140 million this weekend in North America, breaking records for 2010’s Alice in Wonderland and 2014’s Maleficent.
