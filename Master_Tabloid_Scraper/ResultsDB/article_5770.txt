Emma Watson revealed her favorite beauty products to Into the Gloss, and now, payday can’t come soon enough.

Watson ran down the list of the cosmetics and cleansers that she uses on a regular basis, all the while sharing an enviable bit of trivia about her enthusiasm for baths.
“I have a bath every single day of my life,” Watson said. “And if I can have two or three—amazing. Nothing terrible is going to happen in the bath, so I always find time for that. I’ll take phone conversations in the bath, anything.”

In the Beauty and the Beast star’s makeup bag, you’ll find:
The Body Shop’s Red Pomegranate Cheek and Lip Stain:
“It’s something I always wear because A) it doesn’t really look like makeup and B) I tend to get very pale. I’m not someone who has a ton of pink in her skin, so I get washed out without a bit of color added to my face.”

Vita Liberata Self-Tanning Bronzing Powder:
“Four or five years ago, my makeup artist Dotti introduced me to the line Vita Liberata—they do a self-tanning bronzing powder that actually tans you slightly while you’re wearing it. It sounds like a lot, but it’s actually super, super natural.”

DHC Mascara:
“The thing is, I really, really hate using harsh makeup removers, especially around my eyes. They sting and make my eyes water and don’t feel good to me. But the DHC mascara only comes off in warm water.“

Watson also has excellent taste in cleansing products, including this Fur Oil from Fur that “softens pubic hair and clears pores for fewer ingrowns.”
“I’ll use that anywhere from the ends of my hair to my eyebrows to my pubic hair,” Watson said of the $39 oil. “It’s an amazing all-purpose product.”
Her other favorite non-makeup toiletries include:
 Évolué Gentle Cleanser and Firming Toner:
“My skin tends to run pretty dry so I use the Évolué Gentle Cleanser and Firming Toner because it doesn’t have tons of alcohol in it or make your skin sting, but it really does the job.”

And Maria Nila Sheer Silver Shampoo and Conditioner:
“My grandmother was a redhead, so I have quite a lot of warmth in my hair color. But for whatever reason, when it gets dyed, it tends to go a bit brassy or orange. To get rid of that tone, I use the Maria Nila Sheer Silver Shampoo and Conditioner. The brand is amazing—vegan, no parabens, and their packaging is carbon neutral.”
