No Hogwarts robes here! Emma Watson is looking more and more like a princess these days.

Clad in a breathtaking gown by eco-conscious designer Emilia Wickstead, the 26-year-old simply stunned when she walked the red carpet at the Beauty and the Beast premiere on Wednesday night (Feb. 22, 2017). With a long train in tow, the actress, who plays Belle in the upcoming live-action adaptation of the Disney classic, was definitely the belle of the ball as she posed for photos with co-star Dan Stevens.

According to Watson, she currently relies on eco-friendly beauty products to get that ethereal glow. In a recent Instagram takeover with The Press Tour, she broke down her go-to makeup and skincare travel essentials. Surprisingly, they’re all super affordable!
Amongst her must-haves include Vita Liberata Trystal Minerals Self Tanning Bronzing Minerals in Sunkissed, Ilia Soft Focus Fade Into You Powder, Jane Iredale PureBrow Brow Gel and RMS Beauty Un Cover-Up. Watson also admitted to being a fan of Jessica Alba’s makeup line, Honest Beauty, because the brand “champions fair labour and human rights with their Health & Sustainability Standards.”
