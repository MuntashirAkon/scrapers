After a year of self-discovery, Selena Gomez looks to be ready to make her return to music.

According to Mexican pop star Paulina Rubio, she’ll be collaborating with the “Hands to Myself” singer on a new single off her upcoming album, which is slated to be released some time next year. The 45-year-old also adds that she’ll be working with DJ Snake, who teamed up with Gomez’s ex-boyfriend Justin Bieber on the 2016 smash “Let Me Love You”.
“My new album is like another member of the team, or the family. It will be a true warrior, has something from all genres, from band to pop, collaborations of DJ Snake and Selena Gomez,” Rubio tells Vanidades magazine. “I tried to keep a key element: That the music is danceable.”

Word of this duet comes just a week after Gomez was photographed inside a recording studio by songwriter Justin Tranter, who she previously worked with for 2015’s Revival.
It was also recently announced that Gomez, after taking time off to deal with her mental health and complications stemming from her battle with Lupus, just signed a $10 million deal with fashion label Coach.
“I’m not trying to get validation nor do I need it anymore,” the former Disney Channel star said at this year’s American Music Awards, where she made her first public appearance since taking a 90-day hiatus from social media. “All I can say from the bottom of my heart is that I am so grateful I have the opportunity to share what I love every single day with people that I love.”
