The annual Art of Elysium Heaven Gala has turned into a must-attend event for Hollywood's A-list—and for two in particular in 2017.The non-profit organization, which promotes creative services between artists and communities in need throughout Los Angeles and New York City, will celebrate the organization's 20th anniversary at its 10th "Heaven" Gala on Jan. 7—the night before the Golden Globes, as is tradition.That night, the spotlight will be on Stevie Wonder and Camilla Belle during the charity's largest annual fundraiser, with proceeds directly supporting the empowerment of young, aspiring artists in the disciplines of music, fine art, fashion and theater/media arts..Wonder has been selected as the 2017 Visionary and will conceptualize his idea of heaven for the black-tie gala's one-night artistic installation, while Belle is the recipient of the Spirit of Elysium Award for her sincerity, initiative, and commitment to volunteering, as well as her overall support for Art of Elysium.

"I am honored and humbled to be receiving the Spirit of Elysium award for being involved with an organization that I believe in so deeply," Belle said in response. "The Art of Elysium has become a part of my daily life over the years."Past Spirit of Elysium Award recipients include Amber Heard, David Arquette, Elijah Wood, James Franco, Kirsten Dunst and Eva Mendes. Jennifer Howell, who founded the non-profit in 1997, explains, "Artists are creators with a platform that can alter the way people experience the world around them, particularly during challenges or crisis-driven situations. Our volunteers are inspired through their acts of service and creating from a place of compassion, resulting in their artistry becoming a catalyst for social change and transformation."
