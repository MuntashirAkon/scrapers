Another day, another bob!Camilla Belle is the latest celebrity to embrace the big chop. Looking effortlessly chic in a CH Carolina Herrera blouse and lace skirt combo, the actress debuted her shorter ‘do at the brand's boutique opening in Los Angeles.Also at last night's fashion fete (cohosted by Vanity Fair) were A-listers Angie Harmon, Molly Sims, Rashida Jones and Ali Larter and Amy Adams.

It is hard to tell when Belle actually got her haircut, as last night was her first red carpet event since March.Mind you, the actress has been busy filming Amapola. She also was working on Love Is All You Need with Twilight hunk, Kellan Lutz.What is clear is that the star lobbed quite a few inches. Before her new crop the actress had been rocking extra long sleek lock—falling far past her shoulders—for the past few years.

The chin-length style is similar to the textured bobs currently being sported by Jennifer Lawrence and Karlie Kloss, which was named Haircut of the Year by Vogue.Despite being just one of many celebs to opt for the bob this year, Belle knew just how to let her new hairstyle steal the spotlight. The 26-year-old complemented the curly crop with a dash of pink eye shadow, matching petal lipstick and mascara. As for accessories, a simple navy clutch and coral Christian Louboutin peep toes kept her look minimalistic.

Her gorgeous cut comes just days after Milla Jovovich returned to a similar ‘do, and only a week after Jaime Pressly tweeted a pic of her sleek bob.At the rate Hollywood is going there might not be any long haircuts left on the red carpet.
