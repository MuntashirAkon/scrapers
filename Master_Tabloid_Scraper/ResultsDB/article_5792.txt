It's a proud day here at the Fashion Police Academy. Today we are recognizing the profound fashion contribution Camilla Belle has made to a Louis Vuitton runway show in Paris.Camilla, though a younger cadet sometimes prone to falling in with the torn-jeans-and-skate-shoes set, showed up to the event in a sexy but tasteful vintage-inspired combo. Her beautiful creamy blouse, bubble-gum colored skirt hemmed at the appropriate length and ribbon-tied shoes all make her look effortlessly classy.We'll throw our full weight behind any starlet with the courage to forgo the sideboob shirt and ankle-boot lookâ€”and embrace sophisticated couture. Camilla, today we applaud you!
