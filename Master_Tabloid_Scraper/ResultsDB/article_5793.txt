She bangs, she bangs?Camilla Belle changed up her gorgeous bob over the weekend, debuting blunt bangs with her short 'do at Friday's A Quest for Beauty: The Art of Van Cleef Arpels exhibit in Santa Ana, Calif.The 27-year-old stunned in a fab floral Oscar de la Renta fit-and-flare dress, but we have to admit we were too distracted by what was happening above the star's neck to notice much else about her outfit.Not only were her bangs a new addition to her look, but they—along with the rest of her coif—looked decidedly darker than her normally chocolatey hued strands.

And while Belle is a master when it comes to nailing perfectly tousled hair, her latest look struck us as peculiarly stiff, leaving us to wonder if she had reached for a pair of clip-on bangs, or perhaps a wig.She wouldn't be the first star to experiment with faux fringe. Remember when Kim Kardashian fooled her Instagram followers into believing she got bangs, only to reveal a few hours later that her new style came courtesy of clip-ons?And with Halloween around the corner, wigs are as common as hair ties. Perhaps Belle was simply test-driving her costume? We're definitely getting a chic Cleopatra vibe from the (now) dark-haired beauty!
