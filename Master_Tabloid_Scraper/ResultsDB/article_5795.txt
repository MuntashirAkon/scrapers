Bella Hadid Chills on a Yacht in Cannes in Tiny White Bikini (PHOTO GALLERY)/nBella Hadid's used to the high life, but even she had to make a few minor adjustments while cruising around on a baller yacht in France. The supermodel got some sun and enjoyed a smoke Saturday in a smokin' hot bikini. Bella's in the country for the Cannes Film Festival, but there's always time to hang out with friends on a luxury double-decker yacht. All that's missing are the mimosas. No word if Bella's planning on meeting up with fellow model Emily Ratajkowski, but either way ... she's living le belle vie./n
