Model Belle Lucia Becomes New and Improved Carmen Electra from 'Baywatch' /nCarmen ElectraÂ might have made great eye candy on  "Baywatch " during the '90s -- but that was then, and this is now ... so here's Belle Lucia in a similar suit. The Australian model channeled her inner Lani McKenzie during a photo shoot in Sydney, where she even got the famous slo-mo run down ... (inflatable) rescue can and all. We gotta say, Belle and Carmen look A LOT alike here. So the question ... is Belle new and improved, or does nothing beat a classic?/n
