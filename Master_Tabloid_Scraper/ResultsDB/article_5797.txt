Ronda Rousey -- She's Back from Marine Corp Ball ... and She's Back!/nRonda Rousey was her old self Saturday at LAX, after her big date at the Marine Corp Ball. The only hint she's still struggling with her loss to Holly Holm was an off-handed comment about smiling. She kept her promise to escort Lance Corporal Jarrod Haschert to the big event in South Carolina. We got Ronda before the Connor McGregor fight, so no word there. Â And she had few words about her boss, Dana White, endorsing Donald Trump for President./n
