Al Sharpton to TMZ: "Roboho" a Big No-No/nNational Action Network President Al Sharpton has set his sights on TMZ.com over the word  "Roboho " in a fashion piece that was published two weeks ago: "Calling any woman a  "ho " is demeaning and abusive and it should not be tolerated on any level. It is intolerable to think that TMZ.com would find humor in calling Beyonce -- someone who symbolizes the strength, dignity and uplifting of Black women -- a  "Roboho, " and they should be denounced by the entire community for glorifying the continued oppression of women with this derogatory term. Racism in America is perpetuated by ignorance and hate and using one's airwaves or media entity to promote it is a blatant setback to civil rights and the advancement of equality.  National Action Network has been in the forefront of protesting the word  "ho " and will hold a 20-city tour featuring 100 women in each market on August 7th to protest the use of the word  "ho " as well as the  "N " and  "B " words. We encourage TMZ.com to retract their misogynistic labeling of Beyonce and apologize immediately. "TMZ's Response:In response to your statement questioning TMZ's use of the term  "roboho " in our BET Awards fashion story, please note that we called Beyonce's performance outfit a  "roboho " not Ms. Knowles herself. There is a difference. As to accusations that our comment was racially motivated, TMZ has humorously called into question many celebs for wearing racy outfits -- regardless of their race. We've called Lindsay Lohan's trashy ensemble a  "HO-rror " and even gave Kid Rock a humorous  "ho " reference in a December 2006 story. Isn't the context in which a word is used almost as important, if not more so, than the actual word? While others may have used the term with maliciousness -- we clearly did not. It was a humor piece -- as all of our fashion roundup stories are. TMZ appreciates your feedback, Rev. Sharpton, and the dialogue it has opened, but it is clear that the only thing more subjective than what is fashionable, is what one finds funny.

Nicole Richie in Deep  The Commissioner in the Nicole Richie DUI case did not grant the continuance Nicole Richie wanted. Period.As TMZ first reported, Richie's lawyer asked for a continuance until August 5th, because her expert witness, Dr. Terence McGee, was not available to testify then. Commissioner Steven Lubell was visibly upset and ordered both Nicole's lawyer, Shawn Chapman Holley, and the prosecutor into chambers. When the Commissioner came out, he said he would not rule on the continuance and ordered all parties into court tomorrow morning at 8:30 AM -- that's when the trial is scheduled to begin.Seems like Nicole is in a pickle. She flew to Calgary last night with baby daddy Joel Madden, who is performing a gig in the Great White North. Will Nicole bail on the concert and come back to face the Commish?We'll let you know!
