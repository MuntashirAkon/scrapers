Lesley Murphy Debuts New Breast Implants After Preventive Double Mastectomy/n
Just two months after her preventive double mastectomy, reality star Lesley Murphy has had successful breast implant surgery, RadarOnline.com has learned.
As reported, in April of this year, Murphy, who appeared on Sean Lowe‘s season 17 of The Bachelor, revealed that she underwent the procedure after discovering she carried the BRCA 2 gene — putting her at a higher risk of getting breast cancer.
In the weeks following her initial surgery, Murphy had an expander placed in her chest in preparation for breast implant surgery.

 Over the past 12 weeks, I had a prophylactic double mastectomy and watched as 90 CCs of saline were pumped into my expanders every Tuesday, making a grand total of 460 CCs. It's been my craziest adventure to-date…I would literally look down in my plastic surgeon's office and watch my nurse insert the most massive needle into my boobs where they would then grow right before my eyes. Medicine is the coolest, and even though they don't exactly look natural in this photo (or any day for that matter), I kind of love them and all of their awkwardness. In just 83 days, I went from a completely flat chest in horrific pain to somewhere around a comfortable C-cup. Well…as comfortable as I can be in these expanders. The best way I can describe them is like two big boulders on my chest. True story: I tell everyone to poke them just because I think it's hilarious to see their look of shock once they feel how hard they are🤣It's insane to think that going from expanders to implants isn't apples to apples, and my exact size is ultimately up to my plastic surgeon's discretion tomorrow as he decides what fits/looks the best (since I'll be comatose on an O.R. table and can't exactly make final decisions🤷🏼‍♀️). I was always indecisive anyways, and I trust him wholeheartedly. We've had many convos about this 🙂 In a few hours I'll be back in the hospital completing a task I knew I'd set out to do the moment I found out I was BRCA 2 positive. Knowledge is power and I feel powerful knowing I kicked cancer's ass before it could kick mine. The past 3 months have been a whirlwind. Thank you to all of my followers, readers, friends and family from the bottom of my heart for all of your messages and support. I wish I could adequately explain how much you have helped my recovery process. I love you to the O.R. and back!💞 Wearing @goodnightmacaroon. #lesleysbreasties #lesnipsbrcainthebud #breastcancerawareness

Thank you to all of my followers, readers, friends and family from the bottom of my heart for all of your messages and support,” she told Instagram followers. “I wish I could adequately explain how much you have helped my recovery process.”
Now, Murphy is a 500 CC, “which is actually smaller than my expander size when you take into consideration those CCs plus the bulky expander,” Murphy said. She made sure to thank Wright personally ” for ridding me of those boulders and giving me my normalcy back!”
The star made sure to thank plastic surgeon, Dr. Eric J. Wright, who considered “many different variations and sizes” on behalf of his patient.
