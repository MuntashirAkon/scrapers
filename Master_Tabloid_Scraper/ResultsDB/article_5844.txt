Weepy White Nationalist From Vice Documentary Surrenders Himself To The Police/n

Looks like this white nationalist has something new to cry about.
On Wednesday, Christopher Cantwell turned himself into the police for his involvement in the Charlottesville riot. Warrants were issued for Cantwell's arrest after he was caught on camera pepper spraying a counter-protester at the demonstration which took place on August 11.

Authorities have since booked Christopher on two counts of illegal use of tear gas and other gases, and one count of malicious bodily injury with a caustic substance. Each of these charges are felonies.
Although Cantwell was antagonistic in Vice's coverage of the violent rally, he openly wept in a video on Facebook when he learned he may be arrested for his participation in the catastrophic protest. Smh.
It's said the New Hampshire resident surrendered himself over to the police in Lynchburg, VA. Currently, he is being held in a regional jail before he is transported back to Charlottesville.
Hopefully, this means justice will be served soon.
