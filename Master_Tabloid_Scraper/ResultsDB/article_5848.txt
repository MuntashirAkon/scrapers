Solange has had enough of the hate.

The “Cranes in the Sky” singer shut down her Twitter account in the wake of the violent rallies in Charlottesville, Va. Before signing off for good, the 31-year-old shared a final message to rally support behind Takiyah Thompson, a woman who was arrested in relation to taking down a Confederate monument in Durham, N.C.
Via Revolt TV:
Solo wrote, “deleting my twitter soon, but before I dip when are we gonna pull up ? & what we got to do to get my new hero Takiyah Thompson free?”
However, even after deleting her account, Solange continued to voice her opinion via a note shared on her Snapchat account.
The singer denounced and mocked members of the aforementioned alt-right groups, while admitting that she struggled to remain positive and was concerned about her son’s education.
