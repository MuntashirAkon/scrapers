Adorable as they may be, Kate Middleton’s kids aren’t always so well-behaved. Case in point: Princess Charlotte’s tiny temper tantrum on the last day of the royal family’s tour of Germany.

After checking out the helicopters at a local airport with dad Prince William and older brother Prince George on Friday, the 2-year-old had a mini meltdown on the tarmac when she was told it was time to go home. Like what many a children would do in a similar situation, Charlotte planted herself firmly on the ground and refused to walk.

Kate, who was clad in a lavender dress by Emilia Wickstead and nude Gianvito Rossi pumps, tried to comfort the child by crouching down and speaking with her daughter. After wiping a away a few tears from the tot, the Duchess of Cambridge picked up Charlotte in her arms before climbing aboard their private jet.
On the other hand, Prince George looked happy to return home to England as he skipped up the stairs to their plane. Wearing a checkered shirt from Neck and Neck and navy shorts, the 3-year-old seemed excited to get a start on his birthday celebrations this weekend.

“George has got a big tummy,” William gushed about his son during the trip, according to Daily Mail. “He’ll probably end up eating all his cake by himself!”
