Chrissy Teigen was a charitable and fashionable role model over the weekend.

Mercedes Edney, a woman from Charlotte, started a crowdfunding campaign about a month ago to raise money to pay for her esthetician school tuition. According to NBC News Chicago, Edney had raised about $300 when Teigen stepped in to donate the remaining $5,600 on Friday (Apr. 7, 2017).
“I’ve seen this be your passion for such a long time now. So excited to see you fulfill your dream,” Teigen said in a note with her donation.
Eden told NBC News, “I was at work, and I heard my PayPal alert go off. I saw the amount and said ‘what the hell? what’s wrong with PayPal?’ I thought it was a glitch.”


@CruzanChoklate I'm really excited for you to live out your passion ❤❤❤
