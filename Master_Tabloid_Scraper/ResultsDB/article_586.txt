“I do appear towards the end of the season,” Dixon confirmed to Radar exclusively. “They saved the best for last!”
A show insider previously told Radar that Kate Chastain, Nico Scholly and Rosbach were the only returning crew members from season 4. Production fired one of their new cast mates halfway through the new season.
Now, it looks like Dixon, 27, took his replacement’s role! He confirmed he left his London hometown to travel via Instagram — but he didn’t say where he went.

His return came just after news of his arrest broke. Dixon explained to Radar exclusively that he was arrested for allegedly robbing a bar in the U.K., but he insisted he was innocent.
The source also told Radar that Dixon is currently living with his daughters’ mom now that his relationship with his transgender girlfriend Ashley is over.
Dixon confessed to Radar that their romance ended when he welcomed a second daughter, Willow, with his ex. He is already dad to Florence, 3.
