Love Child! Kyle Dixon Reveals SHOCKING Reason For Breakup With Trans Girlfriend/n
Kyle Dixon became a father for the second time — behind his ex-girlfriend’s back!
The Below Deck star revealed to RadarOnline.com exclusively that he and his ex welcomed their second daughter, Willow, just 15 weeks ago. Ashley was understandably upset, and finally ended their on-again-off-again-relationship.
“I used to work for a pub crawl, and I was working one night and I was like, ‘that’s my future wife right there!'” he said of his baby mama.

He explained that he went home with someone else that night, but he formally met his kids’ mom a week later. They subsequently got together and welcomed Florence, 3, before splitting.
He met Ashley while they were broken up, and began a relationship with her as well.
Now, he is “trying to get back together” with his daughters’ mom, despite his on-the-go career.
“It doesn’t bother me,” he said of being away from his kids. “I’m not good at connecting.”

Dixon revealed to Sierra Storm on the Bravo show that he has a daughter — and he struggled to provide for her before Below Deck. He explained to Radar that Valor’s first officer Barry “Double O Baz” Cross even helped him send home money to Florence, and was his “unsung hero.”
For now, the family seems to be doing well — and Dixon isn’t opposed to having more children one day.
“I still need to go for the boy!” Dixon joked.
