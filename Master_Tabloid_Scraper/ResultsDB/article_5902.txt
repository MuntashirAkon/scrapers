Cam Newton's Truck -- The Wreckage (PICS)/nTMZ Sports has obtained new pics of Cam Newton's truck -- which show just how bad it was banged up in Tuesday's wreck. After the collision, which occurred right near Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte, Cam's Dodge Ram 1500 truck was hauled to a nearby tow yard. Sources tell us the truck sustained so much damage from the rollover crash, it's considered a total loss.  It's fortunate Newton didn't have a passenger in the car -- because as you can see in the photo, the roof on the front passenger side caved in when it rolled over. Witnesses say the car rolled at least 2 times. The truck was not your average Dodge Ram -- we're told it was pimped out especially for Cam ... with a custom lift job and other cool features. Of course, Newton walked away with only minor fractures in his back -- but he's gotta be bummed to lose the ride./n
