Lovelorn Tom Gets Brush Off!/n
Tom Cruise is so hot for sexy Swedish co-star Rebecca Ferguson, he’s cast her in a second Mission: Impossible flick — but she’s nixed any romance when the camera’s stop rolling.
The 33-year-old bombshell, who played tough agent Ilsa Faust in 2015’s Mission: Impossible — Rogue Nation, was cast in the upcoming M:I 6 — Mission Impossible. Sources say the move was a way for Tom, 54, to cozy up to her, but so far she’s rejected his advances.
“Tom’s definitely been looking for a girlfriend,” notes a snitch. “He hasn’t been this single in a very long time.

“He’s really into Rebecca and would do anything to date her! But she’s making him chase her.”
While the beauty — who starred in the Starz series The White Queen and the hit flick The Girl on the Train — is separated from Ludwig Hallberg, dad of her 9-year-old son, Issac, sources say she’s been wary of hooking up off-screen with Cruise, a global leader of the Scientology space cult.
But the thrice-divorced hunk figures their working together will wear her down, which is why he demanded her character back for the newest action flick.

“It’s because of him she’s back for M:I 6 … he carries a lot of clout,” says the source. “In this new movie, she’s in the action mix a lot more!
“It’s rare to bring back a character in these movies — but Rebecca really made an impression on Tom! He hasn’t been able to get her out of his head. She’s incredibly clever, classy and funny!”
