'Brady Bunch' Star Florence Henderson Dead At 82/n
The Brady Bunch crew, who all starred in the hit TV series in the ’70s, received some bad news on Thanksgiving this year: Florence Henderson, who starred as their TV mom Carol, had died at 82.
According to her manager, she was admitted to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles on Wednesday, and quickly passed on Thursday from heart failure.
