We mean, as the episode was filled with LOTS of waterworks, we can't say we're surprised to see that Bachelor nation had a lot to say about Rachel Lindsay's final rose ceremony and so much more. So, in honor of The Bachelorette finale, we've collected the best reactions to all of the highlights from the three hour episode. You're welcome!
Obviously, there are MAJOR Bachelorette spoilers ahead‚Ä¶ 
Eric's Beard Sets The Internet On Fire
The season 13 finale almost immediately started with heartbreak as happy-go-lucky Eric Bigger was sent home during the episode's first rose ceremony. Despite the fact that Eric JUST poured his heart out to Rachel, the personal trainer maturely parted ways with the powerhouse attorney. Although, we have a feeling Miz Lindsay may've slightly regretted her decision when Mr. Bigger showed up to the live show looking dapper AF.
And, boy, did the internet take notice. Fans on Twitter noted:

Eric: *walks on stage*

When Peter Cries, We All Cry
The most dramatic moment from the finale HAD to be when Peter Kraus refused to propose to Rachel at the end of their journey. Understandably, the Wisconsin native felt their relationship hadn't progressed enough for them to get engaged. Thus, the twosome had a tearful goodbye ‚Äî and an awkward reunion on the live show.
THIS is what the internet had to say about the drama‚Ä¶

Many are asking why Rachel left Peter crying but aren't asking why Peter leaves all his GFs crying? He can't commit. #TheBacheloretteFinale

#TheBachelorette finale Peter is still hurting and Rachel is being cold af like she mad at him for not being ready like ditch the attitude

We need time to recover from this heartbreak.
Twitter Is NOT Feeling Rachel's Fianc√©
We actually feel kind of bad for Bryan Abasolo. As we previously reported, Rachel accepted Bryan's proposal after having a heartbreaking split with Peter in Spain. This fact made MANY fans skeptical that Rachel was head over heels in love with the Miami native ‚Äî and they had NO PROBLEM expressing this opinion (below).

List of people who told Rachel not to pick Bryan:
- All the guys.
- Her family.
- America.
- The Wind. #TheBacheloretteFinale pic.twitter.com/BwJO9mOgZE

I refuse to believe that you can cry that hard over one person one night and get happily engaged the next to someone else #TheBachelorette
