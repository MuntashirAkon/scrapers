Tom Cruise, The Womanizer?? Former Costar Details ‘Intense Affair’ & Girls Lining Up To Give Blow Jobs!/n

Apparently Tom Cruise was very popular with the ladies as the star of Risky Business!
It's not hard to believe, especially as the A-lister's former costar Curtis Armstrong, most famous for his role as Booger in Revenge of the Nerds, dished all the juicy deets in his new tell-all!

In fact, he even went so far as to detail the 54-year-old's affair with his leading lady and Risky Business love interest Rebecca De Mornay, who was dating actor Harry Dean Stanton at the time.
Curtis spilled: 
"It's no secret that Tom engaged in an intense affair during the shooting with De Mornay. I suspect that most of Harry Dean's great qualities were lost on Tom, who, I think, was beginning to regard him as a guest overstaying his welcome."
But even so, Tom also wasn't seeing Rebecca exclusively:
"Returning late one night, I found three or four young girls — late teens, I suspect — lined up in the hall outside of Tom's room. They just stared at me, and at that moment, Tom's door opened and another girl came out, adjusting her hair and taking off down the hall, while the first girl in line slipped into Tom's room. This was a young man who knew something about time management and understood how to successfully juggle Bible study and blow jobs."
We have a feeling Cruise won't be too happy to hear about either of those stories making it into Curtis' book, but oh well!
Revenge Of The Nerd will be in stores July 11, so who knows what other gems are in there…
