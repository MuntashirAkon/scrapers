The 33-year-old's family reported the "domestic accident" on her social media page, claiming the pressurized canister exploded, hit her chest, and reportedly sent her into cardiac arrest.
French media outlets report Burger had died of cardiac arrest after the incident, despite receiving medical attention.
The family also posted a photo of the deadly canister with a warning about using similar products. They claim thousands of "defective devices" are still in circulation: 




Voici un exemple de siphon à chantilly qui a explosé et percuté le thorax de Rebecca, entraînant son décès. Précision : le siphon qui a engendré sa mort quant à lui été mis sous scellé. N'utilisez pas ce genre d'ustensile chez vous ! Plusieurs dizaines de milliers d'appareils défectueux sont encore en circulation.A post shared by Rebecca Burger (@rebeccablikes) on Jun 20, 2017 at 12:08pm PDT
