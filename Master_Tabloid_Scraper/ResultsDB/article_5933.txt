The Beyhive is in full meltdown amid rumors that Beyoncé is in labor.

Everything started hitting the fan when Bey’s longtime friend Chuck Amos shared a selfie with the “Hold Up” singer, writing on Instagram, “Hang in there, Mama! 💛 You @Beyonce!!” The encouraging message, which was shared Tuesday night (June 13, 2017), quickly sparked speculations of the arrival of Beyoncé’s twins.
However, people truly started freaking out after Us Weekly confirmed that a significant amount of security guards — which many took as a sign of Queen Bey’s large entourage — have been stationed at a Los Angeles-based hospital. Though nothing has been confirmed, fans were nonetheless excited about the impending arrival of music royalty.
Needless to say, Twitter has been buzzing all day:

Folk are reporting that Queen Mother, Queen Beyonce is in labor.
I’m not ready for White Lotus and Purple Reign.

Beyoncé, 35, and Jay Z, 47, announced they were expecting twins in February. “We would like to share our love and happiness,” they said in a statement. “We have been blessed two times over. We are incredibly grateful that our family will be growing by two, and we thank you for your well wishes. – The Carters.”
The couple are already proud parents to 5-year-old daughter Blue Ivy.
