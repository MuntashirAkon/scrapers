Eric Dane is taking some much-needed time off.

The Grey’s Anatomy alum has temporarily shut down production of his TNT series, The Last Ship, so he could seek treatment for his depression.
“Eric asked for a break to deal with personal issues,” a rep tells Variety. “He suffers from depression and has asked for a few weeks of downtime and the producers kindly granted that request. He looks forward to returning.”
Production of the show, which is slated to debut its fourth season this summer, will be on hiatus. Sources says shooting for Season 5 will commence after Memorial Day.
In 2011, Dane, 44, checked himself into a 30-day rehab program for an addiction to painkillers.
The actor shares two daughters — Billie, 7, and Georgia, 5 — with wife Rebecca Gayheart.
