Bill O’Reilly is speaking out for the first time since his dismissal from Fox News.

The embattled host, who as fired from the network after several women accused him of sexual harassment, took to a podcast shared on his official site to air his grievances.
“I am sad that I’m not on television anymore,” the 67-year-old said in the 19-minute recording. “I was very surprised how it all turned out.”
“I can’t say a lot because there’s much stuff going on right now. But I can tell you that I’m very confident the truth will come out. And when it does — I don’t know if you’re going to be surprised, but I think you’re going to be shaken, as I am,” O’Reilly continued. “I can’t say anymore because I just don’t want to influence the flow of the information. I don’t want the media to take what I say and misconstrue it. However you, as a loyal O’Reilly listener, have a right to know, down the lane, what exactly happened. And we are working in that direction.”
O’Reilly was let go from Fox News on April 19 amid revelations that he and the cable news network paid millions of dollars to settle allegations of sexual harassment from multiple women, including hosts Juliet Huddy, Rebecca Diamond, Laurie Dhue, and junior producer Rachel Witlieb Bernstein. He had been with network for over 20 years prior to departure.
