Lauren Mann, an American nanny, was discovered dead in her Vienna, Austria apartment in what police believe to be a homicide.

Alarms were first raised when the Colorado native didn’t show up to her employer’s home. Soon after her absence, the family contacted police officials.

Later that day, firefighters and cops forced their way into the apartment, discovering Mann’s body on a mattress. The working nanny had a sweater across her face, with her arms stretched along her body, The New York Daily News reports.
When they first arrived, all of the light bulbs in the twenty-something’s apartment had reportedly burned out, forcing investigators to replace them before assessing the scene.
Mann had been sharing the apartment with a Gambian immigrant who was living in Austria illegally, local papers reported, and police had been looking for him prior to her death. The nature of his relationship with Mann has not yet been uncovered, though investigators are looking into a possible motive.
