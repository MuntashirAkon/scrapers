Many fashion industry vets have been very critical of newbies like Kendall Jenner and Gigi Hadid who have largely built the careers on their huge social media followings, but there’s at least one supermodel who’s a fan.

Naomi Campbell recently revealed her true feelings about Jenner and Hadid during an interview with Remix Magazine, and she had nothing but good things to say about the new it girls. “I think they’re great. I know all of these young girls, Instagram girls,” she dubbed them. “And they’re all really respectful and sweet.”

Campbell went on to admit that she’s even had a hand in helping them create their signature walks, “If I can ever help them, it’s a pleasure for me to do that. I’ve helped a few of them with their walks.”
While it would be easy to compare the respective model’s rise to fame, Campbell seems to understand and respect that the fashion industry, like everything else, is ever changing. “I think it is a change in the industry. It seems to be that there are so many more models now and it is so much more competitive. It just seems to be that they come in and out much faster.”
“There is a group of girls, I think, that have staying power” she continued. “I never thought I’d be doing it this long either.”
