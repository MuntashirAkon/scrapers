Rebecca Black Drops Out of School, Blames Bullying/n
Who dares mess with our "Friday" girl?!Unfortunately, not everyone was a fan of Rebecca Black's viral YouTube hit (yeah, we were shocked, too) and decided to take it out on the young singer at school.During an interview with ABC's Primetime Nightline, Black discusses the bullying she endured which ultimately led to her mother's decision to have the 13-year-old home-schooled.

Friday has now turned out to be Rebecca's least favorite day. Black explains that classmates would taunt her by asking what day it was or by singing the tune "in a nasally voice."It became too much, even for her mother."It's hard to go to school when you are so famous and to have kids constantly making fun of what's going on," she said.However, home-schooling won't end the massive amounts of death threats and horrible comments Rebecca receives each day, but the young lady won't let that overpower her."I've had a lot of experience with not being liked and all that," she said. "I think if I hadn't had to deal with that in the past then I totally would have handled this differently and I would have gone down in burning flames. But I've learned that you just can't let it get to you."Attagirl.
