New former model feud alert?Rebecca Romijn recently stirred some controversy when she said she hates that "social media stars are now the supermodels in fashion," seemingly referring to daughter Gigi Hadid and Kendall Jenner.The 43-year-old model-turned-actress then clarified her comments, tweeting, @kendalljenner @gigihadid don't believe the #clickbait. Never talked smack about you. Both amazing & beautiful."However, it appears Gigi's mom Yolanda Hadid, 52, a former model herself and current star of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, wasn't buying it."Kind, hard-working and they accomplished more at half your age in the fashion industry @KendallJenner @GiGiHadid," she wrote Friday in response to Romijn's latest post."Woohoo! Twitter beef cherry popped! ❤️ you @YolandaHFoster @Andy," Romijn replied.
