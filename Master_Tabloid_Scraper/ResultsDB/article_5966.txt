Chace Crawford and GF Rebecca Rittenhouse Go Dutch in L.A./nHey upper east siders, Gossip Girl here. Guess who was spotted splitting the bill on an L.A. lunch with his gf ... none other than Chace  "Nate Archibald " Crawford. Must be one of those millennial relationships ... y'know half tabs are the latest trend. After all, Chace and Rebecca Rittenhouse met a couple years ago while co-starring on ABC's  "Blood & Oil, " which got canceled only a few episodes deep. At least they got each other out of the gig. The big question: Did either of them cheat? On the tip amount.  XOXO, gossip girl. /n
