Robert Griffin III -- Taking Parenting Lead From Steph Curry /nRG3 is firmly planted in the pro-Steph Curry camp -- when it comes to kids at news conferences -- telling TMZ Sports he plans to follow suit with his own little girl ... when she's old enough.  The Redskins QB and his wife Rebecca welcomed their 1st daughter Reese Ann earlier this month -- so, when we saw him out in D.C. this weekend we had to ask ... is Reese Ann gonna get a Riley Curry moment?  Of course, certain media members have been bitching about Steph's decision to bring Riley to the NBA post-game pressers -- claiming she disrupts the regular process with her adorableness.   But Griffin's all about it ... telling us he'll  "for sure " bring her to the podium ...  "I just don't want to bring her too early. "  By the way, RG3 was attending an event called the House Inc.’s National Capital A Cinderella Ball -- which honors children connected to the military with a disability or life-threatening illness.  #Respect/n
