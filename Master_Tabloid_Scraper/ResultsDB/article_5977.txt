Robert Griffin III -- Healthy Enough for Grab-Ass In Hawaii/nRobert Griffin III's recovery seems to be going well ... 'cause the Washington Redskins QB is stomping around the beaches of Hawaii with his smokin' hot wife. Since his team didn't make the NFL playoffs, RG3 and his wife Rebecca jetted to the islands for a little R&R ... even playing a little grab-ass on the sand. Of course, Robert was benched toward the end of the season to avoid re-injuring his already tender left knee. For the record, RG3 isn't in Hawaii for the Pro Bowl, since he wasn't selected to play in the game. Then again, nobody cares about the Pro Bowl anyway./n
