Sidewalk Nostradamus/nJerry O'Connell can see into the future! He predicted that video of his filthy car would end up on TMZ -- and he was right!Another photo agency caught O'Connell and hottie wife Rebecca Romijn in West Hollywood, but Jerry thought the camera was TMZ's. Contrary to popular belief, we can't be everywhere at once -- and the photog was quick to correct him. The couple then recognized the pap as one staked out at their wedding -- and while that would normally be an awkward situation, the duo actually hit him up for some photos!
