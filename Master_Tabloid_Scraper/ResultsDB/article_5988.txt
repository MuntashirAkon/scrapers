Romijn & O'Connell -- Still Together!/nAfter four whole days as husband and wife, Rebecca Romijn and Jerry O'Connell aren't sick of each other yet.  TMZ cameras spotted the sexy-yet-somehow-bland couple outside the Fergie concert at the Wiltern Theater in L.A. last night, with Jerry looking mighty Fergalicious with the former Black Eyed Pea proudly displayed on his T-shirt. When asked if the hand-holding couple was still married (remember Britney was once married for just 55 hours) -- Romijn replied,  "And they said it wouldn't last! " -- before running away with her hubby.  Related Articles      Tickle Me O'Connell/n
