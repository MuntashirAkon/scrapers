Charlie Sheen's Victims Gunning For Baseball Collectables Cash!/n
Trainwreck actor Charlie Sheen has indeed pawned off his beloved Babe Ruth memorabilia, but even if he sells the baseball legend’s ring for millions, he may not be rolling in the dough!
An insider confessed to RadarOnline.com, “Some of the people who he settled lawsuits with because he didn’t disclose his HIV status haven’t been compensated yet. They are going to put liens on him to get the proceeds from the sale!”

Sheen, 51, has pathetically pawned his prized baseball possessions as he struggles to scrap up the cash to settle the suits.
“I’ve enjoyed these incredible items for more than two decades and the time has come,” Sheen told ESPN of the goods, which are up for auction on Lelands.com . “Whatever price it brings is gravy.”
Even though his collection is worth well over $2 million, bidding for the baseball legends’ 1927 World Series ring is only up to $500,000. But the Two and a Half Men star is so desperate for fast cash, that he doesn’t even seem to care about the low-ball offers.
