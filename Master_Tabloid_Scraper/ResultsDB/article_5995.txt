He also owed $8,844 on his truck, and $80,000 to his ex, Mary Ruth Jackson. His son, Jake Jackson, was listed as a co-debtor one of his credit cards.
The reality star reported that he is self-employed, but was hemorrhaging $2,836.17 per month. Jackson had just $69.95 in one corporate checking account at the time he filed, and $2,200 in another. He had $4.46 in a military-sponsored checking account, and $25 in a USAA savings account.

He did not have any cash on hand, but claimed ownership of nine domain names involving Texas Flip & Move.
Jackson also filed for bankruptcy in 2001, but the case was dismissed.
He is not the first Texas Flip & Move star to find himself in trouble! Radar previously reported that Suzi Slay was arrested for drug possession  and Donna Snow Landers evicted her husband during their bitter divorce war.
