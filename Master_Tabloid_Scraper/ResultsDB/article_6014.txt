Shondaland Stars Strut Their Stuff To Taylor Swift's Look What You Made Me Do â€” But Not Everyone Is Feeling It!/n

ABC moves quickly.
The TV network capitalized on the hype surrounding Taylor Swift's new single, titled Look What You Made Me Do. How??
Well, on Thursday, ABC dropped a new trailer for their "Thank God It's Thursday [TGIT]" lineup and used Miz Swift's new banger as the theme song. The clip features Shondaland stars Ellen Pompeo, Kerry Washington, and Viola Davis strutting their stuff amid clips of their characters' most badass moments.

It only makes sense that Tay Tay's track be featured on a TGIT promo as Pompeo is a part of the pop star's squad!
Be sure to ch-ch-check out the promo in all of its glory (below).
