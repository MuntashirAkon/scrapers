 Kim’s Baby Heartbreak: Disappointed Kardashian Is ‘Taking A Break’ From Trying For.../n
Kim Kardashian has been very vocal about trying for another baby, but RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned that she’s still not pregnant. And now, sources say, the disappointed reality star is “taking a break” from trying.
The 34-year-old has been eager to expand her small family, but admitted it hasn’t been “as easy” to conceive the second time around. And after meetings with specialists and having sex “500 times a day,” she’s calling it quits — for now.
“Kim has been taking a break from trying to get pregnant,” a source told Radar. “She really, really wants to give North a sibling, but she is saying that she has been too stressed about it so she has stopped trying for now.”

One sign of her new outlook? “Kim bleached her hair and she’s focused on looking her best,” the source said. “She just isn’t going to make getting pregnant her only priority right now.”
“It’s been so hard on her body, and before she does IVF or any other fertility treatments she decided she wanted to take a month off.”
Meanwhile she is back in Europe, where North was conceived, but the source said she is forbidding anyone from bringing that subject up.

“Kim doesn’t want anyone to talk about the fact that Europe is a good luck place for her and Kanye since North was conceived in Florence. She just wants to ignore the fact that she hasn’t been able to get pregnant, hoping that if she relaxes a little bit it will happen for her.”
