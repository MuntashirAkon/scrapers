Bughead is real!

Riverdale’s Cole Sprouse and Lili Reinhart — who play Jughead and Betty on The CW series — are dating, according to People. The budding relationship landed on everyone’s radar when the two were seen “canoodling, holding hands and kissing” during Entertainment Weekly’s Comic-Con Bash in San Diego Saturday night.
An eyewitness told E! News the co-stars were also partying together on Friday, saying Lili, 20, “always had her eye on where Cole was.” At one point, she was spied with Cole, 24, “briefly talking closely by the pool.” The insider noted “they weren’t showing any obvious PDA,” but it looked like “something was going on” between them.

The duo since returned to Vancouver to shoot scenes for the second season of the live-action drama based on the Archie Comics. Their characters started a romantic relationship on the first season of the show.
The couple were first romantically linked after Cole, who sometimes moonlights as a photographer, snapped a picture of his castmate for his Instagram. “Lili and I play characters who are dating,” he told MTV News in May, “so just about any time she and I go out into the wilderness, it’s, ‘Oh, my god!’ Truthfully, I’m a sucker for friends, fashion and framing.”
