Lorde may be friends with Taylor Swift, but she doesn’t consider herself as a member of the singer’s famous squad.

When questioned by Australia’s Sunrise about how it feels befriending famous musicians like Taylor and Beyoncé, the 20-year-old songstress responded, “The second you think too hard about it, you’ll go insane. It’s best to be like, ‘We’re in wonderland and it’s just what happens around here.’ I don’t hang out with these people at all.”
“But hang on,” host David Koch pressed on, “You’re part of Taylor’s squad!”
Letting out a slight grown, Lorde explained, “I mean … You make friends in different places, but I think for the most part, I’m not calling up my idols for advice, necessarily.”

Recently, Lorde compared her friendship with Taylor to an “autoimmune disease,” saying, “There are certain places you can’t go together. Certain things you can’t do. There are these different sets of considerations within the friendship.” The New Zealand native later apologized for the “insensitive” comment.
In 2012, the two BFFs faced rumors they were secretly feuding over collaboration disagreements. At the time, Taylor took to social media to refute the reports. “Media, when you say “Lorde & Taylor are fighting”-by fighting do you mean “FaceTiming constantly from US to NZ and LOLing at you”? Thnx bye,” she tweeted.
Lorde added, “sisters are doin’ it for themselves.
