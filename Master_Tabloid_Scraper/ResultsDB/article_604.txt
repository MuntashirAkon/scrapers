To honor their time together, Kimmy posted some behind-the-scenes photos from the big day on her personal website and app.
It's a nice distraction from the backlash following her controversial tribute to Manchester victims.
She wrote:

"HAPPY THREE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY BABE! THANK YOU FOR BEING THE BEST HUSBAND AND FATHER. I LOVE YOU SO MUCH."
Awww! Three years and two babies later, they're still going strong despite rumors that there's trouble in paradise.
A source also tells E News that everything is hunky-dory, and that the two will spend their anniversary together: 

"Kanye and Kim are on a good path. They have been really working on their marriage and their overall daily lifestyle with incorporating each other in it during crazy and busy times. Their kids have been the stick that has kept them together in hard times. Kanye and Kim both been through a lot but they have both got help and counselling on their own and with each other."
That's awesome to hear! We wish them many more happy years together!
