The first look at Jake Gyllenhaal's Broadway debut alongside The Affair's Ruth Wilson is finally here!The two star in Nick Payne's play, Constellations, which features a couple navigating through the various paths and options within their relationship.During a guest appearance on this morning's Today show, the actors opened up about their upcoming project and how excited they are to be costars on such a highly anticipated play."It's a real honor, it's pretty cool to be up there" he explained to Savannah Guthrie."It's a love story in every different possible universe. All the possibilities that one love can take and that the world can bring to it and that the universe brings to all of us. I think it's really one of the most extraordinary new works in theater. I was moved by it when I saw it in London and I'm moved to be in it here."

He continued, when asked about whether it's exhausting working with such a jam-packed Broadway schedule, "No, it gives me a lot of energy and I'm working with an incredible actress so that exchange is enervating and you get offstage and you're jolting."Wilson, who appeared on The View recently, also shared some insight on the production aspect of the play."It's not a linear structure, it's 60 minutes, it's two actors, there are no props, there's no staging," she dished."And it's amazing."(E! and NBC are both part of the same NBCUniversal family.)
