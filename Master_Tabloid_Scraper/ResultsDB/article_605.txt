Billie Lourd & Taylor Lautner's Love Is In Full Bloom!/n

You guysss.
We're so happy to see Billie Lourd and Taylor Lautner are still going strong – especially if they're gonna keep bringing us this adorableness!
The Scream Queens costars-turned-lovers took a trip to the Antelope Valley California Poppy Reserve on Monday, and it looks like the getaway was nothing short of magical!
The 25-year-old shared a sweet photo on Instagram (above), with the caption:
"🌼🔐💧PoppyLockNdropit"

The 24-year-old daughter of the late Carrie Fisher had a pun of her own, as she posted:

🌼👘🌼I went to the poppy reserve and all I got was this bizarre pic of me in a kimono making a mildly awkward face surrounded by 4ish dying poppies #findingthefunnyA post shared by Billie Lourd (@praisethelourd) on Mar 27, 2017 at 9:15pm PDT

So fun!
Switching gears, we're also hearing that Billie will not be the permanent owner of her mom's beloved dog, Gary, as the late star's longtime assistant, Corby McCoin, has taken the little guy into her custody as she was often responsible for taking care of him anyway.
See some photos of their happy times (below)!!
