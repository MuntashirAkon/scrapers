Meryl Streep's Oscars Red Carpet Look Is ANYTHING But Overrated!/n


And just like that, Meryl Streep whipped past most on the red carpet!
The Florence Foster Jenkins actress chose a navy Elie Saab stunner for the Oscars â€“ featuring beads, a belt, and PANTS! So fab, we can't even.
She completed the flaw-free look with matching peep toe shoes, a flowy blow-out, and chandelier earrings.
Love her!
P.S. Get a look at her on stage, too (above)!
