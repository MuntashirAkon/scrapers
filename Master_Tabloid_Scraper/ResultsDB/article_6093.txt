Hundreds Of Football Fans Are Protesting The Blacklisting Of Colin Kaepernick In Front Of NFL Headquarters!/n

Is the NFL blacklisting Colin Kaepernick??
That's what many believe, and they're willing to put their money where their mouths are ‚Äî by boycotting this football season!
Over the past few weeks, after it became clear that no team was going to sign the quarterback, who has been out of his San Francisco 49ers contract for five months, more and more have supported Kaepernick with their lack of dollars.

According to many experts, though Colin isn't the sure thing he was four years ago, it's not his lack of ability that's keeping him off the field but  the controversy surrounding him.
Kaepernick famously took a knee during the National Anthem in protest of police brutality toward black men, a cause for which many woke NFL fans have his back. And by that we mean they literally have his number on their backs.
Derrick Johnson of the NAACP sent a letter requesting a meeting with NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, saying:
"No player should be victimized and discriminated against because of his exercise of free speech ‚Äî to do so is in violation of his rights under the Constitution and the N.F.L.'s own regulations."
Goodell has denied that the 32 teams are banning Kaepernick or that the league itself has banned him. But that hasn't deterred angry fans.
Over 170,000 have signed a Change.org petition to boycott the NFL as long as he remains unemployed. And many showed up at a protest in front of NFL Headquarters on Wednesday:
