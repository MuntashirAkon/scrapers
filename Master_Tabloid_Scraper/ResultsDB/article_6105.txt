Ashley Graham just narrowly missed a major mishap.

The model was walking down the red carpet at the Time 100 Gala on Tuesday (Apr. 25, 2017) when the heel of her Jimmy Choo stilettos got caught on the train of her high-slit Nili Lotan skirt, causing her to trip in front of a crowd of photographers. Like a true professional, the 29-year-old laughed it off as she regained her composure.
“I’ve never fallen on a runway before,” she told the press after the stumble.

The star-studded event was also attended by Chrissy Teigen, John Legend, Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds, Viola Davis, Riz Ahmed and Margot Robbie as guests toasted the magazine’s cover stars with Johnnie Walker cocktails.
Graham — who was honored at exclusive party as one of the most influential people in the world — is in good company when it comes to taking a tumble. Two years ago, comedienne Amy Schumer also fell at the Time 100 Gala. As a joke, the Trainwreck star purposefully threw herself on the ground in front of Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, hoping make  make the A-list couple laugh. (Sadly, both failed to crack a smile.)
“All the reporters were going crazy, and it was Kim and Kanye, just standing there, just like owning it just like being short and important,” she later explained of the stunt on The Graham Norton Show. “I think falling is the funniest thing, so I just took a dive in front of them and pretended like I fell.”
See? Tripping practically a tradition!
