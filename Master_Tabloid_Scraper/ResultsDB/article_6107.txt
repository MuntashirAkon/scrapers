You’ll be seeing Harrison Ford back in the friendly skies soon.

The Star Wars actor has avoided penalities from the Federal Aviation Administration after he almost crashed into an airliner this February for landing on the wrong runway. According to a statement from the FAA, the 74-year-old will not be fined — nor will he lose his license — for the incident.
As previously reported, Ford nearly collided with an passenger plane on Feb. 13 when he landed at the John Wayne Airport near California’s Orange County. Piloting a single-engine Aviat Husky, he mistakenly aimed for a taxiway instead the runway that ran parallel to it, narrowly avoiding an American Airlines jet that was preparing to take off beneath him.
“Was that airliner meant to be underneath me?” Ford was heard asking the control tower in a recording.
The FAA just closed the investigation into the matter this week, citing controllers did give Ford the proper landing instructions and that he had correctly read back the clearance.
Landing on a taxiway is a violation of FAA safety guidelines and violators could have their pilot’s license revoked.
