Jodie Sweetin’s former fiancé Justin Hodak was arrested for the third time since he and Sweetin called off their engagement.

Hodak was first arrested on Mar. 18 when Sweetin called 911 after Hodak allegedly threatened to commit suicide. According to the LAPD, “During the course of the investigation, he [Hodak] was found to possess a firearm, he is a prior felon, and a prior felon may not possess firearms.”
He was arrested a second time a week after the first arrest on Friday (Mar. 24, 2017) when he allegedly violated an Emergency Protective Order that was put into effect as a result of his first arrest. Law enforcement told Entertainment Tonight, “[Hodak] came back over to the residence which he was restrained from, and officers made contact, and he was arrested for violating a court order.”
Finally, on Monday (Mar. 27, 2017), Hodak was arrested for violating a restraining order granted to Sweetin following both arrests. According to the restraining order, Sweetin said that her ex-fiancé had been “abusing alcohol and marijuana” the night that he threatened to commit suicide and that he “escalated the conflict by pulling down a 7-foot bookcase.”
