Fans aren’t happy with Cuba Gooding Jr’s latest antics.

Many took to social media to express their anger after the actor pulled up co-star Sarah Paulson’s dress during a PaleyFest panel for American Horror Story: Roanoke this Sunday (March 26, 2017). When they two took the stage, Gooding Jr. jokingly lifted the hem of Paulson’s skirt when she was greeting Kathy Bates, exposing her legs — and, thankfully, only her legs — to the crowd.

cuba could have had the purest intentions, & sarah could even be completely okay with it, but what he did holistically is still not okay!

it’s not okay, even in grade school, you don’t pull any girls skirts up…and she’s on a stage with MANY people looking at her…
