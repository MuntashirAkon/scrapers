Bethenny Frankel’s ex-husband Jason Hoppy appeared in court on Monday (Mar. 13, 2017) to face the harassment and stalking charges that were brought against him after he threatened Frankel in front of their daughter Bryn’s school earlier this year.

According to NY Daily News, Hoppy, through his attorney Alex Spiro, rejected a plea offer of pleading to a harassment violation in exchange for going to anger management. The case was adjourned to April 26 and Manhattan Criminal court Judge Abena Darkeh ordered Hoppy to refrain from contacting Frankel, “unless a family court judge orders otherwise.”
Hoppy was arrested on Jan. 27 after he approached Frankel and a friend at their child’s school and tried to provoke a fight.
“He said, ‘I will destroy you, you can get all the lawyers you want, you’ve been warned,'” an NYPD spokesperson told People at the time. They also added that Hoppy “had sent numerous emails and FaceTime calls numbering in the hundreds after a cease and desist letter was sent on Nov. 22, 2016.”

Hoppy was charged with harassment in the first degree and stalking in the fourth degree following his arrest. A judge later issued a restraining order against him at his arraignment.
“There are no words to express how saddened Mr. Hoppy is over his ex-wife’s unjustified actions,” Hoppy’s former attorney Robert C. Gottlieb said in a statement after he denied the charges. “His only concern is his daughter and intends to vigorously fight these false charges.”
Frankel and Hoppy’s divorce was finalized in July 2016.
