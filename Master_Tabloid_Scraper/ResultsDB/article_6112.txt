Ellis, who had struggled with drug and alcohol abuse for years, died from heart complications on July 8 after he reportedly attempted to withdraw from alcohol on his own.
In a statement released on July 10 by Ellis’ manager Emily Gerson Saines to The Hollywood Reporter, Saines said that Ellis’ father had explained that the actor started going into heart failure after he attempted to withdraw from alcohol. Ellis also had many “stints in rehab” before trying to withdraw without any assistance.
Ellis is survived by his son, Breon, as well as his grandmother, Alex Brown, and his father, Tommie Lee Thompson. He is also survived by his siblings Lakeeia Thomson, Tommie Lee Thompson, Babon Ellis, Maurice Turne, Tianna Thompson, Shaentika Beard and Yvonne Ellis and aunt Tartheaia Thompson.
