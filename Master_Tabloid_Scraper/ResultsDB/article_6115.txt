The actress, 51, opened up about the dreams she had for her daughter to PEOPLE, saying her worst fear was that Genesis would grow up to feel “entitled.”

“I never had a house; Genesis has a house,” she said. “I do shop at Target, I buy all her clothes at Target or H&M. And maybe, if I’m feeling really good, Nordstrom Rack.”

Despite her fears, she said she and her husband Julius Tennon hold Genesis “accountable for everything,” and they just might be raising a Wonder Woman of their own if Davis’ strength and success are anything to go by.
Wonder Woman hits theaters on Friday.
