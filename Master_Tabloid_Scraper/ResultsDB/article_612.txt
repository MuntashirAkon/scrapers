More than five years ago, the cast of Jersey Shore were sent to Italy to film scenes for the reality show. Now, Nicole “Snooki” Polizzi and Jenni “JWoww” Farley are revisiting those (drunken) moments courtesy of a time capsule the two recently unearthed.

“Oh, this is so embarrassing,” Snooki admits in a new video for their Awestruck web series, #MomsWithAttitude. “I feel like we’re looking at something from middle school. Like, that’s how embarrassing it is.”
Apparently, Jersey Shore-era Snooki and JWoww had lined their keepsake box with their favorite quotes — don’t worry, “cabs are here” is included — and filled it with souvenirs from their European vacation. The trinkets they kept included Christmas ornaments they bought in Florence, coasters from the winery where Snooki and JWoww had their “first best friends’ fight,” and a homemade collage of seashells they found at Riccione.

“Nicole and I were wasted,” JWoww recalls the trip. “We were wasted.”
Just this week, the Jersey Shore gang reunited to celebrate castmate Sammi “Sweetheart” Giancola’s birthday. While Snooki and JWoww kept the drunken antics to a minimal — after all, they are married moms now — the girls did ring in their friend’s big 3-0 with a huge party with Deena Cortese and Vinny Guadagnino.
