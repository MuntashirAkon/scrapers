This is an outing Viola and her little girl won't soon forget, as our source shared that Genesis, 5, is a budding musician and knew all of The Beatles that music played throughout the show!During the Cirque du Soleil spectacle, we're told Viola couldn't help but dance along to "Strawberry Fields Forever," determined to grab the enormous bouncy balls that make their way through the audience. "She was so full of life!" the source added.It's been quite a year for the A-lister, who took home her first Academy Award in the Best Supporting Actress category, and received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. "I cannot believe my life right now," the Fences actress remarked. "Meryl Streep spoke at my Hollywood Walk of Fame ceremony with my handsome husband [Julius Tennon] and our beautiful daughter."

E! News caught up with Viola and her daughter at the event, and when asked if she wants to follow in her mom's footsteps, Genesis replied, "Yeah, cause she's awesome at her work."Aww!
