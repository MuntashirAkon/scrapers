Viola Davis Is Keeping It 100 On 'Suicide Squad' /nViola Davis isn't shying away from the headlines surrounding her new movie,  "Suicide Squad " -- in fact, she's facing 'em head on in this clip. We asked Viola -- who plays intelligence officer Amanda Waller -- about director David Ayer getting f-bomb happy at the NYC premiere, and she's definitely got his back. As for some pretty harsh reviews of the film? Viola seems to be blowing that off, but her reaction to our photog suggesting the flick might get Oscar attention ... is priceless. Gotta respect her honesty. /n
