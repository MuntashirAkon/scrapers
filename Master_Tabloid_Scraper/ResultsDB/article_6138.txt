'Idol' Contestant Talks About Missing Mom/nAngela Martin -- the  "American Idol " contestant whose  "A.I. " dreams have been derailed twice by personal turmoil -- just appeared on the Ryan Seacrest radio show to make another plea to find her missing mother. Martin's story is heartbreaking: She's made it to Hollywood twice before auditioning again this season -- but both times, she left the show early. Her father was murdered during her  "Idol " run in 2007 and in 2008 she had to quit because of a court appearance. Now Angela has made it to Hollywood again -- but this accomplishment has been marred by the mysterious disappearance of her mother Viola Brown Martin -- who went missing the day after a family Christmas dinner back in December./n
