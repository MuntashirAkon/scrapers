Kobe Bryant: Gets Offer From Dad's Italian Team ... In Majestic Letter/nIt might be the most passionate, poetic job offer ever -- the letter an Italian basketball team sent to Kobe Bryant ... begging him to play for them after he leaves the NBA ... and it's friggin' beautiful.  The team behind the offer is Viola Reggio Calabria -- the team where Kobe's dad, Joe  "Jellybean " Bryant﻿, dominated back in 1986-87 ... once scoring 69 points in one game.  The team got word that Kobe has been kicking around the idea of playing overseas -- and reached out through an open letter to the Mamba ... which included a picture of him wearing a Viola shirt back when he was 8 years old.     "The picture shows an eight-year old boy, proud to wear the jersey with the words Viola Reggio Calabria. Unbeknownst back then, he was destined to great things. That eight-year-old boy was you, Kobe. "  There's more ...   "Dear child of Reggio Calabria, fantastic Kobe, on this most beautiful stretch of land that is full of affection for you we close our eyes and dream. "  "There will always be a home for you at this great club on the Straits of Messina. Our dream might be too big but maybe it is the same dream you unknowingly had as that 8-year-old boy in the picture. "  "We want you to come home, to wear our colours, to represent our city, just as your father did before you. There is a black and orange family waiting for you, with the same name on the back: 'Bryant.' "  "A warm hug, dear Kobe, our great basketball legend. " So far, no word on if Kobe's actually considering the offer. /n
