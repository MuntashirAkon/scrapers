Chanel’s creative director Karl Lagerfeld claimed that Meryl Streep wouldn’t wear a gown from his most recent couture collection to the Academy Awards on Sunday unless she received a paycheck to do so.

According to a report from WWD, Streep was “taken with an embroidered gray silk gown” of Lagerfeld’s, and so it was ordered by the house. She requested an adjustment on the design, which was underway until Chanel’s atelier was told to stop working on the dress.
“I made a sketch, and we started to make the dress,” Lagerfeld told WWD. According to him, the phone call from Streep’s camp said, “’Don’t continue the dress. We found somebody who will pay us.'”
Lagerfeld explained that Chanel has a policy of not paying celebrities to wear their designs.
“She could keep the dress because of the size. It’s couture. It’s perfect for her,” Lagerfeld said, adding, “A genius actress, but cheapness also, no?”
Streep’s camp refuted Lagerfeld’s claim in a statement issued to Entertainment Tonight.

“This is a completely untrue story,” Streep’s rep, Leslee Dart, told ET. “Ms. Streep would NEVER wear anything in exchange for payment. This can be corroborated by Nancy Walsh [director of public relations] at Chanel.”
Streep is nominated in the Best Actress category for the Academy Awards on Sunday for her performance in Florence Foster Jenkins. This is her 20th Academy Award nomination, which makes her the most-nominated person in Oscars history.
