Justin Bieber, who? Just a day after her ex-boyfriend mocked her budding relationship with another man, Selena Gomez was spotted getting hot and heavy with new beau The Weeknd aboard a yacht.

In photos obtained by PopSugar, the couple were seen taking a late-night cruise around Marina Del Rey, Calif. Sitting on the top deck, Gomez and The Weeknd, whose real name is Abel Tesfaye, didn’t hold back the PDA as they cuddled under a blanket aboard their private boat. At one point, the “Hands to Myself” songstress leaned over and gave her boyfriend a few kisses on the lips.
“They are falling for each other,” an insider recently told E! News, adding the “Starboy” singer “has told [Selena] how much he cares for her.”

Explaining that the couple have a “crazy connection” mentally and physically, the source said, “Abel is proud to have Selena by his side.”
We’ll say! Last month, Gomez and The Weeknd enjoyed a romantic vacation in Italy together, embarking on a global adventure filled with PDA. Just this weekend, the two were back at it again as they partied at Los Angeles hotspots Catch and 1OAK following the Grammys.
Something tells us they’ll be spending Valentine’s Day together, too.
