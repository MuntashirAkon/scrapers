Radar previously reported that Thompson told the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star that the baby wasn’t his, but it wasn’t enough for her!
“Khloe is so insecure when it comes to Jordy and she’s convinced her latest stunt — blowing kisses at the camera in lingerie with her bump on full display — was meant for Tristan,” an insider told Radar at the time.

“She thinks it’s pretty trashy what Jordy’s doing, but everyone knows Khloe has fertility issues and this whole mess is really messing with her head,” the source added.
