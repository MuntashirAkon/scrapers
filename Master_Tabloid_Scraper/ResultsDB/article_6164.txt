Robinson claimed in her 2014 filing that she was an assistant and talent wrangler for the show and that Peck and Nunez would tickle her, ask her if “she likes to suck d**ks,” and even called another judge on the tattoo competition show a homophobic slur.”
In new exclusive documents obtained by Radar, the parties involved, including Original Media and Viacom, told Judge Batts they have “engaged in good-faith settlement discussions [regarding a settlement], but have not yet reached a resolution.”
The attorneys stated in a letter to the court that they “believe a settlement conference before a Magistrate Judge would be beneficial at this time.”

Radar also obtained the “Protective Order regarding Confidentiality of Discovery Materials,” which states that “any party shall have the right to identify and designate as ‘confidential’ or ‘highly confidential: attorneys’ eyes only,’ any documents, materials, testimony, information or trade secrets.”
Robinson’s attorney declined to comment to Radar, stating: “We cannot provide comment on ongoing litigation.”
