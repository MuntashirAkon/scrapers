This news comes only a short time after Chester's close friend and fellow rock star, Chris Cornell, committed suicide. How awful.
Unsurprisingly, many in the industry have since taken to Twitter to pay tribute to the Numb singer — including Jimmy Kimmel, Imagine Dragons, Chance The Rapper, etc. Be sure to take a look at their heartfelt notes (below). 

Chester was one of the kindest men I've had on my show. My heart breaks for his family and friends. He will be missed terribly.
