Selena Gomez is taking her relationship with The Weeknd to a new level.

Like what pal Taylor Swift did when she was dating Tom Hiddleston, the “Hands to Myself” singer embarked on a European vacation with her beau just weeks after making their romance public. Two days after they were seen enjoying a date night at Dave & Buster’s in Los Angeles, Gomez and The Weeknd were spotted getting cozy in Florence, Italy. Pictures and videos of the two popped up on social media on Friday (Jan. 27, 2017), showing them enjoying an intimate lunch at Trattoria Borgo Antico.

An onlooker tweeted that the two tried not to draw attention to themselves during the meal, saying Gomez and The Weeknd were acting “so reserved” before leaving together in the same car.
However, another photo of the lovebirds showed Gomez — once again — with her arms wrapped around The Weeknd. Clearly, that’s a thing she now does with the “Starboy” crooner now.

This trip to Italy follows reports that Gomez and The Weeknd are officially following each other on Instagram. Let’s just hope they do a little better than Hiddleswift.
