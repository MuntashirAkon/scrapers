Bella Thorne is moving on.

Though she’s been romantically linked to Scott Disick all summer, the Famous in Love star recently admitted she has started dating someone other than the 34-year-old father-of-three. While Thorne, 19, and Disick remain close, the actress insisted their relationship now is strictly platonic.
“We are [just friends],” she told Us Weekly at the IGoLive launch party on Wednesday, where Blac Chyna was spotted hanging out with fellow Kardashian ex Lamar Odom. “I think we’ll be friends for a long time, honestly.”
“I do have someone that I am starting to see,” she added without revealing a name.

Earlier this month, the Disney Channel alum claimed she “was never with him sexually” despite their PDA-filled fling in Cannes this May. On top of denying she had slept with Disick, Thorne was also quick to refute claims she had cut their vacation short when she found out he had been spending time with other woman.
“Scott is really nice, sweet, charming. I don’t drink, and he really drinks a lot. And it just ended up… I just wasn’t down. I was like, ‘I gotta leave,’” she told Complex of the infamous trip. “We were [at Cannes] a day and a half before I was like I’m booking my flight and leaving. I love to go out and have fun, I love to f**king dance, but I just don’t party hardcore like that and it was way too much for me. I was like, ‘Woah, this is not the way I live my life, bruh.'”
