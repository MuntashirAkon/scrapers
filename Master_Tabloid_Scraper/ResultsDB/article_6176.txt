Katy Perry insists she does’t have bad blood with Taylor Swift.

The “Swish Swish” singer once again addressed her ongoing feud with her longtime nemesis, saying on a recent segment of Australia’s Today show, “I mean, I love her, I always have.”
“We’ve had our differences but I just continue to say, ‘God bless her on her journey,'” she added.

Of course, this wasn’t the first time the 32-year-old tried to make amends with the “Shake It Off” songstress. Earlier this year, Katy seemingly tried to extend an olive branch to Tay by saying she’s “ready for that BS to be done.”
“That might be your story,” she told Natalie Morales during a sit-down with Today, “but my story, which I know is true for me, is that I’ve had not just one person bully me or one person hold me down or met one troll. All I need to say to her is I love her, and God bless her on her journey. And that’s it.”
