Oops! She did it again.

Selena Gomez suffered major wardrobe malfunction Tuesday night (June 6, 2017) during a dinner date in New York City with The Weeknd. Clad in a semi-sheer LBD, the “Bad Liar” singer accidentally exposed her nipples when flash bulbs from the paparazzi’s cameras went off.
If that wasn’t bad enough, the bright light was also able to capture the 24-year-old’s underwear as she was climbing into her car. Talk about a double whammy.

Earlier this week, Selena gushed about being in a relationship with the “Starboy” singer. She added she loves catching his shows — like the one at the Barclay Center last night — with her “hair in a bun” so she can “dance all night” without a care in the world.
“I love being supportive,” she told Sirius XM. “I love just being there and having someone’s back. It feels good. I haven’t had that feeling in a while.”
