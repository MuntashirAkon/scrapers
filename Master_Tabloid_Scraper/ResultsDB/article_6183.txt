Katy Perry says she’s beef-free despite whatever situation with Taylor Swift she addressed in her Carpool Karaoke segment during James Corden’s Late Late Show Primetime Special.

Perry stopped by the Morning Mash Up on SiriusXM on Tuesday mornng (May 23, 2017) to elaborate on the (not-)argument with Swift that she dearly wishes to end as she fully embraces her new era of artistry. Perry says that she contacted Swift to try to set the record straight about the situation involving their backup dancers that opened up the divide between them.
“I tried to do the right thing, the good thing, and you know, she shut me down and wrote a song,” Perry said.

The hosts of the show asked Perry if she would take Swift’s call if she ever tried to extend an olive branch to her and she replied, “Absolutely.”
“By the way, I am ready, because I think when women unite, the world is going to heal,” Perry added. “I don’t have any beef with anyone. I love everyone, and honestly, I love everyone and I think we need to unite more than ever….We need to come together and love on each other today,”
