Ashmore and Dana met on the set of the 2010 drama Frozen, where she was an assistant director. They got engaged in October 2011.
“I just got down on my knee on the couch in our living room and just proposed and she was shocked and she obviously said yes and it was amazing,” Ashmore said at the time.
