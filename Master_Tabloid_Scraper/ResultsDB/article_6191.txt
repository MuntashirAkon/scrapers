Adopt Me! 3-Year-Old Oliver Still Plays Like a Puppy
/n
Home: Some pets never have one to call their own. We’d like to help change that by introducing you to an adoptable pet every week. Today, meet Oliver, a 3-year-old boxer mix available at the Providence Animal Rescue League in Rhode Island.
Oliver arrived at the shelter very skinny but as he now gains weight on a regular diet, people are seeing a significant change in him.
“He’s a goofy guy, and the healthier he gets the more we’re seeing his personality get playful,” said Jillian Ganley, a PARL adoption specialist.
This boy — who now weighs 40 lbs. — is playful with cats and enjoys going on long walks with other dogs. The perfect family for Oliver would have another canine for him to form a bond with.
“Oliver still plays like a puppy, so he’ll need a family who can brush up his manners,” says a bio. “He warms up to new people and loses his nervousness quickly. He really is a very appealing young fella!”
