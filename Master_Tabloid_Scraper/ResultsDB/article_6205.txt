As Friends' Phoebe Buffay would say, "She's your lobster!"Drew Barrymore shared what is probably one of the cutest photos ever of herself and baby daughter Olive, who was dressed in her lobster Halloween costume, during the star's interview with Oprah Winfrey for last Sunday's episode of Oprah's Next Chapter."It's the best picture ever!" she said to Winfrey while pulling up the snapshot on her iPhone. 

A precious Olive was a vision in red when she showed off her crustacean wardrobe (watch out, Sebastian!), while mommy Barrymore bit down on her baby girl's claw."It's like having the worst crush of your life!" Barrymore continued to tell O. "I drive home with heart palpitations, like, I can't wait to get to her. I think, You know, is she gonna call? Will she ask me to spend the night?"Well, with an adorable face like that, how can you blame the new mom?
