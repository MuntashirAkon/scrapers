Oscar De La Hoya Extends Olive Branch In War With Dana White/nMake no mistake about it, Oscar De La Hoya is still pissed Dana White scheduled his superfight 3 weeks before Canelo vs. GGG ... but he's just taken the first step in repairing their friendship. Long story short ... De La Hoya says White broke a very serious unwritten rule between fight promoters -- a rule everyone from Don King to Bob Arum hold sacred.  But despite their feud over the McGregor vs. Mayweather fight -- De La Hoya tells TMZ Sports he still  "loves " Dana and even made a pretty solid peace offering.  No word if Dana will accept ... he's still pretty pissed too. /n
