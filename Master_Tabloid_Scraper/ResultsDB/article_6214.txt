Cat Deeley's Restaurant Server Admits Mistakes But Slams Her for Acting Like Trump/nThe guy who waited on Cat Deeley at Tom George Restaurant on Sunday thinks she totally overreacted by publicly bashing the L.A. eatery ... and leaving him a $0 tip. Joseph Vasko-Bezenek admits the restaurant flubbed the  "So You Think You Can Dance " host's order, but claims he provided great service and the manager went above and beyond to comp her. He particularly takes issue with Cat angrily ranting on Twitter afterward to ruin the restaurant's reputation -- to him ... that's Trump-like. What's worse -- as any server knows -- Joseph got a big fat zero for a tip ... so he didn't want to let Cat get off scot-free for that. On the bright side ... he also told us he'd welcome the chance to serve her again. Olive branch?/n
