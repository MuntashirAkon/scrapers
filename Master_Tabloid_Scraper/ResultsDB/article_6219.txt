Caitlyn Jenner -- Near Miss, Bad Timing (VIDEO)/nCaitlyn Jenner narrowly avoided disaster Thursday night ... a disaster with possible legal consequences. Caitlyn was leaving Fig & Olive restaurant in West Hollywood with new best friend Candis Cayne, when she jumped in her car -- engulfed by paparazzi -- and she threw it in gear, briefly losing control as the SUV lurched forward. She regained control and no one was hurt.   The D.A. is currently reviewing the fatal PCH crash for possible criminal prosecution and the last thing Caitlyn needs is another accident.  /n
