T.I. -- I Settled the Snoop/Iggy Beef ... FREE OF CHARGE!/nT.I. helped squash the Snoop Dogg /Iggy AzaleaÂ beef out of the kindness of his heart ... telling TMZ he received nothing for his Kissinger-esque work.As TMZ previously reported, Snoop posted a video on Instagram apologizing to Iggy for the whole thing ... and it was a call from T.I. that led to Snoop extending the olive branch. When our photog spotted T.I. in NYC on Monday night, he told us the convo with Snoop was short and sweet.We also asked about his recent trip to Tanzania and Ebola fears./n
