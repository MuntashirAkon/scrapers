Chris Brown & Meek Mill -- It's All Good Again ... After STRIP CLUB Peace Summit/nChris Brown and Meek Mill are officially cool with each other again -- after facing off in that massive brawl between Drake and CB's entourages -- because they smoked the metaphorical peace pipe in Charlotte over the weekend.The pics were snapped Friday night at Cameo Nightclub -- the same spot where Drake dropped $50,000 on strippers on Saturday.It's the first time CB and Meek Mill have been seen out together since the melee at W.i.P. nightclub in NYC last June. You'll recall, witnesses at the club said Meek was one of the main instigators behind the bottle-hurling brawl ... with CB's crew on the receiving end ... but Meek denied getting involved.We're told CB and Meek shook hands at Cameo and put the beef to rest once and for all. Still no olive branch from Drake though./n
