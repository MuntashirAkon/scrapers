Kanye West: Wiz and Amber Deserve Each Other /nKanye West was anything but sincere when he tweeted about turning exes into best friends ... we're told he was dripping with sarcasm, and that was the point.  After the back-and-forth, finger-or-no-finger-in-the-butt war between Kanye and Amber Rose, he tweeted,  "Me and my wife got the kind of love that can turn exes into best friends. " Lots of people jumped on this, thinking somehow Kanye and Amber have rekindled their friendship, or at least he was extending an olive branch. Not so ... our sources say Kanye was squarely mocking Wiz Khalifa and Amber -- former enemies who are now bonded by their dislike for him. So Kanye now says he not only owns Wiz and Amber's son, he owns them too.      / //n
