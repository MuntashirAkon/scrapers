Lauren Hutton Gets Shady with Oprah/nJurassic supermodel Lauren Hutton's makeup line comes in four shades: pink, yellow, olive and  "Oprah dark "!  While hawking her jank cosmetics at some South Carolina makeup event this weekend, the 64-year-old black-eyed beauty made a Don Imusian slip and corrected a woman who had picked up the wrong shade of her foundation by saying, "This is Oprah dark. You are not Oprah dark. " Paging Herm√®s! For the record, Hutton's makeup comes in brown -- not  "Oprah dark. "Don't expect to see Lauren's face paint on Oprah's  "Favorite Things " episode anytime soon!  See Also  Oprah Buys Gayle a Maxi Pad?/n
