Lawyer to Eva Longoria -- Let's Make a Deal/nEva Longoria got one helluva an offer from the attorney who filed suit against her for a car accident -- and believe it or not he's willing to make the whole thing go away.Â  As we first reported, Roman Gasparyan is suing Eva over their October 20 smashup -- claiming the wreck was her fault. Eva completely denies that.So, now Roman's attorney is extending an olive branch -- with a huge catch, of course. Watch the video and you'll see why we're pretty sure Eva's gonna tell this guy to go kick rocks./n
