Heavy Thoughts: Sam Smith Wanted To Kill Himself Over His Weight/n
Since recording international hits like Stay With Me and Latch, Sam Smith has built a life that most people can only dream of, but the soulful singer reveals that he has suffered from suicidal thoughts over his weight, the Daily Star reports.
“I saw a picture of me on New Year’s Eve topless on a beach in Sydney and it made me want to kill myself,” he admitted. “I just thought I was huge. I’ve had issues with my weight since I was a kid… My dad became a fitness trainer when I was 12 and he tried to help me, but I’ve always had issues.”

After the New Year’s Eve photo circulated, he found a renewed determination to slim down.
“I was put in contact with Amelia Freer, the dietician who got Boy George to lose all his weight,” he said. Since changing his eating habits, Smith has lost 73 pounds, telling GQ magazine, “The reality is I can do it now because I have a little bit more money, and that’s the sad thing… It’s impossible to eat healthily if you don’t have any money.” /n
