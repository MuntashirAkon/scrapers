Jamie Dornan Has Reportedly Backed Out Of Fifty Shades Of Grey Sequel/n
It looks like Jamie Dornan is hanging up his whip and blindfold after just one installment of S&M trilogy Fifty Shades Of Grey. The Northern Irish heartthrob has allegedly said he is bowing out of the second movie because his wife doesnâ€™t want him to do it. His actress other half, Amelia Warner, who he has a 15-month-old daughter with, is said to be unhappy with him acting out the explicit sex scenes in the controversial film. Having seen his steamy romps with Dakota Johnson we can kinda see why.
