Craziest Housewife Ever? Lisa Rinna Claims She Has A Ghost In Her House/n
Lisa Rinna says her house is haunted — in a good way.
Referencing a discussion she had about “ghostly nosies” she heard in her Southern California home, the pouty-lipped wife of L.A. Law hunk Harry Hamlin wrote in her latest Bravo blog that she believes her home is inhabited by a friendly spirit who passed away there more than 30 years ago.
“Fact is, I can’t prove it, but I believe there is indeed a female ghost named ‘Karen’ … [who] died in the house back in 1980 … that lives with us,” the former Melrose Place star wrote.

Thankfully for Rinna, she considers the ghost in her home is more like Casper and less like Poltergeist, as she said Karen “absolutely loves” her teen daughters Delilah and Amelia, and “and loves to be around them.”
The newest addition to the Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills provided a sad backstory filling the details of why she feels the supernatural presence.
“Karen had a 3-year-old daughter when she passed away, so I feel like she really presented herself to us when the girls were just babies,” Rinna wrote. “She’s a good ghost. A protective spirit that I’m grateful to share my home and family with.”

Rinna, admitting her intuition “sounds crazy,” said “it’s just a feeling” she has.
Elsewhere in the blog, Rinna says that she’s “loving [her] new role as a Housewife,” two weeks into the program’s new broadcasts.
“I have to admit, I am completely humbled and so incredibly grateful for all of the support and all-around amazingness you’ve shown me on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and everywhere else,” she wrote. “I love reading everything you send my way and just know that I love each and every one of you right back!”
