I’ll lose weight 4 ya!
Boy George showed off his jaw-dropping weight loss Sunday night at an awards show in London, and RadarOnline.com has the amazing photos!
The I’ll Tumble 4 Ya singer, 51, known for wearing makeup and his often outlandish head gear, was barely recognizable as he walked the red carpet in style at the WhatsOnStage.com Awards, sporting a slim, chiseled face and a lean body to match.

Only four years ago — in 2009 — the outlandish singer, whose real name is George Dowd, was photographed looking disheveled with a puffy face and obese body as he arrived to court on assault charges.
At that time, he was sentenced to 15 months in jail for the assault and false imprisonment of Audun Carlsen, a 29-year-old man who Dowd shackled to a wall in the star’s Shoreditch flat in April 2007 and thrashed with a chain.

He received credit for good behavior and served only four months behind bars.
In wake of his stunning red carpet appearance, George took to Twitter Monday to credit nutritional therapist Amelia Freer with his weight loss, writing: “My secret!” and posting a link to her website.
