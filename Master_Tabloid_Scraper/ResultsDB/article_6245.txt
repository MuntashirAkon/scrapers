Notorious 82-Year-Old Burglar Arrested Again, Rap Sheet Goes Back 57 Years/n
By Radar Staff
While other women her age are enjoying retirement and maybe spending their time knitting, 82-year-old Doris Thompson’s life-long career as a burglar shows no sign of abating.
Los Angeles County’s oldest burglar was detained at an El Segundo, California hotel Saturday, suspected of stealing from a doctor’s office. She’s being held on $80,000 bail.

Torrance Police Sgt. Robert Watt says Thompson, who has been known under at least 25 different names, has targeted medical facilities in the past.
Her M.O. would be to hide in the office until closing time and then hunt out the keys to the cash box.

“What she does is she goes in with her little burglar bag. She takes cash, stamps, whatever she can find,” L.A. County Deputy Dist. Atty. Paulette Paccione said.
Watt confirmed that officials are submitting evidence connected to eight recent burglaries to the D.A.’s office on Tuesday.

Thompson’s 20-page rap sheet dates back to 1955 and she’s been sent to jail nine times in the last 29 years, all for burglary.
The notorious gray-haired Thompson was caught by security camera two years ago busting open drawers with a screwdriver and a chisel at the Children’s Medical Group in Torrance, and stole $400 in cash and checks, $25 worth of stamps, a plastic urine container, and a device to test children’s hearing which was all worth around $1,400.
