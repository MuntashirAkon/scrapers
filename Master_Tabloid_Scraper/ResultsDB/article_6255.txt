Pining Over An Instagram-Worthy Mani For Festival Season?? Coachella Nail Inspo For The Glowing Desert Gal Lies Ahead!/n

Listen up, ladies!!
You've paid over $250 just to attend Coachella — so why venture into the desert with nasty paws?! You could meet your dream man — you know, the WOKE mother fucker who's telling off a white guy wearing a Native American headdress! SWOON.
There's really no excuse not to aim highest!

So head to your local nail salon with the festival-themed inspiration filed (below) and make it reaaal easy on the artist! OR do it at home!
Whatever you please because strong females do what they want and rock sweet ass nails with the confidence of a suffragette (who prob didn't have time to get their nails done, but it's cool because treating yourself is awesome and they'd support it)!
