In her final days, Florence Henderson got to spend some time doing something she loved. Three days before her untimely death on Thanksgiving, the 82-year-old late star showed up to the filming of the final competition day for Dancing With the Stars on Monday. The television icon sat in the audience as the final four couples performed their best moves—something she had done at the start of the season to cheer on co-star and television daughter Maureen McCormick, who was also a contestant during this season.  

Henderson, who was also a competitor on the show in 2010, was all smiles as she posed with friends for photographers during the show Monday night.Her happy demeanor showed no signs that, just a few days later, she would pass away from heart failure at a Los Angeles hospital surrounded by family and friends.  

Her manager, Kayla Pressman, told the Los Angeles Times that the actress had not been ill, so her death came as a surprise.According to Henderson's publicist, the actress's health had not been a cause for concern initially. "She was quite active until she started not feeling well several days ago," David Brokaw told the New York Times. "It was felt that she would just bounce back from it."McCormick responded to the sad news on Twitter, writing, "Florence Henderson was a dear friend for so very many years & in my <3 forever. Love & hugs to her family. I'll miss u dearly."

"You are in my heart forever Florence," she added with a photo of the two women together at a taping of none other than a filming of DWTS.
