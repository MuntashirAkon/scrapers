The Fifty Shades of Grey actor kept it casual at the premiere of his new film Anthropoid.

Jamie Dornan, perhaps the world’s most famous English actor at the moment, dropped by the red carpet of his new thriller in London looking completely unbothered in a white tee, grey jacket, grey chinos and Adidas tennis shoes.
And his lovely wife Amelia Warner tagged along in a long, colorful dress and platform sandals to support her leading man husband. This was the first time she’s joined him on the red carpet since the arrival of their second child roughly six months ago.
Also on hand was Dornan’s steely-eyed co-star Cillian Murphy who didn’t fuss over the event either, rocking a navy jacket over a white tee with black slacks.
Take a peek Dornan’s and the rest of the cast in the gallery above!
