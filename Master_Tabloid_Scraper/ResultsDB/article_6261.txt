The first fan fiction story was illustrated on the wall of a cave during the Stone Age when a caveman saw two dinosaurs walking together and thought, “Well, that could be nice.”

Okay, so maybe this is a lie, but fan fiction and farcical celebrity relationships were in existence long before the Internet became the infinite black hole of content that it is today. Now that we have the creative outlets of Twitter, Tumblr, Reddit, and more, fandoms stretch their imaginations to find new storylines in the relationships that Hollywood presents to us on screen.
In research tangentially related to our website, Matt Russoniello, Celebuzz’s Managing Editor, became aware of a thriving subdivision of the Fifty Shades of Grey fandom that ships Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan under the couple name “Damie.” Damie shippers believe that Johnson and Doran have an off-screen relationship that they keep out of the public eye and that the media has conspired to not report even though both Johnson and Dornan were in relationships—Dornan having been married to Amelia Warner since 2013—until June of this year when Johnson split from Matthew Hitt.
We encourage dedication to ships like Damie whether or not the relationship is true in real life because the fun in interacting with art and media keeping the fandom alive and thriving in a way that’s uniquely your own. Never stop giving us your all with the fan fiction.
