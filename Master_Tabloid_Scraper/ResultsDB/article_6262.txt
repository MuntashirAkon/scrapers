Yes, this is their job… 

On-screen love interests Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson took to the sea on a jet ski yesterday (July 12, 2016) for a scene in the Fifty Shades of Grey sequels currently in production.
The wave-riding scene is for Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele’s honeymoon in the third installment of E.L. James’ best-selling book trilogy.
Johnson wore a short white crocheted dress highlighting her shapely legs while Dornan went shirtless under his life jacket for the shoot. The attractive duo also rocked designer shades for their cruise around the Mediterranean just off the coast from Paloma Beach in Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat, France.
Take a peek at their joy ride in the gallery above!
