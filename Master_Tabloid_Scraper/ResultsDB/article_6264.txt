Things got emotional as the movie star and his family said their goodbyes.

After five months of filming, the cast and crew of the Fifty Shades of Grey sequels have finally wrapped filming in Vancouver, Canada and are now headed to France to start shooting.
Jamie Dornan and wife Amelia Warner got emotional when saying goodbye to their Canadian staff. Warner even shed a tear as they prepared to leave, which her husband brushed away.
Earlier this week, the trilogy’s writer E.L. James shared a photo of herself alongside director James Foley with the caption: “And that’s a wrap in Vancouver. Thank you to the most fantastic crew and production team. You are all amazing. And to this [email protected] Well done!”

Now, Dornan and the Fifty Shades team will reportedly be heading to Paris to film. Could they be shooting Christian and Ana’s honeymoon?!
