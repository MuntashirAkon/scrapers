Famed pilot Amelia Earhart will be quite the popular lady next year, when two movies featuring her likeness hit theaters—one being the biopic Amelia starring Hilary Swank, and the other the slightly less realistic Night at the Museum 2: Battle of the Smithsonian with Amy Adams.Who could blame either actress for wanting to play the daring pilot? With the riding gloves, leather jackets, cute 30s hair and that hat, it all looks pretty fun.So tell us, which Amelia are you digging? Also, how 'bout that fox around Hilary's neck?
