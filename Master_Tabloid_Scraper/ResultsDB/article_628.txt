Dancing with the Stars and Maureen McCormick Just Brought The Brady Bunch Back with Help from Florence Henderson/n
Here's the story of a lovely lady, and the throwback dance we've all been waiting for. After scores that put her at the back of the pack in the premiere, Maureen McCormick came back in week two of Dancing with the Stars with a vengeance. With help from her TV mom (and former DWTS contestant) Florence Henderson, McCormick stepped back into Marcia Brady's shoes for one heck of a performance to the Brady Bunch theme song. Henderson, who played matriarch Carol Brady on the classic 1970s sitcom, started the dance off with a "Marcia, Marcia, Marcia," and McCormick seemed like a natural as she and partner Artem Chigvintsev flew into a quickstep. 

Last week, their performance earned a 22 out of 40 and a lot of criticism from judges Carrie Ann Inaba, Len Goodman, Julianne Hough, and Bruno Tonioli, but this week there was definite improvement. "I didn't expect all this confidence," Inaba said. "There was a looseness to your spirit, but there was a tightness to your form that you didn't have last week. You looked like you had a great time." McCormick scored a 26 out of 40 for tonight's dance, and we'll have to see if she moved up on the leader board! If it helps, she's at the top of the leader board in our hearts. Dancing with the Stars airs Mondays and Tuesdays at 8 p.m. on ABC.
