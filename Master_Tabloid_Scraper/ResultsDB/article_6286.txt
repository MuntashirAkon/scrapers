Kim & Kanye: We Have A 1,000 Pairs of Shoes To Spare/nKim and Kanye's newborn, Saint West,﻿ is already living up to his name because days after his birth, his parents are donating 1,000 pairs of shoes to charity after hearing a young girl's plea for help. Kim was breastfeeding Saint when she says she saw a TV segment about a girl looking to repay Soles4Souls with 1,000 pairs of shoes after the charity helped her family following Hurricane Katrina.  Kim pointed out in a barrage of tweets that she could help ... since, ya know, she happens to be married to the Shoe of the Year Award winner.  Only problem ... she couldn't find the girl's name, but with a little research we've learned she's 17-year-old Amelia Flores, who's since relocated to Wichita, Kansas. We know what you're thinking ... 1,000 pairs of Yeezys!!! We followed up and sources say it'll mostly be Kardashian Kollection and Adidas kicks. /n
