38 Special Guitarist: It's Time to Get My Jag Off/nOne of 38 Special's guitarists, Jeff Carlisi﻿, has something more valuable than the first Fender guitar ever made ... a 1962 Jaguar, which can be yours for $280,000.  Jeff's dad imported the car from Spain back in '62 and it's been in the family since. The rock star decided to unload the Jag because he thinks the climate in his new home -- Florida -- will take its toll on the car. The multi-platinum guitarist's car will go on the Gooding & Company auction block, along with his guitar from the 1989 video  "Second Chance. " The items will go to the highest bidder March 11th at the Amelia Island Auction in Florida. /n
