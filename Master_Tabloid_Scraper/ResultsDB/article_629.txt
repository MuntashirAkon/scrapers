Sing it, Florence Welch!During a stop on BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge, Florence and the Machine decided to take a break from performing several hit tracks off of their latest album, How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful, to cover one of most popular songs of the summer: Skrillex and Diplo's single "Where Are Ü Now," featuring Justin Bieber.But Florence's version is far more than just your everyday run-of-the-mill cover, it sounds like an entirely different song complete with some of the best live vocals we've heard from her in a while.And sure, the Biebs' song was somber (save for the upbeat dance breaks), but Florence and the Machine's melancholy rendition is a far darker, moodier "Where Are Ü Now" than we're used to hearing.

Enough from us, though! Check out the Brit band's entire visit to the lounge below and feel free to skip right to 23:20 to get the cover.Florence is no stranger to some of the world's most famous pop stars, either; in fact she recently opened up to Billboard about her friendship with Taylor Swift ."Taylor said that you must sing about what's happening in your life," Welch explained, adding that her album was "not about trying to be vindictive."Meanwhile, T.Swift gushed about the singer, saying, "She's the most fun person to dance with at a party, but then five minutes later you find yourself sitting on the stairs with her having an in-depth conversation about love and heartbreak."
