Jerry Seinfeld: I'd Like to Sell You Some Used Cars ... For $28M (PHOTOS)/nJerry Seinfeld's car collection is about to turn into big, big money for the comedian ... he plans to unload 18 of them for more than $28 million! We're told Jerry doesn't have the time to drive all of his cars -- his Porsche collection alone is 47 strong -- so he's using the services of Gooding & Company Auction to streamline his fleet.  Jerry's 1973 Porsche 917 /30 CanAm Spyder is expected to fetch $7 million. The 1955 550 Spyder should go for around $6 mil.  The cars hit the auction block March 11 at the Amelia Island auction in Florida./n
