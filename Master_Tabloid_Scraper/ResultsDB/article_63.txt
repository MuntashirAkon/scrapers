T.I. -- There's No Way I'm Voting for Hillary Clinton ... Chicks Are Too Emotional (VIDEO)/n9:40 AM PT -- T.I. is already issuing a mea culpa. He says,  "My comments about women running for president were unequivocally insensitive and wrong.  I sincerely apologize to everyone I offended. " Hillary Clinton can't be leader of the free world because she's just too female ... this according to T.I., anyway. T.I. told DJ Whoo Kid there's no way he'd be casting a ballot for Hillary or any woman. His rationale ...  "I just know that women make rash decisions, emotionally ... they make very permanent, cemented decisions. " T.I. claimed he wasn't trying to be sexist, and added he thinks women can handle every OTHER political office, but president is too much (It starts around 13:25 in the clip). The rapper -- who can't vote because he's got a felony on his record -- said the world just isn't ready to have a woman with her finger on the nukes. Apparently T.I. hasn't heard of Angela Merkel, Margaret Thatcher, Indira Gandhi, or Golda Meir./n
