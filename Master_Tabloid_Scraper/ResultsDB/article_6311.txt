Netflix Unveils Trailer For New JonBenet Ramsey Murder Special/n
Netflix has unveiled the first trailer for their upcoming special, Casting Jon Benet, which is described as a “documentary hybrid” film about the late little beauty queen JonBenet Ramsey‘s still-mysterious murder.
The film shows real actors auditioning for roles in the reenactment of the still-unsolved 1996 murder—and also talking about how the case emotionally affected them.
In a bizarre moment in the trailer, a little girl says, “My name’s Hannah and I’m auditioning for JonBenet Ramsey.” Looking directly at the camera, she says, “Do you know who killed JonBenet Ramsey?”
Unfortunately, nobody does.

As Radar has previously reported, the mysterious death of six-year-old JonBenet Ramsey in her Boulder, Colorado home on Dec. 26, 1996 has never been solved.
Her mother Patsy made a 911 call to report her daughter kidnapped. After police arrived, Patsy and her wealthy husband John showed them a ransom note they said had been left on their stairs of their home. Later, John discovered their daughter’s body in the wine cellar. Investigators determined JonBenet had suffered a blow to the head and had also been strangled with a garrote.
Quickly, the Ramseys came under the scrutiny of the Boulder police department but they both vehemently denied having anything to do with their daughter’s death. Patsy died in 2006 at age 49 from ovarian cancer. And JonBenet’s brother Burke Ramsey filed a $750 million defamation lawsuit against CBS for The Case of: JonBenét Ramsey, which speculated that Burke may have killed the girl.

During the case’s 20-year anniversary last winter, numerous other TV specials went over facts and theories. And as Radar has reported, there was hope crime scene video could provide police with new clues.
But still, the case looks unsolvable, making it ripe for constant debate.
In the new Netflix film, actors audition for the roles of JonBenét, dad John, mom Patsy Ramsey and brother Burke. Then they share their memories of the much-publicized tragedy. The actors vamp on who they suspect committed the crime.
Casting JonBenet premieres on Netflix on April 28. Watch the trailer!
