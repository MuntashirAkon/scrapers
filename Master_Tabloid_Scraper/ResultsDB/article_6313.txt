He drew a standing ovation at the Venice Film Festival and a source close to the actor told Radar that Ross is the force behind his drastic turn-around.
“He’s in a much better place because of her,” said the insider.
Last month, the Braveheart star bragged toiabout having more children than fellow actor Clint Eastwood.
“I was talking to Clint the other day. I said, ‘How many kids you got?'” he joked. “He said, ‘Eight.’ So I’m beating him.”
