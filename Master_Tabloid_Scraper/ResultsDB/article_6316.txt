 Kate Gosselin 'Feared' For Life In 'Hostile' Dispute With Jon, Told Police He Had A Gun!.../n
Kate Gosselin not only despises her ex Jon after their nasty divorce, she’s scared of him.
When the Kate Plus 8 star, 41, called police with accusations that her former husband, 39, had been showing signs of “suspicious behavior” around their young daughter, she also claimed he was armed and dangerous, RadarOnline.com can exclusively reveal.
In a Pennsylvania police report obtained by Radar, the 41-year-old mother of eight said “Jonathan does have a firearm.”

Kate called the cops on her way to her kids’ school, where she planned to pick up her daughter — first identified as Hannah, now 12, by In Touch — and bring her directly to a therapist for a counseling session.
Due to Jon’s possession of a gun, “she feared that there would be a hostile dispute if she arrived at the school while he was there,” the responding officer wrote in the Manheim Township Police Department report, filed on April 27, 2015.
THE PROOF! READ THE SHOCKING POLICE REPORT
Police arrived to the school first, and discovered Jon was not on the premises, the report indicated.
As Radar previously reported, Kate also admitted to hiring a private investigator to trail her ex during the incident.
In Touch was first to report Kate’s shocking accusations of Jon’s kidnapping and drug dealing during the April 2015 talks with authorities.
