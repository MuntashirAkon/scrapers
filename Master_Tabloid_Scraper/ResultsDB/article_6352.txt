A woman is suing Usher for $10 million dollars in a ‘unprotected sex’ suit, RadarOnline.com has learned.

According to Tmz the ‘Jane Doe’ claims the couple hooked-up at her home on April 16 where after some heavy petting she performed oral sex on him.

This reportedly led to full intercourse where Usher wore a condom.
However, she then alleges that they had sex again 12 days later at a New Orleans hotel room, this time without any protection.
The woman filed her complaint after learning via news reports that Usher, 38, had admitted in an earlier case that he has Herpes Simplex 2.

In her new suit the woman does not say she’s infected – but she claims that she is ‘concerned’ because she was exposed to the virus and claims she would not have had sex with him if she had known about it.
As a result she is suing Usher Raymond IV for negligence, battery, and emotional distress while seeking $10 million in damages.
RadarOnline.com previously revealed in a world exclusive that the star had paid $1.1 million to another woman that he infected with herpes.
This led his former wife Tameka Harris to reveal that she does NOT have the incurable disease.
