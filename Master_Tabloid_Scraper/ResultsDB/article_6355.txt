 Another ‘Vanderpump' Split? Jax & Brittany’s Relationship Explodes On Spinoff.../n

Jax Taylor and Brittany Cartwright have been in “rocky territory” since they filmed their spin-off, and now their dirty laundry is about to air!
The couple filmed Vanderpump Rules: Jax and Brittany Take Kentucky last fall, and the show is set to air this summer while they film for Vanderpump Rules. As Radar previously reported, their spinoff centers on 27-year-old Cartwright’s Kentucky roots and her parents’ desire for her to marry bad boy Taylor, 37.
But, Cartwright’s dad isn’t sure Taylor is the man for her in a new clip!
“To me, Jax is the L.A. guy that looks like Tarzan and plays like Jane,” her dad laughed in the video while Taylor tried to chop down a tree. “It’s becoming one of my favorite things to see his manly toughness be challenged.”
Taylor’s relationship isn’t the only one in jeopardy!
He previously hinted that Katie Maloney and Tom Schwartz are headed towards divorce in a bombshell tweet. But, Maloney’s mom Teri assured Radar exclusively that the couple was “wonderful.”
