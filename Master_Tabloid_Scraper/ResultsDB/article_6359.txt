FBI Probing Bernie's Wife/n
U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders‘ wife, Jane, is in hot legal water — she’s being investigated for bank fraud by the FBI.
As the president of Vermont’s Burlington College, Jane allegedly lied on bank loan applications in 2010, which stated the college would get $2.6 million in donations to pay for land to expand the campus.
In fact, the school only raised $676,000.
The wife of the Democratic presidential candidate later resigned from her post in 2011 — and the college went bankrupt and shut down a year ago.
