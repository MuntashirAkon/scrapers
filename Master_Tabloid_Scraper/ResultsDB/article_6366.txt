Fifth Harmony Flaunts Individual Styles On The MTV VMAs Red Carpet!/n

We feel so conflicted.
On Sunday, Fifth Harmony stopped by the MTV VMAs red carpet, where they certainly made a splash. While Ally Brooke, Normani Kordei, Dinah Jane, and Lauren Jauregui all looked incredible in their respective red carpet looks, it seems as though they forgot that they're in a girl group because none of their outfits were coordinated.
Now, this isn't necessarily a bad thing, but we would've liked to see them in ensembles that tied together. We can't be the only ones who think this, right??
Nonetheless, the ladies of 5H looked like total A-listers at the Hollywood event. We mean, Dinah flaunted her curves in a white Roberto Cavalli gown, Ally was playful AF in her Reem Acra mini dress/capri look, Normani was curvalicious in a black La Bourjoisie dress, and Lauren dressed to impress in a form-fitting red Cushnie et Ochs number.
At the end of the day, we're Down for their decisions.
