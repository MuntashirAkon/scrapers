Jane Fonda is changing up her look for a new role.
The 79-year-old actress shared a group photo of herself with costars Diane Keaton, Candice Bergen and Mary Steenburgen from the set of their upcoming movie, Book Club, on Monday. While the ladies were busy looking at the solar eclipse for their candid moment, all eyes were on Fonda’s hair color.

 It’s no secret the star has long been a bit of a fashion plate. The icon is a testament to the fact that being 79 is truly just a number and “dressing your age” shouldn’t mean missing out on fun, new trends just because you think they’re intended for girls 60 years your junior.
In fact, Fonda has made a habit out of regularly showing up on red carpets and events wearing all of the latest in must-have designer wares and even her accessory game is perfectly on point.
