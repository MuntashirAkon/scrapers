Jane the Virgin’s Justin Baldoni Gushes Over Wife and Fatherhood—and We’re Swooning!
/n
As if we needed any more proof that Justin Baldoni is the happiest dad and husband ever on Instagram, the Jane the Virgin star is at it again with multiple posts dedicated to his growing family.
On July 27, the actor gushed about being a father to 2-year-old Maiya and followed up with a loving tribute to his wife Emily Baldoni on their 4-year anniversary a day later. He captioned an adorable photo of his beautiful spouse and child a day later: “I never knew the human heart was capable of holding this much love.”





 I never knew the human heart was capable of holding this much love. Ok – now that I have asked my wife and daughter to stop so I could take a photo – and then written an inspirational quote to go along with it. It's now time to put this phone away and be present for my family. May we all strive be present today and see life through our eyes and not through the screens of our phones. #workinprogress #bepresent

“Marriage isn’t always a super fun party,” he wrote on his anniversary, “Just like anything meaningful in life I think it requires planning, preparation, hard work, and communication. One of the most beautiful things I’ve ever experienced is the growth that comes out of what most people in our culture would probably consider the “crappy” parts of marriage. The miscommunication, the struggles, the insecurities, the arguments and, at times, even the doubt. The last four years have been the most amazing, challenging and beautiful years of my entire life and it’s all thanks to this amazing woman right here.”





 Marriage isn't always a super fun party.  Just like anything meaningful in life, I think it requires planning, preparation, hard work, and communication. One of the most beautiful things I've ever experienced is the growth that comes out of what most people in our culture would probably consider  the "crappy" parts of marriage. The miscommunication, the struggles, the insecurities, the arguments and, at times, even the doubt. The last four years have been the most amazing, challenging and beautiful years of my entire life and it's all thanks to this amazing woman right here. @emilybaldoni -Thank you for loving me unconditionally, sweetheart. You are the most genuine, kind, and patient human I have ever known. Thank you for your relentless search for truth, and for always being so willing to grow and take me with you. I still don't feel like I deserve you, but since you chose me for some reason…I'm just going to keep going along with it and hope you don't figure it out 😜 Happy FOUR years my love. #marriage

And just when you thought it couldn’t get any cuter, Baldoni shared an adorable photo with his daughter in Target accompanied with these heartwarming words:“It’s so crazy to see my little girl start to grow up and interact with people and the world around her. It’s all happening so fast!” he wrote. “As I see new parts of Maiya unfold I try to remember that fatherhood is about me becoming the kind of man I am meant to be, not about turning my children into the kind of people I want them to be. Maiya is crazy smart, independent, kind, strong willed, and nurturing (Just like her mom).”

 #ad One of the craziest parts of parenting is watching your child grow up and develop a personality of their own. It's so crazy to see my little girl start to grow up and interact with people and the world around her. It's all happening so fast! As I see new parts of Maiya unfold I try to remember that fatherhood is about me becoming the kind of man I am meant to be, not about turning my children into the kind of people I want them to be. Maiya is crazy smart, independent, kind, strong willed, and nurturing (Just like her mom) And Emily and I cannot wait to see her take on the 1st big role of her life… becoming a big sister! But I also need to remember to not get ahead of myself… because being a dad is also about staying in the present. So for now, I’m just gonna enjoy silly moments like this as she helps me pick out all this Cloud Island gear @Target for her little brother’s room. #dearmaiya #bepresent Find Cloud Island items at the link in my bio. #HelloMama

After snapping and posting a cute pic of his wife and daughter preparing for a stroll, the actor promised he’d put his phone away “be present for [his] family.” He also advised that everyone not see life “through the screens of [their] phones.”
In May, Baldoni announced that he and his wife were expecting their second child with videos posted on Instagram and YouTube. In the shared clips, the couple breaks the news of their pregnancy to their loved ones, including Jane the Virgin costars Gina Rodriguez and Yael Grobglas.
Dad of the year.
