'Stay With Me' Lawsuit -- Random Guy Wants Money and a Grammy!/nA random guy claims Sam Smith stole his hit song  "Stay with Me " right out from under him, but using the guy's logic, he ripped off The Supremes. Mark Halper claims in a new lawsuit ... he cut a demo in 1986 of a song called  "Don't Throw Our Love Away. " He says it begins with the  "phraseology and significant phrase, 'stay with me.' " Ergo ... Halper believes Sam Smith -- who uses the phrase  "stay with me " 8 times in his hit -- has ripped him off. So how's this for a little music history. In 1964, The Supremes recorded their massive hit,  "Baby Love. " In the song, Diana Ross, Mary Wilson and Florence Ballard repeatedly sing,  "don't throw our love away. " Therefore, The Supremes own Mark Halper. As for Halper's lawsuit, he's not going after Smith. He's suing several record labels. Among the things he wants ... a recommendation to the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences to acknowledge him with a Grammy./n
