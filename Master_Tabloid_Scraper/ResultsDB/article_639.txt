Tyler Posey -- I'm Becoming A Bada** Boxer/nTyler Posey plays a wolf, but in real life he's becoming an even fiercer animal. We got hold of this video, showing Tyler training for a boxing match which he is taking VERY seriously. The Teen Wolf star will be going toe-to-toe with radio host Michael Tully at The Hard Rock Hotel in Vegas. The fight is 3 months away but Posey is already deep into training.  It's all for charity, but there's no law that says he has to be all Florence Nightingale about it. /n
