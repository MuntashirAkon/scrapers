"Never have I ever joined the mile high club," DeGeneres read.This time, Fonda was proud to tell the world that she had indeed done the deed. "I was 50 years old. It was my fourth date with Ted Turner. He has his own plane, and we get on the plane, and he said, 'Are you a member of the mile high club?' I didn't know what he was talking about," she said. "And I joined!""Suddenly the seats became a bed," Fonda recalled.DeGeneres joked, "Most people are in an economy bathroom!" To find out if Fonda has ever "been drunk before noon" or "stolen something," watch the video above!During Thursday's appearance, Fonda also explained what drew her to Grace and Frankie. "I wanted to do a television series. I wanted to give a cultural face to older women because we're left out," she told the host. "The mass media doesn't really deal with you after a certain age, and I wanted to change that."
