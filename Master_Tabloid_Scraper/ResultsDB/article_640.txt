Kris Jenner -- Hammered for NOT Using N-Word/nKris Jenner is actually being criticized for NOT using the n-word. Kris congratulated Kim and Kanye on their 1-year anniversary Saturday, reminiscing about the uber-fancy wedding in Florence following a blow-out party in Versailles.  Kris posted,  "Kanye treated us to fireworks ... And if you listen closely ... his huge hit song  "Great People in Paris ... "  She didn't want to use the real title,  "(N-word) in Paris. " Some people are railing on Kris, grousing,  "Things white people say, " and others calling her  "ignorant. "  You can't win for losing./n
