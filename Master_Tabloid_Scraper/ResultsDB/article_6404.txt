Dancing Gorilla Is a Maniac, Maniac at Your Door! /nNOBODY PUTS GORILLA IN THE CORNER!! Here's 14-year-old up-and-coming dancer Zola showing off his moves in a kiddie pool at the Dallas Zoo ... which begs the question -- WHY ISN'T HE A JABBAWOCKY YET?!  The video has gone gorilla viral -- and already got the  "Flashdance " treatment ... and it's the best thing you're gonna see all day.  So, sit back, peel a banana, groom your friend's back, beat your chest, cut up a Jane Goodall documentary, scale the Empire State building and enjoy. RIP Harambe.   I added some music to this. pic.twitter.com /UwjhTKpaeu — Bob Hagh (@BobHagh) June 22, 2017/n
