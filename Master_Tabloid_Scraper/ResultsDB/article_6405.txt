'Entourage' Star Kevin Dillon Settles Divorce After Nasty Battle /nKevin Dillon has settled his divorce case, and no one even knew he was getting divorced. Jane Stuart filed a divorce petition last July ... asking a judge to end her 10-year marriage to Kevin, but the docs got buried in the system. Turns out they had a big issue ... she claimed they separated May 29, 2016, but the  "Entourage " star fired back the date of separation was October 2008. It's hugely significant, because once they separated all future  "Entourage " money was his, and his alone. She also said Kevin kept her in the dark on finances from day 1 of the marriage, and she also claimed he under-reported his earnings to the court to keep his support payments low. She believed he made more than $16 million for  "Entourage. " As with most of these cases ... it settled before going to trial. Last month Kevin agreed to pay Jane $3,174 a month in child support for their 11-year-old daughter, and she gets $7,214 in monthly spousal support./n
