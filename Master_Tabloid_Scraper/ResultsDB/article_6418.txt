Miley Cyrus -- Have My Joint! Forget I Hosted VMAs (VIDEO)/nMiley Cyrus shared her DNA with photographers backstage at the VMAs -- via the joint she passed around the room. 'Mary Jane' Cyrus kicked off her post-VMA meeting with the media by lighting up and passing it to reporters and photogs -- several of whom gladly indulged. No doubt, the ganja gift was a great way to soften them up BEFORE they fired off questions about her hosting performance -- or Nicki Minaj. Of course, that gift came doused in her saliva ... if you're into that./n
