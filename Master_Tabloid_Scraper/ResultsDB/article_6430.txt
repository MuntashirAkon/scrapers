“[Scalise] was dragging his body away from second base to get away from the shooter,” Brooks said of the moments following the attack, which he witnessed from a nearby deck. “He was shot in the hip. I think it was not a life-threatening wound. . .There was no exit wound I could see.”
“There was a blood trail about 10 to 15 yards long from where he was shot to wear he crawled to right field,” he continued.
As for the shooter, Brooks said he appeared to be a white male, adding that “I saw him for a second or two.”

The gunman emerged from behind the third base dugout around 6:30 a.m. He didn’t say anything during the attack, Brooks said: “The gun was a semiautomatic. . .It continued to fire at different people. You can imagine, all the people on the field scatter.”
The Alabama Republican added that he used his belt as a tourniquet to help one of the victims, CNN reports.
Meanwhile, the White House addressed the shooting in an official statement from President Donald Trump.
“The Vice President and I are aware of the shooting incident in Virginia and are monitoring developments closely,” Trump said in a statement soon after the attack. “We are deeply saddened by this tragedy. Our thoughts and prayers are with the members of Congress, their staffs, Capitol Police, first responders, and all others affected.”
