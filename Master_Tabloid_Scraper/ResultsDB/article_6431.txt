Insecure Ben Stiller’s Extreme Paranoia Leads To Divorce/n
Insecure comedian-actor Ben Stiller is getting divorced from his longtime wife, Christine Taylor — and RadarOnline.com has learned it was his extreme paranoia that drove her to throw in the towel on their marriage!
“Ben was extremely paranoid, and often told friends he felt like he was out of his league with Christine,” dished a pal close to the 51-year-old Zoolander star after the May 26 announcement.
“His worst nightmare was that she’d leave him one day for a taller, hotter man.”
After 17 years of marriage and two kids – Ella, 15, and son Quinlin, 12 – Stiller and Taylor finally called it quits.

The couple, who starred in multiple films together, including Zoolander, was known for their tumultuous relationship.
As Radar reported, the pair looked extremely unhappy months before their marriage finally ended.
“Whenever Christine was out of town on a job, which wasn’t very often, Ben would inevitably recruit someone on set to spy on her!” said a source close to the actors.
Taylor, 45, “grew tired of Ben’s drama and accusations, especially when he’d have two stunning blond ‘chefs’ on his own movie sets,” claimed a source.
