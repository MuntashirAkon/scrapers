 ‘Texas Flip & Move’ Divorce War: Donna Snow Landers’ Husband Demands, Pay Up!.../n
Texas Flip and Move star Donna Snow Landers’ estranged husband isn’t leaving their marriage without a fight!
Donna filed for divorce on March 17, 2017, after 24 years of marriage, and now Marshall Landers is firing at the rising HGTV star in an explosive counter petition.
RadarOnline.com exclusively obtained his demands, which include requests for Donna to pay his attorney’s fees and to reimburse him for the costs of her separate property.
Marshall “is not in control of sufficient community assets to pay attorney’s fees and anticipated expenses,” the court documents claimed.

He listed his white Ford F-250 as the only property he wanted protected, as a source close to Marshall revealed that his other property is still in Donna’s name.
Finally, he asked for Donna “to provide a sworn inventory and appraisement of all the separate and community property owned or claimed by the parties and all debts and liabilities owed by the parties.”
An insider told Radar that Marshall, 66, appeared in court on March 31 to face off against his soon-to-be ex. But, the judge ultimately ruled in Donna’s favor and Marshall was given two days to remove his property from their residence.
