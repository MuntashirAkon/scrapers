Speaking at Fort Myer in Arlington, Virginia, the businessman said his original instinct was to pull out of the 16-year war, but after studying the Middle Eastern country and having meetings, he came to the conclusion that we cannot make a "hasty withdraw." 
He came to this decision based on three points: the immense security threats from Afghanistan and Pakistan, the "predictable and unacceptable" consequences of a rapid exit (which would create a "vacuum" that terrorists would fill), and the need to endure an outcome worthy of the sacrifices our country has made.
Additionally, the U.S. strategy will shift from one based on time to one based on conditions — where we will never announce our plans to attack. Trump will also integrate all instruments of American power (economic, diplomatic, etc.), change our approach when it comes to dealing with Pakistan (who he says are housing terrorists), team up with India for economic assistance and development, and expand authority and lift restrictions to our armed forces when it comes to targeting terrorists.
In his words:

"We will fight to win."
