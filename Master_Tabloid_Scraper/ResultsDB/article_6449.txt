Shavaughn McKenzie, the man convicted of trespassing at Kendall Jenner’s Hollywood Hills home, has been released.
On Thursday (Nov. 10, 2016), McKenzie appeared in court where he was sentenced to 178 days behind bars (the maximum penalty). However, because he’s been in jail since his arrest in August — and has been on his best behavior — he already served his time, allowing him to walk free.
Although the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star testified against him in court and got a restraining order, McKenzie still won’t be serving any jail time.

“I’ve never been so scared in my life,” Jenner, 21, said in court on Oct. 13, as she recalled being approached by her alleged stalker. “I was crying, I was screaming, I was freaking out. I didn’t know what his intentions were… I was frightened for sure.”
So what makes the courts think he won’t try this again? Well, his lawyer revealed McKenzie’s mother plans to take him home to Virginia where he will receive psychiatric treatment.
