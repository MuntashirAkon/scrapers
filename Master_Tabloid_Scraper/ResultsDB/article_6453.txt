A lot of things go into producing a Lady Gaga album. So when it came time to make her latest record, Joanne, the Mother Monster looked around her for inspiration — namely her family, friends, and, yes; even ex-boyfriends.

“My mother’s from West Virginia and I grew up listening to country music with her,” she told Michael Strahan on Good Morning America this Friday (Oct. 21, 2016). “I’ve dated my fair share of cowboys as well, so that had an influence.”
“Essentially, it’s a pop record. It’s just my brand of pop,” she said, explaining how she doesn’t want Joanne to be just known as her so-called country album. “I wanted to make a record about family and friendship and togetherness and learning from the past.”
Gaga, who’s slated to perform at the 2017 Super Bowl, also said she’s “elated” to perform some of her new songs at her headlining halftime show.





“I’m honored to be doing the halftime show,” she said. “We’ve already been planning it and thinking of all the different ways we can make this a special experience for the football fans. I was thinking yesterday about how wonderful it’s going to be also playing maybe a few new songs from the new record at the Super Bowl with my grandmother, who is Joanne’s mother.”
“She’s blind, but I think she’ll be able to hear from the stands,” she quipped. “I think it’ll be a proud moment for out family.”
Joanne, which is currently being sold on Amazon for only $3.99, was named after Gaga’s late aunt.
