Just in case the creative team behind American Horror Story hasn’t already found a way to haunt your dreams…now they’ve incorporated spiders.

Today (Sept. 7, 2016), the 25th promo for the upcoming season of AHS has released is sure to have you jumping out of your seat.
Like several of its predecessors, this new clip, featuring a gigantic creepy crawly, has a (toothy) surprise for its viewers.
The show’s creator Ryan Murphy and his crew have managed to keep the new season’s cast mostly under wraps, but we do know Lady Gaga, Kathy Bates, Angela Bassett, Evan Peters, Matt Bomer and Cuba Gooding Jr. will be making an appearance.
As for the setting, it’s still shrouded in mystery. However, TMZ acquired some images featuring what appears to be a rugged settlement and the word “croatoan” carved into a tree, seemingly recreating the colony of Roanoke, Virginia whose inhabitants disappeared  in 1590.
American Horror Story returns to FX on Sept. 14, 2016.
Check out the squirm-inducing teaser in the clip above!
