The latest promo for the upcoming Season 6 of American Horror Story should cause some lack of sleep.
Called “Baby Face,” the promo features ominous, tinkling piano music, a spooky vocal chorus — and one seriously creepy zombie-like doll, smacking its bloody chops. Watch above, if you dare.
Just as with the other promos, we’re still not sure if creepy doll has anything to do with what the new season will focus on. We’ve been told by the peeps upstairs that most of the promos are redirects, and only one that has aired so far has anything to do with the show.
Rumors are the series will be set in 16th century America and follow the infamous myth about the “Lost Colony” of Roanoke, Virginia, so this might not fit in because it has a more 1930s vibe.
We’ll see when American Horror Story premieres Wednesday, September 14 on FX.
