Lawless indeed.Steven Ray Tickle, one of the bootlegging stars of Discovery's hit series Moonshiners, has found himself in a bit of a pickle with authorities in Danville, Va., after being collared last Thursday for public intoxication.Per the Raleigh Telegram, the 35-year-old Tickle was allegedly drinking in a car in a parking lot at a gas station when an unidentified witness reported him to police."At approximately 2:41 p.m. last Thursday a citizen approached a Danville Police Officer and reported that a man was drinking in public while sitting in a convenience store parking lot," law enforcement told the paper.

When officers showed up at Charlie's Stop and Shop convenience store, police said they found the reality star drinking from an open container and detected a "strong odor" of alcohol and signs he was intoxicated (no word if he was drinking his own hooch).After Tickle was unable to locate someone to pick him up, he was taken into custody and charged with the misdemeanor. He was subsequently released a few hours later.A rep for Discovery was unavailable for comment.Moonshiners chronicles Tickle and his cohort Tim Smith in their adventures in running a purportedly unlawful distillery in the mountains of Appalachia.
