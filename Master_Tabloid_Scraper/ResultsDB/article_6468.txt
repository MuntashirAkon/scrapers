While on the set of her new music video for "Perfume" recently, Britney Spears had an unfortunate mishap involving a Virginia Tech college sweatshirt and a prop gun.During the filming of a scene in which the 31-year-old singer points a gun a man in a car, Spears kept warm in between takes by bundling up in a red and orange sweater from Virginia Tech, the school that was at the center of the 2007 campus shooting which resulted in the deaths of 33 people (including the gunman).

The sweatshirt presumably belongs to Brit's boyfriend David Lucado, who is a huge fan of Virginia Tech and wears lots of the college's clothing.Spears ditched the sweater while actually filming the gun scenes though, opting for heels, tight jeans, white shirt and leather jacket.This isn't the first time that the singer has caused some controversy with guns in her music videos.In 2011, London officials demanded that Spears apologize for wielding a fake firearm on the set of her video for "Criminal." Why? The shoot took place in the very neighborhood that was devastated by the London riots just a few months before.Spears' team responded to the "Criminal" controversy at the time, saying, "The video is a fantasy story featuring Britney's boyfriend, Jason Trawick, which literally plays out the lyrics of a song written three years before the riots ever happened."
