Angelina -- I Didn't Ban Anyone!/nIs today's game of  "He said, she said " -- Angelina Jolie vs. FOX News? Ms. Jolie was on  "The Daily Show with Jon Stewart " last night, where she was asked about the so-called  "ban " clamped on press at the premiere of  "A Mighty Heart " in NYC on Wednesday. While Jolie admits a memo was indeed drawn up that asked reporters to limit their questions to the film, she says nobody was forced to sign it. She added that her handlers wrote it, but she personally wouldn't have put it out there.  TMZ caught Angie on her way out of the taping and again outside Florence Gould Hall, where she was swarmed by fans, paps and autograph seekers -- again taking time to sign for the crowd./n
