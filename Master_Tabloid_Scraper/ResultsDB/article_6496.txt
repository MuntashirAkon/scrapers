Ben Affleck is giving his not-so-glamorous girlfriend Lindsay Shookus a makeover, RadarOnline.com has learned exclusively.
A source said the actor is showing his insensitive and shallow side once again, by ordering his new often-frumpy flame to glam herself up! “Ben takes his image incredibly seriously, and while he adores Lindsay he’s aware she’s not quite the glamour puss of say, Emily Ratajkowski or Blake Lively [two of his rumored former conquests whilst he was married to Jen Garner],” our snitch spills.

Affleck wants to uphold his Hollywood image and believes his arm candy should be dressed to the nines at all times. According to the pal, Ben “wants Lindsay to seize the moment and get herself a brand new wardrobe, even some fillers if necessary.”
And lo and behold, she’s going through with it! “She’s totally smitten and dancing to his tune, so expect her to follow through and vamp up her image big time,” the insider dishes.
