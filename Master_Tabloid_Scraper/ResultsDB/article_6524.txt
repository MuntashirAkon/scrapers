Emily Ratajkowski Dishes on Her Not-So-Strict Diet: ‘I’m Someone Who Eats a Lot’/n

Don’t let her looks fool you: Emily Ratajkowski has quite an appetite.
On Jimmy Kimmel Live! on Monday night, the model admitted that while she’s not so skilled behind the stove, eating takeout in bed is a regular occurrence in her household. “I’m not someone who cooks. I’m someone who eats — a lot,” she said.
“You should see my refrigerator. It’s insane,” she continued. “I have a relationship with Postmates. It’s basically Indian food and Thai food, preferably when I’m horizontal in bed. I’ve had people come over and watch me eat and then say, like, ‘I’ve lost all respect for you.'”

Ratajkowski also buried the hatchet with Kimmel regarding some “beef” they’ve had since the 2016 Emmy Awards.
Kimmel, who was hosting the ceremony, passed out peanut butter and jelly sandwiches to the audience—which he claimed were made by his mother. After the event, Ratajkowski told TMZ that they “weren’t that good.”

“I was one of the few people who actually ate them, a lot of people don’t eat in Hollywood,” Ratajowski responded, explaining that she felt like her sandwich had been sitting out too long, thus compromising the quality.
“To your mother, I really apologize,” she added. “And maybe to you because you had to eat those peanut butter and jelly sandwiches throughout your life.”
