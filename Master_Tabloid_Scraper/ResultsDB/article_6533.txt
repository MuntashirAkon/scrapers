During the event, Blunt, who has two daughters with funnyman John Krasinski, added that she wanted to pay tribute to the original classic, but make sure that the role was her own."I needed to try to pay homage to Julie Andrews but carve out a new space for myself. And we were very loyal to the books," said Blunt.During the Disney expo, the film's director Rob Marshall said The Devil Wears Prada actress is "stunning" and was "born to play this part." Streep said that Mary Poppins Returns was a "gift to the world."Meanwhile, Van Dyke said being on the set felt the same as it did in the '60s—the "highest level of joy."The movie is set 25 years after the original film, which came out in 1964, and catches up with the magical nanny in Depression-era London.In March, the first image of Blunt in costume was released.
