Emily Ratajkowski Cannes Do No Wrong Wrapped Up In Her Bikini /nEmily Ratajkowski is in the South of France with a ton of other celebs this week for the Cannes Film Festival, but she's already stealing the show. Emily took a dip Wednesday in a bikini that looked like it crept up onto her body and wrapped itself around her ... because what bikini wouldn't want to do that? She's staying at the hoity-toity Hotel du Cap-Eden-RocÂ in Antibes where the pool hovers right over the Mediterranean, so the views are epic ... especially when Emily's getting out of the pool./n
