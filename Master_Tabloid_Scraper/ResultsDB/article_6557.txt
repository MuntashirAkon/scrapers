'Little Women: Atlanta' ... Pregnant Chick in Bar Brawl/nFour of the  "Little Women: Atlanta " cast members got into a knock-down, drag-out fight that ended with one of them -- the pregnant one -- ending up in the hospital.  In an episode airing Wednesday ... Emily and her friend Bri got into it with twins Amanda and Andrea Salinas. The twins just started waiting tables at the same club where Emily and Bri work as dancers -- and as everyone knows ... waitresses and dancers don't mix.  Watch, Emily (with cornrows and a  "Boss " tee) is the one with child ... but she didn't hesitate to throw down. We're told she went to a hospital for a checkup after the fight. She and her fetus are fine, but some hair was definitely damaged!/n
