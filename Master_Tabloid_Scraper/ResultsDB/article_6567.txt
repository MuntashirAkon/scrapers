Oscar Pistorius Begs To End New Court Appeal In Girlfriend's Murder/n
Oscar Pistorius is fighting vigorously to keep his legal victory, a quick six-year prison sentence for the murder of his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp.
The 29-year-old has maintained that he shot the model and student after mistaking her for an intruder .

As Radar previously reported, Judge Thokozile Matilda Masipa determined on July 6 that the disgraced former Olympian would receive a sentence much shorter than that of a typical murder conviction due to mitigating circumstances.
While the minimum prison time for the crime in South Africa is 15 years, Pistorius may be up for parole in just three years under his current sentence.
Calling the case outcome “shockingly too lenient,” the National Prosecuting Authority of South Africa announced their plans to appeal the previous decision last month.

Now, Pistorius has been forced to fight to keep this initial court win, with his defense team lobbying: “A continuation of this matter is inimical to the interests of justice, patently unfair and that enough is enough.”
The amputee’s lawyers will argue “enough is enough” when the case continues next week, according to reports. /n
