Prosecutors Appeal Oscar Pistorius' 'Shockingly Too Lenient' Murder Sentence/n
Oscar Pistorius‘ legal victory— a quick six-year prison sentence for the murder of his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp— may be short-lived.
Calling the sentence “shockingly too lenient,” the National Prosecuting Authority of South Africa announced their plans to appeal the previous decision, RadarOnline.com has learned.
According to the New York Times, Judge Thokozile Matilda Masipa has the authority to send on the appeal to the Supreme Court.

As Radar previously reported, Judge Masipa determined on July 6 that the disgraced former Olympian, 29, would receive a sentence much shorter than that of a typical murder conviction due to mitigating circumstances.
While the minimum prison time for the crime in South Africa is 15 years, Pistorius may be up for parole in just three years under his current sentence.

“We respectfully submit that the sentence of six years imprisonment, in all the circumstances, is disproportionate to the crime of murder committed,” the NPA reportedly announced late on Thursday. “That is to say, shockingly too lenient, and has accordingly resulted in an injustice and has the potential to bring the administration of justice into disrepute.”
Pistoriu has been in and out of the courtroom since killing Steenkamp on Valentine’s Day in 2013.
He has maintained that he shot the model and student, then 29, after mistaking her for an intruder. /n
