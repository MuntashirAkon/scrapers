Watch Out Michelle! Williams' New Boyfriend Has Scary Drug Past/n
When Michelle Williams was spotted enjoying a sunny day in the park on Monday with her daughter Matilda, 7, and new boyfriend Dustin Yellin, many believed she had found happiness at last. But RadarOnline.com has learned he has connections to the same hard-partying milieu that ultimately proved toxic for her great love, Heath Ledger.
Years ago, when he was just starting out in New York, Yellin was known for hosting wild parties at his loft at 136 10th Avenue. In February, 2000, Bijou Phillips stabbed Yellin in the leg during one out-of-control bash! “We were hanging out with friends,” he explained at the time. “People were playing music. She picked up a kitchen knife and started chasing me with it. We were just horsing around, but it went too far. It was a moment of insanity.”
The wound almost proved fatal when Yellin suffered from internal bleeding days after being stitched up in the ER.

Just two months later, Yellin’s loft would be the setting for an even grislier scene, however, when banking heir Raphael de Rothschild died of a suspected heroin overdose on the sidewalk out front after partying all night at Yellin’s pad.
Yellin was not confirmed to have been at the party, or otherwise connected to the death.
More recently, he was spotted getting cozy with Mary Kate Olsen at the NYAA Take Home a Nude Benefit in October 2011. Mary Kate, infamously, was the first person Heath’s masseuse called when she found him dead, and the two were reportedly dating at the time of his passing.
And Yellin himself has admitted to drug use recently, claiming in an April 2013 video interview with the Tribeca Film Festival that “taking crazy hallucinogens” was one way he finds inspiration for his art.

Does Michelle know? Famously careful of whom she lets into her life after Heath’s death, she dumped actor Jason Segel after his drinking became an issue. /n
