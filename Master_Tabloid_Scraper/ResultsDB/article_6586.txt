Gordon Ramsay's Daughter Admits Her Father Is A 'Really Fussy Eater' & Gets Hot-Headed With Her Cooking Too!/n

Gordon Ramsay is known for being a pretty tough cookie when it comes to critiquing aspiring chefs.
Apparently, the culinary mastermind can get just as hot-headed when it comes to the cooking of his 15-year-old daughter!
But growing up with the scalding verbal burns of her father has shaped Tilly Ramsay into quite the food prodigy — which was evidenced in the teen chef's appearance on ITV's This Morning.

On Monday's segment, Tilly admitted her dad was "a really fussy eater" with her less-seasoned food and can get just as dramatic as his on-air persona if something less than sublime grazes his tastebuds.
Thankfully, the entrepreneurial teen is already a pro in the kitchen — she already has her own cooking show, NBD — and showcased her inherited skills by whipping up her signature chili dish for hosts Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby.
Before she got to cooking though, Tilly received a heartwarming (yet slightly intimidating) video message from her dad telling her not to fuck up. Ha!
Ch-ch-check out the clip (below) to see how Gordon's daughter make her American-inspired dish.
