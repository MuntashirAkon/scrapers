Adopt Me! 'Innocent Spirit' Matilda Love Will Melt Your Heart
/n
Home: Some pets never have one to call their own. We’d like to help change that by introducing you to an extraordinary, adoptable pet every week. Today, in honor of Adopt a Senior Pet Month, meet Matilda Love, a Jack Russell terrier currently residing in a foster home in Washington, D.C., via Rescuzilla Animal Rescue of N.Y.C.
This pup’s bio starts out a lot like a fairy tale:
A couple of years ago a little Jack Russell terrier was found as a stray in the Bronx. She was so gentle and sweet that ‘Matilda Love’ seemed like the perfect name for her. Matilda quickly found a home but lost it in April when the family moved where pets were not allowed. Her search for a new home is a little tougher now that she’s a little older and needs some more care.
This mature girl, who was once a professional fetch player, is now a champion nap taker. Mati, as her foster dad calls her, gets incredibly excited about two things in life: meals and when her person comes home. Though she has started losing some of her eyesight and hearing, her nose can always find food, the rescue says, and her antics are guaranteed to make your heart melt.
“She’ll make you giggle by somehow falling asleep with half her body off the bed,” reads her bio. “Most of all, she’ll make you smile with her innocent spirit that is just happy to be.”
Matilda Love is spayed, up-to-date on vaccinations, microchipped and recently had a dental cleaning. She currently takes a little pill every day to keep her heart rate up and “vitamins to help keep her sprightly.”
