14 Things You Never Knew About Matilda in Honor of Its 20th Anniversary/n

Matilda turns 20 on Aug. 20, hammering yet another nail into the coffin of your childhood. Roald Dahl’s psychic child is currently experiencing another bout of popularity, thanks to the thriving musical version of the book that’s currently charming audiences across the world. (Mara Wilson remains, as ever, a national treasure, though she’s expressed no interest in returning to the role.)
So pop that weathered VHS into your VCR (or you know, choose a modern viewing alternative) to relive the excitement, while we provide you with some cocktail-party-ready trivia points about Matilda as you gear up for your weekly nostalgia screening, Snapchat discussion or God knows whatever the kids are up to these days. 
1. The film’s trailers contained a number of references to Tim Burton movies

For whatever reason, filmmakers decided to use an instrumental version of Burton’s The Nightmare Before Christmas song “What’s This” in Matilda‘s theatrical trailer (top of this post). This was possibly done as a nod to Nightmare director Henry Selick, who helmed the film adaptation of Dahl’s James and the Giant Peach, released the same year as Matilda – Burton produced that film as well. Another version of the trailer, included on the home releases of other films, including Jumanji (above), included Harry Belafonte’s “Jump in the Line,” which is used in the final scene of Burton’s Beetlejuice.
2. …As does its casting

Pee-wee Herman himself, Paul Reubens, is one of the FBI agents in the film. (Burton directed Pee-wee’s Big Adventure.) The rabbit hole only goes deeper: Reubens was also in Batman Returns as the father of the villainous Penguin (played by Matilda‘s director and star, Danny DeVito) and Tracey Walter, who plays the other FBI agent, was the whimsically named Bob the Goon in Burton’s original Batman. 
3. Mariska Hargitay was originally slated to play Miss HoneyHargitay turned the role down to continue as a TV actress, landing roles on Can’t Hurry Love and ER before becoming the Olivia Benson we all know and love on Law & Order: SVU. 
4. Pam Ferris stayed in character as Miss Trunchbull throughout filming

She wanted to ensure the children’s onscreen reactions to her character were genuine. Ferris would later go on to play the equally repugnant Aunt Marge in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, as well as many other non-children’s literature roles. 
5. Matilda out-grossed the other Dahl adaptation of the year

The Nightmare Before Christmas director Henry Selick and Tim Burton released their stop-motion animation version of Dahl’s James and the Giant Peach in 1996, the same year as Matilda. Though the film was nominated for an Oscar, for its score by Randy Newman, it was outperformed at the box office by Matilda, grossing slightly under $29 million to Matilda‘s $33.4 million. (Both are domestic figures.)
6. The newt that terrorizes Miss Trunchbull is in the film’s credits… Where it’s listed as being played by Mr. Speaker, Sir Isaac and Wayne. These are all newt puns; they reference politician Newt Gingrich, physicist Sir Isaac Newton and singer Wayne Newton.
7. Mara Wilson designed Wanda, the doll Matilda carries

The system behind the chalkboard writing involved having the letters written on the back of the chalkboard backwards, then using magnets attached to the chalk to draw the words as someone stood behind the wall tracing the outlines. It’s a trick that’s been slightly modified for the book’s stage adaptation.
9. Roald Dahl has an uncredited cameo in the filmDahl, who died in 1990, appears as Magnus, Matilda’s deceased father, via the portrait that Matilda shows Miss Honey. That’s actually a painting of a young Dahl.
10. Bruce Bogtrotter left Hollywood to pursue medicine

Despite nabbing a few other bit parts, the actor who played Bruce Bogtrotter – the student that Trunchbull forces to devour an entire chocolate cake – has since slimmed down and is currently pursuing a degree in osteopathic medicine in Philadelphia. 
11. The film contains a reference to another Dahl workMatilda tells Miss Honey that she loves Charles Dickens, but mispronounces the author’s name as “Dahls Dickens.” This is both a nod to the author and his book The BFG, in which the titular giant consistently mangles English.
12. … and his wife …Miss Honey’s childhood toy, Lissy Doll, is a similar malapropism that nods to Dahl. The author’s second wife was named Felicity, though her nickname was “Liccy.” Get it? Liccy Dahl… Lissy Doll? Never mind. 
13. … oh, and another Dahl book

//s.imgur.com/min/embed.jsThere’s a copy of Dahl’s The Witches on a bookshelf near the end of the film. But another nod to the work is included in the line Matilda speaks to Miss Honey about the speed of a mouse’s beating heart, which is lifted nearly verbatim from a conversation in the book.
14. Matilda’s parents were probably arrested by the F.B.I.Okay, it’s not so much trivia, but you know how Matilda’s parents say they’re moving to Guam to escape the feds? Guam is a U.S. territory. As such, it’s not one of the countries without an extradition treaty with the U.S. and therefore not a great place to hide if you’re looking to duck the F.B.I.
