Heath Worth a Helluva Lot More Than $145K/nThere have been news reports that Heath Ledger left a grand total of $145,000 in his estate, and, as a result, his daughter might not be taken care of properly -- BOGUS!True, we know the will lists $145,000 in assets. But here's the deal. The will was drafted in 2003. Since then, sources say, Heath accumulated lots of jack, from movies like  "Lords of Dogtown, "  "The Brothers Grimm, "  "Brokeback Mountain, "  "Casanova, "  "Candy, "  "I'm Not There " and  "The Dark Knight. "We're told Heath has considerably more assets than the $145k. On top of that, sources say he lived all over the world and was smart enough to know all of his money shouldn't sit in the U.S., where taxes are a bitch.On the other hand, one of Heath's uncles has said the late actor's estate is valued at $60 mil. We're told that's absurd as well (on the high side), and the uncle doesn't know jack since he's been estranged from the family as well.Bottom line -- Matilda will be fine, and there's a lot of $$$ on the line./n
