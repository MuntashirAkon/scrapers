The singer continued on to explain the cause of Rona’s death.
“Rona died of a very aggressive brain tumor and mercifully suffered no pain,” Olivia said.

Olivia revealed last month that Rona had been fighting brain cancer. So, just as Rona stood by Olivia’s side as she beat breast cancer in the early 90s, Olivia spent the past few weeks supporting her sister.
“I will miss her forever – my beautiful, smart, talented, funny, brave sister Rona,” Olivia added.
In memory of her sister, who was also an actress, Olivia asks her fans to send donations to the Olivia Newton-John Wellness Cancer & Wellness Center. /n
