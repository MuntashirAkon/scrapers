Judge Rob Kardashian, citing a question from Twitter, asked Culpo: “Would you feel it would be fair that a transgender woman wins the Miss USA title over a natural-born woman?”
She responded, “I do think that would be fair, but I could understand how people could be apprehensive to take that road. However, there are so many people who have a need to change for a happier life.
