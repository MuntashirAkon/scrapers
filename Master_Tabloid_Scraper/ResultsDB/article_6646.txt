Ruth Negga Is Radiating In Red On The Oscars Red Carpet!/n

Ruth Negga is making all kinds of statements!
On Sunday, Miz Negga hit the red carpet for the 2017 Oscars as she's a Best Actress nominee for her role in the movie Loving. And the 35-year-old made sure to make the most of her time in the spotlight as she not only stunned in a gorgeous, ruby red Valentino gown, but she also rocked an ACLU blue ribbon. YASSSS!
We aren't shocked Ruth made a political statement on the red carpet as her nominated movie is all about an interracial couple fighting for their marriage in the 1950s. Way to be on the right side of history, girl!
Also, can we take a minute to talk about the INCREDIBLE ruby covered Irene Neuwirth crown and earrings the up-and-comer is wearing??? Ummmmm, AH-Mazing!
This may be one of the best looks of the night.
