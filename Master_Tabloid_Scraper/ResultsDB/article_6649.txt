Mariah Carey & Elton John Just Reportedly Made MILLIONS Performing At Russian Billionaire Heiress' Wedding!/n

Well we guess she officially survived her New Year's Eve disaster!
Mariah Carey and Elton John are undoubtedly two of the biggest acts in the entire worldâ€¦ but just in case you thought differently, Russian billionaire Valery Kogan is here to set you straight.
That's because the airport magnate just reportedly paid the music legends roughly $4.22 MILLION to perform at his granddaughter's wedding over the weekend!

Apparently, 19-year-old Irene Kogan â€” heiress to Moscow's Domodedovo Airport fortune â€” wed Daniel Kevey at London's Landmark Hotel on Saturdayâ€¦ with We Belong Together selected as the couple's wedding song!
It's unclear exactly how the multiple millions were split up between Mariah and Elton, but whichever way you slice it, they both made serious bank for playing the 9-hour reception.
Plus, Mimi actually sounded like her old self again!!! (We guess that means Dick Clark Productions just didn't pay her well enoughâ€¦)
Ch-ch-check out some of Mariah Carey and Elton John's wealthy wedding set-list (below)!!!
