Dave Franco and Alison Brie tied the knot without making a sound.

Brie’s reps confirmed the couple’s marriage on Monday, Mar. 13 without providing any additional details.

While he was promoting Now You See Me 2 last June, Franco alluded that their wedding ceremony would be unconventional.
“I feel like when we do eventually get married, we’re not gonna do a lot of the traditions and we’re just gonna make it easy and who knows?” the actor told Entertainment Tonight.  “We’re pretty lax about the whole thing. It’ll happen when it happens.”
