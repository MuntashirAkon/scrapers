Toddlerogrophy isn’t as easy as you’d expect.
Gwyneth Paltrow and James Corden teamed up on Tuesday’s (Apr. 19, 2016) episode of The Late Late Show to get dance lessons from the most intense choreographers in America — some adorable toddlers. So intense, in fact, it even apparently made Beyoncé cry. In the hilarious skit, the late night host and actress leap, twirl and jam to Irene Cara’s “Flashdance…What a Feeling,” following along as their little coaches dance their hearts out.

Besides their ’80 moves and sweatbands, the best part of the video has to be when they cool off and rehydrate with some juice boxes afterwards. Now that Paltrow has some extra time on her hands — she’s taking a break from acting — we know what she might be up to next.
Watch the hilarious video above.
