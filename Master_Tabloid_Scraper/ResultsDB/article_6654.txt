 Everybody’s favorite detective will return — next year.
Some six months after Sherlock wrapped its third series, the BBC has announced plans to make a fourth series, along with a special.

Which means Benedict Cumberbatch will be back looking as dashing as ever in his Sherlock Holmes coat and (dorky) hat, with Martin Freeman as the sweet John Watson by his side.
“Of course, it’s far too early to say what’s coming, but we’re reasonably confident that the very next thing to happen to Sherlock and John, is the very last thing you’d expect,” co-creator, writer and executive producer Steven Moffat said of the new season.
Last thing you’d expect eh? Should we all forget about the romance of our dreams then? Will there be a spot for Irene Adler? Will Sherlock finally wear something other than his long coat and hat? (Probably not on that last one).

“It’s always special to return to Sherlock but this time it’s even more special as we’re doing… a Special!” added Mark Gatiss, another co-creator, writer and executive producer. “Not only THAT, we’ll then be shooting three more episodes which will take Sherlock and John Watson into deeper and darker water than ever before. The whole Sherlock team are terrifically excited to return for four new adventures. The Game is on – again!”
Whatever the writers come up with, please don’t touch the wonderful union that is John and Mary, the delightful Mrs. Hudson or dear Molly.
The Sherlock special will start filming in January 2015, with the new season “later next year.”
