The Next Season of ‘The Real World’ Will Feature the Cast-Mates’ Exes/n
In a move so stunningly idiotic it could only have been dreamed up by television executives, the next season of The Real World (shot in San Francisco) will feature the show’s first ever format change.
Entertainment Weekly reports that this coming season will start off normally, with seven strangers picked to live in a house, work together and have their lives taped blah blah blah. There will be a little (a lot) of drinking. Ruthie will get naked in a pool. Stephen will slap Irene. Shenanigans abound. Then! One month into the three-month shoot, a twist! Our kindly (or maybe not so kind, there’s always a bigot on this show) strangers will take a day trip (if they go visit Twitter HQ or some shit like that I will scream) and when they return, their exes will have moved into the house as well. Just like that.
According to Jonathan Murray, the show’s creator, the change is about updating a stale format and not to intentionally tank a show he’s grown tired of working on for 21 years.
“When The Real World went on the air in ’92 you put seven diverse people together and you get conflict, and out of that conflict would come change, and then you have a story,” Murray told EW. “Now that it’s 21 years or so later, maybe we’re a bit of a victim of our own success. Diversity is a fact of life today. A lot of young people date people of different races, or have friends who are gay. The world has changed. We’ve had conversations [with the network] throughout 28 seasons of the show, but we’ve never made this big of a commitment to change.”
Oh, yeah, this season will be called Real World: Ex-Plosion. Christ.
