Me, Myself & Irene/n
Subtle is not a word in the Farrelly brothers' dictionary. After hooking audiences with There's Something About Mary, the boys raise the crude-comedy factor a few notches here by throwing everything at the wall and letting the audience determine which ones stick. They're not all as potent as Ben Stiller's man-mousse, but just check out those three African Americans who play Carrey's sons (don't even ask).

 And then there's that chicken (really don't ask!). Playing a guy with multiple personalities, both of which fall for the same girl, Carrey's physical humor has never been better--especially when he's duking it out with himself. Zellweger is a great girl-in-distress and witness to this madness, which packs enough yucks for you and any of your alternate personalities.
