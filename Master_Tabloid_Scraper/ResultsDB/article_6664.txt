Carrey's "Irene" Under Fire/n
Note to Jim Carrey and Hollywood: Be gentle with the mental jokes.        That's what the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI) is asking for in light of Carrey's crazed performance in the upcoming comedy Me, Myself & Irene.  The Virginia-based nonprofit advocacy group has launched a "national protest" against the 20th Century Fox film, calling it an "ignorant" and "insensitive" portrayal of people with mental illnesses.         "We're concerned because the movie perpetuates the myth that schizophrenia is the same as split-personality disorder and that's not true," says Bill Emmet, NAMI's deputy executive director.         In the movie, Carrey stars as a policeman whose two personalities fall in love with the same woman, played by Carrey's real-life paramour Renee Zellweger.        The organization says the would-be zany comedy, which opens June 23, and its marketing campaign (featuring the tag line: "From Gentle to Mental") reinforce existing stereotypes when it comes to mentally ill and their families.         "In some of their promotional material, they use terms like 'schizo' inappropriately," Emmet adds.  "Part of our mission is to educate the public and put out a corrective message."        Pointing out that over 30,000 suicides a year are often linked to mental illnesses including schizophrenia, Emmet's organization, which represents over 220,000 people with such diseases, would like to see a more balanced view.        NAMI is calling on the filmmakers to provide a more accurate depiction of mental illness through public service announcements, promotional material and interviews.         No strangers to playing the mentally challenged for laughs, Irene comes from the twisted minds of gross-out kings Peter and Bobby Farrelly, the directing duo behind such goof-fests as There's Something About Mary, Dumb & Dumber and Kingpin.         Despite NAMI's contentions, 20th Century Fox has never claimed Carrey's character is schizophrenic.  In its publicity campaign, the studio only refers to the character as suffering from "split-personality disorder."  Reps for the studio, the Farrellys and Carrey had no comment on the budding protest.        Earlier this year, NAMI launched a similar protest against the TV series Wonderland, claiming the show  presented a hopeless view of mental illness and ran contrary to the Surgeon General's campaign to prevent suicide. The show was canceled by ABC after only two episodes--but low ratings, not the controversy, was the reason.
