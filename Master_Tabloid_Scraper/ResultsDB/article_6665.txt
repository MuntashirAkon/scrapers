Carrey and Farrellys: Something About "Irene"/n
Not many studio bosses have the luxury of a sure thing--a movie that can't miss at the box office.            These days, 20th Century Fox film honcho Bill Mechanic must be sleeping better than most. Not only is his studio behind the biggest film event in years, the release of George Lucas' Star Wars: Episode I--The Phantom Menace, it also has the proven comedy team of writer-director brothers Peter and Bob Farrelly (fresh off last year's monster hit There's Something About Mary) and rubber-faced funnyman Jim Carrey all lined up to make another movie, Industry trades report.            The project is called Me, Myself and Irene and has Carrey playing the role of a guy with a split personality whose two personas are at odds over the same girl, with each persona sabotaging the other (kind of like the low-budget stinker Dr. Jekyll and Ms. Hyde with Sean Young and Tim Daly).            Of course, in 1994, the Farrellys and Carrey hit paydirt with the aptly titled smash Dumb and Dumber, a film that cost less than $20 million to make but took in $127 million domestically.            No word yet on what Carrey--who himself now costs about $20 million a picture--will get paid. Quoting unnamed inside sources (official ones aren't talking yet), Daily Variety says that while The Truman Show star's deal isn't finalized yet, the dotted line is a mere formality.            As for shooting, that's said to be getting under way soon, since Carrey doesn't have a project to do until later this year, when he'll start work on the Ron Howard-helmed Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas.
