We also chatted with Caleb and Jena after their big night to find out how they were feeling about their three performances."Everything was such a whirlwind; it was just amazing and electric. It was just nuts," Caleb told us, while Jena gushed, "I remember just looking at when I started singing my first song and thinking to myself, ‘How am I here?!' I'm performing in front of stadium of feeling.' It was just the best feeling in the world."And while Caleb wasn't able to pinpoint just one moment as his favorite throughout the season, Jena picked a time of hardship as her standout memory. "When I performed "Decode" because I was a new wild card at that point and I was still really proving myself to America that I do deserve to be in this competition," Jena recalled of her Top 11 performance.To hear more from Seacrest, Caleb and Jena, watch our interviews with them above!American Idol's finale airs tonight at 8 p.m. on Fox.
