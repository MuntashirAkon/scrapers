Kathryn Dennis & Thomas Ravenel Duke Out Custody Battle In Courtroom Showdown/n
Kathryn Dennis and Thomas Ravenel squared off in a Charleston, S.C. family court on June 28, RadarOnline.com has learned.
Dennis, 24, and Ravenel, 54, have been battling for custody of Kensie, 3, and St. Julien, 1, since their 2016 breakup.
Dennis arrived shortly after Ravenel with a water bottle that his team joked was filled with gin, according to reports. Radar previously reported that Dennis completed a month-long stay in a California based rehab facility after a drug test revealed she had amphetamine, marijuana, crack/cocaine and methadone in her system.

She denied failing the test on the season 3 reunion and accused Ravenel of being an “alcoholic” instead.
She also accused him of using mushrooms and cocaine in front of their tots in court documents obtained by Radar just last month, and now reports claim that Dennis asked a judge to order more random drug tests for Ravenel.
They did not reach a settlement at the end of their hearing — and Ravenel noticeably left Dennis out of a cast photo on his Instagram page after leaving court.
