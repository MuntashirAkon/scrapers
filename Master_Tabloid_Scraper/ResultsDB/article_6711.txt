 'Betrayed!' Thomas Ravenel Slams Landon Clements Amid Custody Battle With Kathryn Dennis.../n
Kathryn Dennis is making amends with more than with just Thomas Ravenel!
The Southern Charm stars took a cast trip to Key West, Fla., and Landon Clements decided to end her feud with Dennis during a dinner on the vacation. RadarOnline.com previously reported that Clements, 35, and Dennis, 24, were fighting over 54-year-old Ravenel’s affection.
“I’m sorry that hurt your feelings,” Clements babbled in a clip as Dennis looked disgusted. “I really and truly am and I do apologize.”

“It’s not necessarily just feelings, it’s that we had a child involved,” Dennis began. “We broke up two days —”
“I’m sorry for my ignorance to not considering your feelings,” Clements cut off.
“I appreciate that,” Dennis said, unimpressed.

“I’ve never been a mom,” Clements explained. “I don’t know those things. And I know you and Thomas have your relationship and I feel like sometimes he uses me as a weapon against you and I don’t think that’s right.”
“I just want the best for you and I don’t know how to facilitate that,” Clements added.
Finally, the girls hugged out their feud — but the drama isn’t over yet!

“This just feels very fake,” Dennis said in a confessional.
“My visceral reaction is betrayal,” Ravenel admitted in his own confessional about his feelings towards Clements. “I’m curious to what her intent is.”
Dennis and Ravenel are still in a heated custody battle over their babies Kensie, 3, and St. Julien, 1. They are due back in court later this month.
