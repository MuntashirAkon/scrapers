Son Of Former Wife Swap Family Murders His Mother & Brother Before Attempting Suicide/n

This is so, so sad.
Back in 2008, the "devoutly religious" Stockdale family appeared on Wife Swap, during which viewers got an inside look at the very strict household which involved a ban on swearing, television, and video games. The four young brothers were homeschooled and expected to complete their chores around the farm.
Now, it's been reported the second youngest son, Jacob, is in critical condition after shooting his mother, Kathryn, and younger brother, James, before pulling the gun on himself at the home of The Stockdale Family Band.

The 54-year-old matriarch and 21-year-old bass player were pronounced dead at the scene.
According to reports, police got a 911 call Thursday afternoon before finding the two bodies and Jacob, 25, with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. He remains in the hospital as the remaining family members prepare funeral arrangements.
On Friday, the eldest brother, Calvin, said in a statement: 
"[Our family] appreciates the prayers and support we are receiving from our friends and the community."
What a tragic situation.
