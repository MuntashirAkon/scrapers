Lisa Vanderpump's BFF Dorit Kemsley Makes Her Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills Debut!/n

When you've traveled the world, you can speak in any accent you want.
Now that Real Housewives of Beverly Hills has officially moved past its Yolanda Hadid era and straight into Season 7, it's time to start focusing on the new.
Luckily, Tuesday night's RHOBH premiere made that pretty easy to doâ€¦ because we're already loving YoYo and Kathryn Edwards' first replacement, Dorit Kemsley!
Lisa Vanderpump's BFF may only be from Connecticut, but you'd never be able to tell based on her thick British/Israeli/??? accent!

Luckily for Dorit, her mannerisms aren't actually the most interesting things about her because she just so happens to be housemates with the one and only Boy George!!!
But in case you were wondering how Dorit got to be a part of the Bravo family, we only have the Vanderpump Rules matriarch to thank for that.
Plus, how great is her impression of LVP?!
Ch-ch-check out Dorit's RHOBH introduction (below)!!!
