RHOBH Newbie Eden Sassoon Once Gave Mac Miller A Blowjob AND Has A Creepy Rob Lowe Connection!/n

Watch out, Ariana Grande!
Eden Sassoon was a socialite in her own right long before joining the cast of Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, so it shouldn't be a shocker that she already has her own Hollywood horror stories.
To celebrate Tuesday's RHOBH premiere, the hair care heiress stopped by The Tomorrow Show with Keven Underago on Monday night to show off her personality since she won't be making her Bravo debut until later in the season.

However, Vidal Sassoon's daughter is already proving she's not a one-and-done 'wife… because she's basically as shameless as Brandi Glanville!
After admitting she "wouldn't kick Justin Bieber out of bed," Eden opened up about her oral history with Mac Miller, saying: 

"I did give him a blow job. I didn't want to sleep with him, so I was like, 'let me take care of this kid…' [But,] I don't know if I would take Mac or Justin for a date."
For those of you keeping count, the 24-year-old rapper is 19 years Eden's junior — and we love it!!
Oh, but wait until you hear the one about Rob Lowe…
