Kathryn Dennis sought help from a very unlikely ally in the midst of her ongoing custody battle with ex Thomas Ravenel.
In an exclusive sneak peek at Monday’s Southern Charm, Dennis asks the advice of Ravenel’s closest friend JD Madison and his wife, Elizabeth, who are the godparents to her children with Ravenel: daughter Kensie, 3, and son Saint, 18 months.
In the clip, Dennis tells the couple she and Ravenel, 54, hadn’t talked for nine months when he texted her out of the blue to have a sit-down, leaving her unsure how to respond.
“Do you want to reach back out to him or not?” asks Elizabeth.
Says Dennis, “I want to, of course, for my children. I’m nervous. I always feel like he has a motive or something like that, you know?”

JD reveals he’d had his own pep talk with Ravenel three days before, telling him, “The kids need their mom just like their dad. My God, man. It’s gotta come to a resolution.”
JD, who’s known Thomas for 20 years, says in a separate interview that the plantation owner and volatile relationship with the former model is “very complicated … but, as godfather, you want to help.”
With Saint’s 1st birthday coming up at the time of filming, Dennis admits, “In a perfect world, I would hope we could celebrate it together, but I don’t really know how to navigate [the situation].”
The Madisons tell Dennis, who completed a stint in rehab shortly before the latest season began, that she should start with a simple agenda and treat her get-togethers with Ravenel like a business deal — otherwise, their court battle could end in devastating losses for one or both of them.
“I’ve worked really hard to get to a place where I’m okay with the fact that Thomas and I do not communicate because it isn’t good for us,” says Dennis, 24. “But maybe it’s time.”
Southern Charm airs Mondays (9 p.m. ET) on Bravo.
