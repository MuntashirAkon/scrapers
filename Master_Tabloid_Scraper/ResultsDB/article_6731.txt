Over a couple rounds of drinks at the local mall, the moms share how they really feel about the holiday. "I feel like a giant stress ball from November to New Years" complains Kunis. Hahn adds that Christmas is the busiest time of the year for her: "I waxed 39 p-----s today. Since when did every woman in America need a completely hairless vagina on Christmas?" Cue the Christmas tree heist, strippers, a camel and a whole lot of sampling mall alcohol. 

The bad moms have "had it up to here," and this Christmas, they are taking on the mother of all holidays. If that doesn't sound hard enough, imagine doing it all while hosting Cheryl Hines, Christine Baranski and Susan Sarandon, the mothers of the bad moms.When Kunis's mom, played by Baranski, realizes she is cutting out all of the Christmas spirit, she quickly puts her straight: "Moms don't enjoy, they give joy. That's how being a mom works."A Bad Moms Christmas hits theaters on November 3, 2017.
