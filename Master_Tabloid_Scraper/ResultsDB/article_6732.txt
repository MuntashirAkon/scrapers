The Visit is definitely a horror movie.But the M. Night Shyamalan-directed film is also a comedy.In the movie, Kathryn Hahn plays Loretta, a single mom who sends her two kids (Olivia DeJonge and Ed Oxenbould) to visit with her estranged parents.Turns out grandma (Deanna Dunagan) and grandpa (Peter McRobbie) are very creepy. Not to spoil any big surprises, but the kids are scared for their lives and the story line includes soiled adult diapers.Just when you think you're going to scream, you laugh and vice versa.

Hahn first saw the final cut of the film (in theaters Sept. 11) in a screening room with just a few other people. "We were all screaming and laughing by the end of it," Hahn says. "The four of us walked into the blinding L.A. afternoon sun and were like, 'What just happened?'"It's not Hahn's usual movie fare. "I read it and I was like, 'I wanna audition for this!'" she remembered. "They were like, 'Do you?' I was like, 'Yeah, I will. I would totally audition. I want Loretta.' I love this part. I love the women that [Shyamalan] writes."Needless to say, but Hahn's children, Leonard, 8, and Mae, 6, won't be seeing The Visit anytime soon. In fact, they haven't seen much of their mom's work.Tomorrowland is one of the few of Hahn's movies they've been allowed to watch."They loved it and saw my head blown off," Hahn said, laughing. "They were so excited. They were like, 'Mommy's a robot!'"Did you know that Hahn was supposed to star in the U.S. version of Absolutely Fabulous?
