EXCLUSIVE! Are You the One's Kathryn Palmer Reacts to Those Romance Rumors With The Bachelorette's Robby Hayes/n
In regards to dating someone that's in or out of the public eye, Kathryn doesn't have a preference. What's most important is the compatibility. "As far as dating other people on reality TV, it's nice to be able to connect with someone who's been through a similar experience because they understand it whereas people who haven't been in your shoes in that way don't really understand what you did on TV. They don't understand what the experience was like or the things you are doing now," she explained. "But I'm definitely open to whatever."
