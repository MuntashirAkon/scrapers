Kathryn Bigelow made history when she became the first woman to win a Best Director Oscar.And if this new teaser trailer for Zero Dark Thirty is any indication, the lady behind The Hurt Locker could very well find herself in the running for another statuette.Mind you, there's very little revealed about the film's storyline of the U.S. military's pursuit and subsequent killing of Osama bin Laden.

But in this case, the less-is-more, shrouded-in-secrecy feel actually works well here given how little we do actually know about what went down on May 2, 2011.The movie, written by Hurt Locker screenwriter Mark Boal, has encountered some controversy since it started production.A year ago, President Barack Obama's administration was accused of supplying Bigelow and her team with classified information relating to the mission that took down the onetime Al Qaeda leader, but the White House insisted it was not true.What's more, the movie's original release date of Oct. 12 has now been moved to December so as to avoid it looking as if it was intended to put Obama in a more positive light just weeks before the presidential election.Zero Dark Thirty, originally titled Kill Bin Laden, stars Kyle Chandler, Jessica Chastain, Chris Pratt, Joel Edgerton, Jennifer Ehle and Mark Duplass.
