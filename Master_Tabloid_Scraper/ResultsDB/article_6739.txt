Directors James Cameron and Kathryn Bigelow may be ex-spouses going head-to-head this awards season with Avatar and The Hurt Locker, but it sounds like things are better than good between the two.At least according to Cameron."It's fun," he insisted at the Critics' Choice Awards before Bigelow beat him for best director and best picture. "You know, Kathryn and I have worked together a lot, and we'll probably work together again. And if she wins, I'll be cheering."When asked about his favorite movies of the year, Cameron said...

"I happen to particularly like The Hurt Locker," he said. "That's both the beauty and the oddness of this type of an event where you have to pick one. How do you pick one from so many disparate subjects and styles?"Cameron insists he didn't expect all of the success Avatar has already had."We expected the film to be commercially successful, but not on the level that it is by any stretch," he said. "We didn't really see it as a film that would break through into the critics' consciousness because typically they don't look at science fiction the way they look at more 'serious' movies."Even so, Cameron is confident that his blue world of Pandora will stand the test of time à la...William Shakespeare."I think Avatar and Titanic both have a sort of classicism in that there are references from movies that were 10 or 20 or 30 years earlier," he said. "They're kind of timeless stories. Boy meets girl, like Romeo and Juliet. I think that's like 500 years old."
