Bret Easton Ellis has never been one to hold back his opinions on Twitter (see: Paris Hilton, Matt Bomer).Now, he's directing his 140-character vitriol at a most unlikely of targets: Zero Dark Thirty helmer Kathryn Bigelow.The motormouthed author took to Twitter Wednesday night to slam the filmmaker—the first woman to win an Oscar for Best Director—for her success mainly because of her gender.Oh, yes: He went there.

Fifty Shades of bitter? Bret Easton Ellis calls casting gay Matt Bomer "ludicrous"

"Kathryn Bigelow would be considered a mildly interesting filmmaker if she was a man but since she's a very hot woman she's really overrated," the 48-year-old author-screenwriter tweeted.He didn't stop there: An hour later, he posted another missive that ran down the 62-year-old filmmaker's body of work—including her Oscar-winning The Hurt Locker—only to offer up a gut punch at the end."Kathryn Bigelow: Strange Days, K-19 The Widowmaker, Blue Steel, The Hurt Locker," he wrote. "Are we talking about visionary filmmaking or just OK junk?"

Of course, the author is no stranger to trading Twitter punches: Last summer, he blasted rumors that Bomer, who is gay, was being talked up to star as the decidedly straight titular leading man in Fifty Shades of Grey.And then, in September, he defended Hilton's controversial homophobic remarks asserting that gay men are "disgusting" and "probably have AIDS."When it comes to his Bigelow beef, though, the director could have the last laugh: Zero Dark Thirty is shaping up to be a serious Oscar dark horse, nabbing top prizes from the National Board of Review and the New York Film Critics Circle.So much for "just OK junk."
