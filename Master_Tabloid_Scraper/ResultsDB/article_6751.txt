George Gets Revenge on Childhood Bullies/nNot very long ago, in a galaxy incomprehensibly far away, a schluberrific white-haired old guy found himself surrounded by a rainbow harem of stunning sirens.The only way this could happen in our own galaxy is if the humanoid Ewok (or Ewokian human?) was George Lucas,  "Star Wars " founder and multi-billionaire mogul. Here, he enjoys the attention of such noted female delicacies as  "X-Men's " Kelly Hu, Playmate Kendra Wilkinson,  "Cold Case's " Kathryn Morris, and  "CSI: Miami's " Emily Procter -- in preparation for the Toyota Grand Prix in Long Beach.Yeah, a billion dollars is something ... but Lucas might be emblazoning this photo on the t-shirt he wears to his next high school reunion./n
