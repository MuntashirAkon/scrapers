TMZ has learned. The song in question is called  "On Sight " -- which includes the lyric,  "A monster about to come alive again  / Soon as I pull up and park the Benz  / We get this bitch shaking like Parkinson's. " Now, TMZ has learned the American Parkinson Disease Association is upset about the lyric -- with the org.'s VP Kathryn Whitford telling us,  "We find these lyrics distasteful and the product of obvious ignorance.
