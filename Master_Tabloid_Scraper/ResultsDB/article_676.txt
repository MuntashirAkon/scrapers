That was fast.

Blac Chyna is back with Mechie just a week after it was reported the reality star had parted ways with the R&B singer. Putting an end to breakup rumors, Chyna got hot and heavy with her man while partying at a nightclub this weekend.
In a video shared on Snapchat, the 29-year-old mom-of-two made out with her on-again beau as she grinding on his body. At one, Mechie even grabbed Chyna’s booty as she wrapped her legs around his waist.

The PDA-packed clip came after Chyna told fans she was longing for her boo amid rumors of their split. Shortly before attending an event in Hollywood last week, the Rob & Chyna star posted a photo on Snapchat of Mechie holding her in his arms.
“Missing bae,” she wrote in the caption, alongside a sad face emoji.
