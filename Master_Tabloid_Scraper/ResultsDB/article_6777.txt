She states that during the concert, she was approached by “a man associated with Bridgestone Arena” who offered to take her backstage to meet both Drake and Future.
As she followed, Leavy Johnson, backstage, she claims he: “suddenly … pushed Jane Doe to the ground and violently assaulted her, shattering her cell phone and causing severe physical and psychological injury.”
