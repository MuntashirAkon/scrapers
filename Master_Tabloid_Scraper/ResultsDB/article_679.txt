Bella Thorne has a new man in her life!

The 19-year-old Famous in Love star made things official when she made her first red carpet debut as a couple with Blackbear at the 2017 Teen Choice Awards Sunday. Not shying away from the cameras, the two packed on major PDA as they shared kisses in front of photographers. At one point, Bella even turned to her man and licked his ear!
The couple were first rumored to be dating in July when Blackbear shared a photo of them in the middle of a steamy lip-lock on Instagram. At the time, the 26-year-old hip-hop star captioned the picture, “were hot.”

Though Bella was previously linked with Scott Disick, she quashed romance rumors with the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star when she confirmed to Us Weekly she has “someone that I am starting to see.”
“We are [just friends],” she said. “I think we’ll be friends for a long time, honestly.”
