She’s aging like fine wine!

Jessica Simpson rang in her 37th birthday Monday (July 10, 2017) by sharing a topless photo of herself. Clad only in skimpy bikini bottoms in the sexy photo, the singer-turned-designer captioned the Instagram shot, “Kiss My Butt 36.”
In the picture, the mom-of-two is seen lounging on a inflatable pool float while sipping a drink from a bedazzled pineapple.

Jessica also recently celebrated her son Ace Knute’s 4th birthday, throwing him a Moana themed bash with husband Eric Johnson. The backyard party included character impersonators from the Disney movie, as well as personalized gift bags for all of the attendees.
“May wish #4 come true my beautiful baby boy,” she wrote alongside a photo of her son blowing out the candles on his birthday cake.
