His body is a wonderland, and he knows it.

John Mayer responded to Katy Perry’s confession that he was the best sex she’s ever had. Speaking with the Rolling Stone, the singer expressed he was actually humbled by his ex-girlfriend’s revelation.
“I don’t have a cool-enough thought for you,” he said. “I’ve hacked this game. I pay very little of the price of fame now. I get to play the music that moves me the most. I’m having the time of my life. I’m 39 — I remember 32. I don’t wanna do it again.”
Earlier this month, Katy ranked John as the best lover in bed, beating out Orlando Bloom and Diplo. The latter since claimed he doesn’t even remember having sex with the “Swish Swish” songstress.
“They’re all amazing lovers,” Katy later explained. “I would have sex with all of them when I get out of this place!”

Katy’s confession came just months after John revealed he wrote “Still Feel Like Your Man” about his ex. Though he hasn’t been with Katy — who he dated on-and-off for four years — since 2015, he admitted the 32-year-old was still on his mind.
“Who else would I be thinking about?” he mused to the New York Times. “And by the way, it’s a testament to the fact that I have not dated a lot of people in the last five, six years. That was my only relationship. So it’s like, give me this, people.”
