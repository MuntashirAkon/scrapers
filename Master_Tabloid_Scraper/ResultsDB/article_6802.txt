It may have been a John Legend concert, but all eyes were on Chrissy Teigen when her boob accidentally popped out on stage. 
The model suffered a major nip slip while dancing with her husband during his performance Tuesday night (June 27, 2017). Chrissy — who was braless in a low-cut maxi dress — had a wardrobe malfunction when her gown slipped to the side, exposing her entire left breast to the crowd.
Like a true gentleman, John reached over and fixed his wife’s frock without missing a beat. Meanwhile, Chrissy shrugged off the gaffe.
“Sorry!” the mom-of-one quipped.

The best night ever! Thank you!!! @chrissyteigen @johnlegend pic.twitter.com/0KIL5mK4zu

Chrissy and her daughter, Luna Stephens, has on the road with John as part of the “Surefire” singer’s Darkness and Light Tour.
“I’m excited that we’re in the position where we can bring [Luna] on tour this summer and late spring, so that’ll be fun,” John said in a Facebook Live video earlier this year. “I’m in a position where we can make things happen to make sure she’s around us as much as possible.”
