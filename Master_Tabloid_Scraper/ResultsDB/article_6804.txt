Author Stephen King, whose novel Salem‚Äôs Lot was adapted for a television movie, also paid tribute.


Sorry to hear Tobe Hooper passed. He did a terrific job directing the 'SALEM'S LOT miniseries, back in the day. He will be missed.

Director Rob Zombie added via Instagram, ‚ÄúI just heard about the death of Tobe Hooper. This is really sad. I first met Tobe at the premiere of House of 1000 Corpses. He was very cool and gave me a great quote for the DVD package. Obviously, he was a big influence on that film. After that we became friends. I still remember him in his Hawaiian shirt at our Polynesian BBQ marveling at the about of monster stuff I owned. He will be missed and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre will always be one of the greatest movies ever made.‚Äù

It's rare for a filmmaker to have just their name bring a visceral reaction when said. Tobe Hooper was one of those for me. A horror master.
