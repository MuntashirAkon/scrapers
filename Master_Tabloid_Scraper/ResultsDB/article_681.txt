Kendall Jenner is in hot water with the wait staff at a famous Brooklyn bar.

According to the people at Baby’s All Right, the 21-year-old model failed to leave a tip when she went to out partying at the Williamsburg hotspot. Though the establishment didn’t necessarily call out the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star by name, they did share a photo of a receipt signed by one “Kendall N. Jenner” for a $24 bill on Instagram. (For the record: Jenner’s middle name is Nicole.)
“Don’t forget to tip your bartender,” the bar captioned along with a presumably passive aggressive smiley face.

While it’s still unconfirmed if the credit card holder in question is the reality star, internet sleuths point out the timeline fits as Kendall was spotted attending a concert in New York City Thursday and her rumored boyfriend, A$AP Rocky, performed at an album release party at Baby’s All Right that night.
The morning after, she was photographed catching a flight out of town at the John F. Kennedy Airport. Guess that bar won’t get their money now.
