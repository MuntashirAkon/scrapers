Taylor Swift Lashes Out at Kanye, Katy with 'Look What You Made Me Do' /nIt's now obvious Taylor Swift's been sharpening her lyrical knives during her hiatus -- she whipped 'em out for Katy Perry AND Kanye West in her new track,  "Look What You Made Me Do. "  Tay Tay just dropped a music video for the track, and the lyrics leave no doubt who she's attacking. She sings,  "I don't like your little games ... don't like your tilted stage " in the opening verse -- a clear reference to Kanye's last tour. Taylor also clearly refers to 'Ye calling her a bitch in,  "Famous " --  "The role you made me play of the fool ... no, I don't like you. " The 2nd verse seems to be targeting Katy for their feud over tour dancers -- and she plays off those snake teasers she's been posting. They're all over the animated music vid. The track is dripping with revenge shots like ...  "Maybe I got mine, but one day you'll get yours " and  "I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined. " It's always the quiet ones./n
