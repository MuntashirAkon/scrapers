Taylor Swift, Singer Scores Winning Verdict in Butt Grab Trial/nTaylor just issued this statement,  "I want to thank Judge William J. Martinez and the jury for their careful consideration ... [my attorneys] and anyone who feels silenced by a sexual assault, and especially anyone who offered their support through this four-year ordeal... " Taylor went on,  "I acknowledge the privilege that I benefit from in life, in society and in my ability to shoulder the enormous cost of defending myself in a trial like this. My hope is to help those whose voices should also be heard. Therefore, I will be making donations in the near future to multiple organizations that help sexual assault victims defend themselves. "  Taylor SwiftÂ just got very important new fans ... and they just unanimously gave her a huge win in her butt groping trial. The jury ruled David Mueller did indeed commit sexual assault by grabbing her butt at a meet and greet after a 2013 Denver concert. They gave her $1, which is what she was asking. The jury also ruled Taylor's mother and staff did not intentionally interfere with Mueller's employment. As we reported ... Tay filed her $1 countersuit against the former DJ on principle. Taylor was in court to hear the verdict. She hugged her mom and her attorneys. As for her mom ... she cried. Swift testified during the trial and was unmovable, calling BS on Mueller's claim that all he did was touch her rib cage. She says he latched on to her bare ass underneath her skirt. Mueller had sued Swift for defamation, claiming her allegations cost him his job. The judge threw out his case against Taylor, Friday, saying he never proved during the trial she directly made him lose his job./n
