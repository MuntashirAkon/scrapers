As part of the agreement with prosecutors, Cora was placed on three years probation with the 120 days of jail time suspended pending her successful completion of probation. She was also ordered to pay a $2,386 fine, obey all laws and not drive with any measurable amount of alcohol in her system. She must also have a valid driver's license and insurance and complete a nine-month alcohol education class.

Cora was popped for a DUI on June 17 in Santa Barbara after local law enforcement said she got into a fender-bender during which time the other driver called cops to the scene and reported that she may have been drinking.The ex-Iron Chef America star subsequently failed two Breathalyzer tests and was taken into custody. She later admitted to downing three bottles of beer before she got behind the wheel and has since paid restitution to the other driver.When she wasn't jet-setting with Around the World contestants this summer, Cora also served as a judge this past June for the 2012 Miss USA pageant.
