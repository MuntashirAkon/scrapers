Replaced! Producers To Trade Adele For Beyoncé On Next 'James Bond' Film/n
Now that it’s been confirmed that leading actor Daniel Craig, 39, will be returning to his fifth James Bond film, fans are speaking about who should perform 007’s new theme song, RadarOnline.com can report.
While Adele‘s Skyfall was a massive hit following the release of the latest 007 movie, sources have told Straight Shuter that her name isn’t even in the running this time around.
Before Adele, 29, stars such as Madonna and Alicia Keys were given the honor to record a James Bond theme song, and sources say Beyoncé, 35, could be next.
