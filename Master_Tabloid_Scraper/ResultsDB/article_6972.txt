“Lala is cool with Stassi [Schroeder], Kristen [Doute] and Katie and hung out with them in Mexico on their trip,” the source added. “Production made everyone hang out for certain moments.”
Radar reported that Maloney, 30, and Kent, 26, settled their years-long feud during the cast trip for season six.
The women were at odds since Kent was rude during Maloney’s engagement party and proceeded to “fat shame” her afterwards. Maloney retaliated by teaming up with Doute and Schroeder to reveal that Kent was allegedly dating a married man. The allegations forced Kent to quit filming midway through the season.

She also filmed with boss Lisa Vanderpump for her new dog spin-off show in April.
