Trusted Tommy Davis has been released from the business tycoon’s CPH investment company.
Davis was supposed to oversee Packer’s new casino in Las Vegas plus monitor his investment in his RatPac movie venture but the mogul is no longer involved with either project.
Packer trusted Davis who introduced him to the likes of Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes opening many doors in Hollywood but things soured when the hulking Australian started dating Mariah Carey in what turned out to be a disaster relationship.

Carey, 48, reportedly accused Davis of being one of the main causes in their relationship breakdown, which led to the couple ending their engagement.
Privately, Packer was understood to being very hurt by the public way in which their relationship ended after she embarrassed him by dating dancer Bryan Tanaka.
