"It's going to be very much what the Super Nanny does but with food," Cora says. "It's very much about dealing with the some of the neurosis and psychology of the kitchen."And speaking of Super Nanny, Cora says she and her wife Jennifer probably won't be having anymore kidsâ€”at least any time soon. "We have four boys," Cora said. "We are done. No more."But then she quickly added, " I never say, 'never,' but for now we have our hands' full."Also on Cora's plate is the upcoming gay-friendly Second Chance Prom in Mississippi. The annual event has received $20,000 donations from Green Day and the American Humanist Association this time around because of the attention around Constance McMillen, the high school senior who waged a court battle against her local school district because it bans same-sex prom dates.Lance Bass is hosting Second Chance."They've rented out an arena for it," McMillen said at the recent GLAAD Media Awards in L.A. "It's going to be huge."
