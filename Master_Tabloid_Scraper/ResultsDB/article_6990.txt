Jay Z shall now henceforth be known as JAY-Z.

Just days after welcoming newborn twins with Beyoncé, the rapper announced he will be dropping a new album under the name JAY-Z. (Please note the hyphen and caps.) Titled 4:44, Hova’s new record will be released June 30 as a Tidal exclusive.
Though his name was formatted as “JAY:Z” in a teaser for the album, a rep for Roc Nation since confirmed the return of the hyphen as well as the new capitalization of Jay Z JAY-Z’s name.
Needless to say, fans — specifically writers like yours truly — had a field day with the new name change.

Jay Z really changed his name to JAY-Z ? all caps with the hyphen? While we’re in 2017 he’s already in 2444. #BossMove

In 2013, Jay dropped the hyphen from his name after the release Watch the Throne. He continued to keep the hyphen off his moniker for Magna Carta Holy Grail.
