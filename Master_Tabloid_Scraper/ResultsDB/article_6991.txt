Sorry, Beyoncé. You’re not the highest-paid entertainer of 2017.

This year, the top honor went to Sean “Diddy” Combs, who made approximately $130 million, according to Forbes. The rapper-turned-entrepreneur reportedly knocked off Queen Bey for the No. 1 spot thanks to his earnings from his Bad Boy Family Reunion Tour and Ciroc vodka partnership, as well as selling one-third of his Sean John clothing line.
Though she wasn’t not the top-earning celebrity, Beyoncé was named 2017’s highest-paid female with a $105 million payday from Lemonade and her Formation World Tour ticket sales.

J.K. Rowling ($95 million), Drake ($94 million), and Cristiano Ronaldo ($93 million) rounded out the top five spots, while The Weeknd — who graces the cover of the latest issue — beat out Kim Kardashian ($45.5 million), Kylie Jenner ($41 million), and LeBron James ($86 million) by earning $92 million in 2017.
As for Taylor Swift, who topped Forbes’ list last year, she dropped to the No. 49 spot with an income of $44 million in 2017. The magazine noted the “Bad Blood” singer’s ranking took a 74 percent decrease after she wrapped up her 1989 World Tour.
