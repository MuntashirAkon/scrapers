Blac Chyna has a new bae — and unlike Rob Kardashian’s fake “girlfriend,” he’s actually real.

Just days after reality star Mehgan James allegedly lied about being with the sock designer for publicity, Chyna stepped out with a new man around her arm to prove to the world she’s not into fake relationships. The mom-of-two enjoyed a dinner date with hairstylist Kellon Deryck — who she claims she’s “been dating” for a while — around Los Angeles Tuesday (June 5, 2017).
“Yeah, [this is] Kellon. We’re dating,” Chyna confirmed to the paparazzi as they left the Argyle nightclub in Hollywood. “We’ve been dating.”

The 29-year-old then seemingly threw shade at Rob’s imaginary romance with Meghan, saying how she would never plant a fake story in the press for attention. She continued to explain how the paparazzi actually keep celebrities in “the game” and claimed she’ll always be honest with the press with who she dates.
“All that facade sh*t, I’m not with it,” she said. “I’m a real a** b*tch.”
Got that?
