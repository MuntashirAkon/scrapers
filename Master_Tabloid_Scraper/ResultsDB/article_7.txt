Battle Of The Divas! Inside NeNe Leakes's War With 'Fashion Police' Cast/n
Ring the alarm! NeNe Leakes is about to get read her rights by the Fashion Police cast. Less than two months after the 48-year-old former Real Housewives of Atlanta star joined the E’s style show as a special co-host, RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned that she is already wearing out her welcome.
According to a source, Leakes, 48, “was pissed off” that she was not on last week’s episode. Instead, Kardashian puppet- master Kris Jenner, 60, appeared.
“Nene has really been butting heads with everyone,” the insider said, referring to the ever-changing cast which now consists of Melissa Rivers, 45, Giuliana Rancic, 41, and Brad Goreski, 38, plus newcomer Margaret Cho, 47.

“NeNe and Melissa have not been seeing eye to eye because they are both very controlling,” the said source, adding, “Melissa also does not like the fact that NeNe takes away from Margaret Cho.”
So why is this especially bad news for Leakes?
As Radar reported two weeks ago, Leakes was recently given an ultimatum by executives at E! parent company NBC Universal, which also oversees Housewives network Bravo: Sources told Radar Leakes was warned she must return full-time to RHOA or get canned from Fashion Police.

“NeNe seems to think she is better than doing reality television and has moved on from RHOA. Going back would be a step back in her plan to become a global brand,” a separate source said previously.
