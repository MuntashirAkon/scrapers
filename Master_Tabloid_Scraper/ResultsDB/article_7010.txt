Craig had been sitting on the secret for a "couple of months," he admitted. "We've been discussing it. We've just been trying to figure things out. I always wanted to; I needed a break."Is that what he's calling it?In 2015, Craig caused controversy for saying he'd "rather slash [his] wrists" than make a fifth Bond film, a statement for which he later apologizedâ€”and Colbert brought up again. "I don't want to make excuses about it, but it was two days after I finished shooting the last movie. I went straight to an interview and someone asked, 'Would you do another one?'" Craig said. "I went, 'No!' Instead of saying something with style and grace, I gave a really stupid answer."

The next James Bond film, the 25th in the series, is slated for release in November 2019."I just want to go out on a high note," Craig said, "and I can't wait."
