Charlottesville Killer Dead Ringer for John Lennon's Killer Mark David Chapman /nIt's eerie ... the man who mowed down 20 people in Charlottesville Saturday looks very much like another killer ... Mark David Chapman. Their crimes are different for sure, but both committed monstrous acts ... you know what James Alex Fields did -- killing 1 and injuring 19 by plowing into them during the weekend rally. Â  Chapman, you'll recall, shot and killed John Lennon in 1980 after lying in wait for the former Beatle. There's no connection between the 2 ... it's just interesting./n
