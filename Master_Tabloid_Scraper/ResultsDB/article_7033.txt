LeBron James at Son's Game: 'Get In They Ass Like a Bike Without a Seat' /nLeBron James was  "that dad " at his 12-year-old son's youth basketball game this weekend -- talking mess from the sidelines and telling his kid to get in his opponents' ass,  "like a bike without a seat. " It all went down at an AAU tournament in Vegas where Bronny's team -- the North Coast Blue Chips -- were taking on the Utah Elite ... and LeBron wasn't happy with the way things were going.  You can hear James say,  "Don't care about sportsmanship? " -- but it's unclear why. He then yells out to the players,  "Get in they ass like a bike without a seat. " Toward the end of the game, someone shouts back at LeBron -- and it sounds like the NBA superstar responds by mumbling an n-bomb under his breath. One person who was there tells us there's no real issue --  "LeBron was cool. No problems. " As for the game, we're told the Blue Chips won handily. /n
