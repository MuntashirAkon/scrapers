Taylor Swift's Album Reputation Drops On The 10th Anniversary Of Kanye West's Mom's Death â€” & People Are PISSED!/n

If this isn't a coincidence, it's a SAVAGE marketing strategy.
As you may've heard, Taylor Swift's sixth studio album, titled Reputation, is set to drop on November 10. Obviously, the L.P. announcement had tongues waggin' â€” but not for the reason you think.

It appears as though Reputation's drop date falls directly on the 10-year anniversary of Kanye West's mother's untimely death. In case you forgot, Donda West passed away on November 10 in 2007 due to complications from cosmetic surgery. Oh man.
Now, November 10 DOES fall on a Friday this year, and Fridays are preferred for big music releases. Still, we find it inneresting that Tay's team decided to release her album on day that means SO MUCH to her nemesis. We mean, Yeezus' breakdown last year coincided with the anniversary of Donda's passing.
Understandably, stans on Twitter have voiced their disdain for the release date decision. They wrote:

Taylor Swift releasing her album on the anniversary of Donda Westâ€™s death is an objectively ugly, trash thing to do.

Taylor scheduling REPUTATION's release for the 10th anniversary of Donda Westâ€™s death is such an egregious and disgusting miscalculation

I'm gonna let this sink in. Taylor Swift is releasing an album on the date of Donda West's passing. What fucking filth. Fucking. Filth.

Oof.
While we'd like to give Taylor the benefit of the doubt, it appears as though she is waging all out war on West. 'Ye has wife Kim Kardashian West to thank for that!
