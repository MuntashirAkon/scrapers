Another one of R. Kelly’s alleged victims has come forward to speak out her abusive relationship with the singer.

A woman named Jerhonda Pace has broken her silence and revealed she was in an illegal relationship with R. Kelly in a new investigative piece. Explaining how she met the R&B superstar outside of court during his 2008 child pornography trial when she was just 16, Pace claims she had underage sex with Kelly before she was abused and forced to keep her mouth shut.
Via Revolt TV:
Pace says she began her relationship with Kelly when she was 16, one year below the age of consent in the U.S. state of Illinois where the incident took place. She broke off contact with Kelly after an incident in which she claims: “I was slapped and I was choked and I was spit on” by the singer.

Although Pace, now 24, signed a nondisclosure agreement about her relationship with Kelly in exchange for a settlement, she said she feels the need to tell her story in hopes of helping any women who are still associated with the singer. “If I can speak out and I can help them get out of that situation, that’s what I will do,” she stated. “He’s brainwashed them really bad, and it kind of reminds me of Charles Manson.”
