Prince William, Kate Middleton and Prince Harry all gathered outside the Westminster Abbey on Wednesday (Apr. 5, 2017) to pay tribute to the four people killed during the London terror attack last month.

Attending on behalf of the entire royal family, the trio laid a wreath with a handwritten message reading: “For PC Keith Palmer, and all those who have served our community so valiantly. Your legacy is our way of life. William.”
During the multi-faith service, William also read a bible passage from the Gospel of Luke. Meanwhile, the Duchess of Cambridge and Harry lit candles in remembrance of the lives that were lost.
The memorial took place just two weeks after Khalid Masood drove a vehicle into a crowd of people at the Westminster Bridge before fatally stabbing a police constable near the Houses of Parliament. Several surviving victims from the incident also attended the service.
Previously, William met with the London Ambulance Service paramedics who treated injured victims. His father, Prince Charles, later visited patients in King’s College Hospital following the attack.
