Prince Charles had quite the fright while in Scotland recently, according to reports. The famous royal was driving his car, an Audi, through the Queen Elizabeth II's Balmoral Estate over the weekend when he collided with a deer. While the state of the deer is still unknown, reports indicate the prince was left shaken but thankfully unharmed following the collision.A source told The Mirror that encounters with the animal are common in northern Scotland, adding, "Charles is a careful driver but sometimes they dash out on the road and there's little you can do."

The royal family is currently wrapping up the summer season with their annual vacation to their home away from home. Prince Charles joined the queen in early September for their yearly visit to the country's Braemar Highland Games, where they were photographed having an absolute blast watching the sporting events. Prince William, Kate Middleton and their two children were also visiting the estate's grounds at the time of Charles' crash, as well as the Duchess of Cambridge's parents, Carole and Michael Middleton. William and his princess are currently gearing up for their departure to Canada on Sept. 24, where they will embark on an eight-day tour of the country with Prince George and Princess Charlotte.  This will be the first time that Charlotte, 16 months, has been on a royal tour with her parents.Wishing every member of the royal family a safe, deer-less week ahead!
