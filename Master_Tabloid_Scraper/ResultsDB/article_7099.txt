LaVar Ball Fires Back at Michael Jordan, 'I'll Beat You With 1 Arm' /nLaVar Ball ain't backin' down from Michael Jordan -- saying he's STILL confident he'd crush MJ in 1-on-1 even if he had 1 arm tied behind his back.  The Big Baller attacked LaVar at his basketball camp earlier this week, saying,  "I don't think he could beat me even if I was 1-legged. "  Ball's response?   "I could beat him with 1 hand tied behind my back with some glasses on with one eye lens out with some flips flops on in the rain. " There's more ... LaVar also goes after Shaq's diss track -- blasting the dude as old and irrelevant.   Then it's on to Charles Barkley ... saying Chuck was talkin' out his ass when he said Lonzo and the Lakers aren't a playoff team. Enjoy ... /n
