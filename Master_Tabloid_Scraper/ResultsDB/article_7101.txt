Kanye West, Tom Cruise and Justin Bieber's Unclaimed Money/nJustin Bieber, Kanye West, Tom Cruise ﻿and Mel Gibson﻿ are so busy making money they don't have time for scooping up what they consider chump change and what we consider to be a bonanza. Kanye: $1,886 -- from PayPal, Foot Locker and insurance money. Tom Cruise: $1,324 -- from Paramount Pictures, Charles Schwab and others. Caitlyn Jenner: $3,892 -- from Foot Locker and insurance money. Mel Gibson: $216 -- from AAA, Blue Cross and AMCO. Justin Bieber: $19 -- from PayPal (hey, enough for a nice lunch). Credit Karma's got a feature to check unclaimed dough, so it's clearly the place to go to cash in ... unless  you're just that rich that it doesn't matter./n
