Charles Barkley: If I Saw Racist Fan, 'I Would Put an End to That Sh*t' /nCharles Barkley says he's very disappointed in the people AROUND the racist fan who hurled the N-word at Adam Jones ... saying he if saw anyone being racist,  "I would put an end to that sh*t. " Barkley was out in NYC when we asked about the situation in Boston -- where a fan at Fenway Park hurled racial taunts at the Baltimore Orioles star.   "It should never happen, " Barkley says ...  "but I'm disappointed in the fans who were around those people saying those things. " Barkley essentially says it's up to others to stand up for what's right -- and that's what he would do.  By the way, this is just the beginning of Barkley's foray into racial issues --  he's launching a new show on TNT called  "American Race " later this month ... and he's not holding back.  In fact, Barkley gave us a teaser and said one of the issues he's most passionate about is the mistreatment of Muslims in the United States. /n
