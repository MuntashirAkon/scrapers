The distraught girlfriend of bodybuilder Dallas McCarver has shared a personal tribute to her bodybuilder boyfriend, just hours after he reportedly choked to death on some food.
“Aug 22 the lord received another angel, who happens 2 (sic) be my life – Dallas was the only one who understood me,” WWE Diva Dana Brooke wrote on Instagram.

The 26-year-old was found unconscious and unresponsive Tuesday morning at his home in Boca Raton, Fla. He was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead.
“Dallas was an exceptional body builder, but I didn’t see him for that,” Brooke continued. “I saw him for him and his heart! He is the best individual I have ever met– my ying to my yang.. finished my sentences and knew what I was thinking before I’d say it!”
Police in Boca Raton, Fla., where McCarver lived, are now awaiting the medical examiner’s report for the exact cause of death, but no foul play is suspected.
