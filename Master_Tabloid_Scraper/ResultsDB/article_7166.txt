He explained, "Not only does The Duchess of Cambridge have to worry about what she is wearing in public, but she has to dress her own children and find a balance between royal tradition and heritage and more proletariat customs, such as the 'suburban' habit of making young boys wear trousers."Hanson claimed this dates back to the 16th century tradition of "breeching," during which newborn boys would wear a dress for the first few years of their lives as they were being potty trained. Once they were breeched, they would switch to shorts, which signified the very important time in boys' lives. By the age of 8, they would then switch into pants or trousers."Shorts on young boys is one of those silent British class markers that deliberately harks back to a bygone age," Hanson added. "British upper classes—and particularly royals—are especially keen to hold on to tradition so this sartorial one will silently mark them out from 'the rest.'"
