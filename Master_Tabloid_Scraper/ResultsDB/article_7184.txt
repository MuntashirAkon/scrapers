LeBron James: Trump Made Hate Fashionable Again/nTwo NBA superstars are going off on Donald Trump -- LeBron James and Steve Nash -- trashing POTUS over the comments he made about anti-racist protesters in Charlottesville.   "Hate has always existed in America. Yes we know that but Donald Trump just made it fashionable again, " Bron posted ...  "Statues has nothing to do with us now! " James is responding to Trump's news conference Tuesday in which he said alt-left protesters were also to blame for the violence in Virginia. He made a specific reference to protesters removing a statue of Robert E. Lee.  "This week, it is Robert E Lee, " Trump said ...  "I noticed that Stonewall Jackson's coming down. I wonder is it George Washington next week and is it Thomas Jefferson the week after? " Trump then mentioned that he owned a winery in Charlottesville ... and that set off Steve Nash.   "To defend white supremacists and then slang his sh*tty ass grape juice pretty much sums the man up. " LeBron has been ripping Trump for months -- and just this weekend wore a red hat to spoof Trump's  "Make America Great Again " fashion line./n
