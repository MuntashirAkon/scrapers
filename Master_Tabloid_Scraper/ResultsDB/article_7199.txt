William Shatner Becomes Bunny Rabbit Handler on 'Better Late Than Never'/nWilliam Shatner may have explored new worlds where no man has gone before, but now he's in Sweden ... running around with rabbits. The legendary  "Star Trek " actor is in Stockholm shooting for his new comedy /reality show  "Better Late Than Never " ... and showed off his skills as a bunny handler. Spoiler alert -- he wasn't great at it. Rabbit show jumping is big in Sweden -- kind of like the Westminster Dog Show in the U.S. Shatner and his fellow cultural icons on the show --Â Henry Winkler, Terry Bradshaw and George Foreman -- all took part in the rabbit racing and looked like they had a blast. As usual, host Jeff Dye was their guide./n
