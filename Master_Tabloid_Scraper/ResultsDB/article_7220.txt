In addition to Kendra and Patti, the other famously dysfunctional families that are fighting to fix their relationships include a roundup of reality TV icons: Mike “The Situation” Sorrentino, 34, and his brothers, Marc and Frank Jr., Teen Mom OG star, Farrah Abraham, 25, and parents, Michael and Debra Abraham, as well as Ochocinco: The Ultimate Catch star, Chad “Ochocinco” Johnson, 38, and mom, Paula Johnson.
As Radar previously reported, Abraham’s mom, at least, already has raves for the experience.
“It was an opportunity that was too good to pass on. To be able to look at the difficulties we had and to do in an intense way was really important,” Farrah’s mom, Debra, said told Radr Farrah’s father, Michael, added that the family is “doing excellent” now!
