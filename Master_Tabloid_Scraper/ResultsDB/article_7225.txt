Donald Trump Had The Most Bi-Polar Reaction To Boston's Failed Free Speech Rally Today!/n

Our great country has been divided for decades. Sometimes you need protest in order to heal, & we will heal, & be stronger than ever before!

I want to applaud the many protestors in Boston who are speaking out against bigotry and hate. Our country will soon come together as one!
