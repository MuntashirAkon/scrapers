Miguel feels very strongly about... Miguel.The pop-R&B crooner—who lost out to Frank Ocean in 2013 for Best Urban Contemporary Album at the Grammys and then famously didn't join in the standing ovation when Ocean's name was called—apparently still feels that the Recording Academy got it wrong."I wouldn't say we were friends," Miguel, whose "Adorn" did win the Grammy for Best R&B Song that year, said in a recent interview with London's Sunday Times, calling his relationship with Ocean "cordial" at best.

"To be completely honest—and no disrespect to anyone—I genuinely believe that I make better music, all the way around."Miguel added, "It's interesting, but we'll see who's in it for the long haul. It's like a marathon, you know?"Well, he's certainly entitled to his opinion. The 29-year-old's third studio album, Wildheart, just dropped on June 30 and fans are eating it up with a spoon.

Ocean, meanwhile, received rave reviews for 2012's Channel Orange, which in addition to Best Urban Contemporary Album was nominated for Album of the Year, but what will be his second studio album is finally supposed to be out this month.He told BBC's Radio 1 back in 2013 that he was "10, 11 songs" into his follow-up, which he described as "bordering on a concept record again.""At the end of Channel Orange, there's 'Golden Girl,' and it's this beach scene," Ocean said. "And I kind of want it to extend that feel into the next record all together, kind of make it that theme."No time like the summer time then! And perhaps his album, called Boys Don't Cry, will be all the response to Miguel that's necessary.
