Singer, songwriter…model?That's right, for his latest gig Frank Ocean has stepped in front of the camera to star in Band of Outsiders ongoing Polaroid series for the brand's spring 2013 campaign.Armed with the old-school camera, the brand's creative director, Scott Sternberg, took to the top of the Los Angeles Times building to shoot the Grammy winner, who looks pretty dapper in the brand's sharply tailored suit.

We can't say we're surprised the company tapped Ocean to don its latest collection. Remember how effortlessly edgy he looked in the brand's bold yellow tux during his performance at the 2013 Grammys? Ocean definitely caught our eye in the boldly hued ensemble, and it seems Band of Outsiders was also paying close attention. Ocean joins the likes of Amy Adams, Josh Brolin, Kirsten Dunst and Michelle Williams, who have also struck a pose for the clothing company's Polaroid series.Like Ocean's shots?
