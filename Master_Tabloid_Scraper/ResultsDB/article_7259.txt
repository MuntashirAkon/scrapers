Brad Pitt Inspires Frank Ocean Performance at FYF Fest/nBrad Pitt is so big of a Frank Ocean fan ... he co-starred Saturday night in the singer's set at FYF Fest. This video's pretty cool ... as Frank launched into his version of  "Never Can Say Goodbye " by the Jackson 5, Brad appeared in the giant video screens. It looked like a pre-recorded clip of him listening to the performance on a phone ... although, he might have been listening live. At the end of the song, Frank says,  "This is for our good friend. " Brad's recently called out Frank's music ... saying it's helped him cope through the break-up with Angelina Jolie.Â /n
