7 of 9Although Joseph reportedly wasn't with Schwarzenneger and his four kids from Shriver on Father's Day, the actor recently Instagrammed a message to his boy to celebrate his 19th birthday, writing, "Happy birthday, Joseph. Great student, great athlete. I'm proud of you and I love you!"Photo credit: BACKGRID8 of 9Joseph has been seen riding bikes with his dad. His birth was kept a secret from the public for 14 years. Shriver allegedly confronted Schwarzenegger about Joseph's uncanny appearance to Arnold in 2011, ending their long marriage. The star's love child grew up in the low-key community of Bakersfield, Calif., but has lately been seen near his dad's Malibu stomping grounds.

9 of 9Joseph isn't shy about his body! Last year, as Radar reported, Joseph was also seen shirtless on the beach in Malibu. Schwarzenegger claimed to 60 Minutes that he didn't know Joseph was his son until he was about 7 or 8 and the resemblance became obvious.
