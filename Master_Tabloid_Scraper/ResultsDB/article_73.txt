Hillary Clinton -- Rips GOP for $10 Bill Gaffe ... Then Makes Her Own (VIDEO)/nHillary Clinton opened the door ... pouncing on the Republican candidates for weak suggestions on which woman should grace the new $10 bill, but you gotta see how she answers when we put the question to her. Clinton was doing the candidate thing -- signing autographs Sunday in Georgetown when our man Colin asked if Maya Angelou should be in the running. Her response:  "I was sort of amazed that the Republicans couldn't think of one American woman. " Not entirely accurate -- there were a couple nods for Rosa Parks and Susan B. Anthony, but yeah ... they also said Margaret Thatcher and Mother Teresa. But then Clinton added,  "I could give them a really long list if they're interested. " Alright, door's wide open, sooo ... watch what happens when Colin asks for that list.  Lotsa crickets in D.C. this time o' year./n
