The wait is almost over. The music video for Taylor Swift and Zayn Malik’s collaboration, “I Don’t Wanna Live Forever,” will debut on Friday at midnight.

To get you all worked up before the big premiere, the two singers have dropped a preview clip to the visuals — and it pretty much looks like a “Blank Space” outtake. Though everything is a little less tongue-in-cheek and more moody, it’s clear that the upcoming video shares the same tropes as the Joseph Kahn one.

Dish-smashing? Check.
Lacy lingerie? Check.
Angst Swift? Check check check.

As previously reported, the song is from the Fifty Shades Darker soundtrack.
In December, a lyric video for the track was released alongside clips from the upcoming erotic movie. Earlier this week, Swift teased the video with a simple screenshot showing her and Malik basked in the glow of a scarlet light. (Maybe as a reference to the Red Room of Pain?)
Here’s hoping there aren’t any awkward sex scenes in the video. After all, Malik is dating Swift’s BFF Gigi Hadid at the moment.
