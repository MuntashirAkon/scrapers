Andrew Garfield admitted that he still has love for his ex-girlfriend, Emma Stone.
The couple may have ended their relationship last year, but that doesn’t mean they don’t love each other anymore. During a new interview with The Hollywood Reporter, the Hacksaw Ridge star was asked which actor or actress he would bring with him if he was stuck on a desert island.

“Emma Stone. I love Emma,” he answered without hesitation. “She’s all right. She can come.” So what does this mean for the exes? The last time they were spotted together was back in August, so perhaps they haven’t closed the book on their relationship just yet.
In any case, we think Garfield made a wise choice. Jeff Bridges, Casey Affleck, Dev Patel, Mahershala Ali and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who said he would bring Orson Welles to the desert island with him, were also present at the THR roundtable.
