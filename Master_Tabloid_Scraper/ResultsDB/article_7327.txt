Edyta Sliwinska is a mom again!
The former Dancing with the Stars pro gave birth to a baby girl named Leia Josephine Mazo — her second child with husband Alec Mazo — on Sunday, June 18, Sliwinska’s rep confirms to PEOPLE exclusively. Born at 7:08 p.m., little Leia weighed in at 7 lbs. and measured 20 inches long.
“The new family of four are over the moon and absolutely in love with their little princess,” the rep tells PEOPLE.
Sliwinska, 36, and Mazo are also parents to 3½-year-old son Michael Alexander, whom they welcomed into the world in January 2014.
Turns out Michael is actually responsible for his little sister’s moniker. “He picked the name and insisted for months that it would be baby Leia,” says the rep.
