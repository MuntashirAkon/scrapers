Danish model Josephine Skriver officially got her wings in 2016 when she was announced as the newest Victoria’s Secret Angel, joining fellow top-tier Angels including Adriana Lima, Alessandra Ambrosio and Lily Aldridge — and the star hasn’t slowed down since.
The 24-year-old model has walked in the iconic Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show consecutively since 2013, but most recently, she’s spreading the word about her favorite new scent, Victoria’s Secret new Bombshell summer fragrance, which she plans on spritzing on herself all summer long.

“It’s a really lighthearted fragrance that’s fruity and floral. From the moment you smell it, you’re like OK, this is definitely a fragrance that you want to wear with a cute sandal and sundress,” Skriver told PeopleStyle. “It’s a scent that you just want to have fun in!”

“I might be guilty of being an over-sprayer! I can’t help it. When I find something I love, I want to spritz it on so it lasts throughout the day,” she said.
And while she’s not an expert with fragrances, she is one of the top posers in the world. Below Skriver spills some of her style and beauty secrets.
Her best posing tips are from Instagram.

“Find the best light possible. And find a simple backdrop so you can focus on the look and not everything that’s going on behind you.”

When in doubt, work out. 
“Sometimes, I don’t have time to go to the gym, but when I’m home in New York, I head over to the Dogpound where my trainer combines strength training and cardio movements. On a good week, I work out every morning around 6am. I’m an early riser!”

There’s still a few beauty products she won’t stop buying (even though she gets sent so many!). 
“Coconut oil, Dr. Hauschka and Proactiv. They’re still part of my daily routines.”
She keeps her weekend wardrobe minimal. 
“I definitely wear cut-off shorts, a t-shirt, a bralette and sneakers. I’m try to be as comfortable as possible when I don’t have to get all dressed up for an event.”

SPF is her BFF. 
“I try to be really careful in the sun during the summer months. I have the luxury of traveling to sunny places all year around for work, so I don’t ever have that first time shock to the skin, but I definitely make sure to have some protection — a baseball hat to block the sun from my face and lots of water to make sure I’m hydrating from the inside out. I like using Sun Bum SPF because it’s organic and smells good.”

She still gets giddy around celebrities.
“The OG Angels like Tyra [Banks], Gisele [Bündchen], Heidi [Klum] and even Adriana [Lima] make me star struck!”
