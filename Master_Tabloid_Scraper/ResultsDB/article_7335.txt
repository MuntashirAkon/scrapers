Who Is Joseph Gordon-Levitt?/n
One child in four grows up not knowing how to read, but back in 1997, Joseph Gordon-Levitt put to rest all the outrageous rumors about the literacy rate of children who play aliens on TV! He pulled this off single-handedly with one sunny appearance on celebrity Jeopardy!. Subsequently, he proved to the world that he didn't have to be an actor; he could have easily become a professor of literature, or a back-up vocalist for Hanson. In fact, he rose to the occasion with such undeniable enthusiasm, his hero might call him a phony.
