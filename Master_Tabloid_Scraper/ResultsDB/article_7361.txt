'You'll Never Be Forgotten'/nLeBron James just posted a goodbye letter to Lauren Hill -- the 19-year-old college basketball player who died from brain cancer -- explaining how she deeply impacted his life ... even though they never met.  Lauren's story became national news ... when she realized her dream to play for the Mount St. Joseph women's hoops team back in November while battling an inoperable brain tumor.  At the time, James said Hill was  "truly amazing " and an inspiration -- and now, with news of her passing, he penned an emotional farewell letter.   "Dear Lauren Hill, You are the true definition of strength, courage, power, leadership, etc etc!
