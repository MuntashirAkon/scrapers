NFL's Joseph Randle Arrested At Kansas Casino ... 'Assaulted Cop' /nEx-Dallas Cowboys running back Joseph Randle was arrested outside of a Kansas casino last night ... after he was told to leave and went berserk on cops on the way out ... TMZ Sports has learned.  We've confirmed ... 23-year-old Randle was arrested at 10:40 PM in front of the Kansas Star Casino in Mulvane, KS.  Sources at the casino tell us he was initially asked to leave for being too drunk -- but on the way out, spit on the floor and assaulted a security officer.  He was ultimately taken into custody and transported to a nearby jail on several charges -- including felony criminal threats, misdemeanor assault of a law enforcement officer, interference with a law enforcement officer, battery, disorderly conduct and criminal trespass. Randle was being held on $25,000 bail, but he's since been released ... as photographed by KSN News in Kansas.  We spoke with Fred Waller -- an enforcement agent with the Kansas Gaming and Racing Commission -- who tells us Randle was belligerent on the casino floor and was asked to leave.  Waller says Randle initially left ... but then returned to the casino. He was confronted by a KGRC agent ... but instead of obeying the officer, Randle tried to fight him.  Other agents jumped in and took Randle into custody. He'll most likely be banned from the casino.  Randle has a history of legal issues -- he's on unsupervised probation in Texas for stealing underwear and cologne from a department store.  He was cut from the Cowboys earlier this season -- after Jerry Jones said he was concerned about Randle's mental health. /n
