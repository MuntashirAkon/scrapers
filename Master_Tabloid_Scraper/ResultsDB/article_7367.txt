As Radar previously reported, Bailey and Thomas called it quits in 2016 after six years of marriage.
“Marriage is hard,” the reality star told OKMagazine.com at the time. “I think it’s definitely difficult when it’s long distance relationship, and at this point, it is a long distance relationship.”
Before their split, cheating rumors sparked, after a video leaked of Thomas heavily flirting with another woman.

Thomas was then said to be dating much-younger actress, Love & Hip-Hop guest star Sina Bina. In an Instagram post, she claimed they had know each other for years, and were just friends.
Thomas confirmed during a RHOA reunion that he had a new girl he liked “a whole lot” — yet refused to reveal her name.
Meanwhile, Bailey, 50, said she would be focusing on herself after the separation. “I am definitely taking some time to myself to figure out how I want to move forward. I don’t want to rush into anything, so I think this time apart is good for us.”
