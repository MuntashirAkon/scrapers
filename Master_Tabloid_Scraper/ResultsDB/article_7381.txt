Thomas Dekker Comes Out As Gay, Reveals He's Married: 'I Could Not Be Happier'/n
Heroes actor Thomas Dekker just posted a revealing statement on social media saying he is gay and married, RadarOnline.com can reveal.
“My sexual orientation once again came into question this week when a prominent gay man used an awards acceptance speech to ‘out’ me. While he did not mention me by name, the explicit details of his reference made it easy for the public and media to connect the dots,” Dekker wrote on Twitter.
He added in the shocking statement: “While it is an odd situation, I thank him because it presents a prime opportunity for me to publicly say that I am indeed a man who proudly loves other men. In fact, this April, I married my husband and I could not be happier.”

He said: “I have never lied to the press about the fluidity of my sexuality but this man claiming that I came out is not true. Because I have not ‘officially’ until this moment. I simply refuse to be robbed of the glorious joy that belongs to me.”
He then added that he is not ashamed of his sexuality, and it fills him with honor to finally say the words that he has been holding back.

“To say the words myself. ‘I’m gay’. Those words are a badge of honor that no one can steal. Sexuality and who you love is a deeply personal and complicated thing. For some of us, it takes time to cultivate, discover and conclude. It is not something anyone should ever be ashamed of and certainly not something anyone should be rushed into,” he said.
As Radar can report, Fuller claimed during a recent event that a gay heroes star was told by his managers to refrain from coming out as gay, because it might influence his position on Hollywood. He was, of course, referring to Dekker.
The brave actor concluded his confession by writing: “Be proud of who you are. No matter how long it takes.”
