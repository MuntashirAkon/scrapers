Four Confederate Statues Removed In Baltimore Overnight (& Unannounced!) ‚Äî Twitter Celebrates!/n

Good morning, Baltimore!!!
ICYMI on Monday, the Baltimore City Council voted to immediately take down four statues of Confederate soldiers and leaders ‚Äî and Tuesday night, Mayor Catherine Pugh wasted no time fulfilling that promise!
In the dead of night early on Wednesday morning, the city removed Confederate monuments including those of Robert E. Lee, Thomas. J. "Stonewall" Jackson, and Roger B. Taney (who declared in 1857 that slaves weren't U.S. citizens).
Laters!

Obviously, this all comes after violence erupted in Charlottesville over the weekend over the removal of the city's monument of Lee ‚Äî a rally which tragically took the life of 32-year-old Heather Heyer, who died after a white supremacist plowed his car into a crowd of counter-protestors.
Pugh said of her decision to act fast: 
"It's done. They needed to come down."
Ch-ch-check out all the praise the city of Baltimore is receiving (below)!!

Shout out to the Baltimore City Council for voting to remove all of the confederate memorials so quickly. Let your actions be an example.
