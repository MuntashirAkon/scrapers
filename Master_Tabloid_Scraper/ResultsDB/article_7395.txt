Andrew Lincoln appears at Keira Knightley’s door (again) with signs to incite a conversation about his beard. Bill Nighy’s character, Billy Mack, reveals that the best sex of his life was with “one of the Kardashians,” but he can’t remember which one. Meanwhile, Rufus, played by Rowan Atkinson, takes his job as a jelly bean scooper very seriously, but maybe too seriously.
