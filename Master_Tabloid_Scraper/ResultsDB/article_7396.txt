Paris Jackson and her brother Prince are now permanently bound in body ink.

Paris shared a photo of her and her brother’s yin and yang tattoos on Instagram on Monday (Mar. 27, 2017) and thoroughly explained their significance in the caption.
Yin, Paris’s tattoo, represents the “passive female principle of the universe, characterized as female and sustaining and associated with structure, night, the moon, fluidity, calmness, the earth, darkness, cold, death, and ascends energy” in Chinese philosophy, according to her research. Yang, Prince’s tattoo, represents “the active male principle of the universe, characterized as male and creative and associated with function, the sky and sun, speed, expression, heaven, heat, light, birth, and descends energy.”
“Sometimes I feel like my big brother and I always think the same thoughts, he just doesn’t have a filter and always vocalizes them,” writes Paris. “though total opposites, like my gooko and I, the inseparable yin and yang work together finding and causing balance within each other. Matchies with my bestie @princejackson! ❤️”
