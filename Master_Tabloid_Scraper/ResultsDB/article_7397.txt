It’s time for Prince George to sharpen his pencils as he’ll officially be attending Thomas’s Battersea come September.

Ben Thomas, the Headmaster at Thomas’s Battersea, announced on Friday that his institution is “honored and delighted that Their Royal Highnesses The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have chosen Thomas’s Battersea for Prince George.”
“We greatly look forward to welcoming him and all of our new pupils to the school in September,” Thomas added in his statement.
In January 2016, George began attending nursery school at Westacre Montessori School in Norfolk, but only when his family was actively residing in their Norfolk home. His education at Westacre only cost $49 per day, but each term at Thomas Battersea will cost $7,975.

According to the school’s website, the institution serves students ages 4-13 and the program is structured in three, three-year stages, though students can choose to depart at age 11. Thomas Battersea’s biggest rule is to “be kind.”
“We place a greater emphasis on a set of core values, which include kindness, courtesy, confidence, humility and learning to be givers, not takers,” reads Thomas’s statement on the website. “We hope that our pupils will leave this school with a strong sense of social responsibility, set on a path to become net contributors to society and to flourish as conscientious and caring citizens of the world.”
A notable alumna of the school is Cara Delevingne.
