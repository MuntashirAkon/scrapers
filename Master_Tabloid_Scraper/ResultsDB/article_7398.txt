After waiting with bated breath, fans are finally getting the first look at the upcoming Love Actually reunion special.

Featuring Andrew Lincoln, Keira Knightley, Hugh Grant, Liam Neeson, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Thomas Brodie-Sangster and more, the first full-length trailer brings back the 2003 flick’s famous cue cards as the cast asks, “Which one of us has aged best?”
Set years after the events from the rom-com classic, the highly-anticipated follow-up was created as part of 2017’s Red Nose Day campaign, an annual charity telethon dedicated to raising funds for children living in poverty. The short film will premiere on BBC One in the U.K. on March 24.
Much of the original lineup are set to returning, including Colin Firth, Bill Nighy and Rowan Atkinson. As previously reported, Emma Thompson bowed out of the project as she felt it was “too sad” and “too soon” to revisit her role following the death of her dear friend and onscreen husband, Alan Rickman.
“I would never have dreamt of writing a sequel to Love Actually, but I thought it might be fun to do 10 minutes to see what everyone is now up to,” Richard Curtis, one of screenwriters for the first movie, said in a press release. “We hope to make something that’ll be fun — very much in the spirit of the original film and of Red Nose Day.”
