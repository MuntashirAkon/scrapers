They allege the  "fake " was sold for several thousands of dollars.White is suing Howell and The Gallery HB -- in Huntington Beach, CA -- for more than $5 million in damages.Howell actually fired the first shot in this legal war when she sued White ... claiming he sent thugs to force her to sign an agreement returning his artwork and copyrights. Howell's attorney has said she only signed  "out of fear for her life. " White denies that accusation -- and his lawsuit specifically asks the court to declare the signed agreement valid./n
