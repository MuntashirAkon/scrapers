Though Lady Gaga is dating again, Taylor Kinney’s relationship status is another story.

The Chicago Fire star, who ended his engagement with the “Million Reasons” singer last summer after more than five years together, revealed that he’s more focused on work than his love life with these days.
“My dating life is through Chicago Fire,” the 35-year-old told Entertainment Tonight while promoting his NBC show. “I live vicariously through my character.”
While he may not be actively looking for romance, he added that he’s open for anything.

“I don’t think I have a type. I think it’s more of an energy,” he explained of his dream girl. “I think of compatibility as the intangibles of something, and someone that you meet and connect with, and someone you can laugh with, and maybe share a [similar] sense of humor, then things go from there.”
Following his split with Gaga, Kinney was briefly linked to Alanna DiGiovanni, a former waitress who works in the radiology department at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia. At the time, the couple were said to be “head over heels” for each other.
Gaga, 30, is now dating CAA talent agent Christian Carino. Earlier this month, the two were spotted kissing during a date night out in West Hollywood.
