This Sweet Southern Charm Sneak Peek of Thomas Ravenel and Kathryn Dennis Actually Getting Along Might Make You Emotional/n
Quick, run to your window and look outside. Are pigs flying?We ask because in the exclusive video above from Southern Charm's all-new episode, airing tonight, Thomas Ravenel and Kathryn Dennis are in the same room. By choice. Laughing. Smiling. Getting along. Yes, miracles really do happen.The former couple reunites in tonight's episode of the Bravo reality hit for a mommy-daughter photo shoot, with Thomas adoringly watching on as Kathryn poses with Kensington Calhoun Ravenel.And it becomes quite the emotional experience for Kathryn, who lost custody of Kensie, 3, and their one-year-old son, St. Julien Rembert, after failing a drug test. 

Also giving us hope that Thomas and Kathryn's relationship may finally be on solid ground is a recent Twitter photo of the two of them enjoying lunch together, posted by The Gentry Bar and Room restaurant in Charleston.Southern Charm airs Mondays at 9 p.m. on Bravo.(E! and Bravo are both part of the NBCUniversal family)
