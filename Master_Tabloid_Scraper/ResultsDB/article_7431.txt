Bucks Owner's Daughter: 'I Wanna Buy the Knicks!' (Dad Can Keep the Bucks)/nThe smokin' hot daughter of Bucks co-owner Wes Edens is shootin' HIGH with her NBA future ... saying she's gunnin' to own the most valuable team in the league!! Spoiler -- it's not the Bucks (sorry, dad). “I wanna buy the Knicks one day, " Mallory Edens ﻿told TMZ Sports when we saw her in L.A. Our photog asked if she was gonna try and trade the franchises in a Kyrie-for-IT-level blockbuster ... but she wasn't having none of that.  “I don’t need to swap -- my dad can keep the Bucks.” Ouch. In her defense ... the Knicks are worth a lot more -- Forbes says they're valued at $3.3 BILLION! In all seriousness, Mallory told us she wants to be a trailblazer for women in the NBA and sports in general ... and we think she can do it. I mean, she can basically spell Giannis Antetokounmpo﻿. Pretty impressive./n
