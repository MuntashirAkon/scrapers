'Dukes of Hazzard' Star Tom Wopat Charged with Sticking Finger In Woman's Butt Crack /nTom Wopat allegedly grabbed a woman's butt and put his finger between her butt cheeks, and that's why he was arrested for felony indecent assault. According to the police report, obtained by TMZ, Wopat was rehearsing his show,  "42nd Street, " at the Reagle Theatre in Waltham, MA on July 23 when a woman on the set claims he walked behind her and she felt his hand grab her butt.
