Chris Paul And James Harden Get First Run Together As Rockets Teammates /nClose your eyes, Clippers fans ... here's the first footage of James Harden & Chris Paul hooping together since CP3 joined the Rockets, and the guys look pretty freakin' good together. The game went down in L.A., and Paul and Harden weren't the only NBA guys playing -- they were joined by Rockets teammate Trevor Ariza and NBA champion JaVale McGee. It's a pretty sick video uploaded by YouBall Training honchos Thomas Scott and Anthony Davis (not that one). Ready to call 'em a superteam yet?      The ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€are Lit ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥already! @jharden13 @cp3 #youballtraining #houstonrockets @bleacherreport #chrispaul #jamesharden @hoopshypeofficial #cp3 @espn #rednation A post shared by Thomas Scott (@youballtraining) on Jul 25, 2017 at 9:44pm PDT/n
