The competition — which goes viral every year — usually attracts smaller dogs that compete for a $1,500 prize and a big, flashy trophy, but it's Martha who was crowned the winner this time!
All 125 pounds of this three-year-old pup were on display at the Sonoma-Marin Fair in Petaluma, California yesterday afternoon, and she went all the way to the finals — and won!!!
her backstory is just as inspiring:  her owner, Shirley Zindler, calls her "125 pounds of drooling, snoring, gassy, loud and silly girl," and Martha nearly went blind from neglect early in her life before Zindler rescued her from a shelter.
Martha underwent surgery to improve her eyesight, and now, she's the top dog with $1,500 and a huge trophy to her name!!
Congrats, Martha!!!
