The $20 will also include a lunch and meet and greet with Jessa.
Jessa’s husband Ben Seewald and sons Spurgeon and Henry unfortunately won’t be in attendance, as “men, infants and children under the age of 9 will be regretfully ineligible to attend.”
But not all fans will be in attendance, as the mother-of-two was slammed for charging for the event.

“Being paid to talk about your modest lifestyle seems like an oxymoron,” one fan said on The Duggar Family Blog, as another wrote, “It feels immodest to talk about how modest you are.”
She is even being slammed for not being modest enough!
“Will Jessa be discussing modest attire while pregnant?” a fan asked. “Everyone has seen her too tight, overstretched T-shirts hardly modest.”
