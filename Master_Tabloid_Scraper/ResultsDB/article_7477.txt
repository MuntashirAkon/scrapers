The men in Kaley Cuoco’s life has nothing but love for each other!

That was evident when Cuoco’s current boyfriend, equestrian Karl Cook, visited her on the set of The Big Bang Theory on Tuesday (March 14, 2017). While Cook was pleased watch the actress at work on the set of her hit CBS sit-com, it seemed he was even happier to see her co-star — and Cuoco’s ex-boyfriend — Johnny Galecki.
Cuoco shared a photo of the boys cuddling up on a couch in a living room set, writing on Instagram, “Ummmmmm then this happened 🙈🙈 @sanctionedjohnnygalecki get off my man! 😂 @mrtankcook.”

Not to miss out on the PDA, the 31-year-old also posted a sweet snap of her giving Cook a kiss on the cheek. “Can you tell I ❤️when this guy comes to visit me at work?!” Cuoco captioned.

“Love you so much honey,” Cook wrote on his Instagram alongside a picture of him in Cuoco’s dressing room. The 26-year-old was with his family during the set visit to watch a taping of the show.
He added, ” So much fun, what a great episode.”

Following her divorce with tennis player Ryan Sweeting, Cuoco started dating Cook last year after meeting the professional rider at a horse show. According to her, their mutual love of all-things equine brought them closer together.
“I finally found my horse guy. I know. It was meant to be,” she gushed on The Talk in September. “He’s an amazing, amazing rider. Rider and jumper. Amazing equestrian and great human.We share obviously our passion for horses and dogs and all that.”
Previously, Cuoco secretly dated Galecki for two years while working on their TV series together. “It took a minute, a bit of awkwardness. By the grace of God, we became best buddies and moved on in such an elegant way,” she said in a 2014 Cosmopolitan interview. “[He’s] one of my closest friends.”
