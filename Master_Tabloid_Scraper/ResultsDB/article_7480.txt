As if 2016 hasn’t already seen enough celebrity splits, T.I.‘s wife, Tameka “Tiny” Cottle, is seeking a divorce after six years of marriage.

The former Xscape member filed the necessary paperwork in Georgia’s Henry County on Dec. 7, according legal documents obtained by TheDirty.com. T.I, whose real name is Clifford Harris Jr., has yet to respond to the filing.
The split comes just months after the season finale the couple’s reality show, T.I. & Tiny: The Family Hustle, aired on VH1. T.I. and Tiny, who married in 2010 in Miami, have been together since 2001. They share three children together — two sons and a daughter named Heiress, who they welcomed just earlier this year.
