When you’re as famous as Ryan Gosling, fans can get pretty creative with the things you say, the things you do and the pictures you take.

While Gosling is appreciative of his fans, there’s one thing he’s never really understood: the ever popular “Hey Girl” memes. From declarations of wearing sweaters made from “boyfriend material” to wishing said girl good luck on her finals, the memes have kind of taken on a life of their own, but Gosling remains baffled as he pointed out to Variety, “I’ve never said that.”

The memes aren’t the only internet phenomenon that completely confuses Gosling. He goes on to admit he never really understood everyone’s obsession with trying to make his on-screen characters eat cereal, despite eventually paying tribute to the Vine’s creator, Ryan McHenry. “That was strange,” he said. “Just walking down the street, people would say, ‘Why won’t you eat your cereal? Are you too good for cereal?’”
When asked to describe his relationship with the internet, the actor ultimately compared himself to Fabio. “Do you remember when Fabio got hit in the face with a pigeon on the roller coaster and it broke his nose. Sometimes I feel like I’m the pigeon and the internet is Fabio’s face” Gosling explained. “Actually, I don’t know if I’m the pigeon or I’m Fabio’s face. Depends on the day, I guess.”
