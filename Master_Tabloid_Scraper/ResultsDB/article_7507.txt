The owner tells us in the last 3 days he's sold as many shelters as he would have sold in 1 year, 6 years ago. -- Rising S Bunker offers a starter bunker for $45k but the top-of-the-line,  "The Aristrocrat, " will set you back $8.35 million. Â  -- Vivos can dig 30 feet underground and customize your bunker ... starting at $35k.
