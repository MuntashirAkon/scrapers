'Game of Thrones' Star Uses NY Jets to Save His Role, Allegedly /nHere's  "Game of Thrones " star Alfie Allen -- aka Theon Greyjoy -- rockin' a NY Jets hat in L.A. this week.  When pressed about his favorite player on the Jets, Allen didn't know a damn thing about the NFL team and instead jokingly named soccer legend Thierry Henry.  There's only one explanation -- George R.R. Martin, the mad genius behind 'GOT.' Martin's a huuuuge NY Jets fan -- die-hard -- and often blogs about how his team drives him absolutely crazy.  So, here's the theory: Allen's going Green to kiss Martin's ass so he won't kill off his character ... because as EVERYONE knows -- no one is safe on that show.  Will the hat work? New season starts Sunday, so we'll find out soon enough ... /n
