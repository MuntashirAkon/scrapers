Stephen Colbert, who hosted the star-studded gala in Washington D.C., was one of the reasons behind the round of applause. “I think we can all agree: For the past eight years, the White House has given us a leader who’s passionate, intelligent and dignified,” he said.
“Sir, I don’t even know why you stood up,” Colbert joked after the President stood up and waved at the audience. “I was talking about Michelle.”
