WWE's Mark Henry -- I Need Rick Ross' Help ... To Kick Some Ass/nWWE superstar Mark Henry wants to enter the ring like a BOSS -- which is why he's calling on his doppleganger Rick Ross to remix his famous theme music so he can kick ass with a brand new beat.  FYI -- Henry is well aware of the fact he and Ross look EXACTLY alike -- and says that's exactly why his big bearded brother from another mother is the perfect guy to put a new twist on  "Somebody's Gonna Get Their Ass Kicked. "  And Henry's convinced there's a real shot it could happen ... thanks to a mutual famous friend -- who happens to be a hardcore wrestling fan. One last thing ... when we asked Henry if he's ever taken a photo with Ross, he kinda dodged the question. In fact, now that we think of it, we've never seen the two of them in the same place at the same time ... /n
