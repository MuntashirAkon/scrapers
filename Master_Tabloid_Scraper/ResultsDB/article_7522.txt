Rick Ross & Young Jeezy -- We're Done Hatin' On Each Other -- Thanks, T.I./nRapper T.I. is the Henry Kissinger of hip hop ... because he's done what seemed like the impossible ... brokering a peace treaty between Rick Ross and Young Jeezy ... TMZ has learned.You'll recall ... the Ross /Jeezy beef goes way back ... and got nuclear at the BET Hip Hop Awards two years ago when the two rappers tangled backstage and shots were fired in the parking lot.Sources close to both men tell TMZ those days are gone -- as is the bad blood -- all thanks to T.I., who had a kumbaya moment with Jeezy.T.I. told us he had a heart-to-heart with Jeezy and got him to see he had taken his eye off the ball.Â  He was focusing on bad blood rather than what was important -- MAKING MONEY.Jeezy saw the light and Rick ended up seeing things the same way.Not only did they bury the hatchet, they agreed to work together on a new Ross track.Follow the money ... and life will be easy Jeezy./n
