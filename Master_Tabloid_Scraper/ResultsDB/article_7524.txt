Bobby Brown's Brother Arrested for Driving on a Suspended License/nTrouble behind the wheel runs in Bobby Brown's family -- his brother Tommy was arrested this morning for driving on a suspended license ... TMZ has learned.Brown's older brother -- who appeared on  "Being Bobby Brown " and  "The Houstons: On Our Own " -- was popped by Henry County PD in McDonough, GA at 5:20 AM. He's being held on $1,805 bond for the driving on a suspended license charge and one additional charge ... improper passing of an emergency /towing /highway vehicle. The arrest is ironic, when you consider Bobby was sentenced to 55 days in jail earlier this week, stemming from a DUI arrest (his third).Should any of Bobby's other siblings (or even an aunt or cousin) offer you a ride in the near future, it's best if you turn them down./n
