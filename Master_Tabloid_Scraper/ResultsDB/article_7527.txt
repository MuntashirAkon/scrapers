LSU's Leonard Fournette: NEVER SKIP LEG DAY/nHere's LSU running back Leonard Fournette busting out a set of 405 POUND squats like it's nothing.  Last year, Leonard said he could max out at 605 lbs ... and the way he knocks out 405, it makes you wonder if that number has gone up even more.  For comparison, here's Alabama running back Derrick Henry busting out 1 rep of 500 pounds last year. /n
