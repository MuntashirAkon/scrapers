Blac Chyna is considering taking legal action against Rob Kardashian after he invaded her privacy and shared her personal photos online.

“I am exploring all legal remedies and protections available to my client at this time in attempts to best advise her on how she may want to proceed,” the mother-of-two’s attorney, Walter Mosley, told People.
According to a legal expert, Rob could be subject to criminal charges for posting explicit materials of his ex. Carrie Goldberg, an attorney and founder of Internet abuse and sexual consent firm C. A. Goldberg, PLLC, told the publication what Rob did “is sort of the classic, quintessential revenge porn.”
“Rob has made the work of a prosecutor or a victim’s attorney quite easy so far as to even post about the very motive behind his outrageous act of posting these private and nude photos of his ex,” she explained, adding “the allegation of infidelity does not give someone the right to seek revenge in such a devastating way.”

As reported, Rob took to social media Wednesday (July 5, 2017) to publicly drag his former fiancée. Aside from leaking her nude selfies, he alleged Chyna used drugs, slept around with other men, got paid to be in a threesome with T.I, underwent $100,000 worth of surgery since giving birth to their 8-month-old daughter Dream.
“I never want my daughter to be raised by a woman like Chyna who cheats and does drugs and alcohol with my baby in the house. She could only breastfeed for 4 weeks because she wanted to drink alcohol so bad,” he penned in a now-deleted Instagram post. “My daughter is the best thing that happened to me and she will know that Chyna did this out of spite not love ’cause she’s mad my little sister took her baby daddy.”
He wrote to Chyna, “You will never see Dream again unless you stop the alcohol and drugs and cocaine and X and E.”
Instagram since deactivated Rob’s account, leaving the reality star to air his grievances on Twitter. (The social media platform also deleted several of Chyna’s naked photos Rob had tweeted out.)

Just sad. Loved Chyna as my wife and accepted all the wrong she did and continued to ride for her and remain Loyal to her. Never did I cheat

Soon as kylie and tyga broke up Chyna was over the game. She had a baby out of spite and I’ll never view her the same.

I truly thought Chyna wanted to be a family and that’s why I was so loyal to her but I learned my lesson and everyone else was right
