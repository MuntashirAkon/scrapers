This segment of “Never Have I Ever” with Anna Kendrick, Martha Stewart, Snoop Dogg, and Ellen DeGeneres covers plenty of bases.

We get the obvious: Snoop has been high during a talk show interview.
We get the unexpected: Kendrick has been handcuffed for reasons other than acting or being arrested.
And then we are fed the truth that tastes surprising at first, but then, once it’s chewed over just a little while longer, calls to mind assumptions that we drew in our subconscious so, so long ago: Once-incarcerated Martha Stewart, the queen of decoupage, has used her mobile device to sext. When DeGeneres asks the Martha & Snoop’s Potluck Dinner Party host who she’s sexted, Stewart flips her paddle back and forth before responding, “It doesn’t say, ‘None of your business.'”
