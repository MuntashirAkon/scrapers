Weeks after Demi Lovato dissed Taylor Swift’s famous squad, accusing the group for projecting a “false image” about women empowerment, Lily Aldridge is doing damage control defending her famous BFF by insisting that their friendship is nothing but genuine.

“We are a really nice group of women who support each other and really, genuinely have each others’ back and it’s awesome,” the model told E! News. “That’s something to be about.”
Previously, Lovato slammed Swift and her gal pals, insinuating that the “Bad Blood” singer isn’t actually being inclusive because many of the ladies in her group of friends are all women with thin figures.

“To be honest, and this will probably get me in trouble, I don’t see anybody in any sort of squad that has a normal body,” Lovato told Glamour earlier this month. “It’s kind of this false image of what people should look like. And what they should be like, and it’s not real. It’s not realistic.”
Regardless of naysayers, Swift is still going strong with her squad. Recently, the songstress stepped out in New York City with her girls to see Aldridge’s husband, Caleb Followill, perform at a Kings of Leon concert. Amongst the crew were  Lorde, Cara Delevingne, Dakota Johnson, Suki Waterhouse, Martha Hunt, Zoë Kravitz and Lily Donaldson. Naturally, the evening was commemorated with a squad photo.
