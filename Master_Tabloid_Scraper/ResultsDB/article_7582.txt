Robert Pattinson Praised by PETA After Refusing to Perform Sex Act on a Dog in Good Time/n
For those who missed Robert's interview Thursday night, the actor shared a story from production that caught viewers by surprise."My character, Connie, has this affinity with dogs; he thinks he is a dog in a previous life and he thinks he has control over animals," Robert explained. "There's this one scene we shot— there's a drug dealer who busts into the room, and I was sleeping with the dog and basically giving the dog a hand job."He continued, "It was a character thing. I asked the trainer [about it] because the director was like, 'Just do it for real, man! Don't be a pussy!' And the dog's owner was like, 'Well, he's a breeder. I mean, you can. You just gotta massage the inside of his thighs.' I was like, 'Just massage the inside of his thighs?!' I didn't agree to do the real one, so we made a fake red rocket."

Obviously caught off guard, Jimmy Kimmel tried to lighten the mood by adding some humor to the story."You made a fake dog penis?" the late-night host asked. "Wow, Hollywood is a great place. It really is."Good Time tells the story of a bank robber who finds himself unable to evade those who are looking for him. The project, directed by Benny Safdie and Josh Safdie, is scheduled to hit theatres August 11.
