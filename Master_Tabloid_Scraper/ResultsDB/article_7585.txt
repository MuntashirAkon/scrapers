Robert Pattinson Refuses to Perform a Sex Act on a Dog While Shooting Good Time/n
That certainly wasn't what Jimmy had hoped to hear from his guest. "That was what you, the actor Robert Pattinson, were doing?" the host asked. "Or that's what the character was doing?""It was a character thing. I asked the trainer [about it] because the director was like, 'Just do it for real, man! Don't be a pussy!' And the dog's owner was like, 'Well, he's a breeder. I mean, you can. You just gotta massage the inside of his thighs.' I was like, 'Just massage the inside of his thighs?!'" Robert recalled. "I didn't agree to do the real one, so we made a fake red rocket.""You made a fake dog penis?" Jimmy asked. "Wow, Hollywood is a great place. It really is.""But, it was fun," Robert said with a laugh. "It will be on the DVD extras."

Good Time competed for the Palme d'Or in the main competition section at the 2017 Cannes Film Festival. In his review, Variety's Guy Lodge said that Robert "hits a career high" in the film.
