Robert Pattinson Praised by PETA for Refusing to Masturbate a Dog/nRobert Pattinson is a hero to 4-legged friends for refusing to masturbate a dog for a movie scene ... so says PETA. The actor told Jimmy Kimmel Thursday night the director of his latest flick,  "Good Time, " wanted him to shoot a scene in which he pleasured a pooch, but Pattinson drew a line in the sand and refused. PETA is now praising Pattinson, saying the scene is both a form of mistreatment and  "like child molestation. " The animal rights org refers to a story TMZ broke, involving a distressed dog that appeared to have been forced to swim in raging waters in the movie  "A Dog's Purpose, " saying,  "PETA depends on actors and crew members to come forward when they see mistreatment. " PETA says it's now on the case, trying to determine if any laws have been broken./n
