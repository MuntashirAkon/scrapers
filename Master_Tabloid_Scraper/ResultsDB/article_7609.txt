Katy Perry Is Still Ridin' Orlando Bloom/nKaty Perry didn't need an Uber to get to Saturday night's Ed Sheeran concert in L.A. ... she got a lift from ex-BF Orlando Bloom. Looks like the break is over for the ex-couple who attended Sheeran's concert at the Staples Center ... the first time they've been spotted out since calling it quits in March after a year of dating. Katy said the breakup was amicable and she's been linked to other guys, namely Rob PattinsonÂ with whom she had dinner with last week. As they say ... old flames die hard./n
