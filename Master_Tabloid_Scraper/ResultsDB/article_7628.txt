A third commenter posted, “She’s pregnant again? Look at that bump!”
But not all followers were convinced, as many blamed the angle of the photo.
Bookout has yet to respond to the speculation. But as fans know, she has been adamant that she is done having children. She is also mother daughter Jayde, 2, with McKinney.
“We’ve both talked about adoption or fostering in the future, down the road, but we’re not [having kids] biologically,” she told People. “For both of us, it’s one of those things where if we are capable of providing a stable home, healthy relationships and some hope for a child who may not have that or ever experienced it, then we want to.”
