“Hey you know what would be the coolest?” he asked. “Bachelor and bachelorette parties. I just thought about it, but I can’t rethink about it. We’re going to be married, we’re going to be married.”
Standifer then turned the camera off, but left their microphones on as she asked if he took Xanax again.
