What feud??
That's obviously what Louis Tomlinson and Zayn Malik are asking themselves these days as the former One Direction bandmates are officially friends again. In case you forgot, the two boy banders got into it on Twitter after Malik's new producing partner Naughty Boy taunted 1D about the 24-year-old's 2015 departure from the X Factor created group.

Fast forward two years later and it seems as though Zouis are bros again! Tomlinson confirmed this news during a candid chat on Monday on Andy Cohen's SiriusXM radio show. It's said it was Louis' now deceased mother, Johannah Deakin, who inspired the Back To You singer to reach out to and reconcile with his ex-bandmate.
On where he stands now with Gigi Hadid's boyfriend, the father-of-one dished: 
"We got back in touch with each other and kind of cleared the air and talked everything through. So we're mates again, I suppose… Like anything like that, it takes time. But it was nice that we had an opportunity to clear the air and be adults about it, I suppose."

We're sure Directioners everywhere are tearing up over this! We mean, we know we are!!
