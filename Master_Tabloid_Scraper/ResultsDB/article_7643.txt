There's a line in the song that's supposed to go "hope she ain't faking it like I did," but when it came time for Perrie to perform it live, she changed it to something very personal for Zayn and Gigi:  "hope she ain't faking like Hadid."
Damn!!!!
Watch it happen in real tlme (below) ‚Äî and it's such a hit with the rest of Little Mix that Jade Thirlwall was laughing too hard to sing her part afterwards:
