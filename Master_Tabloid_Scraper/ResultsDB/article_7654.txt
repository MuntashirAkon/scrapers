George Orwell’s 1984 is selling like dystopian hotcakes.

Orwell’s 1949 novel that illustrates his nightmarish vision of a totalitarian, bureaucratic dystopian universe saw a spike in sales during the first week of Donald Trump’s presidency, specifically after Kellyanne Conway described White House press secretary Sean Spicer’s exaggerated inauguration attendance numbers as “alternative facts” on Sunday’s Meet the Press. The term “alternative facts” calls to mind Orwell’s “Ministry of Truth” in the novel, which is referred to as “the place where there is no darkness” and concerns itself with lies.

A spokesperson for Penguin, the book’s publishing house, said that they put through a 75,000 copy reprint this week — an unusually large reprint, even taking into account the usual demand that comes with the start of the spring semester.
