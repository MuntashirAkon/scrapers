"Oh, my God," Anna said. "I'm so glad I'm here today." Pressed to explain one of her answers, Martha examined both sides of her paddle and joked, "It doesn't say, 'None of your business.'"It wasn't all fun and games, of course.Anna was on the show to promote her memoir, Scrappy Little Nobody. "It's weird to see you holding it, but it was just in brain and on my computer for so long," she told Ellen. "It's funny stories and silly thoughts about stuff. I always feel weird trying to sell it, because...I wrote it."

Martha and Snoop, meanwhile, were on hand to discuss their new show, Martha & Snoop's Potluck Dinner Party. To celebrate, the duo made a few of their favorite food and drink recipes.
