Perrie Edwards is taking a trip down memory lane — and she’s taking the peach emoji with her!
The 23-year-old Little Mix singer took to Instagram on Tuesday, sharing a butt-baring photo of herself and two friends showing off their backsides in a pool while on a recent vacation in the Maldives.
“Take🍑Me 🍑Back🍑” Edwards captioned the photo of herself sporting a white bikini, flanked by her friends in their red and yellow swimsuits.

The star was likely referring to her January 2016 beach getaway, in which she and a pair of friends spent a few days soaking up some sun.
In one Instagram shot from the vacation, Edwards and the ladies were seen jogging along the beach. “Not quite Baywatch,” the singer wrote alongside the photo.





 Sun sun sun! ☀️

The sun-filled vacation isn’t all Edwards has been missing in recent weeks.
