Edward Furlong is staying put in jail.The 35-year-old actor was charged today with felony assault and other offenses—the result of multiple arrests over the last several months, including his most recent bust for allegedly violating his girlfriend's restraining order against him.Furlong pleaded not guilty to felony charges of dissuading a witness by force or threat, assault by means to likely produce great bodily injury and vandalism over $400, as well as to a misdemeanor count of disobeying a domestic restraining order.

Per the L.A. County District Attorney's Office, Furlong had two pending misdemeanor battery cases open against him when he showed up May 21 at his ex's house, where, authorities say, he assaulted her and threatened her not to call the police. He's also accused of damaging laptop and photo equipment at the time.That incident is not to be confused with him being collared after police found him hiding on a neighboring property on May 16.The pending cases, from arrests on Nov. 21 and Jan. 13, also involved the same alleged victim.Furlong is facing up to four years in state prison if he's convicted on all charges. In the meantime, he remains in jail in lieu of $100,000 bail and he's due back in court July 1, when a date will be set for his preliminary hearing.The Terminator 2: Judgment Day star has been in custody since June 10.
