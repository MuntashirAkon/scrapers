Judgment day wasn't as bad as it could have been for Edward Furlong.The Terminator 2 star cut a deal with prosecutors today that allowed him to avoid more jail time after popping in and out from behind bars over the past eight months on suspicion of assaulting his girlfriend, violating a restraining order, battery and other offenses related to his rocky relationship.Furlong pleaded no contest to an amended felony charge of willful infliction of corporal injury on a cohabitant or spouse; in exchange, six other charges pending against him were dropped.

He was sentenced to 61 days in jail, but was credited for time served.Very much in the present, however, Furlong was slapped with five years of probation and ordered to attend 90 days of a drug-treatment program and complete 52 weeks of domestic violence counseling.The 35-year-old actor was also ordered by L.A. Superior Court Commissioner Mark Zuckman to avoid all contact with the victim. The protective order is made to last the entire term of his probation, but the court will review the "stay away" portion in three months.Furlong was last locked up on June 10 after a judge hiked his bail from $50,000 to $100,000. He bailed out on June 19 after initially pleading not guilty toÂ felony charges of dissuading a witness by force or threat, assault by means to likely produce great bodily injury and vandalism over $400, as well as to a misdemeanor count of disobeying a domestic restraining order. He also had two battery charges pending for arrests in November and January.
