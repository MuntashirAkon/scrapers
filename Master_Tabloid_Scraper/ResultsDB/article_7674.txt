Prison seems to be becoming Edward Furlong's home away from home. The Terminator 2: Judgment Day star, who was jailed in Van Nuys, Calif., last month for alleged battery, has now been sentenced to six months behind bars for violating his probation from a 2010 case."Despite the best efforts of my office, and with the cooperation of the City Attorney and the Court in this case, Mr. Furlong had the opportunity to avoid Jail in a deal my office worked out which would of resolved not just this case but two other criminal cases in Beverly Hills, by checking himself into a drug rehabilitation program, a very unusual disposition in a case that alleged violence," Furlong's attorney Brian Michaels told E! News.

He added, "Sadly, Mr. Furlong rejected all proposals to get into drug rehabilitation, and the Court, ultimately decided that it was forced to sentence to him a hefty amount of jail time. We are hopeful that Mr. Furlong uses this experience, unpleasant as it may be, to revisit the issue of Rehab when he is released."Jail records revealed today that Furlong may be released in late May, even though Superior Court Judge Dennis Mulcahy directed officials not to release the actor early or give him credit for time served.Furlong was placed on three years' probation in November 2010 for violating a restraining order put in place by his then-wife, Rachael Kneeland. —Reporting by Baker Machado
