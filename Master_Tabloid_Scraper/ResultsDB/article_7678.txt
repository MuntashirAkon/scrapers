Natalee Holloway Miniseries Triggers Lawsuit /nNatalee Holloway has been missing for 12 years, and her story is still embroiled in controversy ... a story that has triggered a new lawsuit. Edward Kramer just filed suit against 2 production companies -- Brian Graden Media and Lipstick -- for allegedly stealing his idea for a miniseries about Holloway's cold case. He says what's worse, he worked for the companies for more than a year without getting as much as a penny. In the docs, obtained by TMZ, Kramer claims after Lipstick put him in touch with BGM in 2014 to develop the Holloway project, he was tasked with doing a lot of the legwork, like figuring out how to turn it into a miniseries, doing interviews, and getting the pitch ready for NBC and Oxygen (which is airing  "The Disappearance of Natalee Holloway " this week). Kramer says when he began asking about compensation, he got the runaround. He's asking a judge to block the airing of the show. We've reached out to BGM ... so far, no word back. /n
