'Below Deck' Star Captain Lee Says Bankruptcy Case is a Fraud, Feds Investigating /nCaptain Lee Rosbach﻿ claims someone filed for bankruptcy for him without his knowledge or consent and he has no idea why ... but he's on the hunt and is looking for revenge. The  "Below Deck " sea captain tells TMZ ... he was shocked to hear reports of his bankruptcy case while he was out at sea filming for season 5.
