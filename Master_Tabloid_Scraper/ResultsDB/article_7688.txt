Oprah Winfrey -- Check Out My Nudes! They're All for Sale/nOprah Winfrey is holding the yard sale to end all yard sales -- in the form of a massive online auction -- and the items up for sale reveal ... Oprah's a little bit of a freak.   Look past her run-of-the-mill plates, tables, chairs, etc. -- and the thing that stands out is her abundance of nude artwork. For example, there's the set of four framed nude male mythological figures ... expected to fetch between $800-$1,200.  There's also a nude painting by Aristide Maillol ($8,000-$12,000), a few Ellie Dolgin nude statues (around $10,000), and a painting of a nude woman by Richard Edward Miller with an estimated worth of $80,000-$120,000. There's also a weight set that looks barely used (no shade, just the truth) for about $500, a pen with Oprah's name on it for $50, and some kind of lamb sculpture that lays for about $2,000. Maybe just stick with the nudes.  /n
