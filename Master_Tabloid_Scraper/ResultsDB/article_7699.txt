Reggie Bush: STL Fires Back in Stadium Slip Lawsuit ... It's YOUR Fault! /nReggie Bush only has HIMSELF to blame for slipping, falling and injuring himself at the Edward Jones Dome back in November ... so says the city of St. Louis in new court docs obtained by TMZ Sports.  As we previously reported, Bush sued the city (which owns the stadium) -- claiming it stupidly installed a ring of concrete around the perimeter of the field ... incredibly dangerous for the players wearing slippery cleats.  Bush badly injured his left knee during a fall on the concrete on Nov. 1st -- just one week after another player injured his shoulder slipping on the surface ... and he says the city must pay.  But the city is calling BS -- saying Bush knew about the concrete ring and should have SLOWED DOWN before reaching it.  The city of St. Louis says Bush could have  "stopped, slackened his speed to have avoided the accident. "  "[Bush] assumed the risk of running on concrete in shoes with cleats on them, and of all danger inherent of playing football. " The craziest part of this lawsuit ... Bush was PUSHED past the playing field and onto the ring.  Watch the clip -- you really think he had time to stop???/n
