What Would Martha Stewart and Paula Deen Think of Orange Is the New Black's Judy King? So what does Brown think Stewart and Deen would make of her lifestyle guru prison inmate? "I would think both of them would be appalled," s.../n
Blair Brown's Orange Is the New Black character, Judy King, took Litchfield by storm in the fourth season of the Netflix dramedy. She's one part Martha Stewart, one part Paula Deen and a whole lot of trouble. This is your spoiler warning.Judy King clashed with Red (Kate Mulgrew) over the garden (and got diarrhea as a result), begrudgingly taught a cooking class and fake dated Black Cindy (Adrienne C. Moore) after using her to quell a racist scandal in the press. And that's just the tip of the iceberg, let's not forget her threesome with Luschek (Matt Peters) and Yoga Jones (Constance Shulman) while rolling on Molly.

So what does Brown think Stewart and Deen would make of her lifestyle guru prison inmate? "I would think both of them would be appalled," she told Kristin Dos Santos in the video above. "But the thing is, they can take themselves off the hook because it's not themâ€¦She happens to cook and just happens to be southern."The season of Orange Is the New Black ended with (again, spoiler alert) the prison trying to get Judy King out early in an effort to avoid bad press over an incident she was there for. As she was being escorted out, three factions of inmates converged, a gun was pulled and the season ended on a cliffhanger.Orange Is the New Black has already been renewed for seasons five, six and seven.
