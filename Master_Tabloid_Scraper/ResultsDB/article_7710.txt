The Queen Is Not Standing Down For Prince Charles To Take The Throne - Details/n
The Queen will not stand aside for Prince Charles despite recent rumors.
The 91-year-old monarch wants to continue her duties as long as possible and Prince Charles, 68, will only take over if she dies or cannot perform her role because of illness.
The world’s longest reigning living monarch is as committed to the role as ever despite her age.
A source revealed: “‘The Queen has always been so vehement that there will never be a regency unless she was sick to the point of being unable to perform her duties.”
