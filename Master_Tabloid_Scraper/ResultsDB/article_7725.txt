This French Bulldog Enjoying His ~Very Own~ Bedroom Is More Luxurious Than You'll Ever Be/n

Some pups just need their privacy.
One French bulldog was lucky enough to get his own paw-sonal space when he was built his very own bedroom!
Photos have gone viral on Twitter showing the pooch enjoying every inch of his doggy nook, which was constructed Harry Potter style in a tiny space under the stairs.

Unlike Harry's cramped space, however, the dog's area is decked out with hardwood floors, an overhead light, freshly painted walls, and pictures of his friends — both human and canine.
The dog owner's brother shared images of the renovation from start to finish, including pics of the tiny pooch lounging in his new digs. Ch-ch-check it out (below)!
