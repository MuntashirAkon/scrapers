Your Weekend 6 Picks: Scott Disick Addresses Bella Thorne Relationship Rumors/n
Scott Disick says he’s not a sex addict.

Though he admitted he was obsessed with sleeping around on an episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians earlier this year, the father-of-three refuted the claims when he was asked about the comment this weekend.
“I would say I think it’s a little rude that everybody keeps addressing me as a sex addict,” the 34-year-old told E! News during an appearance at LIQUID Pool Lounge at Aria Resort & Casino in Las Vegas on Saturday. “I just like sex, but I’m not a sex addict. I said that in a humorous, joking fashion on the show and now I’m getting billed as one, and it’s not the case. I do like sex, but I am not an addict.”
He added, “A gargantuan appetite, but not an addict!”
The reality star also opened up about about his rumored fling with 19-year-old actress Bella Thorne, saying, “We have nothing to do with each other romantically.
“No, no love interest for me. I’m just focusing on one girl at a time,” he joked. “I’m just kidding. I just try to live and be decently happy. But no, No girlfriends or anything like that.”
