Each subject area includes a "specially commissioned essay" from people like Steve Backshall, Richard Coles, Owen Davies, Julia Eccleshare, Roger Highfield, Steve Kloves, Lucy Mangan, Anna Pavord and Tim Peake. A Journey Through a History of Magic, meanwhile, will teach readers lessons on Astronomy, Defense Against the Dark Arts, Divination, Herbology and other wizarding subjects.

The books will be available Oct. 20, and they are both available for pre-order now.

The London-based Harry Potter exhibition, meanwhile, will run through February 2018; it honors the 20th anniversary of J.K. Rowling's novel Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. Next spring, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child will begin performances on Broadway. The play, which runs in repertory in two parts, has been a critical and commercial hit in on the West End.
