Prince Harry Shows Some Love for Harry Styles/nIt's almost too much Harry for a photo. Britain's 2 favorite Harry's -- Prince Harry and Harry Styles -- came face-to-face Thursday night in London. It happened at the at the  "Dunkirk " premiere at the Odeon in Leicester Square. It's the 1D guy's debut role in a movie, and it happens to be about the WWII battle at Dunkirk -- which explains why the royal one was all ribboned up. It's not the first time they've met -- as many assumed. They hooked up in 2015 at a Royal concert event in London. Y'know the red headed Harry's jammed out to  "Story of My Life " more than a few times, right?/n
