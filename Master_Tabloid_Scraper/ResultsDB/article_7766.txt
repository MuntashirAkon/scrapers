L.A. Rams Rookies Tour Warner Bros. Studios/nYou're looking at the most black people ever on the set of  "Friends " ... courtesy of the L.A. Rams! The Rams' rookie class hit up the Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, CA on Monday for a spectacular VIP tour of the backlot ... which included Central Perk. Serious question ... these guys are in their early 20s. Do you think any of them have ever seen a full episode of  "Friends "? Doesn't matter ... the guys had a blast anyway visiting other iconic Warner Bros. movie stuff --- including Harry Potter's broom, the Batmobile and more! WR's Cooper Kupp and Shakeir Ryan even went behind bars in the jail cell from  "Suicide Squad. " Other must-dos ... visit the Hollywood sign, survive an earthquake, go to the Walk of Fame and leave disappointed and get stuck on the 405. Welcome to L.A.!/n
