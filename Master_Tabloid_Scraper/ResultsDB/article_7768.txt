Brad Pitt Treats Chris Cornell's Kids To A Bit of Magic At Universal Studios (PHOTOS)/nBrad Pitt put a little magic into Chris Cornell's kids' lives, thanks to butterbeer and wizard wands from Universal Studios' Harry Potter World. Pitt hit up the L.A. theme park Wednesday with Cornell's 2 tweens ... 12-year-old daughter Toni, and 11-year-old Christopher. Cornell also has a 16-year-old daughter from a previous marriage, who was not present.  Doesn't look like they left a part of the park uncovered between the swag they picked up at the Wizarding World of Harry Potter and riding the Jurassic Park ride.      #New #BradPitt at the Universal with Chris Cornell's kids A post shared by Brad Pitt (@brad.pitt.official) on May 31, 2017 at 11:42pm PDT    Pitt and Cornell were close friends for years.
