Martha Stewart -- You Can Take My Picture ... You Just Can't Be in It!/nMartha Stewart ﻿made one thing perfectly clear in NYC last night ... photography is not a participatory sport.Stewart was heading into an event at the TimesCenter in New York City when two guys, claiming to be big fans, asked her for a quick photo. Martha blew right by them.But 15 minutes later when she left ... the same two guys were still waiting in front. They asked again, and this time Martha responded ... only agreeing to pose for a photo ... without them in it. When the guys balked, Martha just went on her way.They don't make 'em like that anymore./n
