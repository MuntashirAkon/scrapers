Rupert Grint Says Arachnophobia's No Illusion ... But Magic Is!!!/nRupert Grint's not about that wizardry life ... don't let his acting fool you. The 'Harry Potter' star -- who was arriving at LAX Sunday -- couldn't dodge our photog's question -- do you believe in magic? Rupert caves and tells us, but he also admits he's got something VERY much in common with the character he plays in J.K. Rowling's hit series -- NO SPIDERS!!/n
