Charlie Sheen Pens Strange Poem On Ex Brooke Mueller's Hospitalization/n
After ex Brooke Mueller was hospitalized earlier this week following a bender breakdown, Charlie Sheen came forward, writing a bizarre poem in response to the incident.
“In the face of a roughshod and polar moment of unsanctioned divide, sanity and certainty were restored with grace and resolve,” he said in an statement to People.
“Immeasurable gratitude and love to a fellow yeoman of the apocalypse; sir Michael from that hamlet called Walters, need accept each and every Crimson palm-sting, as high fives rain upon his bitchen nobility, not just from this traveler, but from his safe and stable brood as well. . .”

As reported, Sgt. Todd Royce of the Utah Department of Public Safety told Radar that, “On the morning of November 16, dispatchers with the Utah Department of Public Safety received a welfare check call from a woman claiming to be the mother of Brooke Mueller. Troopers with the Utah Highway Patrol responded to the welfare check call and located Mueller, her two children and a nanny on Interstate 15 near Nephi, Utah.”
He added that 7-year-old twins Bob and Max would be released to family during 39-year-old Mueller’s hospitalization.
Sheen’s ex’s sobriety was first called into question after she allegedly got into a fight with her children’s nanny at a bar. She was barefoot, and left before the cops arrived. She was later spotted in another argument at a local gas station.

Still, Mueller’s sister Sydney Wolofsky insisted to Radar that Mueller has been sober since her rehab stint earlier this year, and that she was “totally coherent and everything” during their Tuesday afternoon chat.
