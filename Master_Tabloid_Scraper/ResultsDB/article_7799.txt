Former First Daughter Chelsea Clinton Prepares To Enter Politics/n
While Hillary Clinton may be out of political favor, the former first daughter, Chelsea, may be getting ready to take up the mantle to continue the family tradition of public service.
The younger Clinton is reportedly mulling running for a seat in Congress and could replace 79-year-old Rep. Nita Lowey, who represents New York City’s 17th Congressional District.

“While it is true the Clintons need some time to regroup after Hillary’s crushing loss, they will not give up,” a source told the New York Post of secret behind-the-scenes planning. “Chelsea would be the next extension of the Clinton brand.”
“In the past few years, she has taken a very visible role in the Clinton Foundation and on the campaign trail,” continued the source of the 36-year-old. “While politics isn’t the life Hillary wanted for Chelsea, she chose to go on the campaign trail for her mother and has turned out to be very poised, articulate and comfortable with the visibility.”

The Clintons have reportedly begun laying the groundwork for their only child’s move into the political arena by buying her and her family — husband Marc Mezvinksky and their two kids, Charlotte and Aidan — a million-dollar home next to their own in Chappaqua, New York.
“There has been a lot of speculation within New York Democratic circles about Lowey’s retirement and Chelsea running for the seat,” said the source. “There is a belief that Chappaqua is a logical place for Chelsea to run, because it would be straightforward for her to raise money and build a powerful base.”
