Martha Stewart -- Enjoys the ol' In-N-Out/nMartha Stewart knows more about fast food than you'd think -- because last night in Las Vegas, the world's greatest homemaker ordered an item off the legendary  "secret " menu at a local In-N-Out burger. We're told Martha ordered up an  "Animal Style " combo -- which means the burger patty is cooked and fried with mustard ... then pickles are added, along with grilled onions and extra spread.The combo also comes with fries and a drink. Who's hungry?/n
