Michael Fassbender has been mustering the courage to take on his role in Assassin’s Creed for quite a while.

In the sweat-inducing trailer for the film, Fassbender’s character, Callum Lynch, takes a giant “Leap of Faith” from the top of a building, as the characters do in the game. It’s a terrifying maneuver that was perfected for the film by stuntman Damien Walters, who dove 125 feet into a giant inflatable pillow.

As it turns out, Fassbender could have taken the plunge on his own if he really wanted to, based on his informal training. During his visit to Good Morning America on Tuesday (Dec. 13, 2016), Fassbender revealed that he’d challenge his physical abilities in unconventional ways while he was unemployed as an actor, like diving off of the 10-meter block in the swimming pool. He said that he almost chickened out until a few younger, brazen kids came along. The majority of them ignored Fassbender and jumped off, doing tricks, but one stayed behind to persuade him.
Fassbender recalled, “One kid, he came up to me and he was like, ‘You haven’t gone off yet, have you?’ I was like, ‘No.’ He was like, ‘Are you scared?’ I was like, ‘Yeah.’ He was like, ‘I was scared the first time, too, but just go for it. You’ll hurt yourself a little bit, but it won’t be as bad as you think.'”
The actor took the kid’s advice, admitting that did hurt a little bit, just as the kid predicted.
