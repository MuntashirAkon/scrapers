President-elect Donald Trump’s tweets against Saturday Night Live have not stopped the long-running sketch comedy show from making fun of him. On Saturday (Dec. 10, 2016), Bryan Cranston got in on the fun, bringing Breaking Bad’s Walter White back from the dead to mock Trump’s cabinet picks.

The show opened with a parody of CNN’s Jake Tapper, played by Beck Bennett, interviewing Kellyanne Conway, played by Kate McKinnon. Bennett, as Tapper, questions the president-elect’s cabinet picks, and McKinnon (as Conway) announces a new one. Walter White will head the Drug Enforcement Agency.
Cranston and Bennett banter back and forth, and we learn that White agrees with Trump on a few issues. For example, White likes the president-elects idea to build a wall between the United States and Mexico as it well keep out the competition. Bennett asked if White was talking about jobs and Cranston replied, “Sure.”

Cranston as White also said he, like Trump, wants to cover the United States in “red, white and a whole lot of blue.”
President-elect Trump has yet to tweet about the sketch.
