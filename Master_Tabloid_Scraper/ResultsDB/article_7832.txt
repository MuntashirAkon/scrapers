Comic Curmudgeon Walter Matthau Dead/n
Walter Matthau, Hollywood's favorite grumpy old man, died early Saturday morning of a heart attack. He was 79.                              The perpetually grouchy, Oscar-winning star of The Fortune Cookie, The Odd Couple and Grumpy Old Men was pronounced dead at 1:42 a.m. PT, just moments after being rushed from his Los Angeles-area home to St. John's Health Center in Santa Monica, a hospital spokesperson said.                              Matthau, who's had a history of poor health, was hospitalized as recently as April with an undisclosed ailment, coincidentally sharing a ward with friend Billy Wilder, who directed Matthau to a Supporting Actor Academy Award win in 1966's Fortune Cookie.                              That collaboration also marked the first of many memorable teamings with Jack Lemmon. The duo, whose friendly banter was as playful offscreen as on, worked together on some of Tinseltown's funniest flicks, usually with a plot involving Matthau's character mercilessly tormenting Lemmon's.                           "I have lost someone I loved as a brother, as a closest friend and a remarkable human being," Lemmon said. "We have also lost one of the best damn actors we'll ever see."                           In addition to Fortune Cookie, in which Matthau played Lemmon's insurance-scamming brother-in-law, the tandem appeared in Wilder's Buddy, Buddy (1981) and The Front Page (1974). But their most memorable face-off was in the 1968 movie version of Neil Simon's classic The Odd Couple, with Matthau playing inveterate slob Oscar Madison (a role he originated on Broadway) to Lemmon's anal retentive Felix Unger.                              "Every actor looks all his life for a part that will combine his talents with his personality," Matthau once said. "The Odd Couple was mine. That was the plutonium I needed. It all started happening after that."                              Matthau and Lemmon also costarred in 1996's The Grass Harp, directed by Walter's son Charles, and both appeared in JFK. They made Grumpy Old Men in 1993, followed two years later by Grumpier Old Men. Next came Out to Sea in 1997 and Odd Couple II in 1998.                              And Matthau starred in Lemmon's first directorial effort, Kotch, in 1973, picking up a Best Actor Oscar nomination for the story about, yes, a lovable curmudgeon.                              Matthau also snagged an Academy Award nomination for playing George Burns' vaudeville rival in The Sunshine Boys (1975).                                                           His other greatest hits include The Bad News Bears, Hello, Dolly!, Cactus Flower, Plaza Suite and Pete 'n' Tillie, as well as thrillers (he said he preferred drama to comedy) like The Taking of Pelham 1-2-3 and                Charade.                               He was last seen as the grouchy father of Diane Keaton, Meg Ryan and Lisa Kudrow in Hanging Up, which was released in February.                              Along with his Oscar, his trophy case includes a Golden Globe for The Sunshine Boys, Tonys for A Shot in the Dark and The Odd Couple, and the American Comedy Award for lifetime achievement.                              He was born Walter Matuchanskavasky on October 1, 1920, in New York, the son of poor Russian-Jewish immigrants. After a series of journeyman jobs and a stint as a soldier in World War II, Matthau took some acting lessons and, at the age of 28, landed  the role of understudy to Rex Harrison's aged British bishop in the Broadway drama Anne of the Thousand Days.                              His first major Broadway success, however, came with A Shot in the Dark. Hollywood soon put his lanky, 6-foot-3 frame to use as a heavy in  such films as The Kentuckian, with Burt Lancaster, and King Creole, with Elvis, before he hit his comic stride in The Fortune Cookie.                              Matthau married his first wife, Grace Geraldine Johnson, in 1948. They divorced 10 years later after having two children, David and Jenny. He married Carol Marcus in 1959, and their only child, son Charles, became a filmmaker.                              Ill health plagued Matthau from the beginning of his career. He suffered a major heart attack in 1966 (doctors blamed his three-pack-a-day smoking habit and stress from gambling--he gave up the smoking), underwent heart bypass surgery in 1976, suffered double pneumonia in 1993 (after shooting Grumpy Old Men during the frigid Minnesota winter), had a benign colon tumor removed in 1995 and was hospitalized again for pneumonia in May 1999.                              In typical form, Matthau blamed his maladies on his bad eating habits. "If you eat only celery and lettuce, you won't get sick...I like celery and lettuce, but I like it with pickles, relish, corned beef, potatoes, peas. And I like Eskimo Pies."                              Funeral arrangements are pending, and, per tradition, flowers were placed on Matthau's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
