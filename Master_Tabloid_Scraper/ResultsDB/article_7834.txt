News Legend Walter Cronkite Dead at 92/n
Beyond the TV news set, Cronkite mattered in a very real pop-culture way, topping public-opinion polls seeking "the most trusted man in America," and, per one popular historical take, turning public sentiment against Vietnam with one brief, but pointed observation in a 1968 telecast."How many news  organizations get the chance to bask in the sunshine of a half-century of Edward  R. Murrow followed by a half century of Walter Cronkite?" commented Cronkite's longtime producer, Don Hewitt, upon news of his death.In a retirement that was anything but, Cronkite hosted, narrated and/or appeared in dozens of news specials and documentaries. He even returned to the CBS Evening News. Since 2006, when Couric ascended to the anchor chair that, thanks to ratings attrition, no longer dropped much weight, Cronkite has been heard introducing the newscast."It is  impossible to imagine CBS News, journalism or indeed America without Walter  Cronkite," CBS News President Sean McManus said. "More than just the best and most trusted anchor in history, he guided  America through our crises, tragedies and also our victories and greatest  moments. No matter what the news event was, Walter was always the consummate  professional with an un-paralleled sense of compassion, integrity, humanity,  warmth, and occasionally even humor. There will never be another figure in  American history who will hold the position Walter held in our minds, our hearts  and on the television."In June, Cronkite's family, responding to reports that the newsman was gravely ill, revealed the Cronkite had suffered for "some years" from cerebrovascular disease, a disorder of the blood vessels of the brain.
