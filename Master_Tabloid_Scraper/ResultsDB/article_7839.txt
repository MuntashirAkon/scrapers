'Power Rangers' Star Walter Jones is Impressed by His Real-Life Power Axe/nThe original Black Ranger from  "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers " can't believe someone made his TV weapon into a real-life killing instrument ... and now he wants his own. We got Walter Jones Monday at LAX, where our photog asked what he thought about the show  "Man at Arms " ... recreating his character's Power Axe (which doubled for a gun on TV).  Walter's all about it, but not completely surprised it got done. It is 2017, after all -- the tech these days is pretty wild. As he puts it ... making an axe-blaster is high on the doable list. We also ask what his weapon of choice would be in a real battle ... let's just say Walt's old school. /n
