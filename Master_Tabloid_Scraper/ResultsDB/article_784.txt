Duke Star Jabari Parker – I MIGHT LEAVE SCHOOL EARLY... TO BAKE! /nDuke basketball phenom Jabari Parker could very well be the first pick in the NBA draft ... if he doesn't become Martha Stewart first -- 'cause the guy has some serious baking skills.  Parker showed off his culinary prowess recently by rewarding the swarms of Duke fans camping out for the March 8th battle vs. UNC (Yes, March 8th, they’re crazy) with his signature “Jabari Bars.” Check out the video… it’s a serious culinary experience, with Jabari refusing to detail his full list of ingredients, and at one point saying “If they like them, I might have to leave college to be a professional dessert maker.” The verdict? One student said that the Jabari Bars were a “12 out of 10.” Seems like another reason for Paula Deen to be scared of a big black guy./n
