Justin Bieber -- The Pap Suing Me Is Lame ... Play With Fire, Get Burned!/nIf you stand in front of a moving car, you're gonna get hit -- which is Justin Bieber's defense in a lawsuit filed by a photog he mowed down.Bieber was sued last year by Walter Lee, who claims Biebs struck him in 2013 as he left a comedy club on Sunset Boulevard.  Bieber claims Lee deliberately stood in front of the moving vehicle so TS.Bieber also doubts Lee was actually hurt. As TMZ first reported, despite claiming serious injuries Lee filmed Bieber just a few days after filing his lawsuit. Bieber wants the case tossed out and if the judge wants to award him court costs, that would be swell./n
