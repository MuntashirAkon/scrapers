Cecil the Lion -- Zimbabwe Conservation Group to Dentist: Here's the Drill .../nThe dentist who killed Cecil the lion can acquit himself by putting down his bow and arrow and picking up a drill. An official from the Zimbabwe Conservation Task Force tells TMZ, as much as they condemn what Dr. Walter Palmer did to their beloved lion, they don't think he deserves the torrent of threats that have come his way. The org has an idea ... that Dr. Palmer should come back to Zimbabwe and provide free dental services to the poor ... a way of repenting for his bad deed. He says it's like community service. The official says pointing the finger at Dr. Palmer is misguided, because the problem is much larger, adding,  "Cecil would not have enjoyed the threats of violence he's getting right now. "/n
