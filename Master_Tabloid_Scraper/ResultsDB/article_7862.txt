 Momager Dearest! Kris Jenner Cashing In On Rob Kardashian & Blac Chyna's Court Drama.../n
Blac Chyna’s battle against ex Rob Kardashian exploded in court today when she was granted a temporary restraining order against him for harassment and cyber-bullying.
And as the former Rob & Chyna reality star parents prepare to work out a co-parenting plan for their daughter Dream, a source close to the KUWTK clan told RadarOnline.com exclusively that Kris Jenner has devised some plans of her own!
“Kris is going to use all of this for the upcoming season of Keeping Up With the Kardashians,’ a source close to the 61-year-old momager said. “She is distraught about the drama, but at the same time excited about this because she knows that this court drama will bring in lots of viewers!”

According to the source, one of Jenner’s biggest concerns is for the fate of her son’s brand – Arthur George Socks!
“Kris is also trying to do damage control right now because she feels like this could really hurt Rob’s business. But as far as Blac Chyna is concerned, Kris will obviously pay her for using this situation on the next season.”

As Radar previously reported, last week Kardashian went on an online tirade against his 29-year-old baby mama by posting naked photos of her on social media, which has since been deleted.
“Kris was upset about this because Rob would not listen to her,” the insider added. “She does not think any woman deserved to be violated like this.”
