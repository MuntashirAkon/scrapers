'Natural Born Killers: The Shocking Truth' Exposes Sick Details of 1965 Crime Spree/n
It’s been 61 years since 18-year-old Charles Starkweather and 13-year-old Caril Ann Fugate executed one of the most chilling and bizarre crime sprees in American history, but their haunting story continues to live on.
The duo went on a two month murder spree and 11 people dead including Caril’s own family. Starkweather died in the electric chair at age 20 and their story went on to inspire the 1994 thriller Natural Born Killers. The horrifying acts also inspired the book Pro Bono: The 18-Year Defense of Caril Ann Fugate by Jeff McArthur.
