Off The Weight Loss Wagon? Rob Kardashian’s Personal Trainer Tells All/n
Take that, Blac Chyna! Rob Kardashian is working on a revenge body, RadarOnline.com can exclusively reveal.
“Rob comes in,” his personal trainer Gunnar Peterson told Radar, adding that the 30-year-old dad “gets after it.”
“He’s so busy with the baby, with his Arthur George socks, with the show, the other show. He’s slammed. So when he’s in town, he gets in and he gets after it.”
Some of the workouts were even caught on camera, Peterson teased, but couldn’t confirm if they were filmed for Keeping Up With the Kardashians.

“We actually filmed a few episodes with him working out which was fun,” Peterson, 54, said. “It was nice to see him turn it back on.”
But, he confessed he doesn’t motivate his client to get to the gym.
“I love when trainers say they motivate — how am I motivating someone who has a baby and who gets paid for a show?” Peterson questioned. “There’s nothing I can say. If they’re not working out, they’re not working out.”
“Your kids motivate you,” he said. “Your legacy motivates you.”

Radar previously reported that the reality star started to lose weight when he first hooked up with his baby mama, Blac Chyna, in 2016. At one point, the diabetic weighed as much as 300 pounds.
But Chyna, 29, and Kardashian split shortly after Dream’s birth in November — and he started to gain weight again.
