Wild Jimmy Webb Admits: I Delivered Drugs To John Lennon!/n
Hard-partying songwriter Jimmy Webb, who penned some of country icon Glen Campbell’s biggest hits,
admits he delivered cocaine to John Lennon and Everybody’s Talkin’ singer Harry Nilsson —
an act he blames on an unwritten code of honor!
“I was sort of called in as the bag man… It was done out of love,” recalls Jimmy,
who got a late call from the party-crazed rockers in 1974.
“Why would you be out in the middle of the night doing a drug run?” he asks in his memoir,
The Cake and the Rain, a title taken from his song MacArthur Park.
“I wasn’t getting paid for it. So there was a loyalty there.
There was an unwritten code that if the Beatles asked you to do something, you did it.” /n
