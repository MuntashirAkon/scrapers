His ex-wife filed for divorce in December 2010, when their daughter Chloe was only 18 months old.

His ex-wife asked for joint legal custody, with sole physical custody being awarded to her. She requested that each party pay their own legal fees, and for Carlson to pay child support, with the court terminating his ability to receive any money from her.
Their divorce was finalized in January 2011. Their custody agreement awarded his ex-wife a substantially larger amount of time with Chloe (78 percent compared to Carlson’s 22 percent), and he was required to pay $400 per month in child support.

But, an order was entered in July 2011 that awarded him three days a week and time with Chloe every other weekend.
It appears he’s taking full advantage of his time with both Blair and Chloe, as he is often seen playing with the actress’ son Arthur on social media.
