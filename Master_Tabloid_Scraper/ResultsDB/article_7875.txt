Teen Allegedly Revealed Plan To Hack 'Inconvenient' Grandpa To Death Online/n
Before allegedly hacking his own grandfather to death, a 15-year-old North Carolina teen reportedly revealed his vicious murder plot through an anonymous messaging app, Radar has learned.
According to The Washington Post, Raistlin Arthur Martin uploaded images of black gloves and a hatchet he bought for the killing, sharing them to Canadian smart phone messaging service Kik. The popular app among teenagers does not verify account information and deletes messages after a certain period of time. Raistlin used the Kik handle EtherealSkull.
Later, Martin told user Sporkus_the_wise that he’d avoid a harsh sentence because of his age, even confessing his reasoning for planning to kill his grandfather: “He’s just kinda inconvenient.”

Twenty minutes after he sent the message, around midnight on August 8, the teen went downstairs, striking his grandfather, 63-year-old Joseph Emmett Naulty, repeatedly with the hatchet, a search warrant affidavit obtained by the Fayetteville, N.C., Observer revealed.
According to court documents, Joseph Ezekiel Naulty heard his father yell “Son oh God no” from upstairs. But by the time he ran to the man’s room, Martin emerged, covered in blood.
“My son, Raistlin Martin, has killed my father with a hatchet,” he said in a 911 call, according to court documents.

Martin, now 16, has been charged as a juvenile with first-degree murder, though prosecutors are pushing to charge him as an adult.
His next court date is scheduled for December 12 in North Carolina’s Cumberland County Juvenile Court.
