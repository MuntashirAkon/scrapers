Love 'Em Or Over 'Em? How Do YOU Feel About Kylie Jenner??/n

We haven't totally figured out Kylie Jenner.
We mean, on one hand, she seems to be the most successful of the Kardashian-Jenner clan. She's covering magazines, her lip kits have made a fortune, she even has her own KUWTK spinoff.
On the other, it seems like no one is interested in watching that shit, her clothing line is being accused of stealing, and even her own brother seems to think she looks like a Muppet.

People may actually dislike her more than any of her sisters â€” and that's a pretty controversial fam in which to hold that distinction.
