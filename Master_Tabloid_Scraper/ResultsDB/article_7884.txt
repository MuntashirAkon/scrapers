According to TMZ, the 29-year-old former stripper is actually the breadwinner of the pair as she makes a ton of money on appearances and hosting gigs. Rob, on the other hand, isn't raking in much dough at all outside of KUWTK.
Dang, y'all really aren't buying those Arthur George socks, huh??
Anyway, it sounds like Dream spends the most time with Rob and even though custody will most likely be split down the middle… he's the one with the case for going after support.
Didn't see that one coming!
