Arthur Chatto may only be 23rd in line to the throne, but he certainly isn't shying away from the limelight. The 18-year-old, who is the grandson of Queen Elizabeth II's sister Princess Margaret, took to Instagram on Thursday to flaunt his buff bod.

We have no idea what he means, but we're sure it'll be trending online soon enough. LOLz!
Ironically, this thirsty post comes only a month after Prince Harry said that no on in the royal family really "wants to be king or queen." Hmmm, after witnessing this saucy pic, we're guessing SOMEONE in the fam would like a bit more attention.
And attention is EXACTLY what Arthur has gotten himself from uploading this snap. We mean, countless people have flocked to the image to weigh in on Chatto's sexiness. Some comments include:
"Would royally smash 😂"
"Well I guess I found my prince 😍😭"
"On my knees for the prince… ready 😂"
"That moment when he's royalty and cute 😍"
HIGHlarious! And for all of you innerested in Queen Elizabeth's grandnephew, here are a few fast facts — a) he recently graduated from the famous Eton College, b) the former page boy had a concentration in military learning, and c) he plays the bagpipes.
Enjoy the pic, ladies and gents, because we're sure the royal family will order him to take it down soon enough…
