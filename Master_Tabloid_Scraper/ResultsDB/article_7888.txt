When it comes to money, Blac Chyna is having way more success in making bank than her former fiancé, Rob Kardashian.

Though Rob may have the Kardashian name, Chyna is actually the one who earns more money, according to TMZ. As the couple continue to negotiate a formal custody agreement for their daughter, Dream, it’s been revealed that Chyna will be the one who will have to hand over cash to Rob should her ex request child support.
Though neither have request any financial help from the other, Rob has more claim to child support as he’s the parent who spends most of his time with Dream. On top of that, the Arthur George sock designer earns very little outside of Keeping Up with the Kardashians, while Chyna has a lucrative career in hosting parties and making club appearances.
The two are said to be close to reaching a settlement.
In the meantime, it seems Chyna continues to take advantage of her time in the spotlight by taking up as many gigs as possible. This week, she sparked rumors of launching a music career after she was seen taking a meeting at the Capitol Records Building in Hollywood.
