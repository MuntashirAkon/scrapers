Blac Chyna had a blowout celebration for her 29th birthday, but Rob KardashianÂ didnâ€™t take part in any of it.

Chyna rang in her birthday on Wednesday night ahead of her birthday on Thursday (May 11, 2017) with her best friend Paige, her mom Tokyo Toni, and a group of more close pals. Noticeably absent was her estranged fiancÃ©e, who was very busy promoting his Arthur George socks on Instagram at the time.
