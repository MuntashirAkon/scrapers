Halle Berry ended her Oscars evening by ditching her gown to go skinny dipping.

Berry shared a sexy slow-motion video set to Bruno Mars’ “Versace on the Floor” that showed her running toward her pool and gracefully shedding her Versace gown to take a dive in the buff. Lest we remind you that Berry made a vocal cameo on Mars’ “Calling All My Lovelies” from his latest album, 24K Magic.
“After a long award show a girl can’t wait to take it off! @brunomars #24kmagic,” the actress captioned the video.

Photos from the Vanity Fair post-Oscars party showed that 90-year-old producer Arthur Cohn was really doing the most to get close to Berry after the show. He held her in an awkward embrace and went as far as to plant a kiss on her cheek.
