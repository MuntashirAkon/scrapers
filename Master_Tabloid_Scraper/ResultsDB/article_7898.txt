Rob Kardashian’s alleged text messages to Pilot Jones, the singer who suggested that he is the father of Blac Chyna’s unborn child, were written with heated, explicit language.

The LAPD’s Threat Management Unit investigated the text messages that Kardashian sent to Jones after he leaked photos of himself making out with Chyna and insinuated that he impregnated her. TMZ obtained some of Kardashian’s alleged text messages from the LAPD that include homophobic remarks and racial slurs against Mexicans and African Americans. For instance, Kardashian purportedly wrote, “I hope you religious cuz after I beat your ass with about 30 Mexicans u better hope God lets u into heaven,” and “Don’t ever come for me and my wife ever U corny ass n***a,” followed by a string of fist emojis with the black skin tone.
The texts messages are still under investigation, though law enforcement tells TMZ that the texts are “murky and general.” Sources close to Kardashian say that Jones’s decision to file a police report is motivated by hopes that publicity will help his music career.

Back at the ranch, Kardashian and Chyna are keeping the mood light this Halloween in the trippiest Freaky Friday swap that you will witness this season. Chyna and her son King Cairo both dressed up in costume as the Arthur George sock mogul. She shared the following videos of their costumes in motion on Snapchat.
“Why do you want to be Rob for Halloween?” Chyna asks her son.
“Because I like him,” he responds.
