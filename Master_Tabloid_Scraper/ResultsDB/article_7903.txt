Stars usually work with stylists for weeks trying to find the perfect designer look to wear for a red carpet event, but Aisha Tyler just flipped the style script at Monday’s star-studded screening of King Arthur: Legend of the Sword in Hollywood wearing a fast fashion dress that you can pick up at your local mall. The Talk co-host took in the new film wearing a Zara dress that set her back just $129 — and you can add it to your own closet with a few clicks of your mouse.
The jacquard minidress showcased Tyler’s legs and featured built-in bling thanks to a lapel collar with gems and sequin patches resembling birds. She accessorized with see-through heels and minimal jewelry.
While star Charlie Hunnam got whipped into shape through the movie’s intense fight scenes, Tyler previously told PEOPLE that she sticks to a “modified paleo diet” to feel her best.

“This means that for the most part, I avoid refined carbohydrates, grains, dairy and sugar,” the 6′ actress and talk show host said. “That said, I’m not super strict. I try to be as disciplined as I can during the week so that I can eat what I want on the weekends, which includes pasta, bread and other fun stuff.”
As for her favorite splurges, Tyler goes for “a bit of organic dark chocolate in the afternoon or a great, well-made cocktail at the end of the day.”
