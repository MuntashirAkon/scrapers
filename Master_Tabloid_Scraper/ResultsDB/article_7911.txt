Even if you live under a rock, you've probably seen them, and know what we're talking about.In a statement to the Associated Press, WGBH spokeswoman Ellen London noted that the network is  ‘‘disappointed by the few that are outside of good taste.'' She went on to say, ‘‘Our hope is that Arthur and his friends will be depicted in a way that is respectful and appropriate for all audiences, including young Arthur fans and their families.''
