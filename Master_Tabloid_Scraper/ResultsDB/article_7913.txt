Arthur and the Invisibles/n
Maybe it was better as a children's book. Adapted from the series by Luc Besson (who directs), this family flick features a sweet setup with likable Freddy Highmore living on a farm with his granny, Mia Farrow. But then Arthur's charms—like the microscopic creatures the boy befriends—become pretty darn invisible.

 You see, the adventuresome 10-year-old wants to save their homestead from real-estate developers and sets out to find treasure hidden among the Minimoys, a subterranean species of elves and fairies in his backyard. Hey, it's better than bugs.  Following clues left by his long-missing grandpa, he enters the Minimoys' fantastical CGI-laden universe. At which point, Highmore morphs into an animated character that looks nothing like the actor but instead a white-haired troll doll. The plucky kid's quest proves predictable and derivative, and brings with it a bunch of busy, uninspired action sequences and a slew of celebrity voiceovers. There's Jimmy Fallon as a chubby sidekick, Snoop Dogg as a Rastafarian who offers them "genie" drinks (hmmm…) and Madonna as a sassy princess who jump-starts Highmore's hormones (which raises weird questions I won't begin to explore). Only David Bowie as an evil emperor makes much of an impression, though he gets saddled with a clumsy "This is why I'm so wicked" monologue when first introduced. The film touts its "dazzling" hybrid of live action and "groundbreaking" CGI, but the visuals can't compare to Happy Feet or any Pixar release. Despite all the talent attached, Arthur's entertainment quotient is almost as mini as the Minimoys.
