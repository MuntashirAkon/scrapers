Caitlyn Jenner -- My Boobs Got More Action ... Than the WNBA/nCaitlyn Jenner's breasts defied the odds last night ... and people won a TON of money because of it ... this according to the gambling site that put up a prop bet on CJ's cleavage.  As we previously reported, BetOnline.ag offered gamblers the chance to bet on whether Caitlyn would show off the gals during the ESPYs -- and before the show, the odds said she would.  But while CJ flaunted a plunging neckline when receiving the Arthur Ashe Award for Courage -- there was NO CLEAVAGE -- so the website says it did NOT pay out for pro-boob bettors.  Surprisingly, the site says 78% of bettors put their money on  "no " -- so the public wins thanks to Caitlyn's classy fashion choice.  Fun Fact -- the site tells us they took more action on the cleavage bet than on the point spread of any of the 4 WNBA games that took place yesterday. /n
