Peter Berg -- Let The Backpedaling Begin ... 'I Respect Caitlyn Jenner'/nPeter Berg's in full damage control mode ... saying he has nothing but the  "utmost respect for Caitlyn Jenner " ... after posting a meme about her earlier today that many people called  "transphobic. "  The  "Ballers " producer /co-star just went to Instagram and wrote,  "I have the utmost respect for Caitlyn Jenner and I am a strong supporter of equality and the rights of trans people everywhere. " It's a much different tone than the one he took earlier -- when he posted an Internet meme that ripped ESPN for giving the Arthur Ashe Courage Award to Jenner instead of a military vet.   The original meme Berg posted included a pic of both a double amputee military vet and Caitlyn Jenner and included the caption,  "One man traded 2 legs for the freedom of the other to trade 2 balls for 2 boobs. "  In his new Instagram post, Berg tries to clarify his stance -- saying,  "I also believe that we don't give enough attention to our courageous returning war veterans, many of whom have sacrificed their bodies and mental health for our country and our principals- principals that include the freedom to live the life you want to live without persecution or abuse. "  So far, Caitlyn has yet to respond to any of Berg's comments. /n
