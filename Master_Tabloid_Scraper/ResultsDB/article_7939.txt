D. L. Hughley -- Caitlyn Jenner ... She Looks Like My P.E. Teacher  (VIDEO)/nD.L. Hughley thinks it's absurd the legacy of Arthur Ashe lives on in Caitlyn Jenner, who simply  "put on a dress. "  Hughley was in NYC Thursday and was as clear as he could be ... it's a travesty that the ESPYs passed over Lauren Hill (the college basketball player who passed away this year from cancer) in favor of Caitlyn.    The comedian didn't stop there, trashing the way Jenner looks, comparing her to a Robin Williams character.    And D.L.'s incredulous that members of the media dare to describe Serena Williams as man-like when, as he puts it, Caitlyn looks like a P.E. teacher.  /n
