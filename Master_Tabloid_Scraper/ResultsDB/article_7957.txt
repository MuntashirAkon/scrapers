As Radar readers know, Ripa claimed she was completely blindsided by show executives when Michael Strahan announced his plans to leave the show for GMA last summer without informing her first.
She’s been hosting Live! solo for some time, with several co-host candidates appearing on the show, including Jerry O’Connell and Fred Savage.
