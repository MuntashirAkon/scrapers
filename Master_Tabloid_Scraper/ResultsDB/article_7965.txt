Mom Of 'Affluenza Teen' Ethan Couch Working As A Bartender!/n
Now that she’s under police watch, Tonya Couch, mom of the “affluenza teen,” is a working woman!
As Radar has extensively reported, son Ethan, 18, famously avoided jail time for a deadly drunk driving accident — killing four people — by claiming “affluenza” (wealthy entitlement clouding his judgment).
Now, according to new reports, Tonya, 49, is working as a bartender at diver bar Honky Tonk Woman in Azle, Texas.

Bar owner Darrell Collins said she’s been working there for two months already, making mixed drinks and serving customers — all while wearing her ankle monitor.
Though she’s permitted to serve alcohol, the shamed mother is not allowed to consume any of it herself.
As Radar readers know, Tonya fled to Mexico with son Ethan earlier this year after a Twitter video surfaced that seemed to capture him violating his parole at a drinking party.
The pair was later caught in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, after she made the mistake of using her cell phone to order Domino’s Pizza.

When the fugitive pair had been returned to the United States, Tonya was placed on house arrest, while Ethan had his case officially moved to adult court.
Tonya could be sentenced to up to ten years in prison for her role in Ethan’s probation violation.
Meanwhile, Ethan’s father, Fred Couch, was involved in a domestic disturbance in January after he allegedly choked his girlfriend.
There’s no doubt about it, this is a family of winners! /n
