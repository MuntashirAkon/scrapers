The couple learned the good news in April while celebrating Eklund’s 40th birthday in Paris. “That was probably the biggest moment of my life,” he says. “I felt like it was meant to be, which is hard for me to say because it’s been so difficult.”
After their surrogate suffered multiple miscarriages, Eklund began feeling discouraged about the in vitro fertilization process. “It felt like every time I went onto Facebook or Instagram, all that I could see were these smiling babies on my feed,” he says. “I was reminded constantly that there was this gap between me and where I wanted to be.”





 Best week of my life. 🙏

Although he says he “did regret sharing so much,” on the show during the last pregnancy, Eklund found inspiration from those who reached out because of it. “A lot of people were sharing their experiences, and they just said, ‘You’ve got to continue. Do not give up. It is going to happen,’ ” he says.
The Sweden-born, New York-based star also attributes his ability to persist through their struggles to his husband. “Derek was the best,” he says. “He’s much more calm than I am.”
Kaplan is already a dad to son Kai; about eight years ago, he donated his sperm to a couple he met in London, where the 7-year-old now lives full-time with his moms.
