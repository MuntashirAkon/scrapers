Fred Willard just can't keep it zipped. So to speak.First it was—well, at this point we all know what it (allegedly) was, so no need to put that mental image back into our collective imaginations.Now it's his mouth that he's giving free reign, as this morning he finally broke his silence in the wake of his arrest for his alleged (and blessedly detail-free...now's as good a time as any to praise the vagueness of this particular law) engaging in a lewd act in an adult theater.So, what did he have to say about his headline-grabbing "misunderstanding" experience?

Well, rather fittingly, he was a bit of a tease. And, lest we be in danger of losing sight of his comedic chops amidst all this unseemliness, rather funny."Wait til u hear my version; much more PG. & my review, lousy film, but theater would make a terrific racquetball court," the 72-year-old tweeted this morning. Everyone's a critic, eh?"Full story 2 follow."But not before clearing up one other thing."I was not fired from TUWYL so B sure 2 watch Trust Us With your life Tues, ABC 9."Hey, any publicity is good publicity, right? They better hope so.Willard has agreed to enter a diversion program and will not face prosecution.
