You'd think if Billy Ray Cyrus was looking to collaborate with someone, he'd choose a fellow country star, or heck, maybe take a page out of Miley's playbook and give Robin Thicke a call.But no, the "Achy Breaky Heart" crooner dialed up Fred Durst—the rap-rocker best known for fronting Nu-metal band Limp Bizkit and writing songs like "Nookie" and "Rollin'"—and invited him to perform his Creed-sounding song "Lately" with him on The Arsenio Hall Show Thursday, Oct. 3.It's probably the most cringe-worthy unusual pairing since the trainwreck that was Fred performing with Christina Aguilera at the 2000 MTV VMAs.And keep an ear out for the Miley reference Durst worked into one of his rhymes, too.
