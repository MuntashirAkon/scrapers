Fred Armisen in Jeopardy?/n
Thanks to Jeopardy!, this week our great nation was boggled by the extraordinary question-answering abilities of Watson, a computer who (that?) won the big bucks from Alex Trebek. But what's a computer going to do with all that money, pay for a Saturday night rebooting session with some cheap foreign calculators?Now The Soup has its very own machine to rival the skills of Watson, thanks to tech wiz Fred Armisen, who took time away from hanging out at Radio Shack fondling diodes to drop in on Joel and display his creation. Good thing, as there are so many unanswered questions on this show.Like, When can I see the next Soup on my television? Tonight at 10 p.m. ET/PT!
