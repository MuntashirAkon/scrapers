Justice For Christina! Grimmie Wrongful Death Lawsuit Goes To Court/n
Christina Grimmie’s family will face off against the company they believe could have saved her in court, RadarOnline.com can exclusively reveal.

The Orlando Philharmonic Orchestra Plaza and AEG Live recently filed a Motion to Dismiss the suit, and the hour-long hearing will decide the matter.

Radar previously reported that Grimmie, 22, was gunned down during a concert meet-and-greet over the summer. James Loibl, 27, shot The Voice singer twice during his brutal attack.
Adam Levine, her mentor, offered to pay for the entire funeral shortly after the news broke.
Six months later, her dad Albert filed a lawsuit against the event organizer, AEG, and the owner of the Plaza Live Theater (where she was shot), claiming that they could have prevented Christina’s death through better security.
The companies fired back that his claims were false, and that they are not at fault.
