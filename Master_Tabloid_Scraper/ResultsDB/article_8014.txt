Even MORE Debt! Caroline Manzo’s Husband Slapped With THIRD Tax Warrant/n
The Real Housewives of New Jersey cast is awash in financial issues! RadarOnline.com has learned that the Manzo family has been hit with yet another tax bill.
A New York State clerk confirmed to Radar exclusively that Al Manzo was slapped with a tax warrant for $1,624.05 on May 7, 2013 — but now he owes $1,809!

The clerk noted that the warrant was in regards to sales tax.
“Sales tax is collected by businesses on behalf of state and local governments,” the clerk explained. “So when a business doesn’t remit that sales tax, then we will bill the business and we’ll usually bill the business a couple of times.”

“Generally we’ll call the business,” he told Radar. “Sometimes we’ll have representatives visit the business to try to get them on track, and then if none of that succeeds the next step is to go to a tax warrant collection process.”
“A tax warrant is basically a lien,” the clerk concluded. “It gives us the authority to pursue collections actions, seize bank accounts and other financial assets as well as off set refunds.”
As Radar previously reported, Caroline’s husband also owes $208,012.77 in New Jersey state taxes from 2015. He was slapped with a lien for $105,983 in 2004 as well, but paid it off within a year.

Al, 56, was also hit with a civil judgment for $13,075 in regards to the Brownstone, and was ordered to pay $6,132 to an elevator company after the case defaulted.
The Paterson, N.J. banquet hall has been the scene for many events on The Real Housewives of New Jersey, including Dina’s infamous charity event in season two.
The Brownstone also hosted Lauren’s wedding on Manzo’d With Children — which is returning to Bravo next month. /n
