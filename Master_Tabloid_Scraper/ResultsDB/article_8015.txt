More Money Woes! Caroline Manzo's Husband Forced To Pay $6K In Brownstone Complaint/n
Albert Manzo must pay $6,132 to Frank and Son Dynamic Elevator Services Inc. on behalf of The Brownstone, RadarOnline.com has learned.
A clerk from the Superior Count Special Civil Part in Passaic County, New Jersey confirmed to Radar exclusively that the case against the Brownstone House defaulted on July 25, 2016.
The elevator company was granted the automatic default after the Brownstone failed to file an answer to the complaint filed on June 9, 2016.
