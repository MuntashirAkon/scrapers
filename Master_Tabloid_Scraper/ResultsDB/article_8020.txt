7 of 9    #rip #garyshandling an amazing showing for a man who was not only a part of the  Thursday's boys dinner, he may be the reason this amazing group of friends has been meeting for close to 500 Thursdays in a row. Great respect for a kind and incredibly talented man #zachschiller @ryanphillippe @jessestern @jessebradford @bwash @cremdon @tyleramitchell @breckinmeyer @sarahkatesilverman @therealjeffreyross A post shared by Craig's Restaurant (@craigsla) on Mar 24, 2016 at 11:53pm PDT
On Friday, just days after Shandling died of a massive heart attack, friends gathered at dinner and posted this photograph on Instagram. The caption read, "An amazing showing for a man who was not only a part of the Thursday's boys dinner, he may be the reason this amazing group of friends has been meeting for close to 500 Thursdays in a row. Great respect for a kind and incredibly talented man."8 of 9    Yesterday we lost our most brilliant comic mind & I lost the most generous loving mentor & friend. Who will I guard?

The source told Radar, "The hardest thing for everyone to understand is why Garry had to go first. He was such a light in so many lives and that is how everyone wanted to remember him."

"After one last game of basketball at his house, which was a tradition, they went around and shared the one funniest moment that they will remember Garry by. There was a lot of laughing and a lot of tears, but everyone got the closure that they wanted from this," said the source.
