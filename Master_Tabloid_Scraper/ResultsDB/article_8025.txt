Minaj announced the tragic incident in a tweet Wednesday: “Two members of my team were stabbed last night in Philly,” she wrote. “One was killed. They had only been there for two days rehearsing for the tour.”
Che’ Bar remained open Wednesday, even as police continued their crime scene investigation.
According to local news station NBC 10, witnesses say the men got caught up in a bar fight that may have involved an employee who was recently fired.
“We believe that both of the victims, as well as the perpetrator, were all inside of this bar and that’s when an argument started,” said Chief Inspector Scott Small.
