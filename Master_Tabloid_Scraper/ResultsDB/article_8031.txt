According to a message posted on the singer's Facebook page, the 66-year-old took a spill after his concert on Sunday night and badly gashed his head.
The singer's team explained in the post: 
"Phil suffers from "drop foot" as a result of a back operation which makes it difficult to walk. He rose in the middle of the night to go to the toilet and slipped in his hotel room, hitting his head in the fall on a chair."
The singer was taken to the hospital where he had stitches for the severe gash near his eye. He is being kept under 24 hour observation and is recovering well.
This week of performances marked the In the Air Tonight singer's first shows in 10 years. But due to his injury, Collins' Thursday and Friday performances at the Royal Albert Hall in London will be postposed.
We wish Collins a speedy recovery. Read the full message (below).
