Previously known as the British Fashion Awards, the 2016 Fashion Awards assembles fashion designers, brands and models to compete in the world’s fashion scene.
The ceremony was held on Monday (Dec. 5, 2016) at the Royal Albert Hall in London, and all the glamorous people were in attendance. Nominee Gigi Hadid, who is up for the award of Best International Model against both her little sister Bella Hadid and best friend Kendall Jenner, wore a silver one-shouldered Versace jumpsuit with a caped skirt cut away and trousers underneath.
Meanwhile, Lady Gaga looked stunning in an elegant black halter-top gown, designed by Brandon Maxwell.
