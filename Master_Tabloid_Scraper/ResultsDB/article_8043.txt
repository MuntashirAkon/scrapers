Emma Roberts proved that she’s quite the bibliophile when she hit the beach in Miami to catch up on some summer reading. Clad in a bright pink bikini, the actress was enjoying a chilled coconut as she lounged by the shore with a gal pal.

According to Roberts, she’s currently deep into finishing Sara Majka’s Cities I’ve Never Lived In. “Breathtaking, lyrical, and thought provoking,” she wrote on her Instagram about the paperback of short stories. “Don’t want it to end!”
