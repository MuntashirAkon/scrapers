As for hanging with Kylie, Albert said, "She's a really sweet and genuine person. When you see her on shows and stuff you really don't get to see that like face to face. And I really thought she was sweet and genuine."So did Albert go in for a little kiss at the end of their night? "I actually did not try it," he smiled shyly. "I was a complete gentleman." Too cute!
