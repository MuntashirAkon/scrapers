Reynolds was perhaps best known for singing and dancing her way into Gene Kelly's heart as Kathy Selden in 1952's Singin' in the Rain, one of the most famous movie musicals of all time.She also garnered the praise of younger generations as the endearing grandma Aggie in Disney Channel's Halloweentown and for her role on Will & Grace as Grace's (Messing) overbearing mother.Our thoughts go out to Fisher and Reynolds' family during this devastating time.
