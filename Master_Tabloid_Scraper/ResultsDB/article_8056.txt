Fat Albert/n
After lambasting African-American entertainers over the last few years, Bill Cosby gets a chance to show everyone how it's done with the live version of his '70s cartoon. Hey, hey, hey, it's a world filled with wide-eyed silliness, an Afterschool Special message and a member of B2K as the main nemesis. Fat Albert (Kenan Thompson) and gang magically jump from the TV into North Philly (looks just like the Fox lot) to help a sad high schooler (Kyla Pratt).

 But while assisting, they lose their own identities, and we learn a little something about being yourself--between the double-Dutch scenes and polite rap version of the theme song at the block party. It's pretty painless viewing, but the uneven suspension of disbelief (some people know Fat Albert and some don't, even though the DVD is for sale at the corner store) and its obviousness will only appeal to little ones. The rest will write this off as a bit of fluff from the junkyard.
