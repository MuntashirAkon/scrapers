Marv Albert: The Day After/n
Marv Albert's sexual assault trial flamed out Thursday, and with it, his career as a top-paid sportscaster. On the day after, experts were trying to assess what happened--and why. Perhaps most disturbing (to Albert's side, anyway) were indications that jurors weren't ready to hang the "Yesss!" man when he short-circuited the proceedings and pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor count of assault and battery.              One member of the Virginia jury said she "still had some reasonable doubt." The proceedings were damaging to both sides, she said--hurting the credibility not just of Albert (portrayed in court as a wig-crowned, back-biting, panty-wearing, garter-sporting lover)--but of his accuser.              "I don't think anyone's completely innocent in this," 27-year-old Kerri Nelson told the Associated Press.              And then there's the taxi driver--the star defense witness who never got a chance to testify. Walter "Biggie" Brodie, 57, told Thursday's Larry King Live that Albert's alleged victim was an "evil woman."              Brodie was prepared to tell jurors that the woman--Albert's lover of 10 years--wanted him to lie about Albert and claim that the longtime voice of the NBA Knicks and NHL Rangers asked him to procure "a boy" for a threesome. The woman also bragged about how she had intended to sue Albert for $3 million, according to Brodie.              There also was speculation Friday that Albert brought the trial to an abrupt end because he was afraid that more mud was about to be slung his way.              Friday's New York Post reports that prosecutors were prepared to call to the stand a "raven-haired transvestite" who reputedly had a 15-year affair with Albert. "I suspect that Marv learned they had located this guy and he decided to fold," an unnamed source tells the newspaper.              The man, a former Broadway dancer described as "Lawrence Taylor in a wig," was to corroborate tales of Albert's penchant for ladies' undergarments, according to the Post.              On Geraldo Rivera's CNBC talk show Thursday, Albert defense lawyer Roy Black, saying he didn't know who else the prosecution intended to bring to court, conceded that he was afraid of his client's life "being paraded out there."              The embarrassments of the week already cost Albert both his longtime NBC and Madison Square Garden cable network gigs--jobs that netted him an estimated $2.5-3 million a year. One sports marketing expert said the announcer's future as a TV pitchman is "dead."              An expert in corporate crisis management told Associated Press that the best thing Albert can do for his career right now is to do a mea culpa with Larry King and Barbara Walters--and after that, "he should go away."
