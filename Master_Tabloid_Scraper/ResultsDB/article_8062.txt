Weeds has sprouted a new star.   E! News confirmed Monday that actor-filmmaker Albert Brooks has signed on to  appear in at least four episodes of the Showtime comedy's upcoming new  season.  The past Oscar nominee will lend his signature neurotic touch to the role of  Len, the estranged father-in-law of Mary-Louise Parker's character, Nancy  Botwin, according to a network rep.  It was the death of Len's son, Judah (Parker's real-life ex-beau, Jeffrey  Dean Morgan), that propelled Nancy into the bowels of suburban pot-dealing. 

This will be the first live-action, small-screen character role for Brooks  since his '70s-era appearances on such fare as The New Dick Van Dyke  Show and Love, American Style. His non-talk show or Saturday  Night Live TV appearances over the past 15 years have been limited to some  sporadic voice-over work on The Simpsons. Brooks, 60, most recently directed and starred in the not-quite-documentary  Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World, in which he plays a comedian named Albert Brooks who's dispatched by the U.S. government to India and Pakistan to find out what makes the locals laugh.  The fourth season of Weeds premieres June 16. Per Showtime's press release heralding its debut, "Nancy & Co. relocate to the fictional beach town of Ren Mar on the San Diego/Mexico border to set up shop with a new front biz thatâ€™s...pregnant with possibilities." (Season three hits DVD on June 3, giving fans just enough time to brush up.)  Furthering the questionable-career-choice theme on Showtime this season will  be the self-explanatory Secret Diary of a Call Girl, a British sitcom  about a secretary who moonlights as a high-class hooker, which premieres after  Weeds.
