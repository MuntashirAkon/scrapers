Marv Albert Injured in Auto Accident/n
Talk about a close call.          Marv Albert, the nationally renowned sports commentator best known for his trademark "Yesss!" call after big plays, and his TV partner, former NBA coach turned analyst Mike Fratello, were hospitalized early Thursday morning with minor injuries after their limousine slammed into a stalled delivery truck on a New Jersey highway.          Both Albert, 60, and Fratello, 55, sustained minor cuts and bruises and were admitted for observation to Fuld Campus of Capital Health System in Trenton.  Albert also suffered a concussion in the accident that occurred at 2:55 a.m. ET  in the southbound lanes of Interstate 295, just outside of Hamilton Township, five miles east of Trenton.            A hospital spokeswoman said Albert remained in the hospital in "good condition" while Fratello was discharged earlier this morning.          "Vital signs are stable and within normal limits. Patient is conscious and comfortable,"  Albert's physician, Dr. Louis D'Amelio, says in a statement. "[Albert was] admitted to the surgical trauma unit for observation with an ankle sprain, contusions and a concussion."  He will likely be released Friday or Saturday.           Fratello was treated for minor injuiries, mostly "contusions and abrasions" (doctorese for bruises and scrapes) and checked out at 9 a.m., according to the spokeswoman while Michael Breges, the driver of the limo, was said to be in "good condition" after suffering a fractured hip and head injuries.          The two men in the delivery truck walked away unharmed. Police say the accident is under investigation.          A spokesperson for NBC Sports says the Peacock has called on another of its all-star announcers, Bob Costas, to fill in for Albert while he sits out this weekend's playoff games to mend.          Costas will handle the play-by-play chores alongside analyst Mike Dunleavy and sideline reporter Andrea Joyce when the Indiana Pacers face off against the New Jersey Nets in New Jersey on Saturday. The team will also work Sunday's game in Boston when the Philadelphia 76ers take on the Celtics.          Fratello, the former coach of the Atlanta Hawks and Cleveland Cavaliers who re-signed with NBC last October as a color analyst, will also miss this weekend's games.            Albert fell from grace when he pleaded guilty in September 1997 to biting a woman during a sexual tryst at a Virginia hotel and was immediately fired by NBC.  He served no jail time and, after staying out of trouble for a year, the assault conviction was expunged from his record.  The network subsequently rehired the sportscaster two years later.          Albert's sidekick Fratello is known to NBC viewers as the "Czar of the Telestrator"--a nickname bestowed on him by Albert.  The pair, hailed for their great chemistry calling games from the sidelines, have often been more entertaining than some of the teams they cover.
