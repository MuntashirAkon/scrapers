Marv Albert Comes Back (Again)/n
The exile of Marv Albert is officially--and (just about) completely--over.          The disgraced sportscaster will return to coast-to-coast broadcasting duties April 2 when he calls a Los Angeles-Phoenix NBA game for cable's TNT.          Albert, absent from national TV since his tawdry, back-biting assault trial in 1997, inked what's described as a multiyear deal with the network Monday. Terms were not disclosed.          "A year ago, I was just wondering if I'd get back," Albert said at a Monday press conference, "but I think everything has turned  out well in the long run when you look at my life."          The "Yesss!" man was NBC's top hoops man until shortly before the start of the 1997-98 season. He was canned for pleading guilty to biting a lady friend during a hotel encounter. The trial, featuring tales of panty-wearing and wig-pulling, left Albert's career in ruin.          The rehabilitation began last year when a New York City cable station hired him to host a local Sportscenter-esque broadcast. And on February 8, he returned to the broadacast booth--at least the radio end, calling a local game for the New York Knicks. (Prior to the trial, Albert was the longtime--and signature--voice of both the Knicks and hockey's New York Rangers.)          "Everyone has been so favorable in New York at the games and walking on the street," Albert said. "I just hope it continues and people continue to react that way."          "But it's out of my control."         The TNT plan calls for Marv to call six regular season games, plus handle some playoff work. He'll be a fulltime member of the network's broadcast crew starting next season.           Turner Sports executive Mike Pearl said the network has "confidence in our decision" to hire Albert.          "The concerns we  had were that he was taking care of himself on a personal note," Pearl said.
