Joe Jackson Reportedly Suffers Stroke/nJoe Jackson has reportedly suffered a stroke that left him at the very least temporarily blind. Jackson family sources confirm to TMZ, Joe was admitted to the Albert Einstein Hospital in São Paulo after reportedly waking up Sunday feeling dizzy, with no vision. Joe, who has diabetes, was in the city for his 87th birthday party that was being thrown for him. These pics were taken hours before the reported stroke.   Family sources tell TMZ, doctors are running tests and they're trying to decide whether to fly Joe back to the U.S. for further treatment.  /n
