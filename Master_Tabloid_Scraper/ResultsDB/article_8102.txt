Smooth Move? Jen Allows Ben To Stick Around — Despite Their Divorce/n
Ben Affleck might have moved most of his stuff into his new residence in Hollywood, but that doesn’t mean he’s willing to leave Jennifer Garner and his family behind for good.
“He and Jen have agreed to keep his quarters on the property they shared intact so he can come and go as he pleases for the kids,” an insider said of Violet, 11, Seraphina, 8, and 5-year-old Samuel.
“However Ben spends way more time there than in his new pad, which he finds eternally boring and too quiet,” added the source.
