VOTE: Open Weed Bars At Weddings Are Becoming A Thing & People Are Pretty Lit About It — Would YOU Do It?/n

It's a nice day for a… high wedding.
Marijuana legalization has opened a pandora's box of exciting new, weed-themed activities and excursions — and it was only a matter of time until the wedding industry got in on the celebration.

Wedding planning companies are offering edibles, weed bouquets, and even full open cannabis bars in states where it's legal.
Naturally, people were quick to chime in on the subject. While most were in favor, some made it clear they would regretfully decline an invitation to a weed wedding, and others had some burning questions.
