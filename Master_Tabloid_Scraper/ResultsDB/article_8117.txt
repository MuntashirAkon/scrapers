Naomi Watts has found love with her onscreen husband.

The Gypsy star is quietly dating Billy Crudup, who plays her spouse on the Netflix series, according to People and Page Six.
Though neither have confirmed the romance, the couple were recently spotted hand-in-hand while grabbing some coffee at a Tribeca café over the weekend. An eyewitness told Page Six the pair “looked happy and were laughing a lot, then left again holding hands.”
