Nicki Minaj may have a new man in her life.

The 34-year-old rapper sparked romance rumors after she was photographed canoodling with Nas. In a picture shared on Minaj’s Instagram this week, the two looked quite cozy as they shared a meal at Los Angeles restaurant Sweet Chick.
“Only KINGS recognize QUEENS,” she captioned the shot. “@sweetchicklife has the best food. congrats @nas.”

According to Us Weekly, the duo’s dinner date actually happened on April 30. They reportedly enjoyed a dinner-for-two of chicken wings, mac and cheese, home fries and drinks.
“They were laughing a lot,” an eyewitness told the publication. “They looked very cute together. No PDA, but they looked like a couple.”
As fans know, Minaj has known Nas for quite some time. The two appeared next to each other in Minaj’s 2012 music video for “Right by My Side,” in which they shared a steamy kiss on a park bench. Nas’ “Ether” was also sampled in Remy Ma’s diss track about Minaj, “shETHER.”





Previously, Minaj dated Meek Mill from 2014 to 2016 and  Safaree Samuels from 2002 to 2014.
Meanwhile, Nas was in a five-year marriage with “Milkshake” singer Kelis, with whom he shares 7-year-old son Knight. He also has a 22-year-old daughter named Destiny with former fiancée Carmen Bryan.
