Uber’s former forensic investigator Samuel Ward Spangenberg revealed in a recent testimony that the company’s employees regularly abused and misused the “God View” function to spy on  “high-profile politicians, celebrities and even personal acquaintances of Uber employees, including ex-boyfriends/girlfriends, and ex-spouses.”

Spangenberg went on to name Beyoncé as one of the high-profile accounts that were regularly spied on. Spangenberg is suing the company for age discrimination and whistleblowing retaliation, claiming the company’s head of information security, John Flynn, and HR chief Andrew Wegley, fired him soon after he voiced his concerns about the poor information security.

Spangenberg claims Uber’s ethical issues don’t end with abusing information. He goes on to say the company regularly stores driver and employee information in an insecure manner, leaving the information vulnerable to hacks.
In a statement released to numerous media outlets, Uber did not deny the allegation but tried to reassure users of their commitment to information security. “Uber continues to increase our security investments and many of these efforts, like our multi-factor authentication checks and bug bounty program, have been widely reported,” the statement reads. “We have hundreds of security and privacy experts working around the clock to protect our data. This includes enforcing to authorized employees solely for purposes of their job responsibilities, and all potential violations are quickly and thoroughly investigated.”
