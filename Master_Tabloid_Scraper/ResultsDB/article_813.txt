UN-Making A Murderer! Subject Of Netflix Documentary Freed From Prison/n
Brendan Dassey, focus of the Netflix documentary Making a Murderer, has been sprung from prison pending his appeal.
A judge in Milwaukee ordered Dassey, who was convicted in 2007 and sent to prison for allegedly helping his uncle, Steven Avery, murder photographer Teresa Halbach, be freed pending the outcome of his appeal in the case.
A judge had previously overturned 26-year-old Dassey’s conviction in August, basing the decision on how officials obtained his confession, which his lawyers now say was false and a result of his low IQ.

“The court’s decision rests on a fundamental principle that is too often forgotten by courts and law enforcement officers: Interrogation tactics which may not be coercive when used on adults are coercive when used on juveniles, particularly young people like Brendan with disabilities,” explained Dassey’s lawyers at the time, Steven A. Drizin and Laura Nirider.
The judge warned prosecutors that they would have a total of 90 days — which has now passed — to retry Dassey on the charges or he would be freed from custody.
As part of his temporary release, court documents show that Dassey is forbidden from having any contact with his co-defendant, Avery, or with Halbach’s family.
