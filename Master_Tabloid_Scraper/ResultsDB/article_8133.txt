Samuel L. Jackson Couldn't Care Less That Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie Are Divorcing/n
There is at least one person in this world who is choosing to ignore the hubbub surrounding Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie's divorce, and that is Samuel L. Jackson.In an interview with Good Morning Britain, The Hateful Eight star made it clear that he couldn't care less about the end of Brangelina, news that took over the world Tuesday. "Is it? Really?" he answered when the journalist noted how sad it was."It's life. You know people carry on. People do what they do. There's a huge segment of America that still thinks what he did to Jennifer Aniston was just wrong, and they're just overjoyed that the Wicked Witch lost a husband or whatever," he added. 

"This comes down to the kind of disagreements that sometimes occur between teenage boys and their father. This is where the situation has spiraled from. And Angelina as a mother can be very protective.""It was a typical agreement between parents and kids," says a source. "Things got heated but they were never in physical danger." The source added that "both great parents" to 15-year-old son Maddox, 12-year-old son Pax, 10-year-old daughter Shiloh and 8-year-old twins Vivienne and Knox.While Jackson might be confused as to why so many people are enthralled with this sad ending, we imagine it will only continue to escalate now that Pitt has lawyered up for his divorce battle.
