Leslie Jones has become famous for her live-tweeting sessions of Game of Thrones, but now that the show is on hiatus until next season, the Ghostbusters star has found something new to comment on: the 2016 Rio Olympics.But Jones isn't the only one who is getting in on the excitement in a real-time way; Samuel L. Jackson has easily become Team USA's No. 1 fan on Twitter, live-tweeting events and commenting on individual Olympians as if it were his full-time job—and we're totally here for it. Perhaps the most spirited part of Jackson's tweets is how he ends each one with "Go USA!""Most MUTHAF---A OF A LEG by AquamanPhelps!!! Hella swim by All!! Go USA!!!!" he passionately tweeted after Michael Phelps won the gold.And that's just a small sample of what Jackson brought to the Twitter table. Here are even more of the Pulp Fiction star's tweets:

And if there was any doubting Jackson's dedication to Team USA, rest assured he's really letting his fandom hang out.
