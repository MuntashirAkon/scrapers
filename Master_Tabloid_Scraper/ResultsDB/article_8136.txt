Samuel L. Jackson took home the Lifetime Achievement Award tonight at the 2016 BET Awards.Described as "one of the greatest actors on this god's planet" by presenter Spike Lee, the A-list star was quick to give thanks to his family and close friends for all their support throughout his career. "First I want to thank god for giving me this opportunity even in the beginning. A young man who grew up in a segregated Tennessee, nobody told me I could be this," he shared on stage at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles. "So, here I am, and here you are. Thank god for that."He continued, "It's sort of exciting, I never get nervous, and I can hear my voice shaking and it's strange to hear myself sound that way. But it's been a great ride getting here, as there are a couple people very instrumental in that."From his publicist and lawyer to Aunt Edna and his drama professor at Spelman College, Samuel gave plenty of credit where credit was due.

But when arriving to his family, he explained, "The other two people that challenged me on a regular basis are my foundation and support, my daughter Zoe and my wife LaTanya. The two women that actually found me passed out on the floor after I left somebody's bachelor party and put me in rehab the next day. And supported me and pushed me and give me a reason to get up and go and chase it day after day after day."In concluding his speech, he lightheartedly said, "Lastly, I want to thank everybody in here and in the world has ever bought a ticket, a video, or a DVD with me in it."The 67-year-old Academy Award nominee, most famous for his roles in Pulp Fiction, Django Unchained and Jurassic Park, adds tonight's achievement to his over two dozen awards won over the years. "It's an honor to receive the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2016 BET Awards later this month," Jackson said last week following the network's announcement of his win. "I'm humbled to be recognized by my peers and to join the company of the exemplary recipients before me."Joining Jackson in the lifetime honoree hall of fame include Whitney Houston in 2001, Prince in 2010 and Lionel Richie in 2014.
