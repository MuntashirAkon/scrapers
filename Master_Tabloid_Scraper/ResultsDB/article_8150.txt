'American Gods' Star asks Samuel L. Jackson, Think There's No Racism in England? /nSamuel L. Jackson's got it twisted if he thinks a black British actor doesn't understand a brotha's struggle ... so says  "American Gods " star Ricky Whittle. The British actor was arriving at LAX Monday -- flanked by co-star Ian McShane -- and we asked him for his take after Samuel went on  "Ebro in the Morning " on Hot 97 and wondered what  "Get Out " would have been with an  "American brother " instead of Daniel Kaluuya, a British actor. Check it out ... Ricky doesn't lay into Samuel but does make a compelling case./n
