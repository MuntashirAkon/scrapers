Producer to Fishburne: You're No Sam Jackson!/nA movie company that hired Samuel L. Jackson to star in a big-budget film is pissed off they were forced to settle for Laurence Fishburne instead, this according to a new lawsuit. It's all over a movie called  "Black Water Transit " -- which Jackson was supposed to star in ... until he hurt his back and had to drop out. The movie company -- Capitol Films U.S. -- claims they wanted to scrap the film entirely, but their insurance broker, AON, got them an inferior policy that didn't cover production losses so Capitol would be  "forced " to recast the star.According to IMDB, Capitol has since hired Laurence Fishburne to play the role -- but according to the suit, filed in L.A. County Superior Court, they just wanted to kill the project and cash in on the policy. Capitol claims they lost more than $20 million in the process -- and probably hurt Laurence Fishburne's feelings in the process.  See Also       Samuel L -- TMZ Had Pass to Beat Woody's Ass!
