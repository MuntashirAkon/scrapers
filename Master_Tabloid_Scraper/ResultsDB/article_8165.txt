Michelle Rodriguez -- Note to Minorities ... STOP STEALING WHITE SUPERHERO ROLES!!/nMichelle Rodriguez has a different take in the lack of diversity in Hollywood ... she thinks it's ridiculous to make things right by making superheros less white. Rodriguez was cruising out of Katsuya Friday night when she shot down rumors she's in talks to play the Green Lantern ... while also throwing shade at minorities who play white superheroes. Michelle has evidence it's happening.   Cases in point ... Michael B. Jordan as the Human Torch, Jason Momoa as Aquaman, Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury ... and the online campaign for Idris Elba to become Bond. Rodriguez' beef seems to revolve around the lack of creativity.  Check out the video.  It's interesting.  2:16 PM PST -- Michelle just posted an apology video on Facebook directed towards anyone who took offense ... then offered up a more detailed explanation of what she was trying to say./n
