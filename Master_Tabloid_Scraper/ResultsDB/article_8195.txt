Madison Beer has a few things to say about rumored boyfriend Brooklyn Beckham.

Amid dating rumors swirling around the teen stars, the singer set things straight about her relationship with David and Victoria Beckham’s son, saying she’s “very much single, not ready to mingle” during her latest interview with AOL’s BUILD Series.
“I’m 18 just trying to navigate my life and I’m having fun and there’s obviously boys I can crush on, but I’m very much single,” she says, explaining she’s just “very much focused” on her career at the moment.
Though she may not be dating Beckham, 18, at the moment, Beer is still very close to the up-and-coming model.
“He’s great, though, he’s a cutie, literally one of my best friends. It’s hard because now every time I’m seen with him people are like, ‘Oh my god, they’re boyfriend and girlfriend!’ But we’re seriously best friends,” she said. “We hang out almost every day with our whole group of friends in LA together and he’s moving to New York soon, so we’re just having fun right now and rumors are going to get started.”
