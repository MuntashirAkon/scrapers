Thanks to NBC’s Red Nose Day special, we now know what all of our favorite characters from the film Love Actually are up to today.

The mini sequel aired in the U.K. on Red Nose Day in March and now it’s made its way to the United States. The 16-minute film kicks off with Julia (Keira Knightley) who finds Mark (Andrew Lincoln) waiting outside of her door with his giant notecard once again. The good news is that even though they didn’t end up together, he’s found a new partner in Kate Moss. Meanwhile, Aurelia (Lucia Moniz) tells Jamie (Colin Firth) that she is expecting their fourth child…in Portuguese. This message gets lost in translation.
