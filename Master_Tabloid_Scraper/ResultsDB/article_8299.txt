Amber Rose may have finalized her divorce with Wiz Khalifa years ago, but her legal problems with his family are far from over.

The 33-year-old model has been slapped with a $50,000 lawsuit from her ex’s mother, Katie Wimbush-Polk, for defamation. According to lawsuit, Amber allegedly made derogatory remarks about her former mother-in-law which are “incompatible with her status as a grandmother and her status as a volunteer mentoring at-risk youth.”
Via Revolt TV:
The suit claims that Amber Rose – real name Amber Rose Levonchuck – made a call on June 19 to a phone connected to Wimbush-Polk’s account. Wimbush-Polk didn’t have the phone though, according to the suit; a friend and former employee named Danesa Letic was using the phone in Louisiana at the time of the call.
Lectic’s 5-year-old niece answered the phone, and according to the suit, Rose “launched into a profane attack.”
