No bra. No problem.

Kendall Jenner ditched her bra again when she stepped out Monday, flaunting her nipples in a see-through top as she went shopping in New York City. The 21-year-old model didn’t seem to mind she was flashing her bar breasts to onlookers as she indulged in a little therapy with pal Jordyn Woods.
She paired her risqué look with denim shorts, pink heels, 90s-inspired sunglasses and a Louis Vuitton fanny pack.

Just a day ago, Jenner was spotted wearing an equally revealing sheer cardigan that showed off her nips.
“I really don’t see what the big deal is with going braless. I think it’s cool and I really just don’t care! It’s sexy, it’s comfortable and I’m cool with my breasts. That’s it!” she wrote on her app last year, explaining why she likes to free the nipple from time to time. “It’s also a fun way to show off my different nipple rings.”
As reported, Jenner got her nipple pierced in 2015 during what she called a “rough time” in her life. “I wanted to get the piercing for SO long before Kylie [Jenner],” she shared on her app. “She did hers and then everyone thought I copied her, but I swear I had the idea first.”
