Johnny Depp requested that Amber Heard pays him $100,000 in legal fees following their bitter divorce.
According to the documents obtained by People, the Pirates of the Caribbean actor has already racked up nearly $1 million in attorney’s fees and costs with his lawyer Laura Wasser. In the event that Heard fails to pay within 10 days, Depp asks for permission to deduct the equivalent amount from his next divorce settlement payment.

The new filing also slams the actress’s behavior throughout their divorce battle, stating that she’s acted “erratically” and “uncooperatively.” Of course, this is in reference to Heard’s recent PSA, as well as her open letter about domestic abuse.
“The impact of her relentless pursuit on Johnny — the damage her false allegations have caused his personal and professional reputation, his and his family’s emotional well-being, and his finances appear to be of no interest to Amber,” the documents reads.
A court hearing on this motion is scheduled for Jan. 13, 2017.
