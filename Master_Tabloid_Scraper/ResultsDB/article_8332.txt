Lonzo Ball: Thank You, Jay-Z! Your BBB Shoes Are Coming! /nLonzo Ball says he's incredibly thankful to Jay-Z for ordering 3 pairs of his ZO2 kicks -- but reminds the mogul the shoes ain't coming for another 3 months! We got Lonzo out in Bev Hills over the weekend -- after dropping some cash at Louis Vuitton -- and asked about Jay publicly and privately throwing his support behind the Big Baller Brand.  "I'm just thankful man, " the Lakers rookie said ...  "Appreciate it. " Lonzo says he hasn't met with Jay and doesn't know too much about the business side of the shoe line --  "I just play basketball man. I don't handle that. " As for Jay's one complaint ... that he hasn't received any of the shoes yet -- Lonzo reminded Hov that they aren't scheduled to ship until November.  As we previously reported, Jay appeared on  "Rap Radar " podcast on Tidal last week and told Elliott Wilson and B.Dot that he's backing the BBB brand because it's important for him to help black owned businesses. /n
