Admitting that working out is absolute “torture” for her, the sexy actress says she works out with a trainer three of four times a week.
While her hunky husband Joe Manganiello, 40 – a longtime athlete – reportedly built a gorgeous gym inside their house, Vergara is not persuaded in the least.
“I’m in a bad mood two hours before, I’m in a bad mood while I’m doing it, I’m in a bad mood at the end because I have to schedule the next class,” she confessed.

“I don’t know if I’m strong. I have bad knees and very thin bones; I can barely do a pushup,” claimed Vergara.
Known for her enviable Latina curves, the actress says she has never been too concerned with her figure and muscle definition.
“It’s not about having muscle or cut abs. I don’t have abs,” said the star, because I’ve never felt that “I need to be like a fit model with a perfect body. That would take too much effort!”
The gorgeous mom of one – wh was recently trapped in a legal battle with her ex over her frozen embryos – also admitted that while she has noticed herself aging, and “changing,” it is nothing to get obsessed over. If you care too much about wanting to “look younger, you’re going to go crazy.”
