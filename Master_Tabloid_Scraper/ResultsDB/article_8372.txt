Bob Marley Hired Gambino Mobsters For Protection During NYC Concerts/n
Reggae icon Bob Marley hired Gambino mob soldiers to watch his back during his landmark 1980 shows at New York City’s Madison Square Garden, according to a new biography.
Roger Steffens, author of So Much Things to Say, claims the “I Shot the Sheriff singer” — who still carried a failed assassin’s bullet in his arm from an earlier attack in his native Jamaica — paid the Mafia for protection because he feared another ambush.

According to Steffens, Marley brokered the deal with the late Joe (Piney) Armone at Sparks Steak House — the future site of crime boss Paul Castellano‘s rubout, just five years later.
The wise guys did their job — but no one could save Marley from the cancer that took his life the very next year.
