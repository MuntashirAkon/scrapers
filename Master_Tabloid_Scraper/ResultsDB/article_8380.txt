Da Ya Think Joe Jonas' Porn-Stache Is Sexy? DNCE Joins Rod Stewart For A Performance At The 2017 MTV VMAs!/n

Even time travel isn't enough to save this year's VMAs!
The MTV awards show sent us back to Las Vegas for a DNCE performance straight outta the 1970s.
The indie rock band was decked out in groovy jumpsuits as they rocked out to Da Ya Think I'm Sexy in a disco-era night club.
If the ambiance and Joe Jonas' porn-stache wasn't enough, Rod Stewart joined the performance and they all partied like it was Boogie Nights!
Ch-ch-check it out (above)!
