Just like Luke, Scott Patterson is ready give people their caffeine fix.

The Gilmore Girls star, who played the lovably gruff diner owner during the show’s seven-year run, is taking his ability to brew the perfect cup ‘o joe offscreen by starting his own brand of coffee.
“I’m developing my own coffee brand,” he revealed in an interview with Wealth Management. “We’re almost ready to launch, but we want to have our ducks in a row before we come out with it.”
“Quality coffee is something that I am obsessed with. It’s the thing I look forward to every morning and throughout the day and throughout the evening and now throughout the middle of the night,” he continued. “It’s going to be called Scotty P’s Big Mug Coffee.”

Last year, Scott teamed up with Netlfix to open several Luke’s Diners pop-ups around the country to promote the Gilmore Girls revival. He visited the Beverly Hills location, where he greeted fans and even autographed a sign for the fictional eatery.
“All I can say is that Luke is Luke,” he told Variety at the time. “I think the reason why fans love him so much is because he doesn’t change. He’s kind of a rock that way, so fans are going to get more of that.”
