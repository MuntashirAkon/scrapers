Forget lip kits. Fans are gearing up to drop big bucks on Kim Kardashian’s new face palette.

Taking to her social media accounts, the 36-year-old shared a photo of herself wearing products from her personal beauty collection.
“Creme Contour & Highlight Kit,” she captioned the shot along with the palette’s June 21 release date.

Needless to say, fans are having a hard time deciding how they should spend their money.
