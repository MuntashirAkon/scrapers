Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas Out at Comic-Con with Bodyguard/nJoe Jonas is probably used to needing a little extra muscle to keep hordes of adoring fans at bay, but at an event like Comic-Con ... his girlfriend Sophie Turner's the main attraction. The couple was spotted out in downtown San Diego Friday night, after the  "Game of Thrones " star hit up the event with Jonas during the day. In case you didn't know ... Sansa Stark's kind of a big deal. So who is Turner's real-life Brienne of Tarth? We're told it's that dude walking a few steps in front of her and Joe. Gotta keep the Lady of Winterfell safe./n
