/n

Laura Prepon has the pregnancy glow – and the cravings to go along with it!
On Thursday morning, the Orange Is the New Black star appeared as a guest on Live with Kelly and Ryan and got candid about her first pregnancy.
Growing up, Prepon’s father would take her to a deli for pastrami sandwiches on rye bread and Dr. Brown’s Black Cherry soda.
“I haven’t eaten that stuff in years,” she said, “and since I’ve been pregnant I’ve been craving kind of like this Jewish deli food, with the pickles and the sauerkraut and mustard. So we kind of delve into that.”
Prepon, 37, and fiancé Ben Foster, 36, are expecting a baby girl in July.
The actress said she’s felt like her pregnancy went quickly: “It’s kind of weird because it sneaks up on you, you’re like ‘I can’t believe it’s been eight months already.’ ”
“But then you’re like, ‘Oh my gosh, she needs to come out already,’ ” she added laughing. “But it’s so wonderful, it’s such a blessing. She likes it in here, she’s already kicking!”
