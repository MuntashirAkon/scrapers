Cowboys Coach Jason Garrett: We Might Cut Lucky Whitehead /nDallas Cowboys head coach Jason Garrett is clearly pissed off about Lucky Whitehead's shoplifting arrest -- and isn't ruling out cutting the WR from the team. After TMZ Sports broke the story, Garrett faced the media after Day 1 of Cowboys training camp and was immediately asked about Whitehead's standing with the team.  "We’re gathering information on it, " Garrett said ...  "We’ll respond accordingly. " When asked if firing Whitehead was a possibility, Garrett said --  "Oh, absolutely. "  "Depending on what the situation is, we’re gonna respond accordingly. Do what’s in the best interest of the Dallas Cowboys. " Whitehead was arrested in June for allegedly stealing under $200 in stuff from a Virginia convenience store. To make things worse, a warrant was issued for his arrest when he failed to appear in court on July 6. Whitehead was asked about the situation after practice -- and said he had no idea what was going on.   Lucky Whitehead:  "I didn't even know about that. "(Any truth to it?) "I don't know what's going on. "(Ever heard about it?) "No. " pic.twitter.com /OII5EbGKe0 — Joe Trahan (@JoeTrahan) July 24, 2017/n
