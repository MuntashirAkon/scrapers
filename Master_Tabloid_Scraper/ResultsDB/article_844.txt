The wedding took place about nine months after Gallacher gave birth to her and Brand's first child, daughter Mabel.Brand and their daughter arrived to the ceremony in a silver Mercedes van, while Gallacher traveled to the church in a white Rolls Royce, accompanied by her father Bernard, The Henley Standard reported."They wanted a very small, personal affair with their daughter Mabel, family and close friends rather than a circus," a source told The Sun. "It was a lovely occasion. Mabel was guest of honor."After exchanging vows, Brand and Gallacher, as well as their daughter, emerged to music from the Brass Funkeys. Guests showered them in confetti, after which everyone made their way to the boat, The Henley Standard said.
