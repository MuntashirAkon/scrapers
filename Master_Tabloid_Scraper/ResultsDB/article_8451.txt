Tragedy To Triumph: Burn Victim Mom Courtney Waldon Finds Love After Heartbreak/n
Courtney Waldon is making a comeback after her worst year ever. Less than a year after she was disfigured in a horrific fire and her husband moved out, the mother to 5-year old Caroline has found love again, RadarOnline.com can exclusively reveal.
“She has found someone,” Waldon’s father, Scott Cosper told Radar. “They’ve known each other since high school, but they met through the church that is building her a house.”
On her Instagram account, the 27-year-old proudly posted a photo with her new man.

According to Cosper, Waldon and her new boyfriend have been dating for about a month and half.
“But she is still not legally divorced.” Cosper admitted. “So I don’t know what they’ll do until she is.”
The Georgia native infamously suffered fourth degree burns to her face and 40 percent of her body after a campfire accident last fall. Two weeks later, she claims her husband took off, and the couple soon divorced.

Her estranged husband, Mitch Cobb, who was also injured in the incident, told Radar that it was not his decision to leave Courtney, but that she called for the split.
“I was there with her night and day, and she was angry with the world, and it spiraled out of control,” Cobb said in an interview with Radar.
“My life has been a whirlwind for the past year. It’s just hard to mentally process all of it. I lose sleep over this every night, the sight, the smells, I can still feel the burns, its hard to sleep at night.”
