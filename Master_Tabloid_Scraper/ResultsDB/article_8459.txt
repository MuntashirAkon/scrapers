Charlie Sheen Slammed With Lawsuit For Exposing Ex-Girlfriend To HIV/n
Charlie Sheen has been sued AGAIN for exposing an ex-girlfriend to HIV, according to court docs filed in Los Angeles County court on Thursday and obtained by RadarOnline.com.
The suit claims the disgraced actor also dissuaded the woman from taking antiretroviral drugs.

While neither Sheen nor the ex are named in the suit, the filing still leaves hints all over, stating that the “confidential male defendant” revealed he was HIV positive in 2011 and gave TV interviews about his illness on Nov. 17, 2015 — the same day Sheen went on Today and revealed his HIV status.
The plaintiff, identified as Jane Doe and described as a “Russian émigré,” is described in the lawsuit as having met Sheen in September 2015, and they quickly began having sex.

She says Sheen insisted he was “fine” after asking him if he had any sexually transmitted diseases. But after the two had unprotected sex, Sheen finally revealed that he was in fact HIV positive, and gave her two pills to prevent transmission.

The following day, the plaintiff went to the emergency room where she was informed she’d have to take the antiretroviral medication for several weeks.
According to the suit, the two got into a heated argument about the exposure in which Sheen blamed her for the exposure and told her he was “noble” for even informing her at all. He also told her that the drugs she had been prescribed were unnecessary, saying not to buy into “the convenient rumors of the medical community.”

The suit also notes the actor’s bizarre statement including how he told her she’d be “fine” as the “Apocalypse” had “cleansed” her soul. “This is more about … not if, but when you do come down with this [HIV], that we’re together and at least we have each other,” the suit quotes him as saying.
The suit also suggests Sheen described himself as “the dumbest f***ing n***** in the room,” while slamming other women who were threatening legal action over HIV exposure, calling them, “assholes, f****** n******.”
