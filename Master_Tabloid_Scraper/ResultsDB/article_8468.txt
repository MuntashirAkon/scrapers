Shia LaBeouf just pulled out his penis for the paparazzi.

The actor raised eyebrows when he exposed himself on the set of The Peanut Butter Falcon in Georgia. While taking a break from filming scenes with Dakota Johnson, Shia was photographed peeing in the water at a nearby beach.
Clad in tattered clothes, the 31-year-old wasn’t shy about his body as he whipped out his junk to relieve himself. Shia was also seen washing his face before returning to work.

However, this wasn’t the first time we’ve seen the Transformers star’s man parts. Shia previously appeared nude in Sigur Ros’ “The Fjogur Piano” music video.
In 2014, The Necessary Death of Charlie Countryman castmate Rupert Grint revealed Shia had also gotten naked when he worked with the Even Stevens alum. According to Rupert, his co-star was more than happy to strip down after taking a hallucinogenic drug as part of his method acting.
“He smashed the place up, got naked and kept seeing this owl,” Rupert remembered. “If anything will make you not do drugs, it’s watching that.”
