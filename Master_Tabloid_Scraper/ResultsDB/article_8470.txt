Blondes don’t actually have more fun. Just ask Bella Thorne.

The Famous in Love star lived out every girl’s nightmare when dyed her hair and absolutely hated the results. Documenting the failed transformation on her Snapchat, the 19-year-old was nearly in tears when she discovered what should’ve been a platinum ‘do became more of a minty in color when she bleached her blue-green tresses.
“Oh my god! No!” she whispered in a video, as a hairstylist tousled her newly lightened locks.
The Disney Channel alum captioned the clip, “Oh my god it’s so ugly.”

Despite the style snafu, Thorne looked to be embracing her new look when she stepped out for Nylon’s Young Hollywood bash at Avenue LA on Tuesday night (May 2, 2017). Clad in a crop top and metallic skirt, the actress happily posed for photos on the red carpet before joining co-stars Charlie DePew, Georgie Flores, Carter Jenkins, and Keith Powers at a VIP booth.
Amber Rose, Zedd, Chantel Jeffries, Christina Milian, and Rowan Blanchard were also spotted mingling with partygoers as guests on nibbled on bites from Luchini.
