Things really are over for Zac Efron and Vanessa Hudgens.

Your favorite High School Musical couple, who dated from 2005 to 2010, are no longer speaking to each other. According to Hudgens, she has severed all ties with the Baywatch star.
While promoting her show  Powerless on Access Hollywood this week, the 28-year-old explained that she doesn’t like to speak about Efron because she’s “completely lost contact with him.”
On the other hand, the actress shared that she was still very close to Ashley Tisdale, whose 2014 wedding she attended as one of the bridesmaids. “I literally just texted Ashley yesterday,” she said. “She released a new video on her website—YouTube—where her niece does her makeup. It was very cute.”

Last year, some of the cast of High School Musical reunited for a TV special celebrating the franchise’s 10-year anniversary. While fans were excited to see Hudgens and Tisdale share the screen with former co-stars Corbin Bleu, Lucas Grabeel and Monique Coleman once again, many were disappointed when Efron did not show up for the in-person reunion. (The actor pre-taped a video message instead.)
“I have nothing but love for the #HighSchoolMusical cast & fans,” he tweeted when fans questioned if he was avoiding his ex-girlfriend. “Wish I could’ve joined the fun in person.”
Apparently, they’re not all in this together.
