Fans have been seeing this music video again and again—enough times for it to officially take the lead. With 2,894,026,649 views, Wiz Khalifa and Charlie Puth's MTV Video Music Award-nominated visual for "See You Again" has officially outranked PSY's "Gangnam Style" to become the most viewed video on YouTube of all time. The milestone comes a little over two years since the "See You Again" video was first uploaded to YouTube on April 6, 2015. "I remember when I signed up for YouTube in 2007 and had hopes of uploading a video and it reaching 10,000 views," Puth said in a statement. "Now a decade later, it feels incredible to be a part of the most-viewed video on YouTube."Before "Gangnam Style" was the titleholder, Justin Bieber's "Baby" was in the lead from July 2010 to November 2012. 

"This was a labor of love. It was in some ways the hardest movie I ever had to do because the relationships that you see on film are so real," Vin Diesel told fans at a Furious 7 screening. "When the tragedy happened I lost my best friend, I lost my brother."As he continued, "We made this movie from our hearts and know that this is our gift to you and more importantly, to my brother."
