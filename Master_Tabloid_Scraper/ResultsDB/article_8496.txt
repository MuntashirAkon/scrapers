Charlie Cox is going to be a first-time father—"very, very soon" in fact.The Daredevil star didn't announce the news that he's expecting his firstborn child via Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat or Twitter; unlike many of his peers, he's not on social media. Instead, Cox nonchalantly revealed he has a baby on the way at a Fan Expo in Canada Sunday. (Earlier that weekend, the 33-year-old actor made an appearance at Dragon Con in Atlanta.)Moderator and Marvel Entertainment chief creative officer Joe Quesada congratulated Cox, who admitted that the timing wasn't ideal. "My girlfriend [was] pretty amused when I said I was going to Toronto a couple weeks beforehand, by the way. And I went, 'So, keep your legs closed."Jokes aside, Cox was "glad" Quesada "brought it up" during Sunday's Q&A session. "I kind of feel like I'm putting you on the spot here," he said, "but one of the things she said to me before I left was, 'If you see Joe, you have to convince him to do a Baby Daredevil drawing for us.'"Quesada obliged, saying, "I can do that."

Cox and producer Samantha Thomas' due date is listed as Sept. 15, according to The Bump. Thomas is a producer who works on two Marvel series: Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. and Jessica Jones.It's been quite a summer for Cox: In July, Netflix renewed Daredevil for a third season. New episodes will debut in 2017, the same year Marvel's Iron Fist and The Defenders also premiere.
