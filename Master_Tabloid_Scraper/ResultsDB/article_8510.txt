Charlie Sheen Introduces New Girlfriend on 'Dark Day'/nCharlie Sheen's beaming with pride and feeling miserable at the same time ... courtesy of his new, smoking hot gf and President Trump. We got Charlie heading into Giorgio Baldi Thursday in Santa Monica to celebrate his daughter's 12th birthday. He paused to launch into the day's burning topics -- Kathy Griffin and the Paris Climate Agreement pullout -- but showed his manners by first introducing us to Jules, his new lady friend. Things got serious though when we asked if Kathy deserved to be fired from CNN -- and got even darker when he talked Trump and the environment. Safe to say, Charlie's down in the dumps ... for Planet Earth./n
