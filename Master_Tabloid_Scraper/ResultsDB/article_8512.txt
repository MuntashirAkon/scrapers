Charlie Sheen Says Original Cast All Coming Back For 'Major League III'/nRicky Vaughn WILL PITCH AGAIN ... so says Charlie Sheen, who tells TMZ Sports he's got the entire cast back on board for  "Major League III " ... and is just waiting for a financier. We got Sheen out in L.A. -- he's looking great BTW -- and asked him what he's working on these days as far as the silver screen is concerned. That's when Charlie broke news ... not only is he working on a new 'Major League' movie, but HE HAS THE ENTIRE ORIGINAL CAST ON BOARD. Not only are the boys all coming back, but Charlie says they've got a dynamite script, and a director, claiming the only thing missing is the biggest component in a Hollywood movie ... THE MONEY. Super exciting news ... we only have one question for Charlie ...Â Wesley Snipes or Omar Epps? Tough one./n
