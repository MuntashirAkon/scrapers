Maybe Ashton Kutcher and Laura Prepon aren't as tight as he thought.The actor guest co-hosted Live! with Kelly Ripa Friday when Prepon's recent engagement to Ben Foster came up. "I'm very upset with her right now. She just announced this engagement, and I had to find out in the news! She's my friend. It's weird like that," Kutcher said. "By the way, it's not just a random engagement. It's an engagement to another friend of mine! So, now I'm double upset that neither of them told me. I got off the plane in New York like, 'What?'"To be fair, Kutcher kept his engagement to Mila Kunis a secret from Prepon back in the day. "When Mila and I got engaged, Pre was like, 'What? This is crazy! You guys, it was like 20 years ago. You were friends and no one saw this coming, and now you're engaged and I have to find out this way,'" Kutcher said. The four actors used to hang out regularly, too. "They were friends 20 years ago!" he recalled. "They're all my friends, and everybody's hooking up, and it's weird!"

There was no denying the facts. "It is true. We've known each other for, what, 20 years, right? Because we all started hanging out in 1998," the Girl on the Train actress said. "Every Friday after our taping, all of our friends would come hang out or whatever, and [Foster] was there."Ripa then told Prepon she had read an article which claimed marriages last longer when the woman is given a round solitaire diamondâ€”which is what Foster gave her. "I know how much you hate talking about this," Kutcher said as his friend blushed. "And it makes me so happy!"
