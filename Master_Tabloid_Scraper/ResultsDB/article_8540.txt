The suspects have been given “arguido” status, which means they have become formal suspects in Portuguese law. Portuguese law enforcement and Scotland Yard detectives will also interrogate eight key witnesses today in the wake of recent searches at Praia da Luz resort on the Algarve.
British police travelled to the town earlier this month to search the area where the McCann family was staying when Madeleine, 3, disappeared in 2007. They searched scrubland near the Ocean Club and two sites on the outskirts of the resort.
