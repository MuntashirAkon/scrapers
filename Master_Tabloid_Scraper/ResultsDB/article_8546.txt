Nickelodeon's Newest Cartoon Introduces Network's First Interracial Gay Couple!/n

The LGBT community just got louder and prouder!
One of the best things about modern children's television is networks' desire to showcase more than just the white, nuclear family on their shows.
Take a look at Nickelodeon, for example — they're about to feature their first same-sex, married couple, who also happens to be interracial to boot!

The Loud House is a cartoon all about a boy named Lincoln trying to survive life with his ten sisters, but his best friend Clyde's parents will finally be introduced on this Wednesday's all-new episode.
Oh yeah… and the gay couple is voiced by none other than Wayne Brady and Michael McDonald!
The Loud House now joins other iconic kids' shows like The Legend of Korra, Steven Universe, Gravity Falls, Clarence, and Good Luck Charlie to feature gay couples, and we cannot wait to see which other series jump on board next.
C'mon, canon Adventure Time Bubbline ship!
