Disney Channel Introduced Its First Gay Male Couple In The Gravity Falls Series Finale!/n

Yay equality!
LGBT representation in children's media is currently at an all-time high, and the Disney Channel just made another huge step forwards on Monday.
After featuring a lesbian couple on Good Luck Charlie back in 2014, the series finale for Gravity Falls made one of the cartoon's shipped male couples canon!

Fans had long suspected that minor characters Sheriff Blubs and Deputy Durland were an item, but after the Sheriff helped save the deputy, they finally admitted their love for one another! 

What makes the news even greater is the finale actually premiered on Disney Channel's sister network Disney XD, which is targeted at boys!
Gravity Falls joins Nickelodeon's The Legend of Korra and Cartoon Network's Steven Universe, Clarence, and — to a lesser extant — Adventure Time as cartoons with out gay characters.
We sure will miss ya, GF!
