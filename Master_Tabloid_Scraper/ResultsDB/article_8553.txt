Thinking about seeing a movie this weekend? Keanu might be the purrrrfect choice.

This weekend, the new comedy from Jordan Peele and Keegan-Michael Key will be arriving in theaters. This caper is packed with familiar faces, lots of laughs, and perhaps the cutest kitten on the face of the earth.
Here’s everything you need to know…
Who’s in it? 
Key and Peele are the co-stars with Will Forte, Method Man, Luis Guzmán, Nia Long, Gabrielle Union and Keanu Reeves filling out the supporting cast.
What’s it about?
After going through a painful breakup, Rell (Peele) is in a rut, but the discovery of a small kitten helps him recover. When the feline, named Keanu, is taken from his home, Rell enlists the help of his friend Clarence (Key) to get his new pet back. But the quest for Keanu quickly gets out of hand and the two are soon dealing with some dangerous gang members.





Why should I care?
If you’ve seen at least five minutes of this duo’s show then you know they are bursting with talent. But that might not be enough to get you in the theater, so why don’t you take a minute and just look at this face…
