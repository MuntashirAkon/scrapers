Olivia Pope, is that you?
No, but close enough. It’s Kerry Washington stepping into the shoes of Anita Hill in an all-new trailer for HBO’s Confirmation. Following the teaser that was released in February, the network debuted an extended trailer on Friday (Mar. 4, 2016) — and boy is it powerful. It features Hill being put under intense scrutiny from the media after she accuses her employer, Clarence Thomas, of sexual harassment shortly before he was confirmed as a Supreme Court Justice.

“I had to tell the truth,” Washtington’s Hill can be heard saying in the video. Her participation in his Supreme Court nomination hearings changed how American culture dealt with workplace equality and gender politics forever. The film also stars Greg Kinnear, Jennifer Hudson, Eric Stonestreet, Jeffrey Wright, and Alison Wright.
Confirmation premieres Saturday, April 16 at 8 p.m. on HBO. Watch it’s trailer above!
