Prince Harry’s glorious beard is in it, too.
On Tuesday (Dec. 22, 2015), Kensington Palace revealed the royal’s 2015 Christmas card, which is a black-and-white photo of Harry with 95-year-old Tom Neil, the last surviving Royal Air Force pilot from the Battle of Britain.
On Harry’s 31st birthday on Sept. 15, he gave up his seat on a spitfire plane for the veteran, so he could take part in a special flypast to celebrate the Battle of Britain’s 75th anniversary. The Prince said that he considered it a great honor to meet Neil and described it as one of his most memorable moments of 2015. Hence why he chose it as his Christmas card.

His Christmas card comes on the heels of Charles and Camilla’s cheerful Christmas card and Prince William and Kate Middleton’s super cute Christmas family photo, featuring their two kids, 2-year-old Prince George and 7-month old Princess Charlotte.
The Royal are such festive folk!
