Sometimes, it’s good to be king — or in this case: just someone in the royal family.

Clarence House recently released its Annual Review detailing the expenditures of Prince Charles and wife Duchess Camilla in the past year. According to the report, the future king doled out approximately $4.6 million to sons Prince William and Prince Harry and daughter-in-law Kate Middleton as their allowance towards “official activities.”
While the palace did not give out specifics as to how these funds were spent, it is said that the money were put towards paying staff, travel costs and the official wardrobe of the royals.

As for Charles, the 66-year-old paid for his expenses by drawing an income from the Duchy of Cornwall, an estate given to the heir to the throne to fund their official and private livelihoods. Per the report, Charles received $31.1 million, which was a 1.7 percent rise from the previous income year.
Both William, 33, and Harry, 30, also received salaries for their respective jobs in the army.
William and Kate, 33, reportedly paid for the refurbishments and upkeep of their private home, Anmer Hall, privately. Their allowance also did not cover the salaries of Prince George and Princess Charlotte’s nanny, Maria Turrion Borrallo.
