'Training Day' Writer David Ayer Files for Divorce After 14 Years/nDavid Ayer -- the guy who wrote  "Training Day, "  "S.W.A.T. " and a bunch of other action thrillers and also directed  "Suicide Squad " -- wants out of his 14-year marriage. David filed for divorce Wednesday in L.A., citing irreconcilable differences. He married Mireya on September 26, 2002 and lists the date of separation as July 29. There's a sign this one is amicable. David's lawyer, disso queen Laura Wasser, checked the box agreeing that her client would pay Mireya spousal support. They have 4 minor children -- 14, 12, 11 and 8. David is asking for joint custody. David -- who also wrote  "The Fast and the Furious " and  "End of Watch " -- will be writing a big check, because we've learned there was no prenup, and we're told he's made a bloody fortune./n
