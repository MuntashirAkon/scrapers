“It’s been a tricky few days, but we’re immensely thrilled,” Prince William, also 32, told reporters during a visit to St. Hugh’s College in Oxford on Sept. 8, hours after announcing the pregnancy news. “It’s great news, and early days. We’re hoping things just settle down and she feels a bit better. I’m going to look after her now.”
The Duchess is due around Spring 2015.
