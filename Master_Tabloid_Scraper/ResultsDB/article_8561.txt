The Queen’s Christmas Message Reveals Behind-The-Scenes Footage of George’s Christening/n
Today, Queen Elizabeth’s annual Christmas broadcast was viewed in homes throughout the Commonwealth, a tradition started by her grandfather, King George V.
This year, the Queen spoke of “striking a balance between action and reflection,” her coronation anniversary and the christening of her great-grandson, Prince George.
“Service and duty are not just the guiding principles of yesterday,” Her Majesty said.  “They have an enduring value, which spans the generations.

“I myself have cause to reflect this year at Westminster Abbey on my own pledge of service made in that great church on coronation day 60 years earlier.”
The Queen also spoke of the new addition to her family, and the happiness it brought.
“Here at home, my family is a little larger this Christmas,” She said as scenes from the christening photocall at Clarence House played.
Traditionally, the royal family gathers around the television at Sandringham to watch Her Majesty’s pre-recorded broadcast, then it’s time for games and relaxing.  Tomorrow, many members will go shooting, as is tradition on Boxing Day.
