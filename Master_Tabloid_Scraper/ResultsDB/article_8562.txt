12 Days of Celebmas: One Future King/n
On July 22nd at 4:24 GMT, HRH Prince George Alexander Louis of Cambridge was born inside the Lindo wing at St. Mary’s Hospital in London.  For the first time in royal history, Kensington Palace broke with protocol and announced the birth via Twitter before posting a formal notice at the gates of Buckingham Palace.
Prince George weighed 8 lbs 6 oz with “a good pair of lungs,” according to his father.  The new parents took a few hours with their son, who is third in line to the British throne behind his father and grandfather, before making the announcement to the world.

The new family left hospital a day later.  Her Royal Highness, wearing a bespoke polka dot Jenny Packham dress, was visibly moved by the celebrations.  She and the Duke spent a few minutes thanking hospital staff and speaking to the media before hopping into a Range Rover, with William at the wheel.
George was christened on October 23rd at St. James’s Palace, surrounded by family, seven godparents and their partners inside the Chapel Royal.  After, official photos were taken inside the Morning Room at Clarence House by photographer Jason Bell.
A day after the christening, the Duchess told guests at a 100 Women in Hedge Funds dinner that George “was such a good boy” on his big day, adding that he’s “not always like that.”
