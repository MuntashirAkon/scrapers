Prince George Steals the Show in His Official Christening Photo/n
Today, Kensington Palace released official photos of Prince George’s christening, which were taken by photographer Jason Bell in the Morning Room at Clarence House.
Catherine, in a custom Alexander McQueen dress and bespoke Jane Taylor fascinator, held George for the photo, which included both the Mountbatten-Windsors and Middletons.

The best remarks about the photo came straight from the peanut gallery.  People talked about the distance between Her Majesty and Catherine on the couch, the fact that Her Majesty’s trusty purse was on the floor (what if a corgi got into it?!) and Prince Harry’s enormous grin (ILYPH).
Also, one insists that James Middleton shave that beard immediately.
Tea and wedding cake was served to guests during the reception, which included George’s godparents and their partners.
British tradition dictates that the cake, which was the top portion of an eight-tier cake designed by Fiona Cairns, be frozen until the birth of a couple’s first child.
At a dinner for 100 Women in Hedge Funds this evening, Catherine told guests how well-behaved George was during the baptism.
“He was such a good boy actually,” Catherine said, according to Sky News.  “We were very lucky, he’s not always like that.”
