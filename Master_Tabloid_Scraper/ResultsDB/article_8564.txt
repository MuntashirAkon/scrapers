"Survivor": Beans Catch Up to Clarence/n
The beans. Never forget the beans.                No amount of desperation goodwill could save Clarence Black from his fate on Survivor: Africa Thursday, as early mistakes caught up to the 24-year-old high school hoops coach, making him the first victim of the newly merged "Moto Maji" tribe.                "Moto Maji," of course, translates to "Brad Pitt Go Home" in Swahili. The grungy tribal backstabbers faced some heavyweight ratings competition for Thursday's Thanksgiving showdown, as Mr. Jennifer Aniston guest-starred on his wife's NBC show, playing a once-chubby high school classmate. (Final ratings will be delayed until Monday, but expect the fat Pitt to easily beat those hairy pits on Survivor.)          RELATED LINKS ·                                                   E!

He and Teresa voted for Lex--the tattooed, de facto tribe leader who tried to play the nice guy by warning Clarence in advance that his time was up. Gee, thanks.                 Teresa, meanwhile, just plain owed her allegiance to Clarence. The pair went arm-to-arm for a painful immunity challenge, in which contestants tried to keep one arm over their heads for as long as possible without triggering a bucket of water hovering above them. After six--count 'em, six--hours, Clarence offered to end the ordeal with Teresa by playing a game of rock-paper-scissors.                 Teresa had paper. Clarence had rock. So he got doused, in more ways than one.                 With his strength a threat, Clarence's former pals in the Boran tribe weren't showing him any allegiance--especially after early screw-ups like his bean-hoarding episode early in the game.                 "I completely understand the decision to get rid of me. I'm strong, and I pose a threat in the Immunities, and I can live with that, because I knew that coming in," Clarence said in his final words. "I really needed this Immunity to find out if there was old Boran loyalty, and I guess there isn't."
