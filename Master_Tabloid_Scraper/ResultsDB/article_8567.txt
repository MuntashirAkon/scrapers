"Clarence lived a wonderful life," The Boss writes. "He carried within him a love of people that made them love him. He created a wondrous and extended family. He loved the saxophone, loved our fans and gave everything he had every night he stepped on stage."His loss is immeasurable and we are honored and thankful to have known him and had the opportunity to stand beside him for nearly forty years. He was my great friend, my partner, and with Clarence at my side, my band and I were able to tell a story far deeper than those simply contained in our music."His life, his memory and his love will live on in that story and in our band."We're sure Bruce will not be the last to speak out, as Clarence greatly influenced many artists working in the music industry, from Lady Gaga to The Grateful Dead.Rest in peace, Clarence.
