This holiday season, the Big Man won't just be in reference to Santa Claus.The late great Clarence Clemons is posthumously giving his fans a couple gifts of his own in the form of two previously unreleased Christmas songs.Â 

"There's Still Christmas" finds Clemons, the famed saxophonist best known for his powerful playing as part of Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band, singing lead vocals. The other track is an instrumental version of "The Christmas Song."Both tunes will have their debut during a release party at The Wonder Bar in (where else?) Asbury Park, N.J., on Nov. 18. The headlining act that evening will be, appropriately enough, The Nick Clemons Band, fronted by Clarence's son Clarence Clemmons III, according to the Newark Star-Ledger. Incidentally, the two songs, which will eventually be made available via iTunes, were actually recorded way back in 1981.
