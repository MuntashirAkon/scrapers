Despite the loss of his iconic wingman, Clarence Clemons, Bruce Springsteen is soldiering on.The Boss confirmed that he and a revamped E Street Band will hit that thunder road again with a 2012 world tour."Well, things are starting to heat up down on E Street," he said his official site, Brucespringsteen.net.

The trek will be E Street's first in three years and first  without its Big Man, who died last June at age 69 after suffering a  stroke. There was no immediate word on how's Clemons' considerable stage presence will be replaced.Aside from Clemons, the E Street Band is also without original organist and keyboard player Danny Federici, who died in 2008 of melanoma at 58.

The European leg will kick off in May and run through July with a   string of stadium and festival appearances. Stops will include a run  through the U.K. in June, including a headlining gig at the Isle  of  Wight Festival. Afterwards, the band is eyeing some U.S. dates, but  nothing has been announced.Even better news?

The E Streeters are currently  putting the finishing touches on a new album, which will likely drop next  year."In addition, we want you to know that the music is almost done (but   still untitled), we have almost settled on the release date (but not   quite yet), and that we are all incredibly excited about everything that   we're planning for 2012. That's all the info we have for right now,  but  we'll get back to youâ€”real soon," Springsteen said.The Boss and his buddies last toured in support of 2009's Working on a Dream, which included a widely acclaimed Super Bowl halftime performance.
