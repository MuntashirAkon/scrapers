Bruce Springsteen Announces Wrecking Ball Album, Releases First Post-Clarence Clemons Single—Listen Now!/n
Wrecking Ball features 11 songs that, according to Springsteen's longtime manager, Jon Landau, showcases the American troubadour at his emotional and insightful best."Bruce has dug down as deep as he can to come up with this vision of modern life," said Landau. "The lyrics tell a story you can't hear anywhere else and the music is his most innovative in recent years. The writing is some of the best of his career and both veteran fans and those who are new to Bruce will find much to love on Wrecking Ball."While the album cover gracing Springsteen's website doesn't mention the E Street Band, his longtime bandmates will be joining him on the new jaunt, which is scheduled to get under way in Europe with a May 13 concert in Sevilla, Spain.
