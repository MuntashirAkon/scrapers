Bruce Springsteen Raises the Roof at the Apollo; First Show Since Clarence Clemons' Death/n
When Springsteen got to "My City of Ruins" early in the show, he asked the crowd, "Are we missing anybody?""That's right. We're missing a few," he replied, a subtle reminder of the void left by Clemons' death last June from complications of a stroke at the age of 69 as well as that left by keyboardist Danny Federici, who died of cancer in 2008."But the only thing I can guarantee tonight is that if you're here, and we're here, then they're here," the "Glory Days" singer said.As Clemons is irreplaceable, Springsteen didn't hire one person to fill the role but instead added an entire brass section, though in tribute to his late friend and to sort of keep it in the family, the troubadour brought on board Clemons' nephew, Jake, to play some of his uncle's biggest solos.

He and the band closed out the show with "Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out."Among the other celebs in attendance: writer-director Nora Ephron, tennis legend John McEnroe, NBC Nightly News Anchor Brian Williams, former L.A. Lakers coach Pat Reilly, fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger and music icon Harry Belafonte.Here's the complete setlist:We Take Care of Our OwnWrecking BallBadlandsDeath to My HometownMy City of RuinsThe E Street ShuffleJack of All TradesShackledÂ and DrawnWaitin' on a Sunny DayThe Promised LandMansion on the HillThe Way You Do The Things You Do6345789The RisingWe Are AliveThunder RoadRocky GroundLand of Hope and DreamsTenth Avenue Freeze-Out
