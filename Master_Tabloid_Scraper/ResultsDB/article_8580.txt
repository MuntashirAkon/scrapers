Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas: Hysterics after Long Lunch/nSupreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas let it all hang out after a long lunch Thursday near Capitol Hill. Our photog got the Justice on his way out of The Capital Grille at around 3:15 PM. We're told he dined in a private back room with a group of guys. You gotta see the video ... Thomas is in hysterics for most of it, asking why our guy would  "photobomb " him. After our photog ID's himself as a TMZ cameraman, the Justice says,  "I know you. I'm just giving you a hard time " One thing was definitely off limits ... what was on the lunch menu./n
