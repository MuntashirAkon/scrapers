Bruce Springsteen's 'Born to Run' Marks 30th Anniversary/nAfter 30 years, the Boss is still running.  In the release of 'Born to Run 30th Anniversary Edition,' rock legend Bruce Springsteen gives an inside look at what went into the song and album that many consider to be one of the most prolific rock 'n' roll albums of all time. You don't even have to be from New Jersey to enjoy it.  The three-disc box set includes a richly remastered DVD of the legendary 1975 Hammersmith Odeon concert, previously unpublished photos and a 90-minute documentary of 'Wings for Wheels: The Making of Born to Run.'   "I wanted it to sound enormous, to grab you by your throat, " Springsteen told Rolling Stone in a recent interview about the making of the anthem.  "[To] insist that you take that ride, insist that you pay attention -- not just to the music, but to life, to being alive. "  Sample concert tracks include 'Thunder Road,' 'Tenth Avenue Freeze Out' and 'Jungleland,' plus interviews with his E Street Band members Clarence Clemons, Max Weinberg and Stevie Van Zandt.  'Born to Run 30th Anniversary Edition' drops on Nov. 15 on Columbia Records.  For more info: www.brucespringsteen.net Bruce Springsteen at AOL Music!/n
