Relapsed Cameron Douglas Violates Probation — Tests Positive For Pot!/n
Cameron Douglas has violated the terms of his probation just three months after being released from federal prison, RadarOnline.com has learned.
According to Page Six, Michael Douglas‘ troubled son — who previously had his five-year sentence extended in 2011 after drugs were found in his possession behind bars — was caught with marijuana in his system this spring.
Court papers reveal that Douglas’ probation officers told Manhattan federal Judge Richard Berman that during a random drug test conducted on April 10, a lab tech accused the 38-year-old of “attempting to manipulate the results.”

After further testing, Douglas’ results came back positive for pot.
Surprisingly, the shamed star’s probation officers took it easy him, assuring the judge that “relapse is part of the recovery process.”

Meanwhile, Douglas’ lawyer argued that his client has been suffering from “post-traumatic stress disorder” following his seven years behind bars.
“His period of imprisonment was horrific,” attorney Ben Brafman said, adding that Douglas was “subject to terrifying treatment” by fellow inmates after ratting out his drug suppliers in court.
“He is fine and there is no issue,” Brafman said of Douglas’ sobriety.
Douglas is due back in court on Wednesday.
