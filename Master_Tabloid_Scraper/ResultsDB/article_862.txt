Nasty Gal Founder/#Girlboss Author's Divorce Final/nNasty Gal founder Sophia Amoruso is officially single again, and it hardly cost her anything. We've learned a judge just granted her a divorce from Joel Jarek DeGraff. The couple was only married for a year, and they had an ironclad prenup before marrying in June 2015. Sophia, who is repped by disso queen Laura Wasser, will pay DeGraff $30,000. In return, DeGraff agreed to waive spousal support. She also paid him $18k for rent on his new pad. DeGraff gets to keep his 2014 Volvo, and that's about it. Sophia, who also wrote #Girlboss, created Nasty Gal before the couple married, so that money was always off the table. The prenup kept all of her earnings separate. Girl boss to the core./n
