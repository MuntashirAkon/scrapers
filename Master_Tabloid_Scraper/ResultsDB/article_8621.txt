Inside Bill Cosby & His Accuser's SECRET Valentine's Day Phone Conversation/n
The defense in Bill Cosby’s sexual assault trial continues to hinge on to their case that Andrea Constand’s phone calls to the disgraced comedian were of romantic nature. The 79-year-old’s lawyer, Brian McMonagle, referenced a call placed to Cosby from his accusers phone which took place on Valentine’s Day (February 14, 2004), insinuating that the relationship between the two was of more than that of just business.
The state then asked Richard Schaffer, the policeman who interviewed Cosby during the 2005 investigation into Constand’s allegations and who is also on the stand in today, about other calls Andrea made on Valentine’s Day. When asked “What do you think Andrea and coach Dawn Staley [Temple’s women’s basketball coach] talked about on February 14, 2004?” Schaffer replied “Basketball?”

Upon Schaffer’s response, the courtroom erupted in laughter. Meanwhile, the state humorously implied in court on Thursday that there are other reasons to call someone on Valentine’s Day other than to show your affection.
Cosby, who will be 80-years-old next month, is being charged on three counts of sexual assault. If convicted, he faces up to 10 years in prison. Since Constand’s claim , more than 40 women have come out accusing Cosby of sexual assault.
