Trump's Defense Of The Confederacy Just Lost Him America's Unions!/n

AFL-CIooooooohhh shit…
Donald Trump showed his true colors during Tuesday's press conference, defending white nationalists who protested the removal of a Confederate statue, and that means losing even more support.
AFL-CIO president Richard Trumka, along with rep Thea Lee, are the latest to step down from the president's manufacturing council, following CEOs for Merck, Under Armour, Intel, and AAM.

In a biting, unequivocal statement, the union leaders slammed Drumpf as "a President who tolerates bigotry and domestic terrorism":

"President Trump's remarks today repudiate his forced remarks yesterday about the KKK and neo-Nazis. We must resign on behalf of America's working people, who reject all notions of legitimacy of these bigoted groups."

Holy shit. Trump actually brought together the unions and Wal-Mart, whose CEO Doug McMillon said earlier today that 45 "missed a critical opportunity to help bring our country together by unequivocally rejecting the appalling actions of white supremacists."
We guess he's uniting the country after all.
