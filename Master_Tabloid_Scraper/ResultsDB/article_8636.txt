Richard Simmons shared a message with his fans and followers after he was hospitalized on Monday for “severe indigestion.”

“Hello to everyone who has shown concern for me and sent their good wishes,” Simmons told People exclusively after he decided to go to the hospital to resolve his stomach problems. “You will never know how much it means to me. Aren’t you sick of hearing and reading about me?! LOL Well by now you know that I’m not ‘missing,’ just a little under the weather. I’m sure I will be feeling good and back home in a couple of days.”
“This has reminded me that when you need help you can’t be afraid to reach out and ask for it,” he continued. “We all think we should always be able to solve our problems all by ourselves and sometimes it’s just bigger than we are.”
“I reached out and I hope you will too. I’m sure there are people in your life who love and care for you and would do anything to help you with the challenges you face. Just knowing you care has already made me feel better. Hope to see you again soon!”
