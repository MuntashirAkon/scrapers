Julia Roberts has been named People magazine’s World’s Most Beautiful Woman for the fifth time in her career.

Roberts was first awarded this title 26 years ago and currently holds the record for Most Beautiful honors over any other person recognized by the magazine.
“I am very flattered,” the actress tells People in the magazine’s May 1 issue. “It will become embarrassing. Right now, let’s just keep it with flattering.”
Roberts remembers that she felt “adorable and naïve and so happy to be invited to the party” when she first appeared on the Most Beautiful cover. “Was I old enough to be voted into this level of popularity?” she laughs.
After her first cover in 1991, Roberts was featured by People again in 2000, 2005 and 2010.

The Pretty Woman actress tells People that she thinks she’s “currently peaking.”
“If I can just grow gracefully-ish old and watch my kids grow up and realize their dreams, and find their person in life, and hopefully have a family and little creatures for Danny [Moder] and I to spoil, that’s what the winter of life is supposed to be about.”
As for plastic surgery, Roberts encourages people who think they need it to get the job(s) done. “I think that we should all do what we want,” she says. We have to put up a little bit of a fight. But then too much of a fight causes a wrinkle.”
Other women featured in this year’s issue include Viola Davis, Taraji P. Henson, Chrissy Metz, Mandy Moore, Emma Watson, Oprah Winfrey and Carrie Underwood. Get the full issue when it hits newsstands on Friday, Apr. 21.
