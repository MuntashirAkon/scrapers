Richard Simmons is on the mend.

The exercise guru, who stepped away from the spotlight during the past few years, has been admitted to a California treatment center for severe indigestion.
“Richard Simmons was hospitalized on Monday at an undisclosed location in California,” his rep, Michael Catalano, tells ABC News. “After a few days of battling severe indigestion and discomfort while eating, we agreed it was best for him to seek treatment.”
He adds, “He’s already feeling better and is expected to make a full recovery.”
Simmons, 68, made headlines last summer when it was rumored he was being held hostage in his own home by his housekeeper. After an investigation by the police, it was revealed that Simmons had voluntarily secluded himself. The fitness icon also denied rumors he was transitioning into a woman.
In 2016, Simmons was hospitalized for dehydration.
“I just sort of want to take care of me. I just really don’t want to do anything. I just don’t want to be traveling anymore. It certainly has taken its toll on me,” he said in a Today interview last year. “You haven’t seen the last of me — I’ll come back, and I’ll come back strong.”
