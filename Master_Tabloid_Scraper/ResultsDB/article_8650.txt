He has addressed concerns over his health and well-being, most recently in a confusing Facebook post following a hospitalization for indigestion.Simmons' absence is particularly mysterious given his dynamic presence and how generally confident and cheerful he always appeared to be with the general public.

Simmons is estimated to have a net worth of at least $15 million. He is reported to have helped people lose over 10 million pounds collectively over the years. That's about $1.5 per pound lost."I would realistically estimate his net worth to be somewhere between $15 to $30 million," Samuel Rad, a celebrity financial advisor, told E! News."When we look at his net worth, it's looking at not just what he has in bank accounts, we're looking at the value of his property, the value of his business at the aerobics studio," he said. "who really knows how much that's worth if he sold it right? We're also looking at his name value, his name brand recognition."

He sold more than 20 million copies, according to the New York Daily News. He has sold over 65 million workout tapes, DVDs, audio tapes and cassettes overall.He also taught fitness classes at his Slimmons exercise studio in Beverly Hills between 1974 until 2016, when it closed.

His boisterous personality was apparent in real life; He sometimes offered free classes to people he would meet while out and about.According to the Missing Richard Simmons podcast, over the years, he has also sold $160 million worth of Deal-A-Meal diet plans, which emphasize portion and calorie control, calculated distribution of carbs, proteins and fats and also make use of cards.
