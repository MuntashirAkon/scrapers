Some fans might consider this a big mistake!While Pretty Woman is one of the most famous films in Richard Gere's repertoire, he's not exactly catching reruns of the 1990 romantic comedy on Saturday afternoons. As he admitted to Jimmy Kimmel on Tuesday night, it's been 27 years since he last saw the film—yes, he last watched it when it first came out.
