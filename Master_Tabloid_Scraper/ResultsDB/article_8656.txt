Richard Gere and Carey Lowell's Divorce Finalized Three Years After They Split/n
Richard Gere and Carey Lowell are officially over. Just over three years after the Hollywood couple initially separated, E! News can confirm their divorce was finalized Tuesday. Details of the settlement were not immediately disclosed. The Pretty Woman star and Lowell tied the knot in 2002, seven years after Gere split from supermodel Cindy Crawford in 1995. Richard and Carey share one child together, a 16-year-old son named Homer.

When Lowell filed for divorce, insiders told Page Six, who was first to report the news, their romance turned south over lifestyle differences. According to the outlet, 67-year-old Gere preferred privacy while Lowell, 55, enjoyed socializing. In 2015, E! News reported Richard had found love again with 33-year-old Spanish socialite Alejandra Silva. The two were recently spotted in June getting cozy on the red carpet of the Taormina Film Festival in Italy. 

Gere was previously linked to Padma Lakshmifor about six months back in 2014.
