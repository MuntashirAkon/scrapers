Watch out, people. We have a new couple alert!It looks like Richard Gere has set his sights on a much younger beauty, because E! News confirms that the 65-year-old actor is dating 32-year-old Spanish socialite Alejandra Silva, whose father is businessman Ignacio Silva, former financial vice president of the pro football club Real Madrid.The pair was snapped getting cozy as they relaxed on a yacht off the coast of Acitrezza, Italy, on Monday. Silva showed off her enviable and toned bod in a tiny, purple bikini while soaking in the sun's rays on the yacht, before the duo took a dive into the sea to enjoy the cool water.At one point, the twosome flaunted a bit of PDA, as well, with Silva sitting on Gere's lap while putting her arm around her beau. While this may seem like new news to the public, Gere and Silva have reportedly been dating for about a year now.

Speaking of Silva's relationship, a friend of Alejandra's reportedly told Spain's ABC, "They've been together for about a year but have been very private about it. Alejandra lives between Manhattan and Madrid and Richard has already been to see her a few times."They added, "They've managed to keep it hidden from the press but all their friends know."The duo also reportedly made their first public appearance as a couple when they stepped out together for the first time on the red carpet at the 61st Annual Taormina Film Festival in Sicily on Wednesday, where Gere was being honored with an award.Gere and actress Carey Lowell, 54, ended their 11-year marriage in 2013, and have one son together, Homer, 15. He was also linked to Padma Lakshmi last year.Silva is divorced from Govind Friedland, with whom she has a son, Albert.
