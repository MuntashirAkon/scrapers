Cecil the Lion's Son Xanda Killed by Trophy Hunters/nAnother one ofÂ Cecil the Lion's sons has died the same way his father did -- shot and killed by trophy hunters in Zimbabwe. Xanda -- a 6-year-old in his prime and himself the father of several young cubs -- was reportedly killed by professional hunter Richard Cooke ... the same guy who killed Xanda's brother. Cecil was killed 2 years ago and his death -- at the hands of American dentist Walter Palmer -- sparked international outrage. Xanda was found dead still wearing an electronic collar just outside the Hwange National Park. The park released a statement saying,  "We can't believe that now, 2 years since Cecil was killed, that his oldest Cub #Xanda has met the same fate. When will the Lions of Hwange National Park be left to live out their years as wild born free lions should? "/n
