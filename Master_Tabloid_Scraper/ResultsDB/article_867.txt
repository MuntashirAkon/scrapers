Eric Trump's Pregnant Wife Lugging Suitcase, Secret Service Agents Ain't Bellmen/nEric Trump doesn't have to worry about his pregnant wife -- Secret Service agents have her back and her front ... just not her suitcases. Lara was leaving her NYC crib Wednesday with a rollie bag, and even though she's in her 2nd trimester and appeared to be struggling with the luggage ... her 2 agents didn't lift a finger. Fair to say they've got more important things to do? Facts? The bag does have wheels ... and Lara's smiling. We're guessing she's totally fine with the level of service./n
