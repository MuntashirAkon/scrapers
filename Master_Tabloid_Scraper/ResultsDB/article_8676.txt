Ex-FBI Director James Comey Testifies About President Trump, Russia Investigation/nFormer FBI Director James Comey's highly anticipated testimony had something for everyone -- supporters of President Trump, but also his detractors. Comey told Sen. Richard Burr he had no doubts Russia attempted to interfere, and made cyber attacks on voter files and the DNC -- but he's also confident they were not able to alter a single vote in the 2016 election. The biggest bombshell though was his explanation for why he took detailed notes after every meeting with President Trump. Comey said,  "I was honestly concerned that he might lie about the nature of our meeting and so I thought it really important to document. " He also got into whether the President leaned on him to back off Gen. Mike Flynn or the Russia investigation. The hearing stopped everything in D.C. -- some interns were waiting in line since 3 AM to get into the hearing  #comeyline --> pic.twitter.com /UhsjpKCQoA â€” Hallie Jackson (@HallieJackson) June 8, 2017/n
