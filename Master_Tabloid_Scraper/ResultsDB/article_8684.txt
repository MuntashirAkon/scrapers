Richard Simmons' National Enquirer Lawsuit Isn't Anti-LGBT, Say Trans Models/nRichard Simmons isn't anti-LGBT by suing  "National Enquirer " over a story claiming he's been transitioning to a woman ... at least not according to transgender model Carmen Carrera. 'Enquirer' claims Simmons isn't pro-LGBT because his suit claims defamation and that suggests being transgender is a bad thing. Carrera says that's just BS.  Zion Moreno -- a trans model who is vying for a shot in the next Sports Illustrated Swimsuit edition -- says it doesn't matter if Simmons is transitioning ... there's a bigger issue the Enquirer is missing. /n
