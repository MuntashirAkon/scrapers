'You Don't Deserve To Look At My Angel!' OJ Forbidden From Contacting Beloved Child/n
O.J. Simpson may soon be (freed on parole) but the “proud father” of the little girl he most wants to meet has warned him to stay away – unless he’s ready for a showdown, RadarOnline.com has learned exclusively. The disgraced former NFL star idolized Madeline, daughter of Christie Prody – (a troubled woman whom he dated) on and off for 12 years – and keeps pictures of her in his cell, but that doesn’t sit well with the youngster’s father, Andrew Leabo. Andrew even wrote a menacing letter to ‘The Juice’, obtained by Radar, demanding the pictures back as he was so disgusted with O.J.’s behavior. Leabo is convinced (Simpson killed his ex-wife), Nicole Brown-Simpson, and her friend, Ron Goldman — a crime he was found not guilty of after a lengthy trial in 1995.
