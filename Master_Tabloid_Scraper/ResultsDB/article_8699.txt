“It’s been officially 2 weeks since your passing and I’m not prepared to say goodbye,” Higgins starts out. “Mentally, I know I’m in denial. I’m waiting for you to pull up to my house in your blacked out Prius, aka Patty, blasting whatever rap music you were feeling that day; I’d hop in as your favorite co-pilot and most likely fall asleep while you drive us around”

“Jimi Patrick you were incredibly kind, sweet, hilarious, handsome, genuine, and millions of more amazing terms. Thank you for giving me some of the best years and moments in my life, I will cherish them and your memory forever,” she ended the post.
