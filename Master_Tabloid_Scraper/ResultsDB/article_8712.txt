You don't impanel a grand jury if you only have smoke. Mueller must be seeing fire. @realDonaldTrump and/or his associates in bigly trouble. https://t.co/psPwRKK4q6

Robert Mueller has assembled a Grand Jury already?
I'm sure it's nothing
Maybe a tiny bit of treason w/ a some money laundering here & there

A grand jury is not a parlor game. Reciting the words "crooked Hillary" won't get you off the hook.

Special Counsel Mueller is not messing around. A grand jury is the step before indictment. https://t.co/oM6mnmlO42

This is gonna be an amazing grand jury, believe me. You're gonna be so sick of how grand this jury is. It's gonna be a yuge grand jury.

And our favorite, from professor Seth Abramson's breakdown of what this all means:

(26) There's consensus Mueller has "prima facie" felonies (cases he, on their face, could win at trial) against Kushner, Manafort and Trump.
