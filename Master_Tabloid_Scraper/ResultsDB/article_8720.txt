You better think twice before doing it for the ‘gram. Just ask Khloé Kardashian.

The Keeping Up with the Kardashians star has been slapped with a federal lawsuit accusing her of copyright infringement for sharing a photo of herself on Instagram. Launched by paparazzi agency Xposure Photos, the suit claims the 32-year-old broke the law by removing the copyright information from one of their pictures and posting it to her social media without crediting them.
The photo in question was taken in September 2016 by photographer Manual Munoz when Kardashian was dining at Miami restaurant Komodo with her sister. The set was licensed to the Daily Mail as an exclusive.

In legal documents, Xposure Photos claims they would have profited from the shots had Kardashian not shared them on social media. They are now seeking $150,000 in damages from Kardashian and 10 anonymous plaintiffs, who presumably are all part of the Revenge Body host’s social team.
The company says in a statement, “Kardashian’s Instagram post made the photograph immediately available to her nearly 67 million followers and others, consumers of entertainment news — and especially news and images of Kardashian herself, as evidenced by their status as followers of Kardashian —who would otherwise be interested in viewing licensed versions of the photograph in the magazines and newspapers that are plaintiff’s customers.”
Just last week, Kardashian shared a paparazzi photo of her in a cleavage-baring red number on Instagram. The only credit she provided was to her makeup artist, Joyce Bonelli, and hairstylist Andrew Fitzsimons.


don't worry, we actually licensed these photos
