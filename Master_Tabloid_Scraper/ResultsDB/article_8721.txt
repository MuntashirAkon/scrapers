Victoria Beckham’s “Carpool Karaoke” segment with James Corden has everything: A Mannequin trailer remake, Target product placement, energetic lip-syncing, shop window dancing…

Beckham’s short video debuted on The Late Late Show on Thursday night (Mar. 30, 2017). Corden announced, “Victoria and I have the oddest thing in common. We are both huge fans of the ‘80s movie Mannequin.”

Thus, the segment riffs on the 1987 film starring Andrew McCarthy and Kim Cattrall. Corden is in love with Beckham, who isn’t actually Beckham, but a mannequin of Beckham. He busts her out of the studio and they sing partially lip-sync the Spice Girls hit, “Spice Up Your Life.”
They arrive at Target, the home of Beckham’s new clothing line, where she is returned to her rightful home of the front window with her closest friends.
