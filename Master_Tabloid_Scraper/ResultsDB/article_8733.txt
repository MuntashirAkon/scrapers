Erin Andrews is a married woman!
Andrews’ rep confirms to PEOPLE that the Andrews and Jarret Stoll were married in Montana on Saturday at a sunset ceremony. The duo said their vows in front of an intimate group of friends and family and then celebrated with a reception — all designed by celebrity wedding planner Yifat Oren. Andrews wore a stunning gown designed by Carolina Herrera.
The Dancing with the Stars host and Stoll – a 34-year-old former NHL star – started dating in 2012, and the sportscaster confirmed their engagement in December of last year.

Andrews told Good Morning America of the proposal, “We went there for Christmas to see the Christmas decorations, and we had a lovely dinner there, and he did it right there at dinner at Disneyland. I was bawling like a child.”
