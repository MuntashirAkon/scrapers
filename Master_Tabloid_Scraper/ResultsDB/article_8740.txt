Andrew Garfield, the time has come for you to lip-sync...for your life!The drag show revue Werq the World Tour stopped in London Tuesday, and Garfield just so happened to be in the audience. The Academy Award-nominated Hacksaw Ridge actor, 33, surprised fans by wearing a curly wig and lip-syncing to Whitney Houston's "I'm Every Woman."Garfield attended Tuesday's drag show with Nathan Stewart-Jarrett and Russell Tovey, his co-stars in the London revival of the play Angels in America (now playing at the National Theatre).

Now all Garfield needs is a drag mother and a stage name.
