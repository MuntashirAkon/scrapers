Chris Christie Slams Reporter for Asking 'TMZ Stuff' Over Sunbathing Scandal /nChris Christie went ham Sunday at a news conference when a reporter dared to ask him if he got a tan while sitting on a beach the NJ Governor closed down, firing back,  "We're talking about the closure of government and you're talking about your TMZ stuff. " Christie's taking more heat than he got from his beach outing, captured by The Star-Ledger of New Jersey. Christie had closed the beach in the wake of a government shutdown in his state over failure to pass a budget. The most hilarious part ... after Christie left the beach over the weekend, he was asked if he had gotten any sun and said,  "I didn't get any sun today. "  Then photos surfaced and his spokesperson gyrated ...  "He did not get any sun. He had a baseball hat on. " Christie says he had always planned to go to the beach with his family ... a beach near his home.  /n
