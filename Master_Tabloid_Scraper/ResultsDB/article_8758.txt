Charlamagne Tha God Thinks Sexual Assault Education's Good, but not from Bill Cosby/nCharlamagne tha God's got no problem with teaching people about sexual assault ... but definitely doesn't think Bill Cosby should be leading the charge.

Cosby is still facing a retrial in the Andrea Constand case./n
