 It hasn't been an easy year, but it has been one of a lot of personal growth and of meeting some amazing people, including the one I got to marry.  We value and respect marriage, but life is short and we also value happiness.  While this was a difficult decision and divorce is not something either of us hoped for, we decided we will be happiest separating.  Still got nothin' but love for @codyknapek !  Thank you to everyone who supported us on our journey!  We hope you will be respectful and understanding of our decision.  I went into #MAFS trusting that this was God's or some greater power's plan and I stand by that now.  Still a big believer in love and looking forward to the future. üíú #marriedatfirstsight #mafs5 #lovestory #trumanshow #groundhogday #GOODVIBESONLY
