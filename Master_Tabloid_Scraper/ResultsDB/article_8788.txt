'RHONJ' Newbie Margaret Josephs ALREADY Feuding With Costars/n
There’s a new addition to The Real Housewives of New Jersey, RadarOnline.com can exclusively reveal!
“Margaret Josephs is the new Housewife of Jersey,” an insider told Radar. “They are filming now.”
“She’s already fighting with Siggy [Flicker],” the source added.
But fans will have to wait to watch the drama, as “the new season doesn’t have a premiere date yet,” according to the insider.

Josephs, 50, is a Jersey-based home accessories designer and lifestyle expert. Her entrance comes on the heels of Jacqueline Laurita’s abrupt exit at the end of the show’s eighth season.
The mom-of-one has already been caught hanging out with Danielle Staub and Melissa Gorga, but it is unclear if she filmed at the Posche fashion show with them.
Radar previously reported that Staub, 54, was gearing up to return to RHONJ after she left at the end of the second season.
