Kourtney Kardashian -- All Signs Point to Lawyering Up in Scott Disick Breakup/nKourtney Kardashian paid a visit to an L.A. office building Monday, and all signs suggest she's lawyering up for some custody and money issues with baby daddy Scott Disick. Kourtney went to a Century City office building filled with lawyers, and one stands out -- disso queen Laura Wasser. We don't know which office Kourtney visited, but when you think about it, 2 of her sisters -- Kim and Khloe -- used Wasser in their divorces, so it's not that hard to connect the dots. Kourtney needs to work out a custody arrangement for her 3 kids, as well as a financial settlement. They never married, but they were together for 9 years./n
