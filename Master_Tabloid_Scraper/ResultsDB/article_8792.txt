VOTE: Is Taylor Swift Hinting Karlie Kloss Is Out Of The Squad??/n

UPDATE 12:20 P.M. EST: Cara Delevingne, Lorde, and Ruby Rose also appear to be missing from the tee. Hmmm! We're dying of curiosity right now!
Taylor Swift's Look What You Made Me Do video is filled with hidden messages, and it has Twitter freaking the fuck out!
Especially after they realized the songstress had her squad sign her "Junior Jewels" shirt (above) replicating the tee from her You Belong With Me video!
Selena Gomez, Ed Sheeran, Gigi Hadid were just a few of the names to pop up, except what happened to Karlie Kloss??
Tay's BFF's moniker can't be seen in any shot in the music video!!

Meanwhile, Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds, Lena Dunham, Patrick Stewart, Todrick Hall, Abigail Anderson, Martha Hunt, Claire Kislinger, and all three Haim sisters Este, Alana, and Danielle are visible!
Maybe the supermodel signed her name on the back?? 
Although, it's extra inneresting since Taylor featured one scene in the video of her sitting in a throne room with William Shakespeare's "et tu brute" written on two of the columns (below):

Who is it that stabbed Taylor in the back a la Julius Caesar??
The Internet was feeling some type of way about it all!
