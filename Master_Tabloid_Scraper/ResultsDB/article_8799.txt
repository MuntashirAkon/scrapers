Danielle Bregoli — the girl behind the infamous “Cash Me Outside” meme — isn’t going to get anymore money from her estranged father.

Ira Peskowitz recently filed documents in Palm Beach County, Florida asking a judge if he can stop paying child support for the 14-year-old. The the court filing, he argued the teenager, who is reportedly getting paid upwards of $40,000 for every public appearance, can provide for herself and does not require the $1,100 a month he’s sending her.
Via TMZ:
In docs, obtained by TMZ … Ira slams Danielle’s mom for allegedly exploiting their kid. He says Barbara Bregoli “is exploiting the minor child as a ‘celebrity’ for the child’s bad behavior.”
He goes on to say it “is fueling a downward spiral of dangerously inappropriate, antisocial and possibly criminal behavior.”
It’s ironic … the alleged exploitation is the basis for him asking the judge to terminate his obligation.
