After months of waiting, fans are finally getting their first look at the fifth season of Netflix’s Orange Is the New Black.

In the freshly released trailer, the ladies of Litchfield unite to riot against the guards after Poussey (Samira Wiley) was accidentally killed in an act of police brutality. Overtaking the entire prison, Piper (Taylor Schilling) and Taystee (Danielle Brooks) devise a plan to contact the press to reveal the truth about their mistreatment, while others deal with the loss of one of their own.
According to the Netflix longline, Season 5 will take place over the course of just three days as the intimates “are emboldened to fight for redemption, resolution and the respect they deserve.”
Also starring Uzo Aduba, Taryn Manning, Natasha Lyonne, Selenis Leyva, Dascha Polanco, Yael Stone, Jackie Cruz, Lea DeLaria and Laverne Cox, the fifth season premieres June 9 on Netflix.
