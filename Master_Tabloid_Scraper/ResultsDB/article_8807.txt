Harry Potter is heading to America!

J.K. Rowling’s stage play, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, will make its stateside debut at New York City’s Lyric Theatre on April 22, 2018. Audience members will still be encouraged to view the two-parter in order on matinee days or over consecutive evenings.
Written by Jack Thorne and directed by John Tiffany, the theatrical adaptation of the beloved fantasy saga takes place 19 years after the original series. The play centers around Potter, an overworked father-of-three employed by the Ministry of Magic, and his son.
Tickets will go on sale this fall, according to the official website.
