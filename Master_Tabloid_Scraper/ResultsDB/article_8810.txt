Paris recently signed a contract with IMG Models and is a recurring guest actor on Lee Daniels’ FOX series, Star. Despite her interest in acting, Paris says that her interests as a child were markedly different. She tells Vanity Fair that she grew up wanting to be an astronaut, a vet, and a nurse.
“I guess the recurring theme was that I wanted to make a difference,” she tells Vanity Fair.
She also issues advice to other young people growing up in the age of unrealistic images of perfection on social media.
“I think it’s important to show our youth that one shouldn’t compare another’s highlight reel to their own behind the scenes,” Paris says.
