Married at First Sight‘s Cody Knapek and Danielle DeGroot are calling it quits on their marriage.
“After a year of marriage, and much thought and consideration, we are deeply saddened to announce that we’ve decided to go our separate ways,” the reality stars — who met for the first time on their wedding day — tell PEOPLE exclusively in a statement. “We remain the closest of friends, and have enjoyed sharing our lives with our Married at First Sight family.”
“We want to thank the experts for their guidance and love throughout all of this. This process has only strengthened our belief that true love does exist!” continues the statement.

The couple wed last August and often battled on the show over DeGroot’s hesitation to consummate their marriage. Though they chose to stay married on the season finale of Lifetime’s hit show (produced by Kinetic Content), DeGroot revealed on the show’s reunion episode that she still hadn’t fallen for her husband.

“I still just don’t feel in love, I think, so it’s very hard for me to totally embrace it,” said the dietitian about their lack of intimacy even after cameras stopped rolling.
On Tuesday, DeGroot opened up to fans on her Instagram page about their split. “It hasn’t been an easy year, but it has been one of a lot of personal growth and of meeting some amazing people, including the one I got to marry,” she wrote in a caption. “We value and respect marriage, but life is short and we also value happiness.”
“While this was a difficult decision and divorce is not something either of us hoped for, we decided we will be happiest separating. Still got nothin’ but love for you @codyknapek,” she continued.

Thank you to everyone who supported us on our journey!  We hope you will be respectful and understanding of our decision.  I went into #MAFS trusting that this was God's or some greater power's plan and I stand by that now.  Still a big believer in love and looking forward to the future. 💜 #marriedatfirstsight #mafs5 #lovestory #trumanshow #groundhogday #GOODVIBESONLY

The two other couples from the pair’s season — Anthony D’Amico and Ashley Petta, and Sheila Downs and Nate Duhon — are still going strong.
While none of the couples from the second and third season of the show worked out, fan favorites Courtney Hendrix-Carrion and Jason Carrion from the show’s inaugural season are still happily wed.
And most notably, Jamie Otis and her husband Doug Hehner, who also met and fell in love on the show’s first season, welcomed their first child together Tuesday morning.
