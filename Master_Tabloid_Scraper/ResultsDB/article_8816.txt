How has fatherhood changed Daniel Bryan?Well, for starters, it's made him love Brie Bella even more."I would read a lot about how to be a dad. I had never changed a diaper before we had Birdie," the Total Bellas star tells E! News exclusively. "And one of the things that they talk about is it can be very hard on a marriage, on a couple, when you had a child. Because there's all these needs you have to take care of.
