Daniel Cormier: Congrats to Jon Jones, 'Phenomenal Job' /nDaniel Cormier has a message for Jon Jones -- Congrats.  D.C. wasn't in the best shape to talk after his loss to Jones at UFC 214 and left the Octagon after only a brief statement with Joe Rogan.  But now, he's opening up ... and giving props to his biggest rival.  "Congratulations to Jon Jones and his team. They did a phenomenal job and got the victory.

I am thankful for the time you gave me to try and defend myself and stay in the fight. " He concluded,  "Again, congrats to Team Jones and Jackson Wink. Love you all. I'll see you soon. "/n
