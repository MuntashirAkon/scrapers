Tyron Woodley: No Way Jon Jones Is Done in UFC, Here's Why/nTyron Woodley ain't convinced Jon Jones took steroids ... but if he did and has to sit out 4 YEARS, Tyron says Jon would still come back and DOMINATE. That's right -- Woodley told us Jones is such a boss, he could reclaim his belt even if he's benched through his prime.   "Jon Jones is the only fighter on the roster that it wouldn't be over for him. He's 3 or 4 years ahead of the curb right now, for the (205 pound) division. "  "After Daniel Cormier, tell me one fighter who's gonna compete with Jon Jones. " FYI, Dana White estimates Jones will get suspended for his test failure ... but JJ could serve less time (or no time) based on how his appeal goes./n
