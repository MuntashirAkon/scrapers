Jon Jones' Brother In Backstage Confrontation with Cormier's Camp /nCraziness behind the scenes at the UFC 214 weigh-in Friday morning -- when Jon Jones' NFL brother, Arthur Jones, got into a heated exchange with several members of Daniel Cormier's camp. We spoke with Arthur who says 6 members of Cormier's team were running their mouths at him during the weigh-in ... so he started jawing back. Don't worry, it didn't get violent ... but you can tell everyone hates each other. As we previously reported, Arthur and D.C. traded insults following UFC 210 a few months ago -- they don't like each other either. Arthur says Jon's sick of talking -- he's ready to fight.  /n
