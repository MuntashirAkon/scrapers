Luke Rockhold: Cormier Will Beat Jones In Crazy Violent War /nLuke Rockhold says his boy, Daniel Cormier, WILL DEFEAT Jon Jones at UFC 214 this weekend -- but it'll be a war.   "I just think they beat the living crap out of each other for 5 rounds, " Rockhold tells TMZ Sports ...  "and I think we can come out on top. " Yeah, he's a little biased -- the two are extremely close and have been for years.  "Me and D.C. have been together from the beginning, " Rockhold says ...  "Living in my manager's house. I'm living in the garage and he's living in the shanty house in front in Gilroy, CA. "  "Rags to riches. It's been a long road. " We also spoke with D.C.'s boxing coach Rosendo Sanchez who tells us the beef with Jon Jones couldn't be more real. /n
