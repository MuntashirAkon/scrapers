Hernandez has also pleaded not guilty to murder charges in a 2012 double killing, but the judge had not allowed prosecutors from mentioning the separate charges in the Lloyd trial.
Hernandez, who had a $40 million contract with the reigning Super Bowl champions, was immediately cut by the team after charges against him surfaced in the summer of 2013. /n
