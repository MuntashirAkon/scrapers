Early Thursday, Hernandezâ€™s attorney James Sultan grilled North Attleborough police Capt. Joseph DiRenzo over handling of evidence in the case, as the lawman said that officers certain artifacts retrieved from the scene, including shell casings, were moved due to a rainstorm at the time.
The 25-year-old Hernandez has pleaded not guilty in the June 17, 2013 slaying of 27-year-old Lloyd, who was gunned down in a North Attleborough, Mass. industrial park.

Prosecutors said the NFL standout organized the killing with the help of associates Carlos Ortiz and Ernest Wallace, who have also pleaded not guilty. Hernandez has also pleaded not guilty to murder charges in a 2012 double killing, but the judge has barred prosecutors from mentioning the separate charges in the Lloyd trial.
