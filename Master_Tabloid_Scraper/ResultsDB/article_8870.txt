 Sharon Stone Sues Production Company For $500K: They Wanted Me To Lie To US Gov't.../n
Sharon Stone filed a lawsuit on Wednesday in Los Angeles against a movie production company for fraud and breach of contract — and RadarOnline.com has all the details.
The suit was filed on behalf of Stone, 55, by her Hollywood attorney Marty Singer and claims Bob Yari and his production companies lured the actress “to participate in their fraudulent scheme.”

According to the court docs, Stone was slated to play Ernest Hemingway’s wife in a new movie called Papa, but Yari wanted her to falsify documents so she could go shoot in Cuba, and when she refused things went sour.
“Defendants advised Ms. Stone to commit a fraud and lie on her license application with the United States governmental agencies and to check a box indicating she was going to Cuba for a ‘cultural endeavor’ rather than to render professional acting services,” the lawsuit reads.

“Had Ms. Stone complied with the Defendants’ directive, she would have subjected herself to a host of potential criminal liabilities and placed her passport privileges in jeopardy.”
Yari recast the role when the two couldn’t come to an agreement, but refused to pay her the salary she was promised.
Stone is seeking $500,000 in damages. /n
