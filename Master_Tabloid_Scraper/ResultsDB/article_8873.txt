Aaron Hernandez: Second Family Member Killed Since His Arrest For Murder/n
Aaron Hernandez has bizarrely lost a second family member to a violent crash while he’s sitting behind bars, accused of murder.
Robert Valentine, 49, died in a moped crash on Saturday, according to the Bristol, CT police.  He is Aaron’s mother’s brother.
Cops say he struck a curb, was thrown from the moped and hit his head.  Valentine was not wearing a helmet.
On June 30, Aaron’s cousin’s husband, Thaddeus Singleton III, died in a high speed crash.  Cops say he was traveling at close to 100 mph when he went off the road and crashed into a building while driving a vehicle owned by another of Aaron’s uncles, Andres Valderrama.

Investigators into the murder case against the former New England Patriot star — he was charged June 17 with the shooting death of Odin Lloyd and is being held without bail — had wanted to interview Singleton, who had his own lengthy criminal record.
Ernest Wallace, who has been charged as Aaron’s accomplice in the Lloyd murder, claimed he lived with Valderrama.
Hernandez has pleaded not guilty to the murder.
