 Epic Blowup! Khloe Confronts Cheating James Harden After He's Caught Bedside With Stripper!.../n
Khloe Kardashian has gone out of her way to incorporate James Harden into her famous family since finalizing her divorce with Lamar Odom, but now, after only months of dating, she has been forced to confront yet another cheating lover after Harden was caught bedside with a stripper!
Harden was allegedly caught in a compromising position as he sat next to the bed of a Philadelphia stripper by the name of Nelly Wit Da Jelly. In the photo, posted to the dancer’s Instagram account, fans immediately identified the basketball star, and Nelly deleted the photo within minutes — but not before screen grabs were captured by Media Takeout, eventually making their way to a livid Khloe Kardashian.

A victim of serial cheating, Kardashian confronted Harden. “They had a terrible fight after Khloe confronted him and demanded the truth about who he’s been seeing behind her back,” an insider told RadarOnline. “James isn’t the type of guy who’ll sit back and take sh*t, and they really got into it. He threw it back in her face the fact that he knows she’s been creeping around behind his back with her ex [Lamar].”
As Radar reported, despite having moved on to different men, Kardashian still cares deeply for Odom, especially as he struggles to clean up his life. Now, his ongoing presence in her life is taking a toll on her new relationship. “James really put her in her place – she was the one calling all the shots, but she doesn’t know what she wants. One week she wants his baby, the next she’s having second thoughts about Lamar, then she wants to be exclusive, then she doesn’t, he has no idea where he stands with her, nor is he the kind of guy who likes drama around him.” /n
