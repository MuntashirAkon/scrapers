Kim Kardashian recognized that she and historic author Ernest Hemingway are basically the same exact person during a recent family trip to Cuba.

In the Keeping Up with the Kardashians promo at the bottom of the page, Kim and her sister Kourtney are given a tour through Hemingway’s home in Cuba, which has been turned into a museum. While in the private bathroom, the tour guide told the women that he who penned The Old Man and the Sea would check his weight almost every day and take notes of its change on the wall.

“That’s like me!” Kim says.
“You did the same?” asks the tour guide.
“Yeah I do,” replies Kim. “That’s cool.”
Hemingway was a Nobel Prize winner whose body of work includes seven novels, six short story collections, and two non-fiction works that are fundamental pieces of educational curriculum more than fifty years after their publishing. Kim published a book of her selfies. Still! They’ve both said some pretty monumental things over the course of their careers.
