Reading is hard. We’ll help.

For some, reading on the beach is just as backwards as making pizza at home — why go through all the effort when you could just buy one down the street, eat it, and relax? It’s a soothing task nonetheless and it makes you appear cultured even though you might only be catching up on Fifty Shades of Grey. This is where audiobooks, read by people who do not exist inside your head, come in handy and it’s arguably a pleasure when these people are your favorite celebrities.
Below is a list of audiobooks from Audible that will keep you company while you’re hanging out with the ocean in front of you and all of your troubles behind you, featuring titles read by Scarlett Johansson and Kate Winslet. Launch the gallery at the top of the page to view more audiobooks of the romantic variety.

Be whisked away to Neverland in the magical novel written by J. M. Barrie. The best part is, you won’t even need sunscreen to avoid harsh aging.
