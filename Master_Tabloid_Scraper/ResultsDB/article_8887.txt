Ah, family.

It was revealed this morning that Arthur George sock CEO, Rob Kardashian, asked Blac Chyna for her hand in marriage after just two months of dating. While Kardashian’s ex-girlfriend, Adrienne Bailon, and Kimoji kompetitor, Amber Rose, dutifully expressed their congratulations on social media, a gaping silence still remains from Rob’s entire nuclear family on the Internet or otherwise.
Sure—the Kardashians might have privately sent the couple an Edible Arrangement with fruit dunked in diabetic-friendly chocolate, but it can be inferred that the clan isn’t ecstatic over the news of Chyna’s re-entry into the family given her prospective Keeping Up cameo deal, among other instances of shade.
Also, it doesn’t help that momager, Kris Jenner, swept up all of the sisters and their families onto a private jet just a day ahead of Rob’s proposal to embark on an impromptu skiing vacation.

If you don’t believe us, just take a look at all the menial things that the Kardashians are doing to avoid addressing Rob’s engagement.
