Rapper Nelly was arrested on drug charges in Tennessee after a state trooper pulled over his tour bus on Saturday.
The “Hot in Herre” singer has been charged with felony possession of drugs, simple possession of marijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia, the Tennessee Department of Safety and Homeland Security said.

Nelly’s lawyer said he was “extremely confident that when the facts come out, Nelly will not be associated with the contraband that was allegedly discovered.”
Nelly, whose real name is Cornell Haynes, and another passenger were both taken to Putnam County Jail. The 40 year-old hip-hop star later posted bond and was released.
