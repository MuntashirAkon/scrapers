 It’s a sad day for wacky product enthusiasts and people with a lot of money to burn as SkyMall, the in-flight shopping catalog that sells visors with fake hair and diamond steam cleaners, and its parent company file for bankruptcy.
Amidst the sorrow, remorse and regret over the announcement, Chrissy Teigen has taken to Twitter to jot down her emotions. And if Ernest Hemingway were alive today, he’d shed a single tear over these words and raise his fists to the high heavens in vain over the loss of this American staple.

My dearest Skymall. No one bought from you but everyone knew you. You were the japanese trinket store of the sky.

According to the court papers, SkyMall’s demise is brought on by an actual disinterest in reading printed words from consumers.
“With the increased use of electronic devices on planes, fewer people browsed the SkyMall in-flight catalog,” Chief Executive Scott Wiley says in the legal filings. “Because SkyMall historically did not narrowly tailor its product offerings, SkyMall faced well-established competitors in every market vertical, as well as competition from significant, broad-based ecommerce providers, such as Amazon.com and eBay.com.”
In other words: YOU KILLED SKYMALL.
