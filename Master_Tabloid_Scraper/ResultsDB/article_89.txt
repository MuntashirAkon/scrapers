So Hot She Gets Her Ice For Free/n
Ida Ljungqvist was named 2009 Playboy Playmate of the year on Saturday and got some free bunny-ear branding bling.  “The icing on the cake” as the busty babe calls it, was a 1 ct. Playboy Bunny necklace designed by Pascal Mouawad worth over $5,000. The watchful bunny eye sits just above her cleavage.  Go Figure!
Free is relative – posing naked can be considered work!
