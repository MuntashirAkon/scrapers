Picks and Pans Review: Ernest Borgnine 1917-2012/n
>Personally, I’ve only ever considered myself a working stiff,” Ernest Borgnine told PEOPLE last year, showing the genuine humility that made him Hollywood’s consummate everyman. Borgnine, who died of renal failure July 8 at 95, took that hard-hat approach with his entire career, acting for more than six decades in over 120 films. After a 10-year stint in the Navy, he gained fame as sadistic sergeant “Fatso” Judson in 1953’s From Here to Eternity. His heartbreaking turn in Marty, as a Bronx butcher all too aware of his limitations, won Borgnine an Academy Award in 1956. “I put a lot of myself into that part,” said Borgnine. He went on to show his comedy chops in the ’60s TV series McHale’s Navy (“My Navy buddies loved it,” he said) and decades later as the voice of Mermaid Man on SpongeBob SquarePants. But for all Borgnine’s success, his favorite project was always the next one. “The man refused to retire,” said Darren Brandl, who produced his final film, The Man Who Shook the Hand of Vicente Fernandez. “He felt so lucky to always be able to do the work he loved.”
