Jason Bateman and his wife, Amanda Anka, are the lucky new owners of the late Ernest Borgnine's Beverly Hills estate, which they recently picked up for $3 million (almost $400,000 less than the asking price). Ernest had owned the home for six decades until his death in 2012. The English-country style compound was originally designed by famous architect L.G. Scherer in 1938 and—even with all the upgrades—has still managed to maintain all of its original character.Listing agent Billy Rose described the Oscar-winning actor's former estate: "It has got a great feeling to the rooms," he told The Hollywood Reporter. "It feels important and elegant while feeling like a home."

The half-acre property sits on a quiet cul-de-sac above Mulholland Drive in Beverly Hills and can only be accessed via a private, gated driveway.Upon entering the 6,148 square-foot home, guests are greeted by a spiraling staircase, leading to both wings of the upstairs area. One wing features the master suite (with his and hers baths, dressing rooms and a balcony) and the other wing houses two additional bedrooms, a bathroom and a lounge.

The property also has a self-contained one-bedroom guesthouse with its own living room and kitchen.As if all of that isn't enough, the estate also offers plenty of outdoor living space, which will be perfect for some Bateman family fun. There is a large pool area (which we're sure the little ones are going to love!) as well as a giant deck, which features a fountain and a gazebo.
