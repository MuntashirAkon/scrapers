"Louis is over the moon. He met Ernest and Doris and fell in love with them," a source told the paper. "Family is massively important to him so he was made up that he was not abroad and was able to meet them so soon after they were born. His sisters mean the world to him so he's delighted to have to more siblings to spoil."Poulston has been with Ernest and Doris' father, Daniel Deakin, for two years. She split from her ex, Mark Tomlinson, four years ago.Meanwhile, One Direction is currently on a three-month break from touring, giving Louis plenty of time to hang out with new brother and sister.Congrats to the whole family!
