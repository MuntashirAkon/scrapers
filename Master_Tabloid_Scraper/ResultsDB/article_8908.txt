That's what I hear from a source that gets down with several suits from Fill in the Blank Agency. Said source swears that Sopranos ex-pat James Gandolfini will follow up his amazing run on David Chase's drama with a directing gig. Yes, that's right, the TV boss will be the real boss. And while Gandolfini is still committed to playing Ernest Hemingway in an untitled drama, what the boy really wants is an off-camera gig. 

And apparently, life isn't all that different from a typical episode of Entourage—as in, I hear his people aren't so sure about this venture. However, the hunt for the script is on, and the flavor of the week (which will probably change by the time you read this) is a script about domestic violence. "Nobody knows if this script is right, but there's pressure to find him something good," says the source. "One week, the domestic violence project has potential, the next week it's dead."Well, I hope it lives. Although I haven't read the script, I do believe that Gandolfini has to have picked up something from the Sopranos directors after all these years. The violence—verbal, physical, restrained—in the series was so well played that it probably would have impressed, well, Hemingway. So, let's say a prayer for the mysterious beat-'em-up story, shall we?
