Nicole Kidman and Clive Owen bring old Hollywood elegance to the May 2012 cover of W magazine.Kidman, 44, and Owen, 47, are working the circuit to promote their upcoming HBO film, Hemingway & Gellhorn, where they co-star as Ernest Hemingway and Martha Gellhorn, one of the greatest literary couples of all times.Kidman stuns on the cover of the "Beauty Goes Retro" issue in a platinum bouffant 'do and elegant Prada dress, while Owen is slick and debonair in a classic Armani suit with a Brunello Cuccinelli pocket square. Tr√©s magnifique!

While the film is set in the 1930s, the cover and accompanying inner spread, shot by Emma Summerton and styled by Arianne Phillips, emote that sultry Mad Men-esque style set in the 60s, and it's perfection. Owen is swank and sexy and we love seeing Kidman looking so luscious and luminous.Airbrushed, but luminous.
