Who's afraid of Lindsay Lohan?Lifetime sure isn't, and we have an exclusive clip from Liz & Dick to prove it!In the scene, Richard Burton (Grant Bowler) introduces Elizabeth Taylor to writer Ernest Lehman (Sex and the City's David Eigenberg), who pitches the movie adaptation of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? to gauge her interest. Liz is instantly intrigued, but is less so when her husband immediately attemps to attach himself to the project alongside her.Of course, we know Burton does go on to eventually star with his wife in the film, but as the clip below showcases, it was definitely a bumpy road to get there.

Liz & Dick premieres Sunday, Nov. 25, at 9 p.m. on Lifetime.
