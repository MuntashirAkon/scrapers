Tom Hanks is the latest to offer a tribute to the late acting legend, recalling their work together on the Chicago-based gangster film The Road to Perdition:"Paul Newman told me his hotel in Chicago was a room at the YMCA, which was not hard to imagine. He considered himself just another member of the acting company, who would call his wife during breaks and confess to feeling self-conscious on the first day of shooting. But he was Paul Newman, and could not mask the fact he was simply—yet elegantly—an extraordinary artist and man. How lucky we all have been..."Hanks is also one of an A-list group of celebs set to take part in a reading of Ernest Hemingway's The World of Nick Adams, proceeds from which will benefit the Painted Turtle, one of the 11 free camps Newman's Hole in the Wall Gang opened for children suffering from life-threatening illnesses.
