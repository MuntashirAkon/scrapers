Woody Allen -- My Typewriter's Worth a Fortune (VIDEO)/nWoody Allen's clunky typewriter could fetch more money than any computer in the world.Â  Our photog spotted the legendary writer /director grabbing dinner in L.A. Monday night at Craig's with wife, Soon-Yi. Woody talked about the legendary Olympia SM-3 ... which he's used to write every movie he's ever made. Get this ... we contacted L.A. Police Commission Prez Steve Soboroff, who is one of the biggest typewriter collectors in the world. Soboroff says Woody's typewriter could set a record, adding it's more valuable than even Hemingway's. He thinks the high bid would be around $1 million./n
