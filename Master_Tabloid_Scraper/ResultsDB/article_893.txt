American Music Awards: Taylor Swift & Justin Timberlake Big Winners /n
Justin Timberlake and Taylor Swift may have been crowned the king and queen of the American Music Awards, but only one woman was named an icon.

Good Girl Gone Bad Rihanna was the first singer to ever receive the grand title as part of the 2013 ceremony that saw her also walk away with the award for Favorite Female Artist in the soul and R&B category.

Country star Taylor Swift walked away with twice as many awards though, including Artist Of The Year, Favorite Female Pop/ Rock Artist and Favorite Female Country Artist. Her album Red was also named the Favorite Country Album of 2013.
