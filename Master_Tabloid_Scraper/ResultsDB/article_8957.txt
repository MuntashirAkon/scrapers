As Radar reported, Kardashian was livid when she learned she could possibly become Swift’s latest target on the singer’s new album.
“It’s about to get ugly, and Kim is ready to shut Taylor down!” a source told Radar.
Swift released her first single from her upcoming album Reputation on Thursday night. Her sixth album will be released on November 10.
