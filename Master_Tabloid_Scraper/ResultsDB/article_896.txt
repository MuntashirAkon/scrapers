Amanda Berry Makes First Public Appearance Since Kidnapping Release/n
Looking happy and amazingly healthy, Amanda Berry appeared at her first public event since being released after a decade held hostage by Ariel Castro.
Berry went to the RoverFest concert in Cleveland Saturday night. She and her family were introduced and invited to the stage, where she stood alongside rapper Nelly.
On Friday, Castro pleaded guilty to 977 counts of kidnap and rape and was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole plus 1,000 year.

The deal spared Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight the trauma of going through a trial.
Berry didn’t address the public at the rock event but a concert goer told the Cleveland Plain Dealer, “she was smiling and happy.”
