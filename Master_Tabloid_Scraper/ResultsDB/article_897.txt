 Crazy in Love? Jennifer Love Hewitt Threatens to Quit 'The Client List' If Producers Don't.../n
Brian Hallisay gave Jennifer Love Hewitt a ring — and now she wants to give him a bigger paycheck.
Season 2 of The Client List wrapped on Sunday night, but Season 3 is in jeopardy, Deadline.com reports because the series’ star  is threatening to quit if her fiancé and baby daddy is not given a bigger role.
Hallisay has already made the jump from recurring character to series regular, and JLH wants him to play graduate to her leading man, Deadline claims. The series’ show runner, however, has reportedly pitched the current male lead – -and much bigger name — Colin Egglesfield to play the on-screen baby daddy.

Complicating matters, Love isn’t just the star of the show, but also an Executive Producer and sometime director.
“I hear the two sides are currently at an impasse, leading to the delay in the Season 3 decision,” Deadeline‘s TV editor Nellie Andreeva writes. “I also hear both sides appear willing to walk away …” presumably leaving the show’s entire crew without a job.
A rep for JLH insists, “There are many story lines we are exploring.”
