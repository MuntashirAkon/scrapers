Though many are waiting with bated breath for the release of Taylor Swift’s highly-anticipated sixth album, there’s one person who isn’t too thrilled with her Reputation.

Kim Kardashian is said to be afraid of what the “Bad Blood” singer will drag out on her new record given their tumultuous history. After all, it seems Tay is trying to reclaim that “snake” image she’s been slapped with since her beef over Kanye West’s infamous lyrics in “Famous”
Via Wet Paint:
“One of the few people out there that is not very excited for Taylor Swift’s upcoming music is Kim Kardashian,” a source revealed.
“She feels that she will be attacked along with Kanye in a future song over their past differences and she doesn’t want to deal with the fallout of a Taylor Swift song and what that does to people.”
