Khloé Kardashian may not have an engagement ring yet, but she sure is getting a lot of diamonds from boyfriend Tristan Thompson!

The 33-year-old reality star, who was spotted filming more scenes for Keeping Up with the Kardashians Friday, recently took to social media to share the blinged out gift she received from her beau. Sharing multiple videos of the blinding bauble on Snapchat, the Revenge Body host gushed, “Look at my Armenian crest that my baby made for me.”
The gold chain featured the official coat of arms of Armenia medallion encrusted diamonds. Khloé accessorized the chain with a more delicate necklace — also studded with jewels — reading “Double T,” a shout-out to her boyfriend’s initials.
“I love it,” she cooed. “Let’s go, Armenia.”

In 2015, Khloé and Kim Kardashian journeyed to Armenia to get in touch with their roots, meeting with the country’s Prime Minister while learning about their paternal family’s homeland. Since the trip, the girls have been very vocal about recognizing the Armenian Genocide.
“I am proud to be an Armenian!!!” wrote earlier this year on the 102-year anniversary of the tragedy. “It is our duty to not be silent whenever and wherever human beings endure suffering and humiliation no matter their race or creed. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented. It saddens me that history books don’t acknowledge such torture but my voice will be used to bring awareness to my people for being survivors!!!”
