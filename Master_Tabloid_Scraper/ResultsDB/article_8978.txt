Prince’s legacy will live on in more ways than one.

The Pantone Color Institute honored the late singer — who was often referred to as The Purple One due to his love of the hue — with a mauve shade of his own. Dubbed “Love Symbol #2,” the color was unveiled with the blessings of Prince’s estate.
Via Revolt TV:
The color was “inspired by his custom-made Yamaha purple piano” and will serve as the “official color across the brand [Prince] left behind,” according to a press release. The title of the shade is inspired by the singer’s unpronounceable name change in 1993, which was later copyrighted.
“The color purple was synonymous with who Prince was and will always be. This is an incredible way for his legacy to live on forever,” Troy Carter, entertainment adviser to Prince’s Estate, said in a statement.
