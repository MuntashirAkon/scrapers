There are six new carnation styles, as well as other bouquets that have the flower sprinkled in throughout. The arrangements start at just $40 and go up to $70, depending on the size you want (choose from 20-60 carnations). And because carnations have an extremely long life span (up to three weeks!), you’ll certainly be getting your money’s worth.
