Shake the Room" and of course, "Getting Jiggy Wit' It."

At the premiere event for Carpool Karaoke: The Series, Corden told E! News' Jason Kennedy that the enormity of his life constantly blows his own mind. "Are you kidding? I'm constantly Google Earthing myself and imagining if I could tell my 12-year-old self that this is my life. His head would explode," Corden gushed. "Are you joking? I never even thought I'd get to meet Will Smith, let alone have emails and texts with him and stuff like that."Next week’s episodes, which premieres on Aug. 15, feature Alicia Keys, John Legend, Metallica and Billy Eichner.Fans can watch the whole premiere episode, now on Apple Music.
