Teen Cannibal Austin Harrouf Was NOT On Bath Salts During Shocking Double Murder — See What FBI Drugs Tests Revealed!/n

This case continues to shock us.
When we first read the story of Austin Harrouff and his admitted double murder and cannibalism, we thought he had to be on drugs.
And we weren't alone — arresting officers were sure the "teen cannibal" had taken bath salts or their new counterpart, flakka.
But according to Attorney Nellie King the FBI drug tests, performed at the bureau's drug lab at Quantico, showed Harrouff was not under the influence of either designer drug.

Apart from "medically introduced" drugs given to the 19-year-old at the hospital, there were no drugs present — just trace amounts of THC, meaning he had previously smoked marijuana.
There was also ethanol in his blood, though it's unclear the source. King argued it could have been the chemicals Harrouff claimed to have drunk from his victims' garage.
Last week Harrouff plead not guilty to the murders of John Stevens III and Michelle Mishcon. We'll keep you up to date on any more twists in this disturbing trial.
