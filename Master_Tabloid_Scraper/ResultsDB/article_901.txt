Olympic Gymnast Simone Biles Splits With Trainer Who Coached Her Since She Was 8 Years Old! Find Out Why!/n

They couldn't have parted ways on a better note!
Simone Biles will no longer be training under Aimee Boorman, her gymnastics coach of 11 years.
After winning four gold medals and one bronze medal at the Rio Olympics, the pint-sized gymnast is parting ways with her trainer since she was 8 years old.
For over a decade, Boorman coached Simone at the World Champions Centre in Spring, Texas, working for the 19-year-old's parents Ron and Nellie (who own the gym) and her brother Adam (the gym's general manager).

Boorman's decision to stop coaching the gymnast — who she led to three world all-around championship titles — is due to her husband being offered a job in Florida, causing the family to move out of Houston.
While the coach says she is "excited" for her new adventure working at EVO Athletics as Executive Director of Women's Gymnastics, she will always "be there as a mentor" for Simone!
Speaking to People, she said:

"We were both sad, but [Simone] understands that life moves on and she knows that if she plans to continue in gymnastics… I will always be willing to coach her. I will be there as a mentor."
Boorman says her and Biles still keep in touch, and will always be close with each other, adding:

"We're texting each other every couple of days. We are both happy for each other. We are both close and we always will be."
Awww! We wish both women the best of luck on the next chapters of their careers!
