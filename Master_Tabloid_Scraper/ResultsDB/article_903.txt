Whoa, nellie!
If you thought John Legend, Jennifer Nettles, & Hunter Hayes were impressive on the CMT Music Awards stage, then this will really stir your grits!
The three vastly different pop stars joined forces to release a rad new single on iTunes, a countryfied version of John's hit cut All of Me!!!
And guess what? It rocks!!!
Ch-ch-check out the track for yourself (above)!
Wow! Sounds John Legend-ary to us!!! Can U believe Hunter Hayes arranged it only hours before last week's CMTs???
Good work, y'all!
