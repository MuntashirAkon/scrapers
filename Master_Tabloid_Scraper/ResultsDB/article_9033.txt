Six years after Jesse James‘ humiliating cheating scandal, he still doesn’t seem to regret cheating on Sandra Bullock!
In a wide-ranging interview with the Daily Mail, James, 47, discusses his betrayal of former flame, and finding happiness today with wife number four, drag racer and heiress Alexis DeJoria.
“We like the same stuff, the same music, the same everything. We like all these things,” James gushed. “It makes me look back at other relationships and be like, ‘I was an idiot! What was I thinking? That was never going to work.’ But I guess that’s how you learn, you know.”

He’s been ripped apart on social media ever since, with many people angry that he hurt someone as beloved as Bullock. But James still doesn’t seem to think that he was too blame.
