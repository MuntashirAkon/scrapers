Trump Ratings TANK! See The Best Twitter Reactions To His 'Too Little, Too Late' Response To Charlottesville!/n

Did you think Donald Trump's response to Charlottesville was too little too late?
Don't worry, you weren't alone!
According to a Gallup tracking poll on Monday, Drumpf's approval ratings have dropped to their lowest EVER, with only 34% saying they approve. Meanwhile his disapproval has naturally hit an all-time high at 61%.

Frankly, we are horrified that a third of the country is still on his side, but it's better than nothing.
And it's probably the only thing that will actually affect Trump, who cares more about ratings than racism, as Modern Family creator Danny Zuker hilariously pointed out on Twitter:

I once challenged @RealDonaldTrump's ratings & he tweeted me in 15 minutes. It took him 3 days to say the KKK is bad. Sorry, it's too late.

It felt like @realDonaldTrump read the TelePrompTer message condemning hate groups like a hostage forced to read a statement by his captors.

Trump's face when he denounces White Nationalism and the KKK is the same face I made when my parents made me eat brussels sprouts.

TRUMP: Racism is [looks at the smeared words on the palm of his hand]â€¦ blad.
â€” Steve Hogarty (@misterbrilliant) August 14, 2017



Why did Trump not renounce the support of KKK, white nationalists, and neo-Nazis and call on them to stop wearing his hats?

Trump just said, "Racism has no place in America." Agreed. That's why we've got to get him out of the White House.

All it took was 3 days of crushing public pressure for @realDonaldTrump to finally muster the courage to condemn nazism & racism.

No child gets credit 4, after being pushed for 2 days, reluctantly apologizing 4 an affront. Trump gets no credit for his late condemnation.

It took trump 10 minutes to condemn black CEO who quit his advisory council over #charlottsville but took him two days to condemn the klan

Trump's tweet attacks on Kenneth Frazier make it hard to accept his statements today as an authentic disavowal of racial violence.

3 days later, Trump calls White Supremacy "Repugnant."

And several couldn't help but notice Trump paired his late denouncement of racism with the news he was "seriously considering" pardoning Joe Arpaio, his friend and fellow leader of the racist Birther movement:

Trump said he may pardon the most corrupt Sheriff in town. Joe Arpaio's hatred of immigrants is equivalent to Neo Nazi thugs & KKK ideology.

Trump today: I'm yelling at the only black CEO I know and pardoning a bigoted sheriff. Also, I hate racism
â€” Will Bunch (@Will_Bunch) August 14, 2017

Arpaio was Trump's partner in crime on the birther investigation. He is literally living proof of Trump's commitment to racism.

Normal humans have empathy, know right from wrong. Trump doesn't. I'll say it in 2 languages: No es apto para ser humano. Unfit to be human! https://t.co/Veuv0wSHB5
