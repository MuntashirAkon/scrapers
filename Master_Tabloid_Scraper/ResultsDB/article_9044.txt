Twitter Reacts To Donald Trump’s Reported White House 'Dump' Comment!/n

Whatever, Donnie! We would LOVE to live in the The White House!
As we reported, in the August issue of Sports Illustrated, Donald Trump is quoted saying, "That White House is a real dump." Now, it's important to note that according to Golf.com (where the entire article is available), a Trump spokesperson denies the event ever occurred. Of course, it's also important to note that Trump's team often says things like "he was joking" when horrible quotes happen.

Almost immediately after the President's reported words went viral, the Internet made fun of the stupid quote on social media!

"The White House is a dump" would've been a week-long scandal/PR crisis in the Obama admin, crowing out all talk of everything else.

Since Classy Guy Trump thinks the White House is a total dump, presumably he won't mind being evicted from it soon.

Trump called the White House "a real dump"
Imagine if obama did that. 24 hour coverage on Fox News. Hypocrites are the lowest form of life.

If @realDonaldTrump truly thinks the White House is a "dump," many of us would chip in to pay for the Uhaul to take him back to Trump Tower.

It takes a lot of balls to say the White House is a dump when your own pad looks like it was decorated by Flavor Flav's dentist. pic.twitter.com/POuFRhQyXJ

If the White House is a dump it's because he made it that way

What does a Trump voter, living in a home he can't sell still underwater from 2008, think of the president calling his mansion "a dump"?

Seriously, if Obama called the White House a "real dump" Fox News would have covered it 24/7 for at least a year.

Trump thinks the White House is a real dump. Well, many Americans think a human heap of garbage has taken up residence there. https://t.co/4sfIyJ3re4
