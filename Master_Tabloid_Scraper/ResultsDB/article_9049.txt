There's a brand-new Hollywood romance in town.A source tells E!

"Minka has been there for Jesse not only as a girlfriend, but also as a friend."Our source added, "Jesse is really private with everything especially his relationships but feels open with Minka and she has been supportive and that's what he needs now."Back in January, Minka caught the attention of fans when she posted an Instagram with Jesse while in Paris. At the time, the pair was not romantically involved. Instead, they were simply working on a video game together.

While he doesn't refer to Aryn by name, Jesse appeared to have addressed the relationship in Jay-Z and Tidal's new offering."I was in a relationship 13 years, 13 real years, not 5 years, not 7 years, 13 years and all of a sudden mother f---kers are writing think-pieces that I somehow threw a 13-year relationship," he shared. "Like thee most painful experience I've had in my life like with a person I've loved with all of my heart—that I threw a person and my family in the trash because a girl I work with is cute."Chris Rock, Will Smith, Kendrick Lamar, Anthony Anderson and Aziz Ansari were also featured on the project.People was first to report the new relationship.
