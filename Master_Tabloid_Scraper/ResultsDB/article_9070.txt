Jesse Williams Ditches Wedding Ring in NYC /nReconciliation is looking less and less likely for Jesse Williams ... who was out in NYC this week sans wedding ring amid the divorce from his wife Aryn.  As we previously reported, the  "Grey's Anatomy " star and his wife separated months ago -- and Jesse is no longer staying in the family home.  Jesse was spotted out with his brother and mother -- and seemed to be in good spirits during a Saturday lunch date.  Not seen in the photos ...
