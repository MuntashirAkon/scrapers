Donald Sterling -- I LOVE Black People ... Who Make Delicious Burgers/nDonald Sterling is pressing more flesh in the Black community these days than Al Sharpton, Jesse Jackson, and Bill Clinton combined -- and his mea culpa tour made a delicious stop today ... for burgers.The soon-to-be ex-owner of the Clippers did lunch at Mo Better Burgers in L.A. -- a favorite spot for people of all colors ... such as Dr. Dre, Tone Loc, and Mayor Eric Garcetti.On his way out ... Donald kept mum about dropping the NBA lawsuit -- but watch happened when we asked about his meal. He dropped not one ... not two ... but THREE kisses on the African-American cook who, for some reason, walked him out to his car!  He also gave us a review of the burgers. Finally, some advice from Sterling you might actually take.Sterling went to a Baptist church service in South L.A. last weekend. Start the countdown to his Slauson Swap Meet appearance./n
