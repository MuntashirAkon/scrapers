Kurt Warner -- 7 Kids Go Hollywood!! Making BANK Off Dad's Biopic/nEx-NFL great Kurt Warner's set to rake in almost a million dollars for a movie about his life, and he's sharing the wealth by writing his SEVEN kids into the deal.FOX bought the movie rights to Kurt's biography  "All Things Possible " a year ago, but since 5 of his kids are under age -- a minors contract has to be filed with the courts. Turns out dear ol' dad was very generous.TMZ Sports obtained a copy of the contracts for Jada (13), Kade (15), Elijah (10), and twins Sienna and Sierra (8) -- and according to the docs ... they will split 25% of all salaries the family earns. Kurt and his wife Brenda's 25-year-old son Zachary, who suffered brain damage as a child ... also gets a 5% cut.The other 70% will be split between Kurt, Brenda, and their adult daughter Jesse.So far the family's only earned $135K ... a down payment for the movie rights. If FOX goes forward, and shoots the movie they'll get another $715K. The floodgates really open if the movie is a box office hit -- they'll get a bunch of bonuses, potentially as high as $200K.Kurt deserves way more than golf balls or a tie next Father's Day./n
