“The whole thing just seemed like too much of a coincidence,” tattled a source. “I don’t buy it for a minute!”

According to a source, the James Bond star reportedly can’t handle his Oscar winning wife’s accolades overshadowing his own. “Rachel’s given first pass on the best Hollywood projects, while Daniel complains that he’s conscripted to mindless action schlock,” a source told Radar exclusively.
And Weisz is reportedly fed up with Craig’s jealousy over her career, according to our source. “She doesn’t feel like she should have to apologize for being so successful.”
