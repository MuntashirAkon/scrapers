Lorde Is Having A Modern Day Cinderella Moment Dressed For The MTV VMAs Red Carpet!/n

She's having a moment!
Clad in an Oscars-worthy ensemble, Lorde stunned at the 2017 MTV VMAs!
The feathered pale purple Monique Lhuillier ball gown was striking against her chestnut lob. WOW!
Makeup was also chiseled and on point! Such a win for the Perfect Places singer!
