Katy Perry On Resolving Her Feud With Calvin Harris: It Was 'Time To Put All That Behind Us'/n

Time to bury the hatchet!
While calling into On Air With Ryan Seacrest on Wednesday, Katy Perry revealed she reconciled with Calvin Harris at an Oscars after party this past year — and that ultimately led the artists to collaborating for the hit Feels!
In case you need a refresher, the two have a history of getting into "spats" with each other on Twitter, not to mention all the overcooked beef between Katy and Calvin's ex, Taylor Swift.

The Witness singer recalled of the moment:
"I saw Calvin at [the] Vanity Fair Oscar party. We just bumped into each other and he said, ‘I think I have a song that you should come check out.’ We had always meant to work together for years and years and years and we’d had little falling outs here and there … we had some Twitter spats … and it was time to put that behind us. … He played this one part of "Feels" and I was like, ‘Oh yeah.’"
She added:
"This is like my favorite song off the record. I was just down to do it. I've always wanted to collaborate with him for years and years and years."
And we're sure glad they did!
