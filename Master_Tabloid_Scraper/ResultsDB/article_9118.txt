Daniel Day-Lewis, the only man to have won three Academy Awards for Best Actor, has quit acting.

A rep for the 60-year-old confirmed the retirement this week, telling Variety in a statement, “Daniel Day-Lewis will no longer be working as an actor. He is immensely grateful to all of his collaborators and audiences over the many years. This is a private decision and neither he nor his representatives will make any further comment on this subject. ”
In four decades, the actor received much critic acclaim, including winning Oscars for his roles in 2012’s Lincoln, 2007’s There Will Be Blood, and 1989’s My Left Foot. He also earned two other Academy Award nods for Gangs of New York and In the Name of the Father.
Day-Lewis has only one final film awaiting release. Directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, the untitled drama sets in the world of high fashion and will be released on December 25, 2017.
