Harry Styles — former One Directioner, current solo artist, future Oscar winner — released his self-titled album, Harry Styles, on Friday (May 12, 2017).

The 10-track album includes “Sign of the Times,” the lead single he released earlier in the month. In addition to the digital album, you can purchase a physical version of the LP, which contains a gatefold vinyl LP, digipak CD and a special limited-edition soundcarrier with a 32-page hardcover book featuring photos from his time in the studio, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

When Styles appeared on Nick Grimshaw’s Radio 1 show to debut the album, Grimshaw asked if a track called “Two Ghosts” is about his ex-girlfriend Taylor Swift. The lyrics to the song read, “Same lips, red. Same eyes, blue,” which fans interpreted in their own way.
“I think it’s pretty, like, self-explanatory,” Styles responded with hesitation. “I think, y’know it’s about sometimes things change and you can do all the same things… and sometimes it’s just different, y’know?”
Grimshaw threw the show to the song, introducing it by saying, “So here we go, the one about Taylor Swift.”
