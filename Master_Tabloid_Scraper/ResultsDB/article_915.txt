 Last season there ended up being about seventeen winners of The Glee Project. Ryan Murphy fell  in love with so many of his special little snowflakes, he wanted to  write them all into his hit show.
This year, though, he is insistent  that there will be only one winner at the end of the season. It makes  sense: There are already far too many characters on Glee to  service individually without adding another handful.
All this means is  that competition should be much more cutthroat. After all, no one goes  on reality shows to make friends, right? So far, though, we could make a  case for just about every kid taking the title — and the role. 
And just how would we cast The Glee Project kids on Glee? Well, we’re so glad you asked!
