Oscar De La Hoya Blasts Dana White, 'Disrespectful' /nOscar De La Hoya is firing back at Dana White -- saying it was  "disrespectful " for the UFC boss to book McGregor vs. Mayweather three weeks ahead of Canelo vs. GGG.  White had previously attacked Oscar in a expletive-filled verbal smackdown after ODLH bashed the McGregor fight as nothing more than a  "circus. " Fast forward to Wednesday when Oscar appeared on ESPN with Canelo Alverez and Gennady Golovkin and was asked how he felt about Dana upstreaming him.   "It was disrespectful, " Oscar said.  "I would have thought that Dana White would have a little more respect with this boxing event taking place, because look, you just don’t do that. "  "It's like having the Super Bowl and then three weeks later the World Series takes place, the final game. It just doesn’t happen. "  "We have the whole year to stage these types of big events ... They could have maybe staged it in November or December but, look, it is what it is. "  "We have a superfight here. We have a real fight, and that’s exactly what we’re focusing on. "/n
