Morgan Spurlock Says Reality Winner's Alleged Leaking Isn't Treason/nMorgan Spurlock is applauding Reality Winner for  "stepping up " to help Americans get closer to the truth ... even though she's been charged with leaking a classified NSA document. We got the  "Super Size Me " filmmaker at LAX, and he was very candid about Winner's arrest. He stopped short of calling it BS, but said he thinks government whistleblowers are a necessity these days ... especially if it relates to Russia. As for what happens to Winner going forward -- Morgan will be keeping a close eye, because he'd love to tag-team with an Oscar-winning documentarian to tell her story. /n
