Jerry Lewis Cause Of Death: Heart Failure/n
Jerry Lewis passed away at the age of 91 on Sunday, and RadarOnline.com can reveal what really killed the comedy king.
Lewis died from heart failure, according to the Clark County Nevada Coroner. The official cause of death was ischemic cardiomyopathy — a term used to describe individuals whose heart can no longer pump enough blood to the rest of their body due to a narrowing of the small blood vessels.
Sources say an autopsy will not be conducted on the body because he was under doctor’s care at the time of his death.
