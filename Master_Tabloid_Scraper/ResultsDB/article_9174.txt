Recovering druggie Tom Sizemore admits he wanted to “grab, f**k* and kill” ex-girlfriend Juliette Lewis, RadarOnline.com has learned!
Sizemore, 55, met Lewis, 44, on the set of the 1994 Oliver Stone film Natural Born Killers.
“I f**ked her,” Sizemore shared on The Night Time Show podcast. “Moved in with her, bought a house with her.”
The actor says the two had a drug-fueled love affair, complete with its own ups and downs, during the filming.
“She broke my nose. On camera,” Sizemore revealed. “We were having an argument as a couple. I was an a**hole.”

As Sizemore and the podcast hosts laughed about the incident, the Twin Peaks star went on to describe her as an animal.
“Look at her, she’s a little wild feral f**king…look at her,” he stammered. “Like a feral little lynx. Grab her, f**k her, and kill her.”
Sizemore also shared a story about nearly nailing a young Lindsay Lohan, but admitted both of them were, “too high to ‘f’.”
Sizemore is no stranger to drug abuse, and spent time in a rehab facility in 2014, after he was caught on camera doing crystal meth.
He also spent some time in jail last year after being arrested on domestic violence charges.
