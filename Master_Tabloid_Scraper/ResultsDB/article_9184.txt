Ailing Actor & Comedian Jerry Lewis Hospitalized In Las Vegas/n
RadarOnline.com has learned that Jerry Lewis was hospitalized in Las Vegas on Saturday, June 3.
The actor’s rep Candi Cazau told Radar: “He got a urinary tract infection and got put on antibiotics. Because Jerry is 91, they wanted to take precautions.”
It’s still unclear if the star has left the hospital yet, but Cazau added that, “He’s good.”

The star, who first got his start in Hollywood at age 5, is determined to keep working despite his health concerns. So far, he’s battled prostate cancer and suffered two heart attacks. He also has Type 1 diabetes and continues to deal with chronic lung disease.
“Jerry is insisting on performing to the very end,” a source told the National ENQUIRER. “That’s how much of a trouper he is! He doesn’t need the money. He’s worth a reported $50 million, but he needs to hear the applause a few final times before he meets his Maker. He’s joked, ‘I’ll die onstage — in the middle of a joke.’ But the fact is, it’s a struggle to go on.”
