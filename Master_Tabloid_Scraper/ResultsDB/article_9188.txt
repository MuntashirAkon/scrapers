In addition to being the longtime comedy partner of singer Dean Martin, Lewis appeared in movies like The Nutty Professor, and The King of Comedy.
He was also very well known for  being the chairman of the Muscular Dystrophy Association, and he hosted their live telethons for nearly five decades.
Our thoughts and prayers are with his family, friends, and loved ones — as well as all those who he touched through his extensive work.
Celebs and entertainers reached out to pay tribute to him (below), too: 

Jerry Lewis just died. When I met him, I feel apart, just sobbed. I guess it's time for that again.
