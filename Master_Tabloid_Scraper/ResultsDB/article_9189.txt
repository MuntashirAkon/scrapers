Listen To This: Turn It Up!/n

Macklemore has pulled off quite the comeback!
This new era is so glorious!
The rapper's new release, Marmalade, features Lil Yachty and reminds us a bit of that other MC's song iSpy.
Childlike vibe with adult lyrics and a feel-good vibe.
This is such a hit!
Check it out above!
