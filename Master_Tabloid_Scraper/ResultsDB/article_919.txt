Turn your speakers up!In 2004, Nelly released "Tilt Ya Head Back," the second single from his album Sweat. The song sampled Curtis Mayfield's 1972 jam "Superfly" and featured new vocals by Christina Aguilera. But, as producer Dorian Moore told The St. Louis Post-Dispatch (via MTV) in 2004, the duet was originally offered to Britney Spears. Moore claimed her record label, Jive, deemed it too "urban" and passed. Both Aguilera and Janet Jackson were considered after Spears opted out. Twelve years later, a snippet of Spears' demo surfaced online, giving fans an idea of what could have been. Singapore's Gold 905 radio station shared 30 seconds of the song, which then made a splash on social media.Nelly and Aguilera's version peaked at No. 58 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. Its music video debuted on MTV's Making the Video, and they performed the duet at the MTV Movie Awards. "Tilt Ya Head Back" wasn't Spears and Nelly's first time teaming up, though, as they performed at the 2001 Super Bowl Halftime Show with Aerosmith, Mary J. Blige, 'N Sync and Run-D.M.C.
