Did Kevin Hart Really Cheat On His Pregnant Wife?? Twitter Weighs In On The Shocking Video!/n

Ooh, this does not look good for Kevin Hart!
In case you hadn't heard, the Jumanji: Welcome To The Jungle star was filmed in a car with an unknown woman outside his hotel at 5 a.m. on the now infamous date of July 3.
What exactly they were up to is unclear, though it does look like they get a little too close at times in the twenty minute vid.

Was he seriously cheating on Eniko Parrish??
Well, it wouldn't be unheard of; the comic did cheat on his first wife Torrei (a fact he has admitted) and as Torrei has claimed, he cheated on her with Eniko in the first place — something Twitter users were quick to point out.
See some of the most savage tweets (below): 

If I was Eniko I would start putting all of Kevin Hart's favorite things on the top shelf pic.twitter.com/BIFLzPbGAT

Kevin Hart is another example of
"If you marry a man who cheats on his wife, you'll be married to a man who cheats on his wife."

On behalf of the dark-skinned community, I would like to say R. Kelly, Usher and Kevin Hart do not represent all of us.
