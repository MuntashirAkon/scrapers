Preach. Sadly, this isn't the first time the A-lister has had to deal with comments about her weight.
In case you forgot, back in 2015 Clarkson stopped by Ellen DeGeneres' talk show and addressed the criticism she has gotten about her weight gain. During the sit down, the mother-of-two explained that she's been facing jabs about her size since her Idol days and has learned to love her body.
LOVES it. We think Kelly has become one hell of a role model. *Snaps*
