Brad Pitt seems to have moved on from Angelina Jolie for good.

The Allied star, who split with his wife last year after more than 10 years together, is said to have started seeing other women again amid rumors his exes — a list of which includes the likes of Kate Hudson, Gwyneth Paltrow and Juliette Lewis — have been contacting him for another chance at love. Though the 53-year-old has yet to go public with anyone, Pitt is single and ready to mingle.
“Brad has been dating a bit, but he is extremely careful to keep it secret,” a source tells Page Six. “He’s focused on his kids, and he’s happy — now that he has settled his divorce from Angelina — to be out of the public eye.”

The insider adds “Brad isn’t interested” in rekindling a romance with his ex-girlfriends, saying, “No partying, no fun. Just work and parenting.”
While the world is Pitt’s oyster, there is one person he won’t be dating: Sienna Miller. When gossip started to spread that she was flirting with Pitt, who executive produced her latest film The Lost City of Z, at a recent dinner, the actress quickly shot down dating reports.
“I’m not going to even dignify it with a response,” she dismissed when asked. “It’s predictable and silly.”
