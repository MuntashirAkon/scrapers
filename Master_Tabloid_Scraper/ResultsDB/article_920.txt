At this point, Latino Mix 105.7's listeners definitely know all the words to Nelly's "Hot in Herre."The San Francisco radio station has been playing the song over and over uninterrupted since at least 3 p.m. Friday, according to Gawker.com, with the Nelly-a-thon also being livestreamed on the station's website.The big question here is why the radio station decided to, um, treat its listeners to the rapper's hit 2002 single repeatedly for hours.

The answer? Well, it's not Nelly's birthday and the radio station isn't celebrating some sort of Nelly day. Instead, the song repeat is nothing more than a classic radio stunt, with the station playing the song in honor of a format change that will re-brand the channel as Hot 105.7.Still, they could've at least put one more song in the mix to give Nelly's ditty a break. Snoop Dogg's "Drop It Like It's Hot" or, Katy Perry's "Hot N Cold" for example?We're just sayin'.
