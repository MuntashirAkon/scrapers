The Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings fandoms were thrown into a frenzy this week when cast members from the respective franchises reunited after spending years apart.

Jason Isaacs, who played Lucius Malfoy in the Harry Potter series, recently met up with onscreen son Tom Felton at — where else? —  The Wizarding World of Harry Potter at the Universal Orlando Resort. If that “father-and-son” reunion wasn’t magical enough already, co-stars Matthew Lewis and Warwick Davis also came along for the so-called trip back to Hogwarts. Be still our hearts!

“Me and the wizarding blond bombshell reunited and wandering around Universal’s #wizardingworldofharrypotter extremely cognito,” Isaacs wrote on his Instagram. On Twitter, he wrote, “Me, @TomFelton & @Mattdavelewis marvel at them getting older as I get younger. 💘 to all the Potter fans who remind us to fight for the light.”

In other reunion news, five out of the nine members of the original crew in 2001’s The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring got together for some laughs on Monday night (Jan. 30, 2017). Like how the fellowship would’ve wanted, Orlando Bloom, Elijah Wood, Viggo Mortensen, Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd enjoyed a boy’s night out at a local tavern.
“They have a cave troll,” Monaghan joked on Instagram, sharing a photo of their old battle stance (though Aragorn has seemingly found himself a gun instead of a sword).

“My captain. My king,” the actor captioned a photo of Mortensen. He later added in the captions of another picture featuring his fellow Hobbits, “Doffing the off the shoulder band look with aplomb @boydbilly @billyboydactor making @electrice and I look like onions.”
Now all we need is Gandalf, Boromir, Gimli and Sam!
