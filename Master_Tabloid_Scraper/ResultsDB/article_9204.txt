Matthew Lewis, best known for playing Neville Longbottom  in the Harry Potter movies, is engaged to girlfriend Angela Jones, according to TMZ.

Lewis reportedly proposed to Jones in November while the couple was in Paris. Judging by TMZ’s photo, which appears to be from Jones’s private Instagram, Lewis popped the question in front of the Eiffel Tower. That sounds like it took Gryffindor levels of bravery.
Jones works as an event planner for Universal Studios in Orlando, Fla. The couple reportedly met during an event at the park’s Wizarding World of Harry Potter and have been dating since July.

According to Entertainment Tonight, the couple shares more in common than a professional relationship with Harry Potter. They are both fans of Netflix’s Stranger Things. Lewis and Jones were spotted hanging out with star Millie Bobby Brown last October.
