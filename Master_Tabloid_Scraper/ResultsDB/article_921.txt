Hot in... So hot in herre... So hot in... OH!I was like, good gracious, ass bodacious/ Flirtatious, tryin' to show patience /I'm waitin' for the right time to shoot my steez (you know) /Waitin' for the right time to flash them keys...A Bay area radio station has been playing a little bit of (uh uh) and a lotta bit of Nelly's "Hot in Herre" this weekend. Latino Mix 105.7 started playing the song at 3 p.m. on Friday. And they're still playing it, on a loop, nearly three days later.I was like, good gracious, ass bodacious/ Flirtatious, tryin' to show patience/ I'm waitin' for the right time to shoot my steez (you know)/ Waitin' for the right time to flash them keys...As Friday turned into Saturday and the song still played, many wondered if the broadcast had been hijacked or if it was the work of a disgruntled DJ. Twitter birthed a hashtag to commemorate the event: #Nelly1057.

I was like, good gracious, ass bodacious/ Flirtatious, tryin' to show patience/ I'm waitin' for the right time to shoot my steez (you know)/ Waitin' for the right time to flash them keys... It turns out the reason behind the nonstop Nelly is far less sinister: Latino Mix is relaunching as Hot 105.7, an English language "contemporary rhythmic" station. SFGate notes, "Playing a song on loop is a common publicity stunt to mark a radio station's format change."
