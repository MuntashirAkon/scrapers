Bill Cosby Arrives at Court with Comedian Joe Torry, Actor Lewis Dix /nBill Cosby brought MORE celeb pals to court for day 4 of his sexual assault trial. Cosby walked in with comedian Joe Torry and actor Lewis Dix Jr. Thursday, and the pals seemed very relaxed, even jovial -- despite serious allegations against Cosby. Earlier this week, Cosby arrived at court locked arm-in-arm with Keshia Knight Pulliam ... and on Wednesday with another former co-star, Sheila Frazier. As we reported, the person who hasn't been by his side yet is his wife, Camille Cosby -- something the jury has, no doubt, noticed./n
