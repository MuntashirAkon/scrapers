Macklemore & Ryan Lewis Sued for Thrift Shop & Neon Cathedral/nMacklemore & Ryan Lewis' breakthrough hit wasn't an original ... according to a  "legendary " New Orleans jazz musician ... who's looking to get his cut. Paul Batiste says  "Thrift Shop " borrows heavily from 2 of his songs --  "Hip Jazz " and  "World of Blues. " He says the Macklemore track's beat and horn melodies come from his songs, which were recorded back in 1997 and 2000. Batiste describes himself as a founding member of The Batiste Brothers Band, and a  "major influence " of the current NOLA jazz scene. Whether you've heard of him or not isn't really the issue -- it's what you hear in the music. Take a listen and judge for yourself. BTW, Batiste is also suing over  "Neon Cathedral " -- claiming the duo lifted from 3 of his other songs. He wants his share of the profits from both Macklemore tunes.Â  Batiste has filed similar suits in the past against T-Pain, Rick Ross, DJ Khaled and several record labels./n
