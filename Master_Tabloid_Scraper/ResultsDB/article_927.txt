EXCLUSIVE! Chris Brown Celeb Basketball Game: Nelly, Waka Flocka Flame and More Slam-Dunk for Charity/n
He got game!Chris Brown put on his do-gooder cap this past weekend and hosted a celebrity basketball game in Atlanta featuring some of his famous friendsâ€”all in the name of charity.Nothing breezy about that, Breezy!

The Grammy winner rounded up pals like Nelly, Waka Flocka Flame and E! News's very own Terrence Jenkins, who all played against Atlanta's Hot 107.9 radio station.Breezy outfitted the team in custom tees from his Black Pyramid clothing line, and natch, everyone was psyched to hit the court."We got this in the bag," Nelly told E! News, thumping that "everyone will play well."

Waka Flocka Flame, on the other hand, quipped that folks should expect "a whole lot of fouling." But he later got serious, saying that it's important to "give back" and that "you can't do it for credit or publicity, you gotta do it out of the heart."Not all the A-list peeps were on the court, though. Sean Kingston watched from the stands, and he even poked fun at the whole brouhaha surrounding his supposed car "gift" from Justin Bieber, suggesting that Justin give the car to new mom Giuliana Rancic as a baby gift.

"I will make that call and talk to Justin and see what he can do," he cracked.But it was Brown who had the last word, later tweeting, "Thank you so much to all the supporters who came and showed love at my charity basketball event. @hot1079atl kicked AZZ! Real family."Proceeds from the event, sponsored by Jordan, were donated to Symphonic Love Foundation to support domestic violence prevention programs.
