Kendall Jenner has nothing to hide.

The 21-year-old is almost naked in La Perla’s latest pre-fall 2017 campaign. Posing topless in nothing but a red lace thong from the lingerie brand, the model seductively strikes a pose in front of a floral backdrop as she covers her breasts with her hands.
Other photos from the campaign — which were released in May — show the brunette clad in skimpy triangle bra and matching briefs, as well as a $1,810 floral slip dress.

The whole shoot was inspired by the work of artists Georgia O’Keeffe and Peter Max and photographed Mert & Marcus.
“Jenner exudes the certainty and self-assurance of a true heroine—owning her world through confidence and empowered femininity,” a press release for the campaign reads. “The explosive visual message is intended to shock and transport the viewer to a world of fantasy, color, and art.”
Earlier this month, Jenner wore the same thong — albeit in black — while showing off major underboob in a bedroom selfie shared on Instagram.
