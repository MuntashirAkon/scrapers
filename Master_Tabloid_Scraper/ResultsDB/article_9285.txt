The wait is over. HBO just dropped the official trailer for its highly anticipated seventh season of Game of Thrones.

Packed with epic battles scenes and one-liners that’ll undoubtedly be quoted by the most diehard fans from here on out, the minute-and-a-half teaser features Cersei (Lena Headey) describing all sorts of threats to King’s Landing while taking her place the Iron Throne as one of the few surviving Lannisters. (Well, as she puts it to her twin brother, the “last ones who count.”)
As seen in the preview, Tyrion Lannister (Peter Dinklage) and Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke) have safely made it across the Narrow Sea to dry land. Meanwhile, Sansa Stark (Sophie Turner) and Jon Snow (Kit Harington) continue to unite the clans of the north as Littlefinger (Aidan Gillen) tries weasel his way into the family.
Also starring Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, Maisie Williams, Liam Cunningham, John Bradley, Hannah Murray, Ellie Kendrick, Isaac Hempstead Wright, Gwendoline Christie, Conleth Hill, Nathalie Emmanuel, Bella Ramsey and Kristofer Hivju, Season 7 premieres July 16 on HBO.
