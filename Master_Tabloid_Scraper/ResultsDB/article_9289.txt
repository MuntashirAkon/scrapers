Pills were strewn about Prince’s home according to search warrants recently released by Minnesota police authorities.

The documents show that law enforcement agents found Ziploc bags and envelopes containing pills.
TMZ reports:
The docs bear out what TMZ has reported … Prince’s bodyguard was the person who went to a Walgreens pharmacy the day preceding the singer’s death to fill prescriptions, including Percocet.
And, Prince used an alias — Peter Bravestrong — and cops found a suitcase with that name that contained pill bottles along with the lyrics for the song, “U Got the Look.”
“The main doctor who was treating Prince — Dr. Michael Schulenberg — admitted to a detective he had prescribed Prince Oxycodone the same day Prince OD’d on a jet — 6 days before he died. The doctor put the Rx in Prince’s bodyguard’s name.
