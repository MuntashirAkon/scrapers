Doctor Who Debuts Trailer for Peter Capaldi's Final Special at SDCC/n
The goodbyes begin now, apparently. Doctor Who hit up Hall H for both the last day of San Diego Comic-Con and its last panel featuring Peter Capaldi and showrunner Steven Moffatt, and gave us a sneak peek at this year's Christmas Special. The special, called "Twice Upon a Time," will be Capaldi's final appearance as the Doctor, Moffatt's last episode as showrunner, and Pearl Mackie's last appearance as companion Bill Potts. It will also feature David Bradley as the first Doctor, who was originally played by William Hartnell, and writer/occasional Doctor Who guest star Mark Gatiss as "The Captain." Apparently, something has gone very wrong with time, trapping everyone inside a single moment, and it's up to the two doctors to fix it. 

Doctor Who will return to BBC America this Christmas.
