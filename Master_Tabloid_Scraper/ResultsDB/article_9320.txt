Rich The Kid Drops a Fortune on Papa Smurf Chain!!!/nRich The Kid hopefully is truly rolling in dough, because he's dripping in jewelry, and his latest acquisition set him back $75k. Rich was leaving Peter Marco Extraordinary Jewels Of Beverly Hills on Rodeo Drive Saturday, when he told us he dropped the loot to snap a Papa Smurf chain. As we reported, made a $2.5 million deal with Interscope last week, and celebrated in NYC by spending $140k a watch and another $100k on a chain. He thinks the money will never stop rolling in. Â Hope he's right./n
