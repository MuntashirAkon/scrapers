Kris Humphries Sells Beverly Hills House for $8.25 Million /nKris HumphriesÂ knows when to pull out ... and the housing market rewarded him handsomely. The Atlanta Hawks center just sold his Bev Hills pad for $8.25 million, which is a KILLING ... considering he bought the 3, bedroom, 4 bath house for $6.2 mil back in 2015. The 3,336 square foot house sits on nearly an acre with unobstructed city and coastline views. The house features tons of glass walls, gourmet kitchen and a den with a wet bar. Peter Cornell and Jason Oppenheim of The Oppenheim Group repped Kris. Jason also repped the buyer./n
