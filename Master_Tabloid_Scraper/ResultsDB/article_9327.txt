Pacman Jones Takes Joe Mixon to Future Concert /nAdam  "Pacman " Jones is taking Joe Mixon under his wing -- and treated the Bengals rookie to a night out at the Future concert this week ... TMZ Sports has learned.  Turns out, Jones is pretty tight with Future -- they grew up together in Atlanta -- and the rapper hooked the Bengals star up with tickets to his Cincinnati concert Wednesday at the Riverbend Music Center.  We're told Jones invited Mixon as his guest -- and they had a blast together and took pics with fans.  So, why Mixon? We're told Jones quietly mentors a lot of young players on the team -- including Joe -- and he likes the guy.  We reached out to Pacman's agent, Peter Schaffer﻿, for comment -- he told us the only issue that came up is that his son, Gavin, was upset he didn't get to go too. School night. You know how that goes. /n
