'Real Housewives of Atlanta' Guys Brawl, First Matt Jordan-Peter Thomas Fight Footage /nPeter Thomas and Matt Jordan's radio station brawl was as epic as advertised -- the video is finally out, and one of them definitely delivered an ass whoopin'. You'll recall ... the 'RHOA' guys went toe-to-toe back in March during a radio interview in Charlotte. There were several tense moments of trash talking while the host stepped between them ... but Matt eventually had enough, and charged at Peter. At the time, Peter bragged he'd held his own in the fight. You can decide for yourself. Peter is pressing assault charges, and our 'Housewives' sources tell us his attorney subpoenaed the video from the radio station.Â /n
