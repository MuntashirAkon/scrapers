Gisele Bündchen & Tom Brady To Welcome Baby No. 3/n
RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned that Gisele Bündchen and Tom Brady are trying for a baby in the wake of the Super Bowl great’s mother suffering a grave illness.
“Galynn’s been battling with a mystery illness for over a year now and it’s not looking good,” an insider told Radar.
According to the insider, the word is it’s a cancer-related issue so Galynn has her ups and downs, but the one thing she takes great pleasure in are her grandkids.

Brady and Bündchen, 36, “do want more kids but had put number three on the backburner,” noted the source of the parents to daughter Vivian, 4, and son Benjamin, 7.
“Now they’ve rearranged everything so they can produce another grandkid for Galynn before the end of the year.”
Brady, 39, recently opened up about his mom’s struggles, saying his mom hadn’t “been to a game this season,” which is “very atypical.”

“They’ve been so supportive my entire life, it’s nice to be able to show them . . . to try to make them proud,” he said.
