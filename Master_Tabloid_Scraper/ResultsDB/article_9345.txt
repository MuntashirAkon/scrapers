Here Comes The Groom! Anderson Cooper Plans Lavish Wedding With Boyfriend/n
It’s wedding bells for Anderson Cooper — because his mother’s sick of the openly gay bachelor just shacking up! The 49-year-old CNN anchor’s planning a spring wedding to club owner Benjamin Maisani, 43 — and Gloria Vanderbilt is thrilled.
“Anderson’s turning 50 next summer, so he finally figured it was time to take the plunge,” a pal dished to RadarOnline.com. “It took a nudge from Gloria to make it happen!”
Meddling mom Vanderbilt, 92, wheedled her silver fox son to the altar.
“Gloria knows she isn’t going to live forever; she dreamed of having one more big, happy occasion in their family’s lives before all is said and done,” explained the friend. “Anderson held up against her pressure — until now.”

Cooper and Maisani have been together since 2009, and “Anderson debated whether marriage was something he wanted for himself,” shared one snitch. “Still, with all the ups and downs, Ben’s stayed by his side.”
With Vanderbilt springing for the bash, Cooper is ready to cave!
“Anderson wanted to pay for a lavish wedding, but Gloria wouldn’t hear of it!” said a source. “It’s going to be a big day in both of their lives.”
