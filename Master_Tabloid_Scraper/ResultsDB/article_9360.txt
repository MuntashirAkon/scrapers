Bradley Cooper & Irina Shayk Have Fun In The Sun With Anderson Cooper, Allison Williams, & Andy Cohen! See The Star-Studded Vacay!/n

Don't even try to keep up with the Coopers!
Of course, we're talking about Bradley Cooper and Anderson Cooper â€” no relation â€” who joined forces last week with their partners for one epic vacation in Tahiti.
B.Coop and his baby mama Irina Shayk were photographed drifting on the French Polynesian waters with A.Coop, his partner Benjamin Maisani, Allison Williams, and her husband Ricky Van Veen.

Not pictured but also in on the island vacay was Andy Cohen and designer Diane von Furstenberg!
Though the Watch What Happens Live! host didn't make the star-studded snap, he shared more pics on Instagram â€” including a fun boat interview with Anderson asking if the CNN anchor could ever get Cohen-sick:

This all-star trip might seem a bit random, but the connections run deep here. Cohen and DVF are longtime friends, while the designer is also friends with Anderson's mother Gloria Vanderbilt.
Von Furstenberg has also worked with Shayk for years, as the Russian model has walked in many of her fashion shows.
Now, that's how you gets some R&R!
