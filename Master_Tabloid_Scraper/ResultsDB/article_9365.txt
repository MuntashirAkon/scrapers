Blac Chyna is living it up!

Despite her recent fallout with ex-fiancé Rob Kardashian, the mom-of-two was back at work at the strip club, hosting a party at West Hollywood’s Ace of Diamonds. In fact, Chyna even indulged in a few lap dancers from eager performers at the hotspot.
Via TMZ:
Blac Chyna scored $10k for the job and wasn’t stingy with it. She spread some of the cash — looks like Washingtons, not Benjamins — while taking in a few lap dances. Mally Mall was also there admiring the views.
Outside the club … it was total chaos when Chyna arrived, and cops even had to help with crowd control. We captured the scene in 360. Enjoy!
