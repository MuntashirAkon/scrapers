Which celebs will be lighting the Menorah this Hanukkah?
We already know Jewish celebrities like Drake and Andy Samberg will be heading home to celebrate Hanukkah with their families this year. For the eight nights of Hanukkah celebrations, we can only wonder what stars like Jake Gyllenhaal, Natalie Portman, and Ben Stiller will be giving and receiving. We can only hope that the positive spirit of the holidays gives Gyllenhaal enough luck to win an Oscar this year so we can get the best gift of all: a shirtless Jake Gyllenhaal.

Portman is expecting her second child with husband Benjamin Millepied, this means next year’s Hanukkah celebrations will have one more little member involved! She was “glowing and showing” on The Tonight Show when she admitted every Jew’s “secret wish.”  Fellow mother and Israeli model, Bar Refaeli, will be able to celebrate her first Hanukkah with four-month old baby girl, Liv, this year as well!
