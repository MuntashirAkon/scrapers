Natalie Portman’s Hannukah is going to get a bit of Christmas cheer this year and she can’t wait.

The Jackie star stopped by The Tonight Show where she revealed that for the first time in her life, her parents are planning to buy a Christmas tree. “I celebrate Hanukkah, I’m Jewish, but my husband’s [Benjamin Millepied] family celebrates Christmas,” Portman explained to host Jimmy Fallon. “So we usually do Hanukkah at ours and Christmas at theirs. But this year it’s the same time, which is really nice!”
Because Hannukah begins on Christmas Eve this year, they families have decided to combine celebrations, and Portman’s family was more than happy to finally have an excuse to purchase a Christmas tree. “My whole life, no Christmas tree, and then all of the sudden they have this great excuse. It’s like every Jew’s secret wish to have a Christmas tree,” Portman joked.

Portman also opened up about expecting her second child and revealed that despite how pregnant she looks, she’s not set to give birth anytime soon. “You know, I’m a small person in general, so you show a lot faster and a lot more when you’re small,” Portman explained. “Everyone thinks I’m about to pop and about to give birth any minute and I have like months to go.”
