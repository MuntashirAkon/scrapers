And another baby makes a family of four!Natalie Portman is pregnant, multiple sources confirm to E! News. This will be the second child for Portman, who already shares son Aleph Portman-Millepied with husband Benjamin Millepied.The Oscar winner, who has since relocated to Paris with her family, previously opened up to Harper's Bazaar about her big move and how life with her son and Millepied has ultimately changed her. Luckily, she had an A-list friend she could turn to when she needed advice."Very early on, I asked [Cate Blanchett] about being a parent," she told the publication. "I said, 'How do you do it? You're a mom. You're the best at what you do.' She said, 'You just do. Stressing about it doesn't help.'"According to the Closer actress, Millepied likely felt the same way. "Most men I know are dealing with the same issues. They say they feel like if they work too hard they won't have enough time with their families," she mused. "Maybe those questions need to be asked of men, too. Maybe the men need better questions."

With five years of parenting under their belt, this couple probably has gotten into a routine, which will undoubtedly help them when their second child arrives! Millepied and Portman met on the set of Black Swan and married in 2012 in a super hush-hush Jewish ceremony in California."The beauty of the weekend was that it was kept a secret, and everyone was relaxed and had a great time because of it," a source told E! News, adding that it was "amazing."When Portman accepted her Oscar in 2011—then pregnant with Aleph—she thanked Millepied for giving her "the most important role of [her] life."Congratulations to the happy couple!
