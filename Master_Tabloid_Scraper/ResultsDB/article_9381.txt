Ben McKenzie and Morena Baccarin have made their first appearance together since becoming parents to their sweet baby girl two months ago!The pair was all all smiles as they attended the Upfront presentation in New York City on Monday, which marked their first public outing since welcoming little Frances Laiz in early March.Baccarin looked stunning in a sleeveless, cobalt blue Shoshanna dress with wavy, dark hair and shimmery makeup, while McKenzie matched his partner in a deep blue suit, rocking some extra scruff for the event.The Gotham couple originally confirmed their pregnancy to E! News in September, and in February, Baccarin was alreadyprepared to give birth. Frances—full name Frances Laiz Setta Schenkkan—made her debut into the world on March 2.

"All are happy and healthy and appreciate the well-wishes," Baccarin's rep told E! News at the time, reiterating that the couple is "so happy."This is the second child for the actress—who already has a 2-year-old son with her ex-husband, Austin Chick—and the first for McKenzie.
