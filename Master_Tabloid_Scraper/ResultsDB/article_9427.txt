Mayer bought the four-floor Tudor style in the Pacific Heights section of the city this past April, Realestalker reports.
It was originally built in 1922, and designed by famed architect Frederick H. Meyer, featuring real estate trademarks of the time such as hand-crafted mill work and hardwood floors.
It sits on a well-to-do street referred to as Billionaire’s Row with tech industry scions such as Gordon Getty, Peter Sperling, Roger Barnett, Larry Ellison, and Mark Pincus residing in the neighborhood. /n
