Donald Trump's Golf Course Commemorates A Civil War Battle That Never Happened/n

And the hits keep coming.
As you know, our President Donald Trump (vom) proved he's far from a history buff after his recent comments on Andrew Jackson and the maybe-alive Frederick Douglass — and now it turns out his golf course in Virginia even commemorates a Civil War battle that NEVER happened!
We truly can't make this stuff up.

According to the New York Times from an article originally published back in 2015, Drumpf has a plaque positioned by the Potomac River at the Northern Virginia Trump National Golf Club that reads: 

"Many great American soldiers, both of the North and South, died at this spot. The casualties were so great that the water would turn red and thus became known as ‘The River of Blood.' It is my great honor to have preserved this important section of the Potomac River!"
The outlet did some digging and talked to local historians, who claim no such battle happened.
Richard Gillespie, the executive director of the Mosby Heritage Area Association, said:

"No. Uh-uh. No way. Nothing like that ever happened there."
When pressed about the issue, the controversial businessman responded:

"Write your story the way you want to write it. You don't have to talk to anybody. It doesn't make any difference. But many people were shot. It makes sense."
WHAT?! YOU CAN'T JUST MAKE UP HISTORY!
This behavior is so infuriating!/n
