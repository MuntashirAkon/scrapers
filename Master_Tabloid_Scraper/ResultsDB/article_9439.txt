Ben Carson Refers To Slaves As Hard-Working 'Immigrants' — See Samuel L. Jackson & The Rest Of The Internet's Appropriate Reactions!/n

Stay woke, Ben Carson.
No, really, stop sleepwalking through your lectures and actually listen to the words coming out of your mouth!
On Monday, the new Secretary of Housing and Urban Development gave a speech to his departmental employees and went on a bizarre tangent about the days where immigrants had a "can-do" attitude.
What hard working immigrants is he speaking of exactly? Slaves, duh!

The retired neurosurgeon mumbled his way through the speech, referring to slaves as immigrants who had a MUCH better work ethic than the immigrants of today! He gargled:

"That's what America is about. A land of dreams and opportunity. There were other immigrants who came here in the bottom of slave ships, worked even longer, even harder for less."
Yeah, the slaves were pretty damn motivated. We would be too if taking a break meant getting 40 lashes on the back. (Something Steve Bannon has probably already tried to add to the revised travel ban.)
Donald Trump's sleepy puppet went on to say that the slaves had dreams that their children and grandchildren could have the opportunity to "pursue prosperity."
Needless to say, Twitter reacted pretty strongly — with Samuel L. Jackson, the NAACP, and plenty more condemning Carson's idiotic remarks.
Ch-ch-check out the clip to hear the ridiculous words for yourself — and see some sharp responses (below)!

Dangerous and irresponsible to grossly embellish the violent centuries of enslavement of African people in America. https://t.co/KOe0fS7rWT

Ben Carson referring to slaves as immigrants is very wrong. But, also unsurprising, given he believes pyramids were used for grain storage.

Ben Carson saying slaves are immigrants is like saying chickens are employees at KFC.
