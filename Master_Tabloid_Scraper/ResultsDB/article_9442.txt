As if President Donald Trump’s Frederick Douglass gaffe during Black History Month wasn’t enough to make you cringe, his latest misstep will definitely leave you dying of secondhand embarrassment.

In celebration of St. Patrick’s Day, the commander-in-chief met with Ireland’s Prime Minister Enda Kenny on the eve of the holiday (March 16, 2017) and shared what he claimed was an Irish proverb to a room. However, as it turned out, what he read wasn’t Irish or even a proverb.

“As we stand together with our Irish friends, I’m reminded of that proverb. This is a good one. This is one I like. I’ve heard it for many many years, and I love it,” Trump told a room full of reporters. “‘Always remember to forget the friends that proved untrue. But never forget to remember those that have stuck by you.'”
Many people were quick to point out that it was not a proverb recognized by the Irish people, but rather a poem from Nigerian poet Albashir Adam Alhassan.

Trump’s Irish poet, Albashir Adam Alhassan, is Nigerian. Also, a proverb is not a poem. #ArtFunding #IrishProverb #IrishLiterature

@BraddJaffy That’s not an Irish proverb. At all.

A White House spokesperson since defended Trump, citing to The Hill that the proverb was “originally supplied in an email on March 8 by the State Department via [the National Security Council] as building blocks in advance of this event. These building blocks were supplied in the context of the Shamrock Ceremony and were ultimately used in the prepared remarks for the luncheon.”
