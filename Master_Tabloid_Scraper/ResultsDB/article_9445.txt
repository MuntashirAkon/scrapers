Rumors are swirling that Lindsay Lohan may have just gone through her biggest breakup yet after her longtime PR manager, Hunter Frederick, dropped the Mean Girls actress as a client because she allegedly became too difficult to handle.

According to Page Six, the two parted ways last week after a screaming match. A source told the publication, “You never know what Lindsay you’re going to get. One second she’s in a great mood and wanting to get things back together, and the next you can’t say anything to make her happy.”
“She’s going to have a really hard time finding a new publicist not only because she’s radioactive and no one wants to represent her, but the monthly retainer alone would render her bankrupt,” the insider continued.

The source also noted that Lohan $1 million worth of business offers last year because she “just doesn’t want to take them for whatever reason,” adding that the 30-year-old can still make at least $15,000 per promotional post on Instagram.
Lohan reportedly worked with Frederick for the last two years, during which the she got engaged to — then subsequently split from — Russian billionaire Egor Tarabasov, accused her ex-fiancé of domestic violence, visited Syrian refugees, opened a nightclub in Greece, and developed a strange European accent.
