John Legend will portray Frederick Douglass, the influential 19th-century abolitionist, in Season 2 of WGN America’s pre-Civil War drama, Underground.
Born into slavery, Douglass fought his circumstances and daringly escaped bondage in Maryland to become one of the most revolutionary leaders in the fight to free slaves. A prominent writer, celebrated speaker and progressive political reformist, Douglass was also a close adviser to President Abraham Lincoln and a symbol of remarkable hope and resilience.
The new, 10-episode season, which is also executive produced by Legend, follows an unremitting struggle for freedom within a divided America on the brink of civil war, each side vying to enact their own justice. Underground stars Jurnee Smollett-Bell and Aldis Hodge.
