It’s fair to say that Megan Fox’s year just got better.

The actress will be the newest brand ambassador, creative partner, and stakeholder of notable lingerie brand Fredrick’s of Hollywood’s.
“I’ve been reluctant in the past to work with brands because there’s a lot of politics behind it, and it’s a big deal to lend your name and image to something,” Fox shared with WWD. “But by offering me ownership in the company and some creative say, it gives me an opportunity to be passionate about what I’m promoting.”
In April of this year, Authentic Brands Group bought the lingerie brand for $22.5 million when the company filed for bankruptcy. But, can Fox help to revive it? We think so!

Fox is no stranger to working on brand campaigns. The New Girl star’s presence in Giorgio Armani Beauty, Avon, and Sharper Image among other campaigns qualify her for the job. Also, the actress is quite fashionable, which will definitely come in handy on the creative side of her latest gig.
In addition to being a brand ambassador, Fox will also create a Spring 2017 collection for Fredrick’s that will be available to the public late next year. Basically, she’s a bonafide businesswoman, and we are all for it.
