Theodore is the fashion designer and entrepreneur’s third child after Arabella Rose and Joseph Frederick, who helped announce her pregnancy in a Facebook video back in September. The family was allegedly spotted together enjoying an Easter brunch only hours prior to the birth announcement.
Trump also shared a glowing post-push photo on her Twitter account, where she cradles the family’s new addition.
