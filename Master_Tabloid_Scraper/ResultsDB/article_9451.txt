Joe Jonas Uses Adam Levine’s Finger as a Penis/n
Joe Jonas is getting naughty with Adam Levine…

The 25-year-old couldn’t help himself when he came across a ProActiv ad featuring the Maroon 5 frontman on which it just so happened Levine’s finger was placed in the perfect spot…






 Fun time last night at The Voice thanks Adam.

LOL! But can you really blame him?
Jonas captioned the silly pic, “Fun time last night at The Voice thanks Adam.”
Unfortunately for Levine, the pic wasn’t the worst thing to happen to him during The Voice finale. His finalist Joshua Davis ended up finishing in third place while Pharrell Williams’ Sawyer Fredericks went on to win the season’s title.
Meanwhile Jonas has been making headlines this week for more than just his dirty mind. The former boybander was spotted hanging out with Gigi Hadid following her split from Cody Simpson, and though several sources claim they’re just friends, we can’t help but speculate.
