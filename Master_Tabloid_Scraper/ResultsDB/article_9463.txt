Kathy Griffin is sporting a brand new look in honor of a family member. Photos of the 56-year-old comic with a freshly shaved head began circulating online this week, and it appears Kathy went bald for a beautiful reason. Her sister is reportedly undergoing treatment for cancer, prompting Griffin to ditch her signature red curls in solidarity. Griffin's mother Maggie Griffin confirmed the news on Twitter. "My daughter Kathleen Mary is a wonderful human being," she wrote alongside images of Kathy smiling sans hair. In 2014, the celebrity mourned the loss of her brother Gary who passed away from esophageal cancer. She has yet to comment on her sister's illness publicly. 

Griffin isn't the only member of Hollywood to go the extra mile when it comes to supporting a loved one or charity. In fact, some of your favorite celebrities from film, television and the music charts have either gone without hair completely or donated locks to organizations supporting those in need. Check out 10 of those especially admirable efforts below.
