Even if you're world famous, there's nothing better than love—and that's just what these two have.Justin Theroux took to Instagram today to ever so subtly pay homage to his superstar wife of two years, Jennifer Aniston, on the couple's second anniversary. The intimate image shows the 45-year-old at a profile while his 48-year-old lady love kisses him on the cheek. It's tender without being overly sappy. It's the image of a husband and wife showing each other affection.The photo had a simple caption (because a picture is worth a thousand words), which consisted of a heart emoji and a peace sign emoji, likely a reference to their two years together. 

Jennifer and Justin wed in the backyard of their Los Angeles home on Aug. 5, 2015 in front of family and friends, including celebs such as her Friends pals Courteney Cox and Lisa Kudrow, Howard Stern, Jason Bateman, Ellen DeGeneres, Tobey McGuire, Sandra Bullock, Orlando Bloom, Rachel McAdams, couple John Krasinski and Emily Bluntand Jimmy Kimmel, who officiated the ceremony.Most of the guests were totally surprised that the two wed, as the whole thing was a surprise to guests. They thought they would be attending a birthday party for Theroux, whose birthday is on Aug. 10. Stern said on his SiriusXM radio show The Howard Stern Show that he was one of the few guests who knew the secret because he he was asked to do a wedding toast."I was so nervous," he said. "They're so secretive, those two."That's not all they are; the couple is so adorable. Check out some of their cutest photos over the years.
