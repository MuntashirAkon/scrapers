Decorating Duo Says Dr. Phil a Fraud/nAn interior design team who claim Dr. Phil McGraw and his wife Robin breached an oral contract has now upped the ante in their lawsuit.Deborah Flattery and Brynja McGrady -- who sued the McGraws in March -- now allege fraud, false advertising and intentional infliction of emotional distress.The designers, who developed a line of skin care products, claim Robin promised to promote the products on her husband's show -- but never did. They also claim they were never fully paid for their services.In response, the McGraws counter-sued for fraud -- claiming Flattery and McGrady over-charged them for a re-do of the couple's master suite.McGraw attorney Frederick Friedman told us,  "The McGraws are simply seeking to recover what the decorators actually admit to having received by fraud.
