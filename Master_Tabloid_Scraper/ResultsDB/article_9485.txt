Morgan Freeman Criticizes Black History Month/nBy THE ASSOCIATED PRESS NEW YORK -- Morgan Freeman says the concept of a month dedicated to black history is  "ridiculous. "   "You're going to relegate my history to a month? " the 68-year-old actor says in an interview on CBS'  "60 Minutes " to air Sunday (7 p.m. EST).  "I don't want a black history month. Black history is American history. "  Black History Month has roots in historian Carter G. Woodson's Negro History Week, which he designated in 1926 as the second week in February to mark the birthdays of Frederick Douglass and Abraham Lincoln.  Woodson said he hoped the week could one day be eliminated -- when black history would become fundamental to American history.  Freeman notes there is no  "white history month, " and says the only way to get rid of racism is to  "stop talking about it. "  The actor says he believes the labels  "black " and  "white " are an obstacle to beating racism.   "I am going to stop calling you a white man and I'm going to ask you to stop calling me a black man, " Freeman says.  Freeman received Oscar nominations for his roles in 1987's 'Street Smart,' 1989's 'Driving Miss Daisy' and 1994's 'The Shawshank Redemption.' He finally won earlier this year for 'Million Dollar Baby.'/n
