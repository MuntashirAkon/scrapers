LeBron James' Lawyer: Mom Not Scoring with Teammate Delonte West/nLeBron James' attorney has fired off a cease and desist email -- finally denying the fast-spreading, and disturbing rumor of a sex scandal involving LeBron's mom and his teammate Delonte West.TMZ obtained a copy of the email sent to terezowens.com -- the sports blog that first reported on Friday that LeBron's mother Gloria was allegedly sleeping with Delonte.  In the email, Frederick Nance -- attorney for LeBron and Gloria -- says the report is  "categorically false and per se defamatory. "   Nance adds,  "No thinking person could possibly believe such rubbish. "The report -- which also spread as a viral email -- was supposed to explain the Cleveland Cavaliers' playoff loss to the Boston Celtics with this theory: LeBron finds out about Delonte and his mom before game 4 ... Cavs go on to lose games 4, 5, and 6 (and possibly LeBron). The guys at terezowens tell us,  "We think it's a little fishy that they waited almost 4 days to fire this off. "  They say they stand by their source, and they're consulting with their lawyers.  The story is still up on their site ... for now.UPDATE: We also spoke to Keith Estabrook -- a spokesman for the James family -- who told us,  "I will not dignify this with a comment.
