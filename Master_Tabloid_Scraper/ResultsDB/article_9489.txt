Demi Moore is penning a tell-all book, RadarOnline.com can exclusively reveal.
According to an insider, the Ghost star will concentrate on her rise up through the ranks in Hollywood and how proud she is of her three daughters with 62-year-old Bruce Willis.

But a source claimed that the famous actress is not interested in dishing the dirt.

The source adds: “She’s got no desire to bash Ashton – or Mila – so suggestions that’s her M.O. are wide off the mark.
“Anyone who knows Demi will tell you she’s been open to a friendship with Ashton but it’s Mila who won’t allow it. She’s in a really good place right now, and looking forward to getting her story out there in a positive way.”
