 I will be the first one to say I'm not perfect and I mess up sometimes and every once in a while I get it right but I wanted to share this because I am really proud of myself. Yesterday I celebrated 6 Months of Sobriety. It's not something I planned on but after the long journey of getting here I can honestly say I have never been more proud of myself in my entire life. Thank you all for the love and support and remember to be gentle with yourself 😊

The former wild child has a family history of addiction issues.
In 2007, her dad Bruce Willis, 62, admitted he dealt with addiction-related problems throughout his marriage to Moore. Moore herself has confessed to alcohol problems in the past.
Sister Tallulah Willis, 23, has also chosen the sober road after her 45-day stint in rehab in 2014.
