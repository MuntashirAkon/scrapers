Grin & Bear It: Demi Moore Nervous Breakdown Horror Exposed!/n
Strung-out Demi Moore lost two teeth over her divorce from Ashton Kutcher — and now friends fear she’s on the verge of another crack-up!
“Stress — one of the biggest killers in America — sheared off my front teeth! Thank God for modern dentistry!” Moore revealed in a shocking confession.
The Striptease star, 54, admitted she was clenching her teeth and was “a little too tense” when each of her two pearly whites “fell out” a year apart.

But pals said Moore suffered an emotional breakdown after 16-years-younger Kutcher was caught cheating and their six-year marriage collapsed.
“Demi hasn’t seemed happy since she split from Ashton in 2011. She’s like an emotional wreck, a ticking time bomb!” spilled a friend.
In early 2012, the Ghost star was rushed to the hospital for seizures after reportedly inhaling the party drug nitrous oxide. A week later, she checked into rehab.

After Kutcher married actress Mila Kunis, Moore reportedly blew half a million bucks on cosmetic surgery, and in May she was sued for wrongful death over the 2015 drowning of a man in her Beverly Hills pool.
That stress could mean more lost teeth for Moore.
“Stress and anxiety are the No. 1 reason people grind their teeth, and grinding weakens teeth,” said dentist Dr. Gary Glassman.
