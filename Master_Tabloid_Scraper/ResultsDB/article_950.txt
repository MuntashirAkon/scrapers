She added: “My love language is communication – I’m a big communicator and I’m affectionate.
“We show our love language in two very different ways, so the way we were trying to communicate with each other was often misconstrued because we don’t speak the same language.”
After the relationship ended Ronnie, 31, said he felt that they had ‘a connection’ but it obviously wasn’t enough to sustain their relationship.
