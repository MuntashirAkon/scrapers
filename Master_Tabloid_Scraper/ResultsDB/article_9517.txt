In honor of the CMA Awards, Jimmy Kimmel had some of country’s biggest stars read mean tweets about themselves.

The late night TV host released another installment of his “Mean Tweets” segment, featuring Miranda Lambert, Dolly Parton, Willie Nelson, Little Big Town, Florida Georgia Line, and more. Of course, they were all asked to read insulting tweets about themselves — and the result was hilarious.

“In case of a national emergency, all air traffic will be redirected to Miranda Lambert’s forehead,” the “House That Built Me” singer read. Another Twitter user told Florida Georgia Line that they “were engineered in a douche factory.”
However, the best mean tweet went to Nelson, who was told that he’s getting “pretty crusty.” His reaction was to stare blankly at the camera.
