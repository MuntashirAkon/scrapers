Miranda Lambert, Willie Nelson, Dolly Parton and Little Big Town Read Mean Tweets on Jimmy Kimmel Live!/n
Nelson didn't disagree with @JuicyGing, who told him, "You're getting pretty crusty, pal."Not everyone saw the humor in the tweets. Morris frowned after @RealJimIsSlim said she looks like Jennifer Lawrence's "less attractive little sister," and Lambert didn't crack a smile after reading @deleco31's tweet: "In case of national emergency, all air traffic will be redirected to Miranda Lambert's forehead."Pope flipped the bird at the person who tweeted her. And Kramer? She offered a fake a apology for "trying too hard with her Texas accent," while Owen sincerely apologized to the "miserable as f--k" person who thought his show was "super lame."
