Willie Nelson Tour Handcuffed/n
    Willie Nelson can't wait to get back on the road again.        The hirsute outlaw country legend has nixed a series of concerts over the next two months so he can undergo surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome, according to Las Vegas' KEYE TV.        The CBS affiliate quotes a promoter who said that the aching in Nelson's tendons and nerves had gotten so bad that the 71-year-old icon had trouble strumming his guitar and was forced to cut short Saturday's performance in Las Vegas.        As a result, Nelson is pulling out of 10 dates scheduled through May and June, including a show at the Beacon Theater in New York City and a slot at the three-day Bonnaroo Music Festival in Manchester, Tennessee, starting June 11.         If all goes well with his recovery, the Grammy-winning singer-songwriter and Farm Aid founder is expected to play his traditional Fourth of July Picnic at the Fort Worth Stockyards followed by the balance of his summer tour dates.        Nelson, who broke into the business writing tunes like "Crazy" for Patsy Cline and other Nashville artists, become a star in his own right with a jukebox worth of hits, including "On the Road Again," "Mammas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys," "Always On My Mind," "My Heroes Have Always Been Cowboys," "Help Me Make It Through the Night," "To All the Girls I've Loved Before" and covers of "Georgia on My Mind" and "Love Me Tender."        Last week, "Shotgun Willie" taped his third annual Willie Nelson & Friends benefit concert at the Wiltern Theater in Los Angeles.         Subtitled Outlaws and Angels, the three-hour show featured Nelson and a who-who's of musical luminaries--including Keith Richards, Al Green, Kid Rock, Jerry Lee Lewis, Joe Walsh, Lucinda Williams, Hank Williams III and Bob Dylan, who made a surprise appearance.        The concert is slated to air on USA Network May 30 at 9 p.m.
