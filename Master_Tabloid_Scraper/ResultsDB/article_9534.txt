Willie Nelson on the Road at 70/n
    Seventy years old or no, Willie Nelson still isn't the stay-at-home type.        The long-haired country crooner, who celebrated the musician's vagabond life in the hit "On the Road Again," will mark his landmark birthday Wednesday night--where else?--but on the road. Again.        Nelson is in the middle of a four-date gig at the Horseshoe Casino in Bossier City, Louisiana. He played Tuesday night. He's scheduled to play Thursday and Friday night. And he'll play on his birthday night.        "Willie is a legend that doesn't really know that, I think," says Tommie Ritter Smith, president of the Texas Country Music Hall of Fame and Tex Ritter Museum in Carthage, Texas. "...He just loves to pick and sing."        That he does. Nelson's been at the music business now for 44 years (if you count back to when he moved to Nashville, in 1959) or 49 years (if you count back to when he hit the airwaves as a radio deejay, in 1954).        "We've been doing it so long it's like a regular routine," Nelson recently told the Associated Press. "It's good for us just to keep hitting it every day."        And for Nelson, the hits do indeed keep coming. Last week, the guy who's been strumming a hole in the same Martin guitar (nicknamed Trigger) since 1969 was back in the Top 20 on Billboard's Hot Country Singles chart, on the strength of the duet, "Beer for My Horses," with Toby Keith.        Other recording artists--Frank Sinatra comes to mind--have scored success as septuagenarians, but even Sinatra, in his prime, might have found it difficult to keep up with Nelson.         In 2003 alone, Nelson plans to play 200 concert dates and host his 16th Farm Aid benefit concert (in the San Francisco area in the fall). Not bad, but not all. He's also won his sixth career Grammy; acted in a movie (The Big Bounce); taped his own all-star birthday special (to air Memorial Day on cable's USA Network); and, released two new albums.        All right, so the new albums aren't all that new--they're compilations. (Not even Nelson's that prolific.)        But the collections, in stores this month to coincide with their namesake's big 7-0, if not brimming with new tunes, are full of history.      Crazy: The Demo Sessions offers up the short-haired Willie, when he was a just another songwriter plugging away in Nashville, trying to sell songs.          Actually, Nelson was never really just another songwriter. "Crazy," the Patsy Cline classic? He wrote that. "Pretty Paper," the modern Christmas staple? He wrote that, too.         Nelson's reputation was such that he earned induction into the Nashville Songwriters Association Hall of Fame in 1973, two years before he scored his breakthrough as a solo artist, Red Headed Stranger.         The career Nelson has enjoyed since that 1975 release, as a singer, actor (The Electric Horseman, Wag the Dog) and all-around media star, is evident in the second new album, The Essential Willie Nelson.        The two-disc, 41-track collection does feature tracks that date back to his early, unsuccessful career as a solo artist in the 1960s. But the majority are the stuff that made him mainstream enough for Miami Vice (where he guested in 1986): "Always on My Mind," "To All the Girls I've Loved Before" (with Julio Iglesias), "Mammas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys" (with Waylon Jennings), the obligatory (and Oscar-nominated) "On the Road Again" (from the film, Honeysuckle Rose)--even a previously unreleased cut with Aerosmith, "One Time Too Many."         Born April 30, 1933 in Abbott, Texas, Nelson still lives in the Lone Star today. (He's also got a home in Hawaii--so his back-breaking tax troubles of the early 1990s are definitely behind him.)         On Tuesday, his last day as a 69-year-old, he was in Carthage, Texas, to help unveil a saddle at the museum there honoring singing cowboy Tex Ritter (yes, father of John).        The museum's Smith says her staff treated Nelson to an early birthday cake, but didn't trouble him for a song. The music would come later.         Nelson played the Horseshoe, about 50 miles away, on Tuesday night. Smith was there for the show. She says it was two hours of "one song after another, just good music."        Says Smith: "There's just no telling how many songs he knows."         Nelson sounds prepared to play them all, one by one, in city after city.          As he told the Associated Press: "There's a lot of people who'd like to be 70 and having as much fun as I'm having."
