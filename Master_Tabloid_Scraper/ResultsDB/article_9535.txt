Willie's Oscar Adventure/n
It's your typical Hollywood success story: One day you're diving in dumpsters trying to make a living, the next you're holding a $50,000 check and making Oscar plans.              Such is the life of Willie Fulgear, the 61-year-old trash recycler turned Academy Award hero.              Yesterday, Fulgear picked up a $50,000 reward for rescuing 52 stolen Oscars from a trash bin, and then he got an invitation to Sunday's Oscar ceremonies, courtesy of the folks at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.              "If anybody says honesty don't pay, send them to me. I'm a poor man, and I stumbled across gold.  And I gave it back," said Fulgear, who literally tripped over crates of the statuettes behind an L.A. grocery store.                Fulgear says he'll use part of the $50,000 reward to rent a tux for the Oscar ceremony and the rest for a down payment on a house for himself and his 22-year-old son, Allen.  He and Allen will traipse down the red carpet Sunday, rubbing shoulders with the A-listers. When asked who he most wanted to meet, Fulgear responded: "Billy Crystal...and Denzel. That's my man."               The Academy Awards ceremony is traditionally the most sought-after ticket in Hollywood.   In fact, Jeffrey Wigand--whose life was the basis for the Oscar-nominated The Insider--barely got invited himself (director Michael Mann stepped in at the last-minute with an invite).                The Academy's goodwill followed a ceremony in which shipping company Roadway Express gave Willie a $50,000 reward for finding the missing Oscars.  The company earlier said it wanted to wait before giving Fulgear the reward, but changed its mind when Los Angeles police cleared him of any involvement in the heist.  A former Roadway employee has been charged with allegedly lifting the little golden guys.              While the sudden celebrity, wealth and Oscar glory are nice, Willie has received the ultimate Hollywood endorsement--he's already been offered a book and movie deal.
