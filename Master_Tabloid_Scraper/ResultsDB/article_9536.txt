BoxCar Willie Derailed/n
The flags are at half-staff in country-music mecca Branson, Missouri, in honor of a favorite local, BoxCar Willie.      The performer died Monday, losing a three-year battle to leukemia. He was 67.      BoxCar Willie never had chart-topping records or albums, but he had a popular theater in Branson--and an enviable gimmick. Even if you didn't know his name, you knew the look (and sound). BoxCar was the guy who dressed like a bum and made "choo-choo" train sounds with his mouth. He billed himself as "The World's Favorite Hobo." It was a living.       Born Lecil Martin in Sterrett, Texas, in 1931, BoxCar performed as a teen at state jamborees. But he put down the guitar to join the Air Force, where he served for 22 years.      BoxCar renewed his performing career in the 1970s--adding the "BoxCar" tag after getting stuck in traffic one day in Lincoln, Nebraska.      "And there was an old boy sitting on a box car, dressed the way I dress today, and he looked like a buddy of mine named Willie Nelson," the Grand Ole Opry member told the Associated Press in 1997. "I said, 'There's Willie in a box car,' and that's where it came from."      BoxCar opened his Branson theater in 1986. He bragged he was the first name-brand country star to live and work there year-round.      Funeral services were tentatively planned for this weekend.
