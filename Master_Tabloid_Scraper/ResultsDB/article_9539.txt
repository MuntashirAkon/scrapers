Inspired By A Real Killer! Discover The Shocking Truth Behind 'Psycho' Blockbuster/n
Everybody remembers Norman Bates, the crazed cross-dressing killer from the Alfred Hitchcock thriller Psycho. But few know about the real-life killer that inspired the classic character â€” until now.
Ed Gein was a Wisconsin farm hand who robbed graves and fashioned costumes from the bodies of the women he dug up before turning to murdering his own victims.
But Geins proved to be even more twisted than his deranged fictional copycat, starting with first murder victim, Mary Hogan, whom he had stalked obsessively.
