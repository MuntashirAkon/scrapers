Heartless Hillary Laughed At Rape Case!/n
After an exhaustive 12-month investigation, RadarOnline.com has uncovered one of the most disturbing secrets from Hillary Clinton‘s past: According to an archived audiotape, the would-be president once blamed a 12-year-old rape victim while defending a child molester she knew was guilty — and laughed about it later!
Hillary, then a 27-year-old lawyer, was appointed to defend Thomas Alfred Taylor, then 41, who was arrested for a horrific 1975 assault in Springdale, Ark.
In court documents obtained by Radar, Hillary shockingly said that the child was “emotionally unstable with a tendency to seek out older men.”
