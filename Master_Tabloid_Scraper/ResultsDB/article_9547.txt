A Family's Dark Past: Prince's Troubled Sister Arrested For Assault, DWI/n
Tyka Nelson, who continues to battle her half-siblings for their late brother’s $300 million fortune, was arrested for assault and DWI after years of suffering from a debilitating crack addiction, RadarOnline.com can exclusively reveal.
According to Hennepin County, Minnesota court records obtained exclusively by Radar, the 55-year-old mother of six was arrested for assault in the 5th degree, DWI in the 3rd degree, and refusing to submit to a sobriety test on April 28, 2001.

Though she initially pled not guilty to all charges, Nelson took a plea deal that summer, admitting guilt in the DWI. The other two charges were ultimately dismissed.
She was sentenced to a chemical dependency evaluation, community service, probation and 30 days in prison.

Though Nelson claimed she sobered up in 2003 with help from Prince, who allegedly sent her to rehab, her problems continued. As Radar previously reported, she was nearly evicted from her modest Irving, Texas apartment in 2014. (The court eventually tossed out the case.)

Now, Nelson is fighting her half-brother Alfred Jackson, who recently hired a lawyer, and other siblings for a piece of Prince’s pie.
“There’s complete and utter chaos,” a family insider told Radar last week.
The music legend died on April 21 after collapsing at his Paisley Park estate in Chanhassen, Minnesota. He was just 57 years old. /n
