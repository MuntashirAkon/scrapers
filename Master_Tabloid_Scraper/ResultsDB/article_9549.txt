It's War! Prince's Brother Lawyers Up As Family Feud Over Millions Explodes/n
The family feud over Prince‘s $300 million estate is getting serious! Just days after his sister, Tyka Nelson, filed paperwork making her the administrator of the dead singer’s estate, one of his half-siblings has made the bold move of lawyering up to defend his slice of the pie.
Alfred Jackson, Prince’s half-brother, filed paperwork in Minnesota on April 27, alerting the court that he had hired Indianapolis attorney Frank K. Wheaton to represent him in the probate matter.

Tyka was appointed administrator by a judge earlier this week, but so far it is not going well.
As Radar reported, an insider told Radar, “There’s complete and utter chaos because Tyka isn’t well versed in managing anything like this. But the other half siblings are even less equipped to deal with it!”
The singer had five other half-siblings: Alfred, Corrine, John, Sharon, and Omar.

According to reports, a family meeting exploded Thursday when Tyka reportedly banned Alfred from Prince’s memorial service.
Alfred’s attorney, Frank Wheaton, did not immediately respond to Radar’s request for comment.
As Radar reported, Prince died on April 21 at 57 in his Paisley Park home. /n
