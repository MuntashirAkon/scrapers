Daring Daytime Jewel Thief Nabs $53 Million In Diamonds In Cannes/n
Police in France are trying to catch a thief after an armed robber got away with a stunning $53 million in diamonds from a Cannes hotel.
The bling was part of an exhibit put on by Leviev  at the legendary Cannes Carlton hotel.
Ironically — or perhaps, not — the hotel was one of the prime locations for the iconic 1955 Alfred Hitchcock film, To Catch a Thief.

The exhibition of some of Leviev’s largest and most dramatic diamonds was in the Carlton’s lobby.
“A full and urgent operation is under way to catch the culprit and recover these jewels. Thieves see Cannes as rich pickings,” a police spokesman said.
In May, while the Cannes Film Festival was in full swing, $1 million in Chopard jewels that were meant to be leant out to celebs for red carpet appearances, were stolen from an employee’s hotel room. And a $2.5 million necklace disappeared from a celebrity-packed party.
