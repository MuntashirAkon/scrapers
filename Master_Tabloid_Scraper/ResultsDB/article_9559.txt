Brides Everywhere Are Stressed The FUCK Out After Popular Wedding Dress Chain Abruptly Shuts Down!/n

As if planning a wedding wasn't stressful enough, some brides across the country are facing a horrible new reality: not having a dress for their big day!
It's been revealed on Friday that major bridal store Alfred Angelo has without warning shut down several locations AND officially filed for bankruptcy liquidation!
WTF!

Not to mention, brides (and bridesmaids) are being left in the dust wondering about the dresses they've already paid for!
David's Bridal is coming in offering 30% off dresses to anyone with an Alfred Angelo receipt, as it doesn't sound like any of the Alfred customers will be seeing their orders.
So sad! That's fucking ridiculous!!
It's no wonder there's such a wide-spread panic happening on Twitter as no one seemingly has any answers! See some of the reactions (below)!

Was standing in my future wedding dress, tears in my eyes, saying yes, when I was told #AlfredAngelo has shut down & I can't order the dress

I'd like to thank the fine folks @AlfredAngelo for taking $1500 for my daughter's wedding dress KNOWING they were filing bankruptcy.

@AlfredAngelo has stolen my $$$ and my dress which I Rush ordered 4 months in advance. How can you take RUSH orders and not honor them!

We hope they all take legal action! So messed up.
Thankfully, so many beautiful people have already started reaching out about lending their own dresses:

Damn! Anyone affected by the #alfredangelo closing, you can have my dress! It's white, strapless, and will fit size 0-2!!!

Brides lending other brides their wedding dresses because of the #AlfredAngelo catastrophe has restored my faith in humanity.

If there is any way you can lend your dress to a bride, we think you'd really make someone's day!
