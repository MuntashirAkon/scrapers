Jaw-Dropping! Vanessa Hudgens Brought It On The MTV VMAs Red Carpet!/n

Vanessa Hudgens is a red carpet maven.
The High School Musical alum proved this fact to be true as she graced the MTV VMAs red carpet with her presence. The 28-year-old looked absolutely stunning as she donned a beautiful red Yanina Couture gown for the awards show.
The dress was certainly a bold choice as the number featured both a sheer layer AND ruffles. What a HAWT look. In fact, red might be our favorite color on Vanessa now!!
Of course, Miz Hudgens tied her entire ensemble together with some red sparkly eye makeup and fierce Sophia Webster heels. Well done.
Way to nail it, doll!
