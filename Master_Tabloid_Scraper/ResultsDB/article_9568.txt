In case you’re keeping track, this is Murphy’s fourth show in production besides American Horror Story, Scream Queens, American Crime Story, and his forthcoming TV movie One Hit Wonders.
The eight-episode project centers on the off-screen rivalry surrounding the 1962 film What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?
Along with Jones, Susan Sarandon will play Bette Davis, Jessica Lange will play Joan Crawford, Alfred Molina will portray the film’s director Robert Aldrich and Stanley Tucci acts as Jack Warner, the famous film exec.
Basically, all of Hollywood dropped by for this one.
