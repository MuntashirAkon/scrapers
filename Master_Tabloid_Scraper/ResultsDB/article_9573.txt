Thanks for the talent tip, Amy Schumer.

LeBron James will reportedly continue his career as a revered screen actor in the sequel to the 1996 film, Space Jam. The Hollywood Reporter says that director Justin Lin, Andrew Dodge, and Alfredo Botello are writing the script after rumors of a Space Jam 2 circulated last summer after James and his SpringHill Entertainment company signed a deal with Warner Bros to produce projects in TV, film, and digital content.
The Cavaliers player made his big screen debut in Schumer’s Trainwreck last year as a cynical Sunglass Hut customer.
