Alfred Hitchcock would be amazed!Sienna Miller portrays Tippi Hedren in BBC/HBO's The Girl, a flick retelling the making of Hitchcock's 1963 classic The Birds.Miller lightens her blond locks for the film and wears her hair in an old-fashioned updo much like Hedren's. Hedren was personally cast by Hitchcock in The Birds, and The Girl looks at the famed director's unwanted obsession with the young actress.

Per the Daily Mail, Hedren has said, "I admired Hitch tremendously for his great talent and still do…Yet, at the same time, I loathed him for his off-set behavior and the way he came on to me sexually. He was a great director – and he destroyed it all by his behavior when he got me alone."Hedren, now 80, is the mother of Melanie Griffith. Her onscreen twin, Miller, welcomed daughter Marlowe with partner Tom Sturridge in July.Looks like some good casting to us!
