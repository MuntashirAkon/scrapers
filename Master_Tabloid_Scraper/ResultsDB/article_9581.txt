Stamping Out Alfred Hitchcock/n
Where suspense filmmaking was concerned, it was hard to lick Alfred Hitchcock. Until now.           Due next year at your local, friendly U.S. post office, Alfred Hitchcock--the postage stamp.          For 32 cents (barring one of those seemingly perennial rate hikes), you can own your very own, very small, portrait of the acclaimed director of Psycho, Rebecca, The Birds and 50-plus other films.          Famed Psycho shower-taker Janet Leigh helped unveil the commemorative stamp--a black-and-white photo, with the imposing filmmaker's famed profile caricature perched above his right shoulder--at a Los Angeles ceremony this week.          The Hitchcock stamp will be the latest entry in the Postal Service's "Legends of Hollywood" series. Washington, D.C. may love to bash La-La Land for smoking and perceived moral squishiness, but it loves to put its leading citizens on glue-backed pieces of paper. The Marilyn Monroe--the first go-round for the "Legends of Hollywood" brand in 1995--was the biggest-selling stamp of its year. Ditto for the James Dean in 1996. (Too soon to tell how the Humphrey Bogart, the 1997 stamp, is faring.)          Unlike Monroe, Dean or Bogart, the Postal Service's citizen advisory committee had to bend the rules to get Hitchcock into the club. The two main prerequisites for stamp-hood call for the potential honoree to be: (1) dead, for at least 10 years (Hitch's cool on that one--he passed on in 1980 at the age of 80); and, (2) an American citizen.     Hitch is not so cool on that last count. The director was born in London in 1899. Was even knighted by the Queen of England. This would, uh, pretty much make him not an American citizen.          Postal Service spokesman Barry Ziehl says the committee decided to exempt Hitchcock from the "Born in the USA" rule, based on his contribution to American film.          As such, the man known for his "Good Eve-uh-ning" drawl joins the lofty likes of St. Francis of Assissi, Martin Luther and Copernicus as foreign-born stamp honorees.          Hitch has even more in common with those guys than you'd think. None of them ever won a competitive Oscar, either.
