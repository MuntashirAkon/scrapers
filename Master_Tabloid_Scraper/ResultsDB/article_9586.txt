Scarlett Johansson is totally going Psycho.The 27-year-old Avengers star channels classic Hollywood glamour (by way of horror-film creepiness) for her role as Janet Leigh in a new biopic of the British director Alfred Hitchcock that will focus on the making of his stab at motel-based suspense, Psycho.Along with Anthony Hopkins as Hitchcock, Jessica Biel as actress Vera Miles and Helen Mirren as the director's wife Alma, the film reportedly examines the auteur's relationship with his spouse during the filming of the 1960 classic. By that account, Hitchcock sounds a bit different from The Girl, HBO's movie about the filmmaker's relationship (or frustrating lack of one) with the actress Tippi Hedren (played by Sienna Miller).
