Robert Griffin III -- REDSKINS MOVIE NIGHT ... With Matt McConaughey/nMatthew McConaughey hosted a movie night with the Washington Redskins last night ... where 6 players screened their favorite movies -- AND NO ONE PICKED A McCONAUGHEY FLICK!!!The event was a fundraiser at the Alamo Drafthouse Cinema in Ashburn, VA yesterday -- 6 players in 6 theaters treated fans to one of their favorite movies. For the record, the event raised money for the NFL's  "Play 60 " program and Matt's  "Just Keep Livin " foundation ... tickets were $200-a-pop. As for the movie screenings ... here's how it broke down: 1) RG3 --  "John Q " with Denzel Washington ... The QB says the drama is his fave flick of all time. 2) Alfred Morris --  "Fantastic Mr. Fox " with George Clooney ... Morris told the crows,  "I stumbled upon 'Fantastic Mr. Fox' and I thoroughly enjoyed it. "3) Chris Baker --  "Superbad " with Jonah Hill ... It's hilarious. Good choice. 4) Nick Sundberg --  "The Lion King " ... Nick told the crowd his fave movie is actually  "Little Mermaid, " but his GF convinced him to screen  "Lion King " instead because she thought it would be better on the big screen. 5) Darrel Young --  "Remember the Titans " ... Another Denzel Washington classic. Score two for DW, zero for McConaughey. 6) Ryan Kerrigan --  "The Internship " ... Kerrigan told the crowd he LOVES McConaughey movies, but for some unexplained reason, went with the Vince Vaughn comedy instead. Bad move. Not Shown:  "Dazed & Confused, "  "A Time to Kill, "  "Contact, "  "EDtv, "  "The Wedding Planner, "  "Two for the Money, "  "We Are Marshall, "  "Failure to Launch, "  "Surfer, Dude, "  "Magic Mike " ... you get the point. Sad. [H /T Washington Post]/n
