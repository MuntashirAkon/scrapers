Spielberg Accused of Back-Dooring Hitchcock/nThat whole  "imitation is the sincerest form of flattery " isn't sitting well with the inspiration behind the classic film  "Rear Window. "Seems the people who own the short story that ultimately became  "Rear Window " are deeply disturbed over  "Disturbia " ... so disturbed they've filed suit in NYC, claiming the Shia LaBeouf flick is a blatant ripoff.When Alfred Hitchcock and James Stewart did  "Rear Window " in 1954, they first commissioned the short story,  "Murder from a Fixed Viewpoint. " The people who own that story say  "Disturbia " is a carbon copy of  "Window " and therefore Steven Spielberg and Dreamworks should have also obtained permission from the owners of  "Murder from a Fixed Viewpoint. "The lawsuit claims  "Disturbia " and  "Rear Window " stories are  "essentially the same " -- a Peeping Tom watches creepy neighbor type flick -- and attacks Spielberg's  "back-door use of the 'Rear Window' story without paying compensation. "Calls to Spielberg's rep were not returned.  See Also      Tom Cruise Shows Spielberg His Cockpit/n
