Donald Trump Sought To Build A Trump Tower In Moscow WHILE He Was Running For POTUS!/n

This doesn't surprise us at all, unfortunately.
While Donald Trump was campaigning to become POTUS in late 2015 and early 2016, he was also campaigning to build a massive Trump Tower in Moscow. This, of course, all comes to light despite the President saying he had "no business dealings" with Russia last summer.
The Washington Post reports Russian-born real estate developer/convicted felon who has longtime ties to the Trump Organization, Felix Sater, reportedly said in a 2015 email that the development of a residential property in the Russian capital and the election of Trump would be two huge upcoming victories.
The project was supposedly abandoned in January of 2016 due to lack of land and permits.

As you may remember, this was right around the same time Putin and Trump were gushing about each other in the press. Interesting timing, no?
