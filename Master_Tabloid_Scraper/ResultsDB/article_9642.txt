Rihanna is moving on up.

The singer recently splashed out $6.8 million on a six-bedroom, nine-bathroom mansion in West Hollywood, the same neighborhood where Kendall Jenner just moved away from due to numerous break-ins at her house.
Via TMZ:
Sources close to the deal tell TMZ … Rihanna recently purchased the crib above the Sunset Strip for a cool $6.8 million. It’s got 6 bedrooms, 9 bathrooms and just over 7,000 square feet of space. There’s also a movie theater inside, a fully equipped gym, a fireplace, a billiard room and a guest house … plus a pool and a huge yard.
It’s also gated … which could come in handy around those parts.
