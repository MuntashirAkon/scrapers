Kim Kardashian is taking a walk down memory lane!

The 36-year-old recently revisited the former home she once shared with ex-husband Kris Humphries. Joined by sister Khloé Kardashian, the reality star had her realtor Josh Altman open the doors to the Beverly Hills mansion — which is currently on the market for $5.5 million — one more time.
“Can anyone guess where I’m at? This is so nostalgic. My old house!” she gushed in a Snapchat video.
The current owner purchased the house for $4 million in 2013. From the looks of it, the purchaser kept all of Kim’s old furniture and decor, including the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star’s logo on top of the vanity mirror in her glam room.
“Every last piece of mine. Everything is exactly the same,” she shared. “They bought all my furniture.”

When it came time to show off the bathroom in the master suite, Kim had a lot to say about some of the memories made in the en suite. For one, she spilled about the time she had a bad reaction to Botox injections.
“Right here and then I sat right here!” she said of the incident, gesturing to the bathtub. “Remember mom had to give me a shot and she shot me in my finger instead? What was that for?”
She added, “That shower. Don’t even want to tell you what’s gone on!”

Later that night, Kim explained she never got to properly say goodbye to the house after giving birth to North West. She moved into her mother’s home with Kanye West soon after welcoming her first child, and sold the house with all its furnishings still inside.
“Once I went into labor, I never went back,” she shared. “I couldn’t even pack it up. I just went to my mom’s house afterwards and I had sold the house. I had never been back, so it was really special to go.”
Kim initially bought the home for $3.4 million in 2010, just a year before she got engaged to her second husband. She tied knot with Kris on August 2011 and filed for divorce 72 days later.
“Fun fact: This house next door was the house I grew up in with mom and Bruce [Jenner],” she said. “Bye to my gorgeous old house. Where all my memories were made. Well not all my memories, but a lot of my Keeping Up memories with my sisters were made at this house.”
