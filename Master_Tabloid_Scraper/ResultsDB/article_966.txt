O.J. Simpson will be out of jail in the near future.

The former athlete, who has been in prison for the last nine years for kidnapping and armed robbery, was granted early release from Lovelock prison in Nevada Thursday. So far, he served nine years of a nine-to-33-year sentence.
“I’ve basically lived a conflict-free life,” the 70-year-old in a video conference during the hearing. “I’m sorry to the people of Nevada. I take full responsibility.”
“I’ve done my time,” he added. “I’ve done it as well and as respectfully as I think anyone can.”
Simpson received a majority of votes from the six parole board commissioners. David Smith, a spokesman for the Nevada Board of Parole Commissioners, told CNN Simpson could be released as early as October.
The disgraced NFL star is most infamously known for the 1995 acquittal of the murder of ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend, Ron Goldman. Dubbed “the trial of the century,” the case was recently covered on FX’s American Crime Story: The People v. O. J. Simpson.
