The two, who met on the set of her steamy music video for "Slumber Party," were first linked romantically back in November whenÂ a since-deleted photo of the two surfaced on Asghari's Instagram. They kept quiet about their relationship for the first couple of months, but made it official last January."We were waiting and waiting together for 20 minutes at a time, literally stuck there," Spears recounted to AMP 103.7 in January. "We were forced to talk to each other.""I kept his number, and it was so weird because it was like five months later that I found his number in my bag," she continued. "I was like 'He was really cute. This guy was really cute!' so then I called him. He is just a really fun, funny person."Of course this isn't the mother of two's first dip in the dating pool, the pop princess has previously dated a slew of men including Justin Timberlake, Jason Trawick and David Lucado. She shares her two sons with ex Kevin Federline.Take a gander through Spears' romantic road to Asghari...
