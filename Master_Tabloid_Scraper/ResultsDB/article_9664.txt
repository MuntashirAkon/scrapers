Getting their sillies out!Britney Spears and her boyfriend Sam Asghari had a head-bopping good time this weekend. The pop star took to Instagram to post a colorful video of the two lovebirds goofing off to the "Mi Gente" tune by J Balvin and Willy William.In the video, which the "Toxic" singer posted to her Instagram on Saturday, the 35-year-old nods her head as the model raises his eyebrows. The singer then lovingly points at her beau and they both break out in smiles.Spears captioned the vid, "Me and my boyfriend" and that tagged the young buck. Asghari shared the same video and captioned it, "Her smile makes me crazy ❤️ @britneyspears."Most know that the "Lucky" singer hasn't been so lucky in love so it's good seeing her so happy with the 23-year-old.

In September 2016, she appeared on The Jonathan Ross Show and revealed she tried to get back into dating, but wasn't having any luck."A lot of men are about games. It's just the mind game with guys, the calling back and the texting, it's just too much, it's silly," she said. "Actually I'm not looking for men right now, I'm really happy with myself. I'm not looking for anything, I'm fine with the way I am."Looks like she just had to wait a couple of months!
