The search for Jamie is on, Outlander fans.In the just-released trailer for the third season of the Starz hit, fans get their first look at the separated soulmates Claire (Caitriona Balfe) and Jamie (Sam Heughan). And while the Droughtlander may be ending and reuniting us with the pair in just a few months, it's abundantly clear that an on-screen reunion between the two will be the season's biggest quest. Can Claire find a way back to the past and into Jamie's arms? Or is she stuck in the 1960s in a marriage she doesn't want for good? Check out the dreamy first look below!

Gary Young, Charlie Hiett, David Berry, César Domboy, Lauren Lyle, John Bell, Wil Johnson, Hannah James, and Tanya Reynolds are also set to star in the new season. Outlander returns for season three on Sunday, Sept. 10 at 8 p.m. on Starz.
