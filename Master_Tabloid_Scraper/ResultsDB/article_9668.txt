Could Outlander's Sam Heughan Be Any More Adorable? Watch Him Welcome You to Season 3/n
We may have to wait many more months for more Outlander, but we don't have to wait any longer to see new footage of Sam Heughan's face. The star of the epic Starz drama is here in this clip, exclusive to E! News, to welcome you to Culloden for the first day of Outlander season 3. Click play above! Season two ended earlier this year with pretty much everything having changed. We learned that after Claire (Caitriona Balfe) had gone back to her own time, she and Frank (Tobias Menzies) had raised her and Jamie's daughter, Brianna (Sophie Skelton) together until Frank's death. Then, on a trip back to Inverness to mourn the death of Reverend Wakefield, Brianna learned about her true parentage and Claire learned that her husband did not die on the battlefield at Culloden. 

What we did not see, however, was what did happen at Culloden after Claire left, and it looks like that's exactly what we're going to see when Outlander returns in 2017. Starz announced back in June that the series would return for both a third and a fourth season, spanning both Voyager and Drums of Autumn, the third and fourth books in Diana Gabaldon's beloved series. Not much has been announced about the upcoming seasons, but a very important character has been cast. Australian actor David Berry will play Lord John Grey, who we've already met as a teenager, but will now meet as an adult. He's so important in the Outlander world that he has his very own Lord John book series. Now, if you'll excuse us, we've got to watch that clip above a few more times...for research.
