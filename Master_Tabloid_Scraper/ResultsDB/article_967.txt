Kim Kardashian has been accused of using drugs, and she’s not happy about it.

When the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star recently shared a Snapchat video talking about her new Kids Supply clothing line with husband Kanye West, many fans pointed out a mystery white powder in the background.
Speculations of drug use quickly spread online, with one Twitter user claiming the mom-of-two had been “caught out with cocaine” after seeing a photo of two white lines on a table.

To prevent false reports from spreading, the mom-of-two quickly jumped in and slammed the allegation.
“I do not play with rumors like this so I’m gonna shut it down real quick,” she tweeted. “That’s sugar from our candy mess from dylan’s candy shop.”

In the past, Kim also revealed rarely drinks alcohol and takes a hard pass at drugs of any kind.
“I never understand why people get so bothered by what other people choose to do with their lives,” she wrote in an essay defending her naked selfies. “I don’t do drugs, I hardly drink, I’ve never committed a crime—and yet I’m a bad role model for being proud of my body?”
