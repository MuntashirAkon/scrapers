Nicky Hilton Is Pregnant with Baby No. 2/n
Nicky Hilton’s family is getting bigger — again!

Just a year after welcoming her first child with husband James Rothschild, the hotel heiress is pregnant with Baby No. 1. A rep for the mom-of-one confirmed the news, saying, “The couple are thrilled about the new addition to their family.”
A source told the Daily Mail, who first reported on the pregnancy, the pair are hoping for a boy — though they “of course will be happy with anything.”
Nicky, 33, was recently seen at Haute Couture Fashion Week in Paris, where she was covered her budding bump in a structured pink Valentino cocktail dress.
The businesswoman and James, a financier, are already proud parents to a daughter named Lily Grace.
