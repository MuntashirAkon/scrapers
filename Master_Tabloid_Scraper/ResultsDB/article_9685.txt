L.A. Rams Become 1st NFL Team to Sponsor Gay Pride Event/nThe L.A. Rams are breaking even more ground in the LGBTQ arena -- becoming the 1st NFL team ever to officially sponsor a gay pride event.  The team has joined up with Venice Pride -- the organization behind the massive Venice Pride block party -- and has sponsored the blue lights in the letter  "C " in the famous VENICE sign.  Each letter in the sign will be lit up with a different color -- just like the rainbow LGBTQ pride flag. The event begins June 2.  A Rams spokesperson issued a statement saying the team is proud to  "stand in alignment with the LGBT community that is such an important part of the fabric of Los Angeles. "  "Inclusion has always been a valued part of our organization and we see this as a unique way to publicly celebrate the diversity that makes this community so special. " Of course, the Rams made history in 2014 when they drafted Michael Sam -- the first openly gay player to enter the NFL Draft./n
