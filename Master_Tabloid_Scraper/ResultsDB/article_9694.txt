Mike 'The Situation' Faces New Tax Evasion Crimes/nMike  "The Situation " SorrentinoÂ is in a heap of trouble, because the feds have added new criminal charges against him, alleging he tried to screw Uncle Sam out of millions of dollars. The U.S. Attorney in New Jersey just added tax evasion, structuring and falsifying records to avoid detection of assets.

They say he filed false income tax returns and made fraudulent deductions. He was originally charged with other tax offenses. He faces decades in prison if convicted./n
