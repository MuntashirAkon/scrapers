Rebel Wilson is taking a stand.

The Pitch Perfect 2 star won her defamation case against Bauer Media Group — a company that owns publications like In Touch, Life & Style, and Women’s World — two years after a series of damning articles were published.
During the three-week trial, which reached a verdict Thursday (June 15, 2017) by an all-female jury, Rebel and her attorneys argued the company’s tabloids portrayed her as a serial liar who had lied about her age and other personal details. She claimed the articles had damaged her reputation so much that she allegedly lost out on two roles.

“Just crushed my defamation case in Australia x thank you to all my family, friends and supporters! I had to take a stand. I had to stand up to a bully, a media organization Bauer Media Group who maliciously took me down in May 2015 with a series of grubby and completely false articles,” she wrote on Instagram. “Far too often tabloid magazines and the ‘journalists’ who work for them don’t abide by professional ethics. Far too often their conduct can only be described as disgraceful and disgusting!”
“I’m glad that the lovely ladies of the jury have agreed with me. Their unanimous and overwhelming verdict has sent a clear message,” she continued. “I love my job as an actress and as an entertainer and I look forward to rebuilding my career now that the record has been set straight. Thank you so much everybody!”
