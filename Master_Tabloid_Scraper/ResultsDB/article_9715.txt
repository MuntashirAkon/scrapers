After Carter’s defense attorney asked the judge to dismiss the case the prosecutor argued vehemently against the motion. “This is not protected speech,” she said about Carter encouraging Roy to commit suicide via thousands of text messages. “She was reckless, your honor, and she caused his death.”

"I thought you wanted to do this. This time is right and you're ready. You just need to do it. You can't keep living this way. You just need to do it like you did the last time and not think about it and just do it, babe. You can't keep doing this every day," was a haunting text message Carter sent to Roy. Her defense attorney stated that she was “involuntarily intoxicated” by anti-depressants that should not have been prescribed for a teenager and said he would present a witness to prove it.
