While Kourtney Kardashian’s young and hot boyfriend Younes Bendjima was being photographed kissing on Kourtney’s neck, Kendall Jenner took some time out to be one with nature (and her drink).

Kardashian, Bendjima, and Jenner were all aboard the same yacht in Antibes, France on Thursday, May 25. Kardashian wore a bright pink thong bikini while Jenner opted for one in blue. Bendjima didn’t get the thong bikini memo, so he wore patterned trunks instead.

Other than washing his abs under the outdoor shower, Bendjima celebrated the great weather by packing on the PDA as they traveled about the boat.

Meanwhile, Jenner found a paddleboard, refilled her drink, and said to the rest of the boat, “See ya later, freaks!”

Gracefully, she paddled out into the middle of the water without even spilling a droplet of her drink.
