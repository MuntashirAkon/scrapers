When you’re Taylor Swift, you don’t need to do much to make a ton of money.

Even without releasing any new music, the”Bad Blood” singer generated a six-figure revenue just by letting streaming platforms like Spotify, Pandora, Tidal, and Amazon have access to her discography once again.
According to Billboard, Tay’s songs were streamed 47.5 million times in their first week, generating roughly $285,000 in revenue based on an average blended per-stream audio-on-demand rate of $0.006. Meanwhile, more than $59,000 of the revenue made from the publishing royalties will be divided among Swift and her co-writers.
In total, approximately $397,000 was made by allowing the 27-year-old’s first five studio albums to be played on streaming services since June 8. (The albums have only been available on the subscription-only Apple Music since 2014.)

Though Taylor — who withheld 1989 from Spotify at the time of its release — claimed her change of heart came as to celebrate the record selling over 10 million copies, many fans thought it was an subtle attempt to steal nemesis Katy Perry’s thunder on the day of her new album’s release.
Now that the numbers have come in, it’s safe to say being petty pays.
