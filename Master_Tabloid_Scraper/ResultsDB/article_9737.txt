Monaco’s Adorable Royal Twins (and Their Curls!) Are Looking More Grown Up Than Ever with Mom Princess Charlene/n
They’re only 2 years old, but Monaco’s Prince Jacques and Princess Gabriella can already work a room.
Along with their mother, Princess Charlene, the twins paid a visit to the Hector Otto Foundation, a retirement home in the principality on August 19.
Jacques was initially a little timid, standing by the door as he was coaxed by his mother to enter, who told him to “come with me.” His twin sister, Gabriella, on the other hand, took the room by storm. According to a report, she captivated her audience, repeatedly telling them “bonjour” and happily handing out gifts in the form of portraits of herself and her brother, while her mother looked on.
The twins were well-dressed for the occasion, too, with Jacques in a pair of celeb-favorite Stan Smith sneakers and Gabriella in a floral purple dress.

Making her third visit to the foundation, Charlene, a former competitive swimmer, couldn’t have been prouder. During the visit, she told the assembled residents  — who were expecting her arrival, but not the children in tow — how very happy she was “to introduce you to Jacques and Gabriella.” 
Of their arrival, Jérôme Breton, the director of the Hector Otto Foundation, said, according to Hello Monaco: “The first time with the Sovereign Prince, then alone, and today with the two children, it is a great honor.”
Besides the photos that the young royals brought for the foundation’s 40 residents, Charlene herself gave away several baskets of fresh garden vegetables grown in Roc Agel, the family’s private retreat in the South of France. 
Though he was nervous to start, Jacques eventually warmed to the crowd, blowing kisses as they said their goodbyes. And Princess Gabriella, capping her appearance, took a curtain call as she left with her mother and brother, saying “Bye, everybody!” to the crowd.
