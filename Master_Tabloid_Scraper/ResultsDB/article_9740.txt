Amid the backlash surrounding the fashion designer, Rachel Roy has cancelled a scheduled public appearance. The stylist was scheduled to give remarks at a "Mastering Your Métier" event in New York City Monday evening organized by NeueHouse. However, as reported by BuzzFeed, those who had confirmed their attendance received the following email today:"Due to a personal emergency, Rachel Roy has had to cancel this evening's event. Our apologies for any inconvenience."While the specifics of that personal emergency remain unknown, it is easy to speculate the sudden absence is connected to this weekend's controversy tying her to Beyoncé's newest album. 

On Saturday, the Grammy-winning songstress released her sixth studio album, a visual album that debuted on HBO Saturday night. The fresh music videos and lyrics are littered with claims of infidelity, though it has not been confirmed whether Beyoncé's referring specifically to her husband Jay-Z or singing generally of a cheating man. Regardless, fans not only have decided Jay Z is the one engaging in an affair, but have also pinpointed his mistress with allegations against Roy. The speculation stemmed from a lyric in the song, "Sorry," where Beyoncé tells her man he "better call Becky with the good hair."Then, in an Instagram selfie shared by the fashionista, the caption read, "Good hair don't care, but we will take good lighting, for selfies, or self truths, always." Fans interpreted this as a reference to the lyric, though Roy subsequently deleted the photo and urged fans that bullying was unacceptable. "I respect love, marriages, families and strength," Roy tweeted. "What shouldn't be tolerated by anyone, no matter what, is bullying, of any kind."
