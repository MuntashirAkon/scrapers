Stop what you're doing.For the first time since that fateful evening after the 2014 Met Gala, Beyoncé, Jay-Z and Rachel Roy are all in the same room together.Bey and Jay arrived at the 2016 CFDA Awards through a side entrance shortly after the official red carpet closed so as to avoid too much attention—but let's face it, the musical power couple hardly went unnoticed.Fans snapped shots of both making their way into the annual fashion event—with Jay getting the dirt off his shoulders dusted off by an assistance as Bey strutted her stuff in a sparkly suit and Formation-themed hat.And it looks like it was it wasn't a night for drama for the Carters because it was a family affair!Little Blue Ivy was escorted into the event by her famous father and was snapped waving her finger at the photographers.
