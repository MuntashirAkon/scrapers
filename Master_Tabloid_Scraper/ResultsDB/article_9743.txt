Rachael Ray made sure Rachel Roy had something to chase that lemonade.In case you've forgotten, the famous chef got thrown into the Beyoncé "Becky with the good hair" drama after the Beyhive misdirected their anger at the wrong person, going after Ray instead of Roy (the names are pretty close, but still...). Regardless, the 47-year-old Food Network star got a glimpse into the wrath Queen B fans can dish, so both ladies sent each other a coping gift to ease the pain."Rachel sent me flowers and I sent her a bottle, a big bottle of wine and a straw," Ray told Us Weekly at the HealthCorps 10th Annual Garden Gala in New York City on Tuesday."[I was going to send Roy] Brunello di Montalcino, where I was married, but I said for our office to ask her office if she drinks red and if she didn't drink red, to send Grande Dame," Ray continued of the gesture. "So I don't know actually which one she got. I wrote the card and she got the straw and the booze."

It all started when when Beyoncé released her sixth studio album Lemonade on Tidal. In one of the songs titled "Sorry," Jay-Z's leading lady sings about a cheating lover with the words, "He only want me when I'm not there / He better call Becky with the good hair."While nobody was (and is) 100 percent sure who this Becky person is, some started to speculate that it's Roy the fashion designer, mainly alluding to the Met Gala blowout from a few years back. But then, Roy's Instagram post (which was later deleted) didn't exactly do her any favors."Good hair don't care, but we will take good lighting, for selfies, or self truths, always," she wrote on Instagram. "Live in the light #NoDramaQueens."Sips tea wine.
