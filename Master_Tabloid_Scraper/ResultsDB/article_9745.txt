Clearly, there aren't enough Rachels in Hollywood these days.Talk-show host and famous chef Rachael Ray is feeling the wrath from Beyoncé fans all around the world this weekend. But as it turns out, all the anger and attacks is being misdirected at the wrong person. The likely target is none other than designer Rachel Roy. It all started Saturday night when Beyoncé released her sixth studio album on Tidal. In one of the songs titled "Sorry," Jay-Z's leading lady sings about a cheating lover with the words, "He only want me when I'm not there / He better call Becky with the good hair."While nobody was (and is) 100 percent sure who this Becky person is, some started to speculate that it's Roy the fashion designer. After all, her Instagram post that has since been deleted didn't do her any favors."Good hair don't care, but we will take good lighting, for selfies, or self truths, always," she wrote on Instagram. "Live in the light #NoDramaQueens."
