The couple welcomed their daughter on Tuesday in New Jersey, Otis’ rep confirmed to PEOPLE exclusively.
“Mommy and baby are doing well and Daddy is in pure bliss,” her rep said.
Otis and Hehner married in 2014 after meeting for the first time on Married at First Sight, seconds before getting married on TV. Otis, 31, revealed her pregnancy to PEOPLE in January, six months after they lost their baby, when Otis was four months pregnant with a little boy.
