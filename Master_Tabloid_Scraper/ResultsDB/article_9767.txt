Roy Hibbert -- I'm Becoming a Gaming Legend ... Thanks to Indiana/nNBA star Roy Hibbert possesses a specific set of skills -- beyond hooping, that is -- and pretty soon he might be unbeatable ... as long as he keeps playing in Indiana.    The Pacers stud was outside Craig's in West Hollywood when we asked ... what's a city kid like himself do for fun in the heartland? Roy doesn't hesitate -- telling us there's not much to do except get super sharp at a particular video game. As he puts it ... his game is  "pretty nice! "Roy also gets a little nostalgic in this clip about his ex-teammate Lance Stephenson -- who bolted for the Hornets.But this clip is really just a heads-up to all you gamers ... look out for Roy on the battlefield!/n
