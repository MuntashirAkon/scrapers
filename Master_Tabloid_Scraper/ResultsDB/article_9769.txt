NBA's Roy Hibbert -- Hey Six Flags ... MAKE BIGGER SEATS/nBeing 7'2 " has obviously paid off for Lakers center Roy Hibbert ... but the mammoth of a man tells TMZ Sports the one place it SUCKS is in the magical fun land of Six Flags! Roy was out in Beverly Hills when we asked him the one place he wished was a little bit friendlier to the GIANT portion of the population (dude weighs in at just under 300 lbs as well). Check out the clip -- It's actually pretty sad ...  Roy knows where it hurts to be huge, and he wants the folks over at Bugs Bunny World to fix the problem immediately. On the bright side, Roy is making $15 million this year ... gotta be at least enough for a personal ferris wheel. /n
