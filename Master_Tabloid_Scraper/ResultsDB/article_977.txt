Jack Gets on Grindr in New Will & Grace Revival Promo
/n

Will & Grace are almost back on screens (along with Jack and Karen, of course), and a new promo for the show’s return reveals the gang’s snark and wit is as on point as ever.
In the sneak peek, which begins with throwback clips from the original series, Will (Eric McCormack) and Grace (Debra Messing) show they’re still in sync with a fast-paced game of Heads Up. “Okay, he’s a man, but he’s aged into a lesbian,” Will tells Grace by way of a description. “Newt Gingrich!” Grace promptly (and correctly) yells.
Elsewhere, Jack (Sean Hayes) is moving with the times when it comes to dating: “Grindr has gotten so skanky,” he complains as he swipes through options. “I feel like I could get finger herpes just from scrolling.” He’s then disappointed to realize the one gay man in the vicinity is Will.
Watch the video above, and find out everything else you need to know about the reboot from EW’s cover story.
The revival premieres Thursday, Sept. 28 at 9 p.m. ET on NBC.
