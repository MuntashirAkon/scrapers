Akon -- My Pet Tigers Poop A LOT!!/nAkon's got a serious poop problem in his backyard ... 'cause his pet tigers are dumping like crazy ... and you won't believe how much scat they drop a week.The  "Smack That " singer was on his way into LAX when he told us he owns two tigers -- named Simba and Tony (clever) -- who drop some serious dookies.Akon says he only cages his tigers at night ... and trusts Tony and Simba enough to let them roam his yard during the day.That's what Roy said./n
