Tamar Braxton & Vince Herbert Involved In Domestic Dispute: 'He Drew Blood!'/n
Trouble in paradise would be an understatement for Tamar Braxton‘s latest turmoil with husband Vince Herbert, as RadarOnline.com has learned the pair was reportedly involved in a violent domestic dispute.
According to BOSSIP, the couple had been spending time at the Ritz Carlton in Buckhead, Atlanta on August 21. But what should have been a romantic time together quickly turned sour — and physical.
During their brawl, Herbert even allegedly bit his wife’s finger and drew blood, the website reports. But by the times cops arrived on the scene, the 47-year-old couldn’t be arrested because he had already left.

“Upon responding to the call, it was learned that it was just a verbal dispute and nothing criminal had transpired,” the Atlanta Police Department later told Hollywood Life.”The other party left the location prior to the police arrival. The call was pulled in ’12’ meaning there was nothing to report. No incident report was generated for the incident.”
However, 38-year-old Braxton’s finger was apparently injured so severely that she might require stitches!

Things have been rocky for the couple for some time, especially after divorce and cheating rumors swirled in July.
To make matters worse, after Tamar was dramatically fired from The Real earlier this summer, the star allegedly fired Vince as her manager as well.
