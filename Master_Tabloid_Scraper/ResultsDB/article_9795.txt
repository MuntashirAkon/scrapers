Source Says Tamar Braxton Has Been Living In 'Private Hell' With Husband Vince Herbert ‚Äî The Shocking Allegations Of Ongoing Domestic Violence HERE/n

Everything isn't always as it seems.
As Tamar Braxton continues to defend her marriage to Vince Herbert, a source has come forward with shocking claims that the 39-year-old is living in a "personal hell" as yet another alleged altercation comes to light.
You may recall back in August, police responded to the couple's Ritz-Carlton room in Atlanta after an alleged incident that cause Vince to flee the scene before cops arrived.
Now we're hearing these fights aren't so rare ‚Äî and, it sounds like Tamar's sisters have had about enough.
The insider tells DailyMail.com: 
"But her family fears that 13 [years of marriage] may be their sister's unlucky number and that if things don't change with Tamar and Vince, she could end up like Rihanna after the Chris Brown altercation or worse."

We're also hearing there was another situation several months ago where sister Toni Braxton called police after a fight between the couple in Calabasas, CA ‚Äî but nothing was done as there was no clear evidence:
"Again, since there were no physical signs of battery, Vince was not arrested. But these fights are happening more and more."
Further, the outlet reports Braxton has been living in a "private hell" after suffering financial and marital problems in the wake of her firing from The Real.
Yikes, we're really hoping this isn't true!
Regardless, T.B. continues to present her union with Vince as a perfect marriage:
