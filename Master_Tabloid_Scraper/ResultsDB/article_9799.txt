Utah Governor To Sign Legislation Declaring Porn A 'Health Hazard' — Get The Scoop!/n

It's no surprise that porn can be a touchy subject — no pun intended — but it seems that Utah Governor, Gary R. Herbert, wants you to keep your hands to yourself altogether!
The Gov. is planning on signing two pieces of legislation on Tuesday that attempt to stop porn from creating "a sexually toxic environment" by helping to raise awareness.

One piece of legislation is only a resolution and it damns pornography stating that it is: 
"A public health hazard leading to a broad spectrum of individual and public health impacts and societal harms."
The resolution also makes the claim that Utah would be the first state in the nation to make such a declaration as it goes on to say that there are numerous negative effects of porn like treatment of "women as objects and commodities for the viewer's use."
The legislation also states that porn:
"Equates violence toward women and children with sex and pain with pleasure, which increases the demand for sex trafficking, prostitution, child sexual abuse images, and child pornography."

Though the resolution can't do anything like ban pornography and is really meant to raise awareness, the bill, House Bill 155 Reporting of Child Pornography, could bring some consequences.
It states that computer technicians who come across child pornography during their work should report any findings to authorities. It goes on to say that "the willful failure to report the child pornography" would be considered a class B misdemeanor.
The proposed bill also specifies that ISPs would not be liable if the provider "reports child pornography in compliance with specified federal law."
