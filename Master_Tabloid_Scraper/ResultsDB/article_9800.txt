Tamar Braxton Explains That A Medical Emergency Forced Her To Skip The Grammys ‚Äî Oh No!/n

Oh no!
On Thursday, it was revealed that Tamar Braxton was MIA from the Grammys because she was back in the hospital ‚Äî but not for herself!
The season four finale of Tamar & Vince documented The Real host accompanying her husband, Vince Herbert, to the E.R. on Valentine's Day after his arm became swollen and was causing severe pain. Yikes!
Since Hebert has a history of of pulmonary embolisms, the doctors admitted the record producer into the hospital. This obviously put a damper on the duo's plans to attend the awards show. Bummer!

The Love and War singer explained on camera:

"So it's like 12:48 in the afternoon, and this is the time I'm supposed to be walking the carpet. I keep getting these tweets and Instagrams about 'What are you wearing?' 'When are you coming?' 'We want to see you.' And I won't be coming because my husband is‚Ä¶"
Well that is totally understandable. She continued:

"This is just so crazy. I'm not even thinking about a Grammy. I'm more thinking about how Vince is and making sure he walks out of here like I did."
As we reported, Toni Braxton's sister was forced to receive medical attention after doctors found blood clots in her lungs back in November. So scary!
Nonetheless, we are happy to report that Vince is doing just fine as Tamar took to Twitter and shared:

Phew! Perhaps Tamar and Vince will make it to the Grammys next year?
Fingers crossed!
