Another Dancing with the Stars contestant has been forced to leave the show due to serious health concerns.

Tamar Braxton, who was paired with pro dancer Val Chmerkovskiy, has announced she’s dropped out of the competition following an earlier hospitalization this week.

She wrote on Instagram,
With a Heavy heart I regret to inform you that my season of #dwts has to come to an end along with the rest of my tour dates with @musicbykem. After yesterday’s final #dwts performance I went back to the hospital (after the doctors didn’t want me to leave in the first place) only to find out that I don’t have pneumonia but something way more serious and that is having several P.E.’s (blood clots in both sides of my lungs)
She added that she’s always one to push through any obstacle that comes her way, but that her current health obstacle is too serious. That being said, her spirits seem high and she sees herself a true winner for pushing on through:
As you all know I will be the first to always encourage anyone to push through any obstacle that comes along one’s way. But in this case, my health is my current obstacle. .. And in TRUE #tamartian form I must go about this the exact same way as I would anything else. I woke up to a mirror and saw myself this morning and that makes me the winner because that almost wasn’t the case.

Braxton also added her thanks for all of her fans’ love and support:
🏆Take care of yourselves… I love you and thank you ALL for your support❤️ p.s. Big hugs and kisses to my boo @iamvalc for being beyond a friend, brother and the BEST partner EVER😘🙌
The 38-year-old singer made a dramatic return on Monday night’s show 20 minutes before it ended to perform a group dance with Nick Carter. Hours before the show began, during dress rehearsal, Braxton was rushed to the ER. Doctors first believed she had a case of pneumonia, but now we know her condition is more serious.

Carter told People after their performance that Braxton was very “unstable.”
There was a moment right before she came out, a minute before we had to perform, and [Chmerkovskiy] came to me and said, ‘Listen, everything else aside, I need you to be a leading man tonight and protect her and take care of her.’ She was unstable. I really had to put her first and assume that responsibility and make sure that she was taken care of.
Contestant Kim Zolciak was eliminated from the show last month after suffering from a previously undiagnosed heart condition and several mini strokes. She underwent heart surgery shortly after departing the ABC show.
