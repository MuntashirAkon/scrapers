So you have platinum albums, sold-out tours, and a celebrity spouse.
… Now what?

Ring the Alarm! Architecture firm Elenberg Fraser has designed a skyscraper inspired by Beyoncé‘s swervalicious curves. The 68-story ‘Premier Tower’ is planned to host retail and residential space will be erected in Melbourne, Australia.
The firm describes its twisting Yoncé edifice as “pure and simple” in a public statement.
“The complex form … is actually the most effective way to redistribute the building’s mass, giving the best results of structural dispersion.”
“Art and science? You betcha,” Elenberg Fraser’s statement reveals that its design was inspired by Queen Bey’s figure in the “Ghost” music video.

On a smaller scale, Kanye West’s greatest quotes have been published in a free e-book by Wonder Shuttle and pxlfctry. The World According to Kanye categorizes Yeezy’s most notable word vomit into chapters including, “Kanye on Self Esteem”, “Kanye on Kanye” (a two-part series), and “Kanye on Learning”.
Here is an excerpt from the chapter titled “Kanyeisms”:

Author Herbert Lui prefaces in his Foreward,
“Kanye represents the voice inside us that pushes us to go beyond. To try and to be honest. Encouraging us to be hated for what we are, rather than loved for what we aren’t. He’s far from perfect, but he’s not ashamed of it.”
Lui’s e-book is available for free download on theworldaccordingtokanye.com.
