You Won’t Recognize Any of the Lyrics in the New ‘Annie’ Trailer/n
There’s another trailer out for the upcoming modern day adaptation on Annie, which stars Jamie Foxx and Quvenzhané Wallis. In addition to the other changes made to the original story of little orphan Annie, this trailer highlights the lyrical changes that will be required in changing the movie’s setting from Depression-era New York to modern day New York.
We get to hear two songs from the movie in the trailer: “A Hard Knock Life” and “You’re Never Fully Dressed Without a Smile.” If you’re looking to hear Quvenzhané’s “Tomorrow” you’re going to have to go back to the first trailer. In “Smile” the un-PC opening line “Hey, hobo man / Hey, Dapper Dan” has been changed to “Hey, America / Let’s turn it up.” In “Hard Knock Life,” “when you’re in an orphanage” has been changed to “when you’re a foster kid” to reflect Annie’s more modern living situation. And then there are songs that are going to have to be cut altogether. It’s hard to imagine anyone singing “We’d Like to Thank You, Herbert Hoover” in this version.
This trailer also highlights Rose Byrne’s character much more heavily, as she rides high off the success of Neighbors. It has also minimized Cameron Diaz’s Miss Hannigan, the most criticized part of the first trailer. That character is still looking questionable though.
Annie will be out in time for Christmas.
