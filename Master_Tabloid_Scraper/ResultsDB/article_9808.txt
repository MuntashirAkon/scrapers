 Though James Franco was listed as one of the 36 stars on Lindsay Lohan’s alleged sex list that was leaked earlier this week, the Spring Breakers actor is insisting that he did not sleep with the actress.
In an interview with Los Angeles Magazine, Franco spills the beans on his true relationship with the Mean Girls starlet, telling the publication that Lohan’s list — which also included the likes of Justin Timberlake, Ashton Kutcher, Adam Levine, and Orlando Bloom — is made of “lies.”

“Lindsay herself has told lies about me with her people-she’s-slept-with list,” he says.
Though Franco admits that there are several poems in his new book, Directing Herbert White, about the former child star, he has nothing bad to say about 27-year-old — or any of the other people he has written about, for that matter.
“No, I didn’t write anything bad about them,” he says. “So I feel like what I said is much less than what she’s said.”
“I know that my life as an actor obviously casts a shadow over what I’m doing with the poetry, but it allows me to get readers that maybe normally wouldn’t read a book of poetry,” he continues.
In 2012, Franco insisted that his relationship with Lohan was strictly platonic in a SiriusXM radio interview with Howard Stern.
“I mean, I don’t want to brag about it,” he said. “I don’t know how that got out … She was having issues even then, so you feel weird. Honestly, she was a friend. I’ve met a lot of people that are troubled and sometimes you don’t want to do that.”
