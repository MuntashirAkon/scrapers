Tamar Braxton Got This Ginormous Diamond for Giving Birth/n
Tamar Braxton is singing a high note and she’s looking good doing it courtesy of a brand new bauble on her left finger.
The singer showed off a ginormous sparkler she got from her hubby… and let’s just say she’s giving Kim Kardashian and Ciara a run for their carats.

Tamar’s gift isn’t your typical ‘thanks for giving birth’ that usually comes in the form of a sterling silver charm bracelet, mini-vacay or baby furniture for all us normal people. She got a yellow diamond to trump all yellow diamonds.

“I don’t know if it’s a Christmas present because my husband owed me a push gift and I didn’t get it,” she said. “So I think this is like a combination.

“I thought he was like joking at first because when I opened the box it had a light. So I opened the box and was like (insert crazy giggling here)… So I won,” Tamar added.
And she claims she doesn’t know how many carats the sparkler actually is…
Guess it’s just too many to count. (Must be nice).
