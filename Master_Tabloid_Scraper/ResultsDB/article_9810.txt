Gaga Is Going Swinging — With Tony Bennett/n
Get ready to do the Lindy Hop, Little Monsters!
After collaborating on “The Lady Is a Tramp” off his Grammy-winning Duets II, legendary singer Tony Bennett is teaming up with Lady Gaga again. But this time, the duo is laying down some swing sound, he revealed in an interview Thursday, according to the AP.
Bennett, 86, “can’t wait” to record “a big swing album” with Mother Monster. Though the singers have yet to step foot in the record studio, “we have it all worked out already on paper,” he said.

Bennett is thrilled to work again with such a “wonderful person and a great talent,” he added, praising Gaga’s savvy has a pop star-cum-businesswoman. 
The collaboration comes on the heels of Gaga canceling the remainder of her highly-lucrative Born This Way Ball tour last month, after she was sidelined due to a labral tear in her right hip that required surgery and strict downtime to recover.

Now, after going under the knife in February, Gaga is on the mend in wheelchair — that is, of course, 24-karat gold. “[She’s] doing unbelievable … doing great,” her manager, Vincent Herbert, said Tuesday, adding that she’s “ready to get back to work.”
“I can’t wait for the world to hear her new music and see her come back healthy, strong and better than ever,” Herbert said, noting that the CD is “very, very refreshing.”
