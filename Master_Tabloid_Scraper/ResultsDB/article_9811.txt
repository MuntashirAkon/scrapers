Gaga Is ‘Doing Wonderful’/n

Lady Gaga is “doing wonderful” as she recovers from hip surgery that forced her to cancel the rest of her Born This Way Ball tour.
This, according to a new interview with her manager.
“[She’s] doing unbelievable … doing great,” Vincent Herbert said Tuesday (via The New York Daily News).
Gaga underwent surgery in February. The procedure left the Poker Face singer wheelchair-bound (in 24-karat gold, no less) and delayed work on her upcoming CD, ARTPOP.
Now, Herbert insists Gaga is “ready to get back to work.”

“I can’t wait for the world to hear her new music and see her come back healthy, strong and better than ever,” Herbert said, adding the CD is “very, very refreshing.”
Celebuzz recently spotted Gaga greeting her fans in New York City.
“I miss you guys so much,” Gaga, whose wheelchair was designed by Ken Borochov, said in a video posted to Twitter.
