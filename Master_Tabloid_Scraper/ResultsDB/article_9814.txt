Tamar Braxton: Despite Husband Vince Herbert’s 100-Lb. Weight Loss, ‘I Like a Little Meat on My Man’s Bones’/n

 
Tamar Braxton is happy her husband is feeling great after dropping nearly 100 lbs., but she still sometimes misses his old body.
“I’m very happy only because he’s much healthier and I want him around forever, but, you know, I like a little meat on my man’s bones,” Braxton tells PEOPLE Now of love Vince Herbert.
The Braxton Family Values star says Herbert, to whom she’s been married for eight years, now “has lots of energy.”

“I had to be very supportive of him, he had a couple of surgeries — not like really cosmetic surgeries, but like medical surgeries to help him to lose weight because he had medical problems due to the weight,” explains Braxton, 39.
In 2012, Herbert was hospitalized for 40 days after suffering multiple blot clots. Opening up about the health scare in 2015, Braxton said on The Real, “He had seven blood clots and what I do want to say about that is you’ve got to be really careful. You’ve got to get checked to make sure that your blood is not too thick.”
