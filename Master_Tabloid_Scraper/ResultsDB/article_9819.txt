Emily Maynard Gets Bachelorette Advice from Ali Fedotowsky and Ashley Herbert/n
Newly-minted star of The Bachelorette Emily Maynard was getting some advice for her upcoming season from two women who have been there before.  
The reality star joined Ali Fedotowsky and Ashley Hebert for a makeup appointment and some chitchat at Blushington Makeup & Beauty Lounge in West Hollywood. According to a source, the ladies were talking about the ABC reality show, and Fedotowsky and Hebert were giving Maynard advice about what to expect.  
“All three ladies got along so great,” a source says. “The ladies were really cute together; they joked around and … were all in very good moods – energetic and excited about being in each other’s company.”  
After the makeup session, the women filmed a promo together for Emily’s Bachelorette season which is scheduled to air during the Feb. 27 episode.  – Monica Rizzo and Jennifer Garcia
