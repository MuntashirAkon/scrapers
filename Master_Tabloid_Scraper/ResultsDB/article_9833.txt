It looks like Lady Gaga's on the edge of a full recovery.In an interview published Wednesday, the pop superstar's manager, Vincent Herbert, revealed that a month after her hip operation Gaga is "doing wonderful, doing great."According to her manager, the hitmaker is "ready to get back to work" finishing up recording her latest album, Artpop, which she began writing during the Born This Way Ball tour.

Unfortunately, Lady Gaga was forced to scrap the remaining dates of that trek after being diagnosed with a labral tear of her right hip that required surgery."I can't wait for the world to hear her new music and see her come back healthy, strong and better than ever," Herbert said.He added that Artpop is shaping up to be "very, very refreshing" and the singer continues to "push the envelope."Her little Monsters will be very, very glad to hear it.
