Tamar Braxton -- Sells L.A. Mansion For $3.5 Million PROFIT!!!/n "Braxton Family Values " star Tamar Braxton is a mansion-flipping GODDESS ... just two years after buying her massive L.A. home, she unloaded the palatial digs for a $3.5 MILLION PROFIT.

They listed the house in Oct. 2012. Now for the kicker, the couple -- which just welcomed a newborn baby -- sold the pad earlier this year for ... wait for it ... $6.9 million!!!Fun Fact -- the home is just a stone's throw from Justin Bieber's private community in Calabasas! So far, no word on where the couple plans to live next./n
