TV Science Guru "Mr. Wizard" Dies at 89/nDon Herbert -- TV's favorite science teacher who taught kids to try everything at home -- died yesterday at 89 in Bell Canyon, Calif. In the earliest days of TV, Herbert turned the idiot box into a science classroom that every child -- and plenty of adults -- could love and learn from.  "Watch Mr. Wizard " ran from 1951 to 1964, but Mr. Wizard lived on well beyond that, through the 1980s, when  "Mr. Wizard's World " ran on Nickelodeon.  "The show today might seem slow, but it was in-depth and forced you to think along, " said Steve Jacobs, a former on-air sidekick, to the AP. Herbert was also one of the first guests on David Letterman's NBC show.The cause of death was bone cancer, said his son-in-law, Tom Nikosey./n
