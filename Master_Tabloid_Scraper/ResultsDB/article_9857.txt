Corey Feldman -- A 300 Pound Woman is Terrorizing Me/nCorey Feldman apparently had good reason to get a 6 ft, 300 lb woman arrested ... because the restraining order she allegedly violated shows a person right out of  "Single White Female. "According to legal docs, obtained by TMZ, Corey allowed a friend, Jennifer Herbert, to live in his house, but things went south quickly.  Feldman claims Herbert threatened to hurt him, trash-talked him in front of house guests, and asked his kid  "adult questions. "Corey couldn't just throw Jennifer out, because she's paying rent and therefore is a tenant.  So the restraining order required her to stay 6 feet away from Corey and his kid while in the home.  It appears she violated that order, and as a result Corey's security guard made a citizen's arrest Friday night. Jennifer -- who Corey knew through Michael Jackson -- was taken into custody, Jennifer was released hours later, went back to the house with cops, picked up her stuff and left.  We don't know if she plans to come back./n
