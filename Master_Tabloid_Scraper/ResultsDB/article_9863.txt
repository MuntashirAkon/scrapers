They have since learned that they’re having a little girl, and Audrey is just weeks away from her due date.





 30 weeks!!! Baby girl is healthy and non-stop moving this bumpin belly. I still can't get over how miraculous pregnancy is. I'm so humbled and honored that the Lord would entrust me with this baby to grow, nurturer, instruct, and love. Jeremy and I are getting more and more excited to meet her, but also feeling less and less prepared 😅 We are 10 weeks from my due date (August 31st) and we still don't have anything for baby yet… not to mention our house is currently a construction zone… so we are living with my parents (pictured – also currently a minor construction zone). No shortage of excitement and chaos over here;) #journeyofjerandauj #alwaysmore
