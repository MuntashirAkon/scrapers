'Little People' Drama: Black Sheep Son Jacob Hidden In Wedding Footage/n
Jacob Roloff hates Little People, Big World — but RadarOnline.com can exclusively reveal that he may be starring in episodes of his sister Molly’s wedding!
“Jacob was very involved in helping to get the farm ready for the wedding and in the logistics of the wedding itself,” an insider told Radar, noting that “TLC cameras were rolling the whole time.”
“Jacob drove Molly and her bridal party around in the mule and the cameras were right on them,” the insider added, saying it “would be impossible” to edit him out of the footage!

 Today was on a whole other level. "Just like everyday life except about two feet off the ground." My beautiful, sweet, genius sister got married.  Simple as that, but with a lotta love. I'm still taking it in reviewing the pictures. Molly Jo Silvius.

Jacob, 20, broke away from his parents’ reality show when he turned 18, and recently called the TLC show “fake,” “staged” and “harmful”. He first exposed the Little People, Big World fakery last summer.
