The friends that model together, stay together.

Kendall Jenner was reunited with Bella Hadid on the set of a photo shoot Monday (June 20, 2017). Clad in coordinating colorful pieces, the two had a blast catching up as they posed by a pool at a private residence in Los Angeles.
Mixing business with pleasure, the duo were seen goofing dancing around the set before Kendall whipped out her own Polaroid to take shots of her BFF.

Earlier this month, Kendall showed off her work as a budding photographer. Taking to Twitter, the 21-year-old model shared black-and-white portraits she had taken of her famous friends and family. The snaps included a photo of Bella at Fashion Week, as well as little sister Kylie Jenner holding a cigarette.
Seems like she has a future behind the camera, too!
