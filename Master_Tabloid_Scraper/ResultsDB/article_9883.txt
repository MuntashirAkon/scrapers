Kris Jenner’s temporary restraining order against her alleged stalker Joshua Jacobs was extended over the next three years by a judge on Wednesday.

Jenner obtained a temporary restraining order against Jacobs when he was arrested earlier this month for felony stalking at Jenner’s home. This was the third time that he has been caught in the act by authorities. The ruling on Wednesday (May 24, 2017) extends the order by three more years to protect Jenner and her family. Jacobs is forbidden to coming within 100 yards of Jenner’s home, job, and car, and cannot make personal contact with her, indirectly or directly.
“The Jenner and Kardashian families take their safety very seriously and will vigorously pursue all remedies available to them—both in criminal and civil court—to ensure that they are protected,” Shawn Holley, the family’s attorney, told E! News in the courtroom.

Jacobs remains in police custody with bail set at $150,000. Jenner’s former security guard, who was fired from his post in her gated community, was warned that he is not permitted to obtain any addresses belonging to Jenner’s family members even though he did not appear in court.
An inside source close to Jenner tells E! News that she is “scared” of Jacobs and is still concerned about the safety of her family.
