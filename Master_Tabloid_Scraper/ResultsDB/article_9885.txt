Emma Stone sent regrets to her could-have-been prom date in the cutest way possible.

Jacob Staudenmaier, the Arizona teen who asked her to prom in a La La Land-inspired video, received a boutonniere to wear on his tux and a corsage for his date, Caitlin Teefy, with a personalized note from Stone.
“Jacob,” the actress began. “A little something for you and your lucky date tomorrow. Have a great time! Much love, Emma Stone.”

Staudenmaier’s “promposal” went viral after he shared the video online. During his appearance on Good Morning America, Stademaier revealed that Stone wrote him a note when she finally saw it.
“Jacob, thanks for making the greatest proposal I have ever received,” she wrote to the high school student. “I can’t tell you what an honor that was and how much I smiled through that entire beautifully orchestrated video. I’m in London working, but I hope you have the best time at prom, and I’m grateful you thought of me. Thank you. P.S. I do see Gosling around the eyes. Love, Emma.”
