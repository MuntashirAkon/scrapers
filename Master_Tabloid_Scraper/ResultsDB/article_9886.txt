Kris Jenner’s former security guard, who was fired, has been arrested for felony stalking.

This is apparently the third time that he’s broke into the gated community to try to approach Kris.
TMZ reports:
Law enforcement sources tell TMZ, Joshua Jacobs broke the arm at the security gate in the Hidden Hills gated community where Kris lives. He made it to the front of her house when Kris’ private security detail pounced on the guy and held him until cops arrived.
We’re told Jacobs has repeatedly busted into the development to get at Kris since he was fired from his security job with the gated community.
