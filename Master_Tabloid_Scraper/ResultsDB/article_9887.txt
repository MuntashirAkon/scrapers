It’s that time of the year again when students everywhere trying to find dates for their prom. However, high school junior Jacob Staudenmeier may have just topped everyone’s promposal by asking Oscar winner Emma Stone out in a La La Land-themed video.

The teen, who bares resemblance to Stone’s co-star Ryan Gosling, went viral after proposing the 28-year-old actress attend Arcadia High School’s prom in a musical number inspired by the Oscar-winning movie’s opening sequence. Though Stone had prior commitment, she did send him a sweet note thanking him for the invite, which Staudenmeier read on Good Morning America.
“I have and I have the letter right here,” he said. “Thanks for making the greatest proposal I’ve ever received. I can’t tell you what an honor that was and how much I smiled throughout that beautifully orchestrated video. I’m in London working, but I hope you have the best time at prom and I’m grateful you thought of me. Thank you and P.S., I do see Gosling around the eyes. Love, Emma.”
Here’s to the ones who dream!
