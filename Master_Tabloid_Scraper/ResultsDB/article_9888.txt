Emily Ratajkowski came to Melania Trump’s defense when a New York Times reporter made a private and degrading comment about the First Lady to her at an event.

Ratajkowski spoke up about an incident on Twitter involving her and a journalist from the New York Times who called Trump a “hooker.”
“Sat next to a journalist from the NYT last night who told me ‘Melania is a hooker.’ Whatever your politics it’s crucial to call this out for what it is: slut shaming,” Ratajkowski tweeted. “I don’t care about her nudes or sexual history and no one should.”


Gender specific attacks are disgusting sexist bullshit.

Trump, whose philanthropic platform will be focused on putting an end to cyber-bullying, expressed her gratitude for Ratajkowski’s support.


Applause to all women around the world who speak up, stand up and support other women! @emrata #PowerOfEveryWoman #PowerOfTheFirstLady
