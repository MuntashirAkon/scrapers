Jacob Tremblay may only be 10 years old, but he already knows his biggest life regret.
Look no further than Jacob Tremblay for Hollywood’s biggest Star Wars super-fan.
Tremblay, a self-declared Star Wars fanatic, opened up to PEOPLE about his love for the famous franchise — and the one galactic star he says he was too “starstruck” to meet.
“I saw Harrison Ford,” Tremblay tells PEOPLE Now of seeing the actor at the 2017 Golden Globes. “But I never got to, like, visit him. And that’s like one of my biggest life regrets, ever.”
While he missed his chance to shake hands with Han Solo, he did get a special treat when it came time to see Rogue One.
“I went to an early screening so it was pretty cool that I was one of the first kids to see the Star Wars movie,” he says.
And when asked if he ever gets emotional while watching the films, Tremblay says he “doesn’t really cry” because he’s “really a manly-man.”
Tremblay has long been vocal about his love of the franchise — and it has definitely paid off. The young star has met a handful of his favorite Star Wars actors including Oscar Isaac and Mark Hamill.

But when the Book of Henry star isn’t working or watching Star Wars, he’s likely playing on his Nintendo Switch.
“That’s my favorite thing I have, other than my family and friends” Tremblay says. “It keeps me entertained when I’m on an airplane or I’m bored.”
