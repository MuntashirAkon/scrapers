Wonder Trailer: Jacob Tremblay Introduces New Emotional Tearjerker
/n

Grab some tissues and prepare for the waterworks. With the release of the Wonder trailer comes an introduction to Hollywood’s next emotionally moving tearjerker of a film.
Fans of author R.J. Palacio are already familiar with his story of August “Auggie” Pullman, but the footage introduces the boy to a new audience. Jacob Tremblay, the lovable child star from Room and Before I Wake, plays Auggie, a boy born with facial differences that prevented him from attending public school. This changes when he enters the fifth grade, but his numerous plastic surgeries can’t make him any less of an outcast, while his family offers what support they can.
Already tearing up? Auggie begins to find acceptance when some of his classmates take a chance. “I want some friends for a change,” one says. His emotional journey ends up leaving a mark on the community and proving that “you can’t blend in when you were born to stand out.”
Rounding out the main cast are Julia Roberts and Owen Wilson as Auggie’s parents, Hamilton veteran Daveed Diggs, Mandy Patinkin, and Sonia Braga. Filmmaker Stephen Chbosky, the director behind another tearjerker, The Perks of Being a Wallflower, helms Wonder based on a script from Steve Conrad and Jack Thorne.
 

The film was originally scheduled for release in April, but positive responses from families out of early test screenings prompted a push back to the holiday season, according to EW sources. So, Wonder will be released in theaters on Nov. 17.
