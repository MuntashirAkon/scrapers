Too cute!Room star Jacob Tremblay, 10, recently shared on his Instagram page videos from his first movie audition, which helped him get the role of the boy Blue in the 2013 film Smurfs 2."#TBT Blooper take from my first movie audition taped by my Mom & Dad! Try not to laugh... I couldn't! #Smurfs2 #actorslife #iwasfive @christina.tremblay."In one clip, while rehearsing with his mother, Jacob sticks his tongue out at her and bursts out laughing. Another video shows part of the slate for the audition, which shows the actor introducing himself and stumbling on his words adorably. The partially animated Smurfs 2 also stared Neil Patrick Harris and Glee's Jayma Mays as Blue's parents, as well as The Simpsons' Hank Azaria and Harry Potter star Brendan Gleeson.

He can be seen next in movies such as Burn Your Maps with Vera Farmiga and Wonder with Julia Roberts.
