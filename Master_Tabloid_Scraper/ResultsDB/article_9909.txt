Jacob Tremblay Continues His Tour of Adorableness at the 2016 Oscars/n
Jacob Tremblay may only be nine years old, but he's not afraid to throw down with Hollywood's most iconic actors.While talking to Ryan Seacrest on E!'s Live From the Red Carpet at the 2016 Oscars, the Room star revealed why he was snapped throwing a (fake) punch at Sylvester Stallone at the Academy Awards Luncheon last week."This is a joke," he adorably prefaced about the photo. "I punched him in the face because he took my spot in Best Supporting [category]."What gives, Stallone?! How could you possibly take the spot of the cutest actor in the business right now? (Sorry, Zac Efron).

Sporting the smallest Armani tux ever, Tremblay was all about supporting his Room costar Brie Larson, who is the favorite for her category tonight. And apparently, having Jacob cheering for you is good luck."I watch the Oscars every year and last year I rooted for Eddie Redmayne. And then he won!"Â But our favorite part of Jacob's interview was the sassy response he had to Ryan's question about what his perspective was attending the Oscars at such a young age."I get to see lots of legs. That's my perspective."Never lose that sass, kid!
