Beyond the celebrations for accomplishments in acting, screenwriting, directing, and more honors, there is another achievement at the 2016 Golden Globes we'd like to recognize.Smokin' hot red carpet dates.Like Michael Keaton's handsome son or Sylvester Stallone's gorgeous daughters, the family members of award show stars can often steal the spotlight, and there's a new plus one making the Internet swoon this awards season.While Jacob Tremblay, the 9-year-old star of the film Room, has been winning over viewers in his interviews and with his exceptional acting abilities, his hot dad has also been getting quite a bit of attention at the Golden Globes.The above photo is of Jacob and his father at the 27th Annual Palm Springs International Film Festival Awards Gala on Jan. 2.

May we take a moment to recognize the hotness, please?
