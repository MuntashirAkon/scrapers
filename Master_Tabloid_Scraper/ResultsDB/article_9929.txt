Kanye West: Watch and Learn ... I'm Rich, Bitches!!!/nKanye West wants to make something perfectly clear ... people in massive debt don't sip champagne in super expensive jewelry stores while eyeing ridiculously pricey watches.  Check out the pics we got inside Jacob & Co. Monday night in NYC. The store is known for watches that will set you back the price of a small house. We don't know what Kanye bought, but he's clearly making a point that he's still flush with cash and not $53 million in debt.    / //n
