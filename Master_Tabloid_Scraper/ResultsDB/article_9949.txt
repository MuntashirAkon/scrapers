The 50-year-old dated Missy before tying the knot with de Lesseps, 52, in a lavish New Yearâ€™s Eve ceremony. The former couple appeared on The Real Housewives of New York together at Tinsley Mortimerâ€˜s party for Sonja Morgan, and had a flirty exchange that led to Dâ€™Agostino taking off his microphone.
De Lesseps was confronted with more of Dâ€™Agostinoâ€™s alleged infidelities during the RHONY reunion, and the couple filed for divorce in early August after just eight months of marriage.

Radar first caught the philandering Dâ€™Agostino with a mystery blonde just hours after filing for divorce.
But, de Lesseps isnâ€™t innocent either! Radar spotted the reality star ignoring Dâ€™Agostino to flirt with other men at a charity event just weeks before they separated.
