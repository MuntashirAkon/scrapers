Jared Leto & 30 Seconds To Mars Have Fun With Fashion On The MTV VMAs Red Carpet!/n


Dig it!
Jared Leto, Shannon Leto and Tomo Miličević — AKA 30 Seconds To Mars — cut a stylish rug on the MTV VMAs! We love outlandish mens fashion and this trio did not disappoint!
Tomo went simple with cuffed denim, a black tee, and leather jacket, while Shannon chose ripped jeans and a sick floral bomber.
But the clear standout was Jared, in what we can only describe as the most magical sequin cape ever. We need a twirl from him STAT!
