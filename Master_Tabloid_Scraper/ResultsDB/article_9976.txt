Unlike her sisters, Kendall Jenner hates working out at home.

The 21-year-old model, who was spotted hitting the gym with pal Hailey Baldwin Tuesday, recently took to her app to share how she stays motivated. Though some people may keep a treadmill at home to say focused on their workout plans, Jenner revealed she prefers to take things elsewhere.
“When I feel like I need to get a workout in, I just want to sweat. I’ll have a sudden urge to just get on a treadmill and start running,” she wrote. “But, I don’t like working out in my house—I like to go somewhere else to do it.”

She continued, “In a way, I think that’s what keeps me motivated to go to the gym.”
According to the reality star, her fitness routine involves pushing 150 lbs. weights across 100 feet, doing at least 10 Bulgarian split squats on each of her legs, and performing at least 10 hip raises on a Bosu balance trainer. To top it all off, she admittedly repeats this cycle at least three times to really get a sweat going.
