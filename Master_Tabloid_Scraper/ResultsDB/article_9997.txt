With the help of Sonja Morgan, Luann recounted what they like to do together: travel, ski, etc. But Bethenny Frankel was quick to point out, "That's all lifestyle stuff. They always say you can make a lifestyle out of a life, but you can't make a life out of a lifestyle."Dorinda Medley was quick to jump in about her time with Tom and Luann off camera and alone, but that just served to start an argument about the use of the phrase penthouse."Jesus, we never stop with the penthouse," Bethenny said. "For the viewers at home, no disrespect, it's a one-bedroom apartment on the top floor. We make it like ‘The Trump sprawling penthouse'—It's like get over it."

What's wrong with calling it a penthouse? "It's pretentious as f—k," Bethenny said.The ladies all acknowledged they're happy for Luann that she made it down the aisle. "You seem like a great couple," Carole Radziwill said."Thank you. I have earned it, right? We've earned it," Luann said.Three weeks after this was filmed, Luann announced on Twitter she was divorcing Tom. "It's with great sadness that Tom & I agreed to divorce," she tweeted August 3. "We care for each other very much, hope you respect our privacy during this sad time!"The Real Housewives of New York City airs Wednesdays on Bravo.(E! and Bravo are both part of the NBCUniversal family.)
