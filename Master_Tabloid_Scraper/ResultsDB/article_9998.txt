"Peter, are you hiding something?" the casting director asked, reading a line from the prompt."With great power comes great responsibility," said Holland, quoting a previous Spider-Man film while wearing a Batman mask and mimicking Christian Bale's turn as the DC Comics hero. "Are you doing Batman?" she asked, to which Holland (in character), replied, "Where is she?""OK, that's not even the right cinematic universe," the woman said."Yes, it is," Holland argued. The casting director replied, "No, it's definitely not.""You're wrong. It is," Holland said. "There's been crossovers. There has. I've seen them.""Tom, if you keep doing this, we're going to get sued," the casting director said."I have so much money," the actor said, ignoring her warning. "I'm Batman."

Â After reviewing Holland's audition tapes, Horowitz appeared to be in a state of disbelief. "Tom, I don't want you to take this the wrong way," the host said, "but you are a horrible auditioner.""Shut up or I'll break you," Holland said, still channeling Batman. "I was born in the darkness!"In reality, he spent months auditioning for the role, even screen testing with Robert Downey Jr., who plays Iron Man, and Chris Evans, who plays Captain America. "I had been auditioning for about five months, and after my final audition they said, 'You'll find out tomorrow," Holland recalled on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in May. "Fast forward six weeks, I was still waiting, still waiting, and one day Marvel just posted on their Instagram, 'Go to our website to find out who the new Spider-Man is. And that's it. I just found out online. They didn't call me up or anything."
