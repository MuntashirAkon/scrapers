Donald Trump Fires Top White House Strategist Steve Bannon!
Why the 'prima donna' staffer was on his way out!
Steve Bannon has been fired as  President Trump's chief strategist — just weeks after The National ENQUIRER revealed that the controversial White House staffer was about to get booted! The ENQUIRER had the scoop on how both Sean Spicer and Bannon were set to be dumped by the outraged President — who's furious over a series of leaks and strategic blunders. The firing comes after a controversial week where Trump was accused of insufficiently condemning Nazis holding a deadly rally in Charlottesville, Va.. White House sources had blamed Bannon for urging Trump to condemn "both sides" in the conflict. But insiders had already told The ENQUIRER that Trump was tired of tolerating Bannon as a top aide — describing the strategist as a “prima donna and a leaker of almost unthinkable proportions.” The source said: “Steve has been instrumental in honing the president’s policy platform, of taking his vision of America and the globe, and translating it into legislation. But there’s a lot to put up with when it comes to Steve!" The insider added that Trump was also furious over "Steve’s attempts to advance his own agenda through unsourced statements in the press.” The firing of Bannon and Spicer reportedly won't be the end of Trump's big house cleaning, either. "[Trump] is accustomed to the business world where CEOs’ orders are actually obeyed," said the D.C. source, "and people maintain their positions based on their failure or success. There’s been one screw-up after another — and the hammer is about to fall!”
Kim Jong-un Aims Nukes At D.C. In Shocking New Poster!
Shocking image follows video of White House being destroyed!
Kim Jong-un has backed off from threats of bombing Guam — but a shocking new propaganda poster shows North Korea nuking Washington, D.C.! This disturbing image was released by the North Korean News Agency on Aug. 17, showing 11 North Korean nuclear missiles destroying the U.S. Capitol building! The print underneath simply reads: "Our Answer!" But that's not the only new threat from the North Korean madman! The new military threats have been released in the wake of China joining Russia in asking Kim Jong-un to avoid "an incident on our doorstep" — after President Trump warned the North Korean leader that the U.S. military is “locked and loaded” to hit the country with “fire and fury.”
Barack Obama: Secret D.C. War Room To Torpedo Trump
Bitter ex-prez and deep-state cronies plot treasonous revenge!
Barack Obama — mounting a vicious campaign to sabotage President Donald Trump — is operating a secret “war room” just two miles from the White House! In a bombshell world exclusive, sources told The National ENQUIRER the puppet master- in-chief’s bunker is buried deep behind the unassuming brick walls of an $8.1 million mansion — just down the street from where the president’s daughter Ivanka lives with her hubby, Jared Kushner! “This war room is how they’re trying to topple Trump!” said D.C. insider Dick Morris, who is The ENQUIRER’s political columnist. Sources have told The ENQUIRER Trump’s predecessor convenes twice-daily meetings of “Deep State” operatives — top Democrats and members of the “underground Trump resistance” — in the bunker built in one of the capital’s ritziest neighborhoods. “They meet there on two conference calls … [at] 8:30 and 9:45 a.m.,” Morris told The ENQUIRER. “And they develop talking points for the media for the day for how to sabotage and undermine Trump. All of the key players are on that conference call.” Sources said the war room acts as a nerve center for Obama to command a 32,525-member army of foot soldiers, united under a network of left-leaning nonprofits, specifically Organizing for Action (OFA) — a 250-chapter national group created after Trump’s election as a successor to Organizing for America, which rallied grassroots support for Obama while he still occupied the Oval Office. The new group is behind countless protests over Trump’s policies — including violent incidents that followed the introduction of the president’s ban on travel from Muslim countries linked to terrorism. “The war room is where Obama moves these soldiers around the chessboard of America in a complex game of sabotage,” said our source. ENQUIRER contributor and renowned political maverick Roger Stone added: “The Obamas are desperate to return to power. Barack intends to insert his wife as president ... and he knows he has to remove Donald Trump in order to do so! They think that in a Trump takedown, they will discredit [VP Mike] Pence, making him an easy target for Michelle [Obama].” Sources told The ENQUIRER Obama presides at the meetings over a rogues’ gallery of former advisors — including senior advisor Valerie Jarrett (center), former U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius; Andy Slavitt, who headed up  Medicare and Medicaid efforts; Jeanne Lambrew, one of Obamacare’s chief architects, and even Michelle. Lately, the conspiracy has been focused on obliterating Trump’s efforts to muster enough votes to save America from the disaster of Obamacare, sources told The ENQUIRER. Obama’s next move is to direct the destruction of Trump’s tax reform plan from his secret nerve center. But the war room is only the tip of the poisonous spear! Obama directs a vast network of moles, who have burrowed into the Trump administration and actively leak lies, rumors and fake news to media outlets. “He’s also the brains behind the Russia witch hunt,” said a highly placed source. The ENQUIRER first reported that the ex-president was orchestrating a coordinated conspiracy to sabotage the Trump administration — and, ultimately, impeach the president. In that earth-shattering exclusive, The ENQUIRER quoted a left-leaning whistle-blower who stepped out of the shadows to expose the revolt. At the time he said, “These acts of defiance ... may seem independently accomplished, but that’s precisely how they’re intended to be seen. “In reality, each one is part of a coordinated campaign to destroy the Trump administration. I was there when they planned it.” The turncoat told The ENQUIRER the Obama-directed conspiracy was launched after the election last fall. It was clear “[Obama’s] agenda and orders were to be carried out,” said the source. “He is the tarantula at the center of this web.”

James Alex Fields, Jr.: Secrets Of Ohio Man Who Ran Down Rally Protesters
Suspect seen holding shield for hate group before attack!
James Alex Fields, Jr. — the man who disrupted a white nationalist demonstration in Charlottesville, Virginia — is a former U.S. military man turned Nazi lover with deep admiration for Adolf Hitler! Fields, Jr. smashed his black Dodge Challenger into a line of cars causing a chain reaction that that killed one person and injured at least 19 others with five critically injured. The lone fatality was identified as Heather Heyer, a 32-year-old Paralegal who worked in the city. The incident occurred after police had cleared Emancipation Park where a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee stands. The decision to have the monument removed drew earlier protests by the Ku Klux Klan and other sympathizers. Fields, Jr. has been charged with one count of "second-degree murder," three counts of "malicious wounding," and one count related to "leaving the scene of a crime." The suspect is scheduled to appear in a Virginia courtroom on Monday. He had recently moved to Ohio last year from his native Kentucky. His mother, Samantha Bloom, said she knew her son was traveling to a protest in Virginia, but did not know it was a white supremacist rally. "I thought it had something to do with Trump. Trump's not a white supremacist," said Bloom. “I try to stay out of his political views. I don’t get too involved.” &nbsp;

Military records list Fields, Jr. joining the U.S. Army on August 18, 2015. His active duty concluded in early December, less than four months after reporting for boot camp, for reasons still unknown! His Facebook page contained much Nazi imagery — such as a baby picture of Adolf Hitler — along with a photo of him posing with the car he used as his murder weapon and was taken down hours later. The Charlottesville crash suspect was spotted carrying a shield representing the neo-Nazi hate group "Vanguard America" just hours before the attack! The group released a statement via Twitter claiming he was, "in no way, a member of Vanguard America," and admitted the shields were handed out freely to anybody who wanted one.

 &nbsp;

"We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence, on many sides. On many sides," said President Donald Trump upon hearing news of the carnage. He also tweeted, "We ALL must be united &amp; condemn all that hate stands for. There is no place for this kind of violence in America. Lets come together as one!" Attorney General Jeff Sessions stated federal authorities will pursue a civil rights investigation into the circumstances surrounding the incident and if Fields, Jr. crossed state lines with the intent to commit violence.
MS-13: Tattooed Maniacs Wild In The Streets
Notorious gang is cruel, greedy, barbaric and bloodthirsty!
The "MS-13" street gang has turned America’s Latin neighborhoods into war zones, but the El Salvador-spawned outlaws messed with the wrong guy — fed-up President Donald Trump! As one of his first orders of business, Trump unleashed federal lawmen on the MS-13 butchers — who are frequently illegal aliens from Central American nations — and demanded an end to the reign of urban terror marked by public beheadings and terrible torture. The response was swift — and devastating! By summer, the gang suffered “a huge blow” when 41 tattoo-covered thugs were collared on Long Island in New York for a string of 32 grisly slayings and “a horrific frenzy of violence.” Authorities say four of the New York victims were hacked to death as “initiation killings” after they were lured into a park by sexpots connected with the machete-wielding outlaws, whose chilling motto is “kill, rape, control.” Savagery and slaughter have allowed the 10,000-member gang to spread across the U.S. from L.A., where the Salvadorans first banded together to protect themselves from American thugs like the "Crips" and the "Bloods." Eventually, MS-13 spread to Washington, D.C., New York and America’s heartland. No one is exempt from their terror — especially members who have betrayed the gang. Last January in D.C., a 17-year- old gangbanger, Jose Cerrato, made a cell phone video of members plunging knifes and a sharp stake into a 15-year-old girl, Damaris Alexandra Reyes Rivas. They believed the girl, who belonged to a rival crew, lured 21-year-old MS-13 thug Christian Sosa Rivas to his death. The slaughter video was to be sent to the MS-13 ruling council in El Salvador, which ordered her death. In another recent slaying, MS-13 monsters shot Jeremy Jerome Jackson, a 30-year-old Jackson, Miss., resident, in the leg before chopping off his head and planting it on his front porch — a terrifying warning to the neighborhood! And in San Francisco, 48-year-old Anthony Bologna and his sons Michael and Matthew were shot dead by MS-13 killer Edwin Ramos because they accidentally blocked his car! Sentenced to life behind bars, Ramos was cheered “as a man of respect” by other gang members as he arrived in prison. &nbsp;

MS-13 creepsters are usually teens “who have no problem hacking somebody up with a machete or knocking someone’s brains out with a bat or sledgehammer,” said Suffolk County, N.Y., Sheriff Vincent DeMarco. Recruits first must pass a brutal hazing ritual where they are beaten by other gang members before carrying out a violent mission ordered by one of the bosses. Members who want to leave the gang and start a family are forced to pay hefty fines to “buy their freedom.” One California member, who wanted to quit, was told if he didn’t pay the freedom fee, he’d be forced to watch his children tortured to death. “The violence is shocking,” psychiatrist Dr. Carole Lieberman tells The National ENQUIRER. “Society has grown used to the idea there are gangs and people will be killed, but it’s the inhumanity that crosses the line.” “The reality is we’re all living in a panic. You live with fear. I feel terrorized!” said Maria Estrada of Islip, N.Y. While the gang is involved in burglaries, auto theft, human trafficking, prostitution and other crimes, members often work as car washers, restaurant workers, landscapers and other low-paying jobs. In the evenings, they must “put in work” committing crimes or hunting down enemies. President Trump blames MS-13’s rise on former President Barack Obama’s “weak illegal immigration policies.” He’s promised to close “dangerous loopholes and liberate” towns from the scourge of MS-13.
Vladimir Putin's American Love Slave Tells All
Russian strong-man checked his "E.D." at pharmacy door!
Russia's macho strong-man Vladimir Putin has to pop Viagra before bed-room romps — and the little blue pill turns him into a rampaging sex machine! That’s the bombshell revelation learned by The National ENQUIRER from the Russian president's former mistress who shockingly admits, “I was Vladimir Putin’s American love slave!” Tracked down by The ENQUIRER with the help of a CIA informant and identifying herself by the pseudonym "Anna," the busty, 36-year-old blond bombshell said she was the kinky Kremlin kingpin’s playmate from 2012 to 2014 and proceeded to rip the lid off the 64-year-old election meddler’s most intimate secrets. Shockingly, she insists “Vladie,” known for ruthlessly rubbing out rivals, can be a sensitive pussycat who bursts into tears! “My Vladie, the one I love, is not the man the world knows,” she says. “He is a different man to those who truly know him. He is a soft-spoken, emotional soul who sent me flowers, quoted Pushkin poetry and, yes, even cried once after sex!” Unlike the formal meetings he's held with U.S. President Donald Trump, she says the dictator got into the mood with romantic records by French songbird Edith Piaf and American recording icon Tony Bennett. Vlad also guzzled German beer, which resulted in erectile dysfunction and forced him to take drugs in order to perform. “He was unapologetic and candid about his problem,” says Anna, an American citizen of Eastern European descent. “But the pills would turn him insatiable.” Their affair began in Paris when he held an unofficial meeting with French bigwigs, she says. At the time, Vlad was still wed to Lyudmila Shkrebneva (right), a former Aeroflot flight attendant and mom of his daughters Mariya, 32, and Yekaterina, 30. After the Paris hook-up, he would arrange torrid trysts throughout Europe and Russia. As in his dalliance with buxom pin-up Pamela Anderson, Vlad demanded absolute secrecy. “He knew what people would think if he was caught carrying on with an American," she said. "I am putting him at a terrible risk with the way relations are between our two countries, but I want the world to know the tender man I still love.”

Donald Trump Sex Scandal — Top Staffers' Baby Mama Drama!
Conservative pundit gives birth — and married former spokesman's the dad!
Donald Trump's administration was hit with a sex scandal before he even took office — and now his original White House communications director is being blasted by his conservative pundit baby mama! Commentator A.J. Delgado gave up writing about politics to join the Trump team in the Trump presidential campaign in 2016. That's when she met married Trump staffer Jason Miller. The couple first made headlines when they showed up at a Las Vegas strip club together the night before their boss' debate with Hillary Clinton — and Delgado later ruined Miller's career after he got her pregnant! Miller was set to be Trump's original White House Communications Director after his stunning victory over Hillary. Delgado, however, went public with a social media blast where she congratulated her married “baby-daddy” on getting the job — before calling him the “2016 version of John Edwards.” The media quickly picked up on Delgado's reference to the disgraced Edwards, the former Senator whose own presidential ambitions were crushed when he was caught cheating on his wife by The National ENQUIRER. The married Miller soon resigned as it was confirmed that Delgado was pregnant with his child — and now she's blasting her baby daddy again! Miller went to the New York Post's "Page Six" column to congratulate Delgado after she announced she'd given birth to their son on July 10, saying: "“My wife and I, along with our two daughters, are excited to welcome William into the world and into our family." Delgado, however, says that's news to her! "I'm not sure what Jason means that he and his wife are excited to welcome Will," said Delgado. "Really? News to me." The pundit also isn't happy with detractors who mocked her as an "immoral" hypocrite for sleeping with the married Miller even as conservatives mocked Hillary for helping her husband Bill Clinton cover up his compulsive womanizing! "I dated someone who was separated (or at least said he was)," said Delgado. "What part of that is immoral?" And to make matters worse for Miller, Delgado is promising that this is just the start of her going public about their affair!
Trump Advisor Sex Scandal — Paul Manafort's Sick Affair
Target in FBI-Russia probe also cheated with woman half his age!
Just as President Donald Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort had his offices raided by FBI agents probing Russian intervention in the 2016 presidential race, the career lobbyist has been rocked by a sleazy sex scandal in which he was caught cheating on his wife — with a hottie younger than his own daughters! That’s the shocking revelation of The National ENQUIRER investigation that exposed Manafort, 68, as a tawdry adulterer — who wore his wedding ring while romping with his 33-year-old mistress in the bedroom he shares with his wife! Desperate to save his 39-year marriage to Kathleen (right), 64, the cheating cad splashed out $18,000 on therapy to avoid airing his dirty laundry in a public divorce, sources said. “President Trump has been focused on draining the swamp in Washington, D.C.,” a White House insider said. “Meanwhile, one of his trusted advisers was bedding another woman behind his wife’s back, betraying her and his country!” The seedy affair began in early 2014, and smutty details surfaced when text messages from Paul’s daughter were hacked and leaked on the “dark web” — an untraceable part of the internet. In text messages seen by The ENQUIRER, Andrea Manafort ranted: “He’s been taking THIS W--RE on trips instead of my mom" Andrea, 32, also sent angry texts to sister Jessica, a 35-year-old filmmaker, and other messages detailed how Paul brazenly took his squeeze to the same spots he frequented with Kathleen! “He has taken her on his playlist of places,” Andrea raged. “As in like the restaurant he celebrates my mom’s bday every year w(sic) her. The place they went on their honeymoon too. All their restaurants they go to when they go to Paris for decades.” According to another source: “The worst part was Paul would sleep with her in the master bedroom of the family home! He would leave his wedding ring on, too!” During the affair, the dirty dog splashed out a fortune on his honey — whose identity is being withheld for privacy reasons — organizing private jets, multiple trips overseas and paying for a Manhattan love nest. The couple also snuck off to Europe twice in 2014, and he rented his sweetie a summer house less than a mile from his family home in the Hamptons. Paul — a key man in the government’s probe of Russian interference in the presidential election — even pulled strings to get her a job. “There are clearly skeletons in his closet, but Paul is happily married now,” a source said. “But when he was warned about the messages being leaked on the dark web, he went into damage control mode — yet foolishly reached out to his mistress again!”
