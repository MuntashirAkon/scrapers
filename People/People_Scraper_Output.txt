Taylor Swift's Reputation Look Will Set You Back $3,595


Well, the day of pop culture reckoning is finally upon us. At midnight on Friday Taylor Swift released her first single from Reputation unto the world, “Look What You Made Me Do,” and her fandom is already shook, to say the least. And it seems Tay has now really opened the floodgates of content as not only did she drop a lyric video for her latest guaranteed hit, she also revealed that the song’s music video will premiere at the VMAs on Sunday and she has not one, but two, “magazines” that will be released exclusively at Target. And it turns out every die-hard Swiftie can now perfectly replicate their favs reinvention look, if they’re willing to max out their credit card that is.
In the first moody shot that serves as the cover for Volume 2 of Reputation magazine, Swift glances over her shoulder wearing her hair down and with its natural texture, opting for a dark burgundy lip, a big change from her usual shade of super bright orange-red. But the really surprising decision in this shot is the singer’s choice in jacket, a long, hooded camo piece from Marc Jacobs‘ Resort 2017 covered in appliqués and sequin embellishment. And Tay’s new outerwear can be yours to the tune of $1,500.

But if you want to go full new bad girl Taylor, you’re going to need more than a super pricey jacket, you’re also going to need a pair of these bank account-busting boots.

For the Volume 1 cover of the magazine that accompanies her album, Taylor tried out a very different, very orange look. In this shot, the pop star tests out a very dramatic cat eye paired with a simple black sweatshirt with super long sleeves and black short shorts paired with thigh-high black boots.

The boots in question look to be Gianvito Rossi “Suede Cuissard Boots,” and if you thought that Marc Jacobs jacket was pricey, these shoes are about to blow that out of the water, retailing for almost double the outerwear’s cost at $2,095. Given that Taylor’s known to cause everything she wears to sell out overnight, we have a feeling there’s going to be a whole lot of Swifties who are going to look at their credit card statement next month and think, “look what you made me do.”
What do you think of Taylor’s new look? Are you a fan or do you prefer her old look? Sound off below!

A Complete History of Taylor Swift at the MTV Video Music Awards



 
While Taylor Swift can claim one of the most iconic MTV Video Music Awards moments ever, her history with the show spans red carpet slays, buzzworthy performances and, of course, cameos from her famous squad. Scroll down to immerse yourself in every major moment of Taylor Swift at the VMAs as you prepare yourself for the “Look What You Made Me Do” music video premiere at Sunday’s show.
Taylor made her first VMAs appearance in 2008, resplendent in fluffy curls and a sweet white dress. It was the perfect VMAs debut look for America’s newest country sweetheart.

The singer kicked off her VMAs career on a strong note, interviewing celebs on the red carpet. Oh, and did we mention that she was nominated for the artist to watch category alongside Katy Perry and Miley Cyrus?

In 2009, Taylor’s return to the VMAs was even more exciting: She rolled up in a literal carriage, because why not, and made us all instantly question why we wanted cars for our 16th birthdays.

Of course, 2009 was also the year that Kanye West famously stagecrashed Taylor Swift after she won the best female video award for “You Belong with Me.”

The singer handled the shocking moment with grace, and in 2013, Vanity Fair even revealed that she has a framed photo of the incident in her house.

Believe it or not, her night wasn’t over yet.

Swift performed “You Belong with Me” on a moving subway (which might be the most glamorous thing to ever happen on the subway).

Swift capped off one heckuva eventful night when Beyoncé brought her up to give her back her moment.

How do you follow up an awards show like that? In 2010, Taylor was back to perform “Innocent,” which was inspired by the previous year’s interruption. “I think a lot of people expected me to write a song about him. But for me it was important to write a song to him,” she told New York magazine of West.

The emotional performance included a clip from the stagecrash and a barefoot Swift.

Taylor went on a brief VMAs hiatus, returning to the awards show in 2012. With freshly chopped bangs and now-signature lipstick, the singer was beginning to usher in the Red era.

Of course, she took to the stage (in stripes!) to perform “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together.”

Take a moment to relive the glory that’s now a half-decade old.

The next year, Taylor walked the carpet in an ultra form-fitting navy gown and faux bob. (A sign of haircuts to come?)

In 2013, she also scooped up a best female video award for “I Knew You Were Trouble.”

Taylor didn’t slow down in 2014, walking the carpet in sky-high heels and a blue romper.

She was about to drop her fifth studio album, 1989, and performed a very sparkly rendition of “Shake It Off.”

Seriously. We will never be over the spangly two-piece and the tux-clad dancers.

However, nothing could ever prepare us for Taylor’s 2015 entrance. She was nominated for “Bad Blood,” so it only made sense that she brought her squad as her date(s).

Speaking of “Bad Blood,” yes, it won the video of the year honor.

She also took to the stage to perform a “The Night Is Still Young/ Bad Blood” mash-up with Nicki Minaj. (The performance squashed any rumors of beef between the two musicians, who got in a Twitter tiff ahead of the awards over a lack of diversity among nominees.)

The singer capped off her night by presenting Kanye West with the iconic Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award.

Taylor opted out of the 2016 awards, which means we are waiting anxiously to see when she’ll be back at the show — perhaps a special appearance Sunday?

Right Said Fred Loves Taylor Swift’s ‘Marvelous’ New Track and ‘I’m Too Sexy’ Sample: ‘It Is Very Flattering’

Taylor Swift‘s got a whole new sound with her savage new single, “Look What You Made Me Do.” But if the baseline on the track’s chorus sounds familiar, that’s probably because it’s been sampled from Right Said Fred’s 1991 dance-floor delight “I’m Too Sexy.”
The British band — made up of brothers Fred and Richards Fairbrass and guitarist Rob Manzoli — lent their biggest hit to Swift and her longtime pal Jack Antonoff, who co-wrote the brooding new track with the “Shake It Off” singer.
They couldn’t be more thrilled either, expressing their gratitude on Twitter towards Swift as the song debuted late Thursday night. “Thank you @taylorswift13,” the band — who also have writing credits on the song — wrote. “What a marvelous reinvention! #imtoosexy #lookwhatyoumademedo.”

But how did one of the ’90s biggest one-hit-wonders find their way onto a track with one of today’s most decorated stars? PEOPLE went right to the source, asking Richard Fairbrass all the Swifties’ burning questions about the collaboration.
How did this come about? Did Taylor contact you personally?
No. We had people on the phone from the U.S. just checking that we were okay for her to use it and that we were cool with it and weren’t going to kick up a fuss  — which, obviously, we didn’t. Fred and I have always been of the view that it’s the song that is the most important thing and musicians should always stick together because if we start to get a bit angry with each other that’s when it gets a bit depressing.
In all fairness to Taylor, she doesn’t know what we’re like. We might be complete idiots. She’s probably up to her chin with work, so the last thing she probably wants to do is pick up a phone from a distance to us. So she got one of her team to handle it.

Did she thank you for agreeing?
She said she is going to send us a prezzie but I don’t know what that is. She and everyone around her have been great.
How did it feel to get a writing credit?
A simple thing like having a writing credit — they didn’t have to do that. They could have been more difficult about that and they were absolutely cool right from the beginning about everything, so thank you to Taylor and all of her people.
In fact, the only time I thought about money was when a friend of mine said, ‘Well, you’ve got a writing credit on the album, that’s going to make you a few quid.’ It hadn’t even crossed my mind. I didn’t even think about it for a second. Then the moment he said it I thought, ‘Of course! Yeah, you’re right!’
Was it hard to keep the secret?
It was a bit weird. I wasn’t allowed to tweet and I wasn’t allowed to do this and I wasn’t allowed to do that… There are lots of musicians we are working with and we had to keep them on board and come up with shows for next year, so we had to imply that there was something happening this summer that would help shows without letting anything on, even when they were asking ‘Who is it, who is it!’ We couldn’t say who it was or what was happening, so that was a bit weird and frustrating. So I am actually quite happy that it’s now in the open and we can get on with it.

How much did you know about the track?
We did know she was going to use it but we didn’t know exactly how she was going to use it. I had no idea what to expect. My personal favorite of her stuff is her earlier stuff  — the more country-driven stuff, so I wasn’t sure what I was going to hear.
Were you nervous Thursday night before the release?
I’m quite philosophical. When we first started, everything was important but in the end I just got tired of treating everything that way. I am much more philosophical these days. I slept really well last night. I watched a couple of movies and didn’t really think about it.
What do you think of the song?
 I am more than happy with it. She used the rhythm as much as anything. It’s flattering. When we recorded “Sexy” I didn’t think it would last more than six months. So to be talking about it 26 years later and a star like Taylor using it and being influenced by it is really flattering. Absolutely flattering.

And its dark tone?
Although we sold it in a rather ridiculous way, “I’m Too Sexy” itself is quite cynical. My brother was dating an American model at the time and she was really full of herself, so the song was about the ludicrous nature of people who think they’re incredibly attractive and the nonsense that comes with it.
What’s interesting is that the original song was cynical and so is the adaptation that Taylor Swift has done. And I like that about it. I like the fact it is dark and cynical and she seems to be drawing a line under her previous manifestation and who she is now. I think that’s very refreshing.
The title sounds like a horror movie. It’s got that sort of remotely threatening, very dark feel. And I really like the lyric. The lyric is really good because it’s dark and cynical and not at all fluffy. I think that’s really cool because my brother and I tend to be dark and cynical when we’re together, so I kind of gravitated to that.
As she declares in the song, the old Taylor Swift is “dead.” What do you think about the new one? 
What I like about Taylor Swift is that she’s edgy. I like the fact that she’s edgy and she’s discussing who she is at that particular moment in time. There’s too much smoke in this business and it’s nice to see through it from time to time.
She’s obviously drawing a line under the person she feels she was and the person she has decided to become. To be a single girl in the music business in America is tough. It’s not easy. I just hope she’s got a couple of really close friends she can rely on in amongst this.

Why do you think “I’m Too Sexy” is so enduring?
When we play “Sexy” live it is always the one that makes people smile. When you start it people immediately cheer up. It has just got that kind of vibe.
Are you re-releasing the song?
We are not re-releasing the original but we are, in a week-or-two, releasing a celebration EP with a remix and couple of new tracks. We put a band together this year and did a few festivals and are hoping to do 30-40 festivals next year. I didn’t think I would enjoy touring with a live band as much as I did. I loved it and the band for the first time is making the sound we’ve always wanted to make.
Anything you want to say to Taylor?
Thank you is obviously the first thing. It is very flattering to be approached in this way. She and all her representatives have been incredibly polite and supportive. There has never once been a situation where e-mails haven’t been answered or we couldn’t get people on the phone. None of that. They have been really, really cool. We’ve been in the business a long time and met a lot of people who aren’t particularly lovely, but I have to say that Taylor and all her people have been absolutely fantastic.

Taylor Swift’s ‘Look What You Made Me Do’ Video to Debut at the MTV VMAs: See a Sneak Peek!


Taylor Swift‘s music videos are always epic, and the one for her new single “Look What You Made Me Do” will likely be no different.
The star gave her fans a sneak peek of the upcoming Joseph Kahn- directed video on Good Morning America hours after releasing the song, which is her first solo single in three years.
The sneak peek featured flashes of her upcoming video, including a shot of a car crash, a shot of a woman in a red dress and Swift — her hair in all its curly glory — standing in a black ensemble in front of a group of dancers. One shot also featured Swift biting on a diamond necklace.
Co-written by the “Shake It Off” singer, 27, and her longtime pal Jack Antonoff (who also produced several tracks off her last album 1989), the dark, biting tracks appears to clap back at Kanye West, Katy Perry and the critical public.

Five versions of the album will be available to fans, and each will contain an exclusive double-sided poster with new art of Swift. A special-edition Target edition will also be released that contains around 70 pages of exclusive content.

The singer announced the release of her new album in a series of Instagram posts on Wednesday. Swift also debuted the black and white cover art, featuring the star sporting her signature dark lip, as well as slicked-back hair and a sweatshirt, with mock newspaper headlines and columns superimposed over part of her face.

On Monday morning, Swift sent the internet into a frenzy by sharing a mysterious 10-second video on her social media accounts — her first posts since her accounts were scrubbed on Friday. The distorted, silent clip appeared to depict a snake tail.
A second, longer clip — with another piece of the tail — went up early Tuesday. In a third clip, which went up at 10 a.m. Wednesday, the head of what turned out to be a serpent was revealed.
The full music video will premiere during the MTV Video Music Awards on Sunday.
 

Nicki Minaj Tweets ‘Be Humble’ After Taylor Swift Drops New Single — and Fans Are Going Nuts


Music fans sure do love a good beef.
Nicki Minaj raised eyebrows Thursday night when she sent out a simple tweet that some speculated might be about Taylor Swift, who dropped her highly anticipated new single “Look What You Made Me Do” that same night.
“N—- sit down. Be humble,” the 34-year-old tweeted, referencing Kendrick Lamar‘s hit track “Humble.”
Minaj did not name Swift in the tweet, and it’s unclear whether the post was a jab at the 27-year-old singer at all. But that didn’t stop the Barbz — and the Swifties — from questioning whether the stars’ feud had been reignited.
Many fans replied to the tweet with gifs of Swift, and some even mentioned the “Bad Blood” singer’s handle, including a simple question mark.
Others posted snake emojis — a digital icon that has plagued Swift since her headline-making feud with Kanye West came to a head last year thanks to Kim Kardashian West.

“This is for @taylorswift13,” one person replied to the post.
The speculation comes about two years after Minaj and Swift famously feuded when the rapper spoke out about her lack of a nomination for video of the year at the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards, attributing the snub to racism in the music industry.
Swift, who among the artists who were nominated, responded to Minaj’s tweet, accusing the star of pitting “women against each other.”
Minaj noted that she made no mention of the “Style” singer, and Swift changed her tune, quickly calling a truce in a follow-up post, writing, “If I win, please come up with me!!” (Swift ended up taking home the award.)
Swift later tweeted an apology to the rap star, writing that she “missed the point” of Minaj’s tweets. The two seemed to put all the “Bad Blood” behind them, and Swift joined Minaj on the VMA stage in a show-stopping performance.
However, Minaj seemed to fuel beef rumors in recent months when she hopped on Katy Perry‘s apparent Swift diss track “Swish Swish” — Perry and Swift have been feuding for years.
