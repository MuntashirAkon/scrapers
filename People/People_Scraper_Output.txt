James Corden Says Chester Bennington's Family Has Final Say Over Linkin Park Carpool Karaoke Episode Airing



Less than a week before his untimely death, Linkin Park frontman Chester Bennington joined the band for a filming of an episode of Carpool Karaoke: The Series. But whether the episode ever sees the light of day will be “completely” up to Bennington’s family.
On Tuesday, Late Late Show host and Carpool Karaoke executive producer James Corden told the Associated Press that Bennington’s family will be consulted about the episode’s future.
“We will approach it in whichever manner his family or the people that were involved in that episode, however they would like it to be handled,” he said. “We will navigate it as delicately as possible and just adhere to whatever wishes they would want because I don’t think there’s any other way we could deal with it, really.”
“It’s completely up to them and that’s a conversation we haven’t even thought about having right now,” he added, calling the singer’s death “a tragedy.”

Corden’s message was appreciated by Bennington’s widow, Talinda — who thanked him for his words on Twitter.
Bennington, 41, was found dead in his Palos Verdes Estates home on July 20 by a housekeeper — the L.A. County Coroner’s Office confirmed to PEOPLE days later that Bennington committed suicide.
A father of six, Bennington joined the Grammy-winning band in 1999. They released their most recent album, One More Light, in May.

Carpool Karaoke: The Series — a 16-episode standalone show based on Corden’s popular Late Late Show segment — premiered on Tuesday on Apple Music.

The outpouring of love and kindness I’ve received from friends and from all over the world has been incredible,” wrote Farrell in a series of tweets.
“I wish I could personally thank every one of you for your love and support,” he continued. “A huge part of Chester’s legacy will be the memories we hold of him in our hearts. He was an enthusiastic, playful father, an honest, passionate musician, and a loyal friend.”
On Aug. 2, Chris Martin honored Bennington with a moving cover of Linkin Park’s Grammy-winning song “Crawling” — telling the audience at Coldplay’s concert in East Rutherford, New Jersey that “This is for anybody who’s missing someone.”

'Keeps His Memory Alive': Chester Bennington Mural Memorializes Linkin Park Singer



Days after his funeral was held in Rancho Paolo Verdes, California, fans are continuing to pay tribute to Chester Bennington in creative and artistic ways.
One of the latest memorials to receive attention was a 20-foot mural painted on the back of a newly opened pizzeria in Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles.
It took local muralist Jonas Never, 35, just two days to create the mural with spray cans and house paint, the artist told Variety.
“I used to take the pitching mound to the sound of ‘One Step Closer,’ ” said the former baseball player-turned-artist, who worked with artists Kryst and Kub to complete the piece. “When I heard Chester died, I immediately thought of that wall because I knew some of the band members lived in the Valley. I just texted Jim and offered to do it for free because it was the right thing to do.”
“I really didn’t want people to forget about Chester, his music… everything,” Never wrote to Entertainment Weekly over email. “I’d seen the wall while I was painting a couple other murals out there, but I hadn’t been able to think of a subject matter worthy of the visibility from the 101. Soon as I heard the news of his passing, I was like, ‘Oh man, that’s the spot,’ especially since the 101 is the way his bandmates would go back home to Agoura.”
Adds Kryst, “The relationship to Linkin Park’s music that I have goes way back as I went to school with [guitarist] Brad [Delson]’s brother and have friends who are really close with them. [Bennington’s death] hit really close to home. It made us proud that they made it and were very successful and getting the recognition they deserved. Because it hit close to home, I reached out to Jonas about doing a mural of him which he responded with, ‘I have a wall already. Let’s do it!’”
The depiction of a shirtless and smiling Bennington — painted on the rock-themed pizza restaurant Rock’n Pies — is visible from the 101 freeway near the Coldwater Canyon exit.
“I’d been seeing that big blank wall from the 101 and thought it would be good for something,” said Never, who also created a mural of Foo Fighters frontman Dave Grohl for the front of the pizzeria.
With the blessing of Jim Connors, the owner of Rock’n Pies, Never and his team got to work. “I’ve been thrilled to see the reaction and hopefully the mural will keep his memory alive and give family, fans, and friends a place where they can kind of ‘visit’ him,” he told EW.
The image was created over the course of two days, with Kryst and Kub completing the background work against Never’s image of Bennington. “I knew it was finished once we put the white glow around him…then it all made sense,” Kryst told Variety.

A post shared by Rock'n Pies Pizza Los Angeles🍕 (@rocknpies) on Jul 28, 2017 at 8:49pm PDT


Last week Rock’n Pies shared a photo on Instagram of the artist creating the mural.
“When life leaves us blind, love keeps us kind.” – Chester Bennington. New mural in progress from our friend @never1959 at our Sherman Oaks location,” wrote the restaurant owners.
In another post shared by Rock’n Pies of the completed mural, the owners of the establishment said they were “honored to have such an amazing tribute to Chester on the wall” of their building.





 We are honored to have such an amazing tribute to Chester on the wall of our building, and overwhelmed by the response from fans in the local community and all over the world. Thanks again @never1959, @_kryst_ and @mr_kub_ . Thank you @kroq for acknowledging this incredible artwork. And thank you, Chester for all the art you've produced over the years.

The tributes for Chester Bennington continue to pour in after his death, and on Tuesday, Chris Martin honored the late Linkin Park frontman with a moving cover of the band’s Grammy-winning song “Crawling.”
His rendition was performed live to a packed MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey — all who had gathered to see Coldplay’s latest stop on their A Head Full of Dreams tour.
“From time to time we like to do a cover song. We’re gonna do one right now,” Martin told the crowd as he sat behind a piano, EW reported. “I hope it’s okay. It may not sound that great, but it’s meant in good faith.”
“This is for anybody who’s missing someone,” he added.

Martin then launched into the song, turning the 2000 rock track into a poignant ballad. According to footage of the concert posted online, he stopped and restarted his performance — explaining “I know this is probably going to end up on YouTube so I want to do it right.”
He did end up doing it right, and the crowd cheered for Matin as he wrapped up the performance. Linkin Park’s Mike Shinoda even thanked him on social media, posting video of Martin’s cover on Instagram. “It sounded beautiful,” he wrote in the post’s caption.





 Thank you @coldplay 🙏🏽 It sounded beautiful.

Bennington’s wife Talinda — who married the late Linkin Park singer in 2006 and is the mother of their son Tyler, and twin daughters Lilly and Lila — also recently broke her silence about her husband’s death.
“One week ago, I lost my soulmate and my children lost their hero-their Daddy,” the 40-year-old said in a statement obtained by PEOPLE. “We had a fairytale life and now it has turned into some sick Shakespearean tragedy. How do I move on? How do I pick up my shattered soul?”

Metallica’s Lars Ulrich Pays Tribute to ‘Big-Hearted’ Chester Bennington

Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich is the most recent musician to pay tribute to the late Linkin Park vocalist, Chester Bennington.
The singer was found dead of a suicide by hanging on July 20, and since then tributes have poured in from throughout the music world.
In an interview with Los Angeles radio station 95.5 KLOS Sunday, Ulrich shared some kind words about Bennington and his music. “Chester was a very kind and very unassuming and very gentle soul, who had a really big heart,” he began.

“The first time I heard Linkin Park – the power that came out of him was just unbelievable. It was so original and so unique. He was one of those singers that has that rare gift where every word that comes out of him sounds authentic.”
Ulrich also recalled 2003’s Summer Sanitarium tour which Metallica shared with Linkin Park. “All those guys are great guys and my heart goes out to all of ’em and to the family. I think more than anything, I think it reaffirms — without sounding too cheesy — that we’ve gotta live each moment to the max and just be in the moment.”

Mourners Remember Chester Bennington in ‘Beautiful’ Private Service for the Late Linkin Park Singer

Linkin Park frontman Chester Bennington was laid to rest on Saturday in Rancho Paolo Verdes, California.
Over 500 of Bennington’s family members and close friends gathered for a private funeral at South Coast Botanical Garden in Palos Verdes Estates near the late singer’s home.
Ted Stryker of KROQ led the service, while Chester’s Stone Temple Pilots bandmates Robert & Dean DeLeo, Kings of Chaos drummer Matt Sorum, Damon Fox, and Jimmy Gnecco teamed up for a powerful and touching rendition of “Amazing Grace.”
All guests were provided with a yellow wristband and a pass with Bennington’s picture on it — similar to the type of admission items VIP fans would receive at a concert.
Austin Carlile — the former lead singer of the band Of Mice and Men — posted a picture of the passes on Instagram. In the photo, the back of the guest pass has an image of Bennington singing into a crowd that is illuminated by the light from the cell phones of concertgoers.
“The service today was beautiful. Thank you Linkin Park, thank you Chester. For everything ❤❤❤,” Carlile wrote.

She continued, “Chester, as one of my best friends of the age of 19, a husband, father to my son, business partner, and all we created together, I’m truly honored to have completed our soul contracts together, build all we did together, & thank you for giving me the greatest gift ever, our beautiful son Draven.
