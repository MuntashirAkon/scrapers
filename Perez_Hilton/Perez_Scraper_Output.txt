Nicki Minaj Shares A Cryptic â€˜Humbleâ€™ Tweet & The Internet Is Calling Taylor Swift Shade!


Is Nicki Minaj bringing her feud with Taylor Swift back from the dead??
That's what some fans are saying following the release of the country-turned-pop star's new track Look What You Made Me Do!

Minutes after Tay's single dropped on Thursday night, the rapper took to Twitter with a cryptic message: 

Nigga sit down. Be humble
â€” NICKI MINAJ (@NICKIMINAJ) August 25, 2017
The tweet quotes Kendrick Lamar's hit HUMBLE., and seemingly comes out of nowhere!
While Nicki didn't elaborate at all, commenters are certain she's throwing shade:

After all, the award-winning artists got into a bit of a feud two years agoâ€¦ also ahead of the MTV VMAs. In case you don't remember, Swift thought Minaj was throwing shots at her after being snubbed for a video nom!
It ended up being a big misunderstanding, which the 27-year-old apologized for.
So, do U think Nicki is calling out the singer this time??

Taylor Swift's Album Reputation Drops On The 10th Anniversary Of Kanye West's Mom's Death â€” & People Are PISSED!


If this isn't a coincidence, it's a SAVAGE marketing strategy.
As you may've heard, Taylor Swift's sixth studio album, titled Reputation, is set to drop on November 10. Obviously, the L.P. announcement had tongues waggin' â€” but not for the reason you think.
Video: Sneak Peek Of Taylor's Look What You Made Me Do Video!
It appears as though Reputation's drop date falls directly on the 10-year anniversary of Kanye West's mother's untimely death. In case you forgot, Donda West passed away on November 10 in 2007 due to complications from cosmetic surgery. Oh man.
Now, November 10 DOES fall on a Friday this year, and Fridays are preferred for big music releases. Still, we find it inneresting that Tay's team decided to release her album on day that means SO MUCH to her nemesis. We mean, Yeezus' breakdown last year coincided with the anniversary of Donda's passing.
Understandably, stans on Twitter have voiced their disdain for the release date decision. They wrote:

ok i was done complaining about taylor swift i felt gross n w/e and then i saw this n absolutely fuck taylor swift pic.twitter.com/ws9LYkmeFu

U all better not support Taylor's new Kanye diss track which is coming out on his mothers 10 year death anniversary. To the day.

Taylor Swift releasing her album on the anniversary of Donda Westâ€™s death is an objectively ugly, trash thing to do.

Taylor scheduling REPUTATION's release for the 10th anniversary of Donda Westâ€™s death is such an egregious and disgusting miscalculation

>Death of Donda West- Nov 10
>Release date of Taylor Swift's Reputation- Nov 10
I dabble in pop culture pettiness for fun but thisâ€¦â€¦

I'm gonna let this sink in. Taylor Swift is releasing an album on the date of Donda West's passing. What fucking filth. Fucking. Filth.
â€” Jason F (@ActiveFishin) August 25, 2017
Oof.
While we'd like to give Taylor the benefit of the doubt, it appears as though she is waging all out war on West. 'Ye has wife Kim Kardashian West to thank for that!

Breaking Down Taylor Swiftâ€™s Look What You Made Me Do Lyrics â€” Here's How She Came For Kanye West, Kim Kardashian, & Katy Perry!


In case you missed it, Taylor Swift released her first solo single in years, and it has a very different sound!
Look What You Made Me Do was released Thursday night with the singer taking very obvious shots at Kim Kardashian West, Kanye West, and even Katy Perry!
This is no Bad Blood diss track!
Video: Sneak Peek Of Taylor's Look What You Made Me Do Video!
Being the lyricist that she is, Tay pointedly called out the Wests over their Famous feud. As you probably remember, the rapper referenced her in the controversial song, saying:
"I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex / Why? I made that bitch famous / I made that bitch famous"
The 40-year-old Chicago native also filmed his phone call with Taylor during his attempt to get her approval over one of the lyrics.
Seemingly in response, the 27-year-old starts off Look What You Made Me Do with: 
"I don't like your little games / Don't like your tilted stage / The role you made me play / Of the fool, no, I don't like you"
Kanye's Saint Pablo tour featured a literally tilted stage which was raised in the air. AND in the video for Famous, he featured a naked Swift lookalike in bed with him AKA the "role" he made her play.

She then goes on to sing:
"I don't like your perfect crime / How you laugh when you lie"
The "perfect crime" being Kanye secretly recording their conversation, and the "laugh when you lie" referencing him laughing in the leaked video when he only played her part of his line about her.
Continuing to allude at the leaked conversation, the songstress also includes her own fake phone conversation into the song:
"I'm sorry, the old Taylor can't come to the phone right now / Why? / Oh, â€™cause she's dead!"
Yeezus isn't the only one she's hinting at in her new track!
Taylor also subtly hits at Katy in a couple of ways, both with Mean Girls references since the Swish Swish singer once not-so-directly hinted her former friend was the "Regina George in sheep's clothing."
In the hook, she sings:
"I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined"
Burn book, right??
And then there's the songstress sampling Peaches song Operate, which was featured in the movie and the soundtrack!! Listen (below):

Swift also mentions losing her throne after the fallout from her feud with Kimye:
"I don't like your kingdom keys / They once belonged to me"
We may not have liked the song, but we can't wait to see what Revenge Taylor has in store!
