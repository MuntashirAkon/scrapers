
I was wondering if you knew of a place online where we can donate erotic graphic novels. We're moving across country and we can't take them all. We'd love to find them a good home. Thank you!

P.S. We're in Philadelphia.
Instead of donating your erotic graphic novels online (I'm not sure how that would work anyway), GRAPHIC, donate your collection to a worthy local non-profit.
Call some used bookstores in Philadelphia and offer to give them your graphic erotic novelsâ€”if they want them, if they think they can sell them. Don't burden a poor bookstore by dumping books on 'em without asking; always call first. But if you're not hurting for money and you're want your novels erotic graphic to find a good home, donating them to a good used bookstore is a great way to go.
I know, I know: a used bookstore isn't technically a "non-profit." But used bookstores are valuable community institutions, their profit margins are ridiculously slim, and they're worthy of our support.
