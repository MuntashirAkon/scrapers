Other than turning off the caps lock, TSG, and laying off the ellipses... I've only got one comment: The popularity of shaved legs on men spikes every four years... right after the Summer Olympics, thanks to all those smooth-shaved, camera-friendly, touchy-feely divers.

They're your legs, TSG, and if shaving them makes you happy—even if the ladies hated it—you go right ahead and shave 'em.
