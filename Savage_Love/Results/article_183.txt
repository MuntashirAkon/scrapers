I am currently separated. A few months after I moved out, my estranged wife found out that I cheated on her before we got married. I was a CPOS. I feel horribly guilty and would like to think I'll never do it again.  The question is when and what should I disclose to future partners?
No Clever Acronym
There’s no need to disclose this to future partners. Everyone makes mistakes—and the mistake you made, while a deeply painful betrayal of your then-girlfriend and a presumably a violation of a premarital monogamous commitment, is a common one. Human beings aren't used cars—we aren't obligated to disclose every wreck and every ditch we drove ourselves into before we resell ourselves. You didn't fuck around habitually, you're not a serial cheater, and you never violated your marriage vows. So there's that. Resolve not to make this mistake again—make only new ones!—and keep your mouth shut.—Dan
Thank you, Dan!—NCA
