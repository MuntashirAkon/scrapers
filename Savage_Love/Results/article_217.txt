I've never written to Savage Love before but I've read it plenty and I'm out of Ideas. 
I'm a 19-year-old Bi woman who works in West Seattle. I went to college but the school wasn't right for me so I left and now I have a great job but basically no friends. I work with people exclusively older than me full time—about four people at a time in the office—and all my other friends are off at their colleges. All I want to do is meet people, make friends, find a partner, etc., and have the fun I should be having in my teen/20s. I've tried Tinder, Bumble, and Her to find friends and romances and have come up with nada. 
The issue is that I am under 21 and until the year and a half till I can be in bars passes I have no idea how to tackle making friends without a school around me help me find like-minded people. And although Seattle is large, its hard to find places and activities where I can be around other people my age. It seems like all activities anywhere in Seattle are 21+.
So please, please, please. Help me with some ways to go find friends and romances.
Without Social Structure 
Shit—it's after six already and I haven't posted a SLLOTD yet. And, hey, I'm old and gay and I really don't know where to tell this young and bi person to go. So I'm tossing this one to you, Slog. Help WSS out with some recommendations: places to go, things to do, where she might meet some like-minded people. Thanks.
