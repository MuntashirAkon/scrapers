GTFO here from Nov. 4th's SLLOTD. First off, thank you so much for your quick response to my plea for urgent help. I was so surprised and grateful to open the app the morning after emailing you to find exactly the response I expected and needed. I talked with the Awkward Boy that day (though sadly left out your sage suggestion that he find others' beds to sleep in, as I knew he'd be more offended than encouraged by that) and ended up finding him a cheap flight home for the following week. That actually worked out well for him, since he was able to find holiday work and start paying his parents back/saving up to go back out traveling. 
It also ended up better for me than I ever could have hoped. Shortly thereafter, I connected with a local sax player who I've been crushing on at shows since I first saw one of his bands 2 years ago. I'm now in the happiest relationship of my life, with someone who is all the things AB turned out not to be - talented, driven, inspiring, intellectually compelling, and both sexy and sweet as can be. I'm starting to get the feeling that I'll be thanking you for that push every day for the rest of my life. So thanks, and much love to you!
