I am a 30-year-old man. May 3 would have marked my one year anniversary with my girlfriend. It has been a week since we split. Funny thing is she is in an open marriage. We made it work really well for a year. Like any other couple we had our issues and we worked on them. She met my family and friends. Even though we met as strangers she became my best friend. Frist time I told her I loved her was something out of a corny sitcom but so natural. I had asked her to marry me, and she said yes. She tried leaving him for me but could not. She tried leaving me but she could not. She wanted to be with us both. Ultimately I saw that her feelings changed from week to weekâ€”one week we were talking about having kids and getting married and the next it seemed like she was dating someone else behind my back. I am totally lost. Today is her birthday and it is killing me. I feel like I should not be this heart broken. Everything was falling apart and breaking up with her was the best decision, I was never going to get what I wanted. A part of me wants to get up and fight, but I do not see anything coming from her. What do I do? 
Confused And Heartbroken
Eat ice cream. Take a walk. Watch a movie. Get a bike. Go for hikes. Hit the gym. Have some donuts. Read a book. Get some distance. Binge on Bee. Leave the house. Hang with friends. Hit the clubs. Drink faggy cocktails. Fuck other people.
Repeat as necessary.
