I'm a 25-year-old bi girl in the Southwest, and I've been with the same hetero guy for almost three years. I miss being with women. We made an attempt at being monogamish, but feelings were hurt and we went back to monogamy. He still parties like he's in college and is a bit dependent on me—socially—whereas I crave independence and, quite frankly, pussy. I've started to withdraw and resent him, not just for the lack of sexual freedom but also because he drinks too much and acts like a slob. I want to move out when our lease ends. I'm willing to work on our issues, but I fear that when I have this conversation, it will break his heart and he will break up with me as a defensive approach, rather than seeing the breathing room as a way to work on our relationship. How can I express my need for other sexual partners and more space without sounding like I'm calling off the relationship? Is it even worth attempting dating, post–living together?

My response after the jump...
Here's what you should say to your boyfriend: "You've got some growing up to do, and I've got some eating pussy to do. I don't want to end our relationship, but I'm moving out when our lease is up." If your boyfriend breaks up with you, IQAH, it's probably for the best—and it may not be forever. If he does dump you for purely defensive reasons, then he didn't really want to dump you at all, right? So once the shock wears off and his anger subsides, your boyfriend may decide that having you in his life is more important than having you all to himself.
