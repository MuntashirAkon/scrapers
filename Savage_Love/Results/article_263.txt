Originally posted on August 7, 2013. I'm a 25-year-old male. After a tragic set of circumstances, I am now the legal guardian of my 15-year-old brother. He's gay. Fortunately, our parents took care of "the talk" and taught him how to use condoms. Unfortunately, he has started dating a senior at his school who is about to turn 18 and is a fucking sleazeball. You know the type: entitled, narcissistic LA type, drives a BMW paid for by his rich parents. This asshole has no respect for my brother. He grabs my brother's ass or says disgusting things like "You really look fuckable in those jeans." I told him to stop that behavior, and he just replied, "Sorry, I can't keep my hands off such a hottie." A keeper for sure, right?
My parents would probably know what to do, but they're dead. I don't think he's mature enough to be in a sexual relationship, but I'm fairly sure he is already sexually active. I laid down the law and told him that he couldn't see his boyfriend anymore, but he has continued to see him behind my back and now doesn't tell me anything that is going on with his life. I don't know what he's doing with a guy like that. My brother is smart, plays lots of sports, and is really involved at school. I'm afraid this loser is going to destroy all that.
I'm new to all of this parenting stuff, but I know that he can't continue to see this person. I know that my issue isn't what you usually deal with, but as a parent yourself, what would you do?
