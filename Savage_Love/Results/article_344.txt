Why am I such a slut?
Girl, Corrupted
My response after the jump...
Are you such a slut?
Or are you a woman who loves sex, has a high libido, and has consensual sex with a lot of willing and grateful partners? Those are traits a sex-negative/misogynist culture conspires to make you feel conflicted about, GC, and then cons you into slapping a pejorative label on yourself—a label you wouldn't feel a need to slap on yourself if you were a dude, gay or straight.
Don't buy into the sexist double standards, GC. So long as your sex life isn't negatively impacting your relationship(s), your health, your classwork, or your career, GC, you aren't doing anything wrong. Don't let shitty, sexist people make you feel like you have to slap a shitty, sexist label on yourself for the crime of enjoying sex while female.
Have fun out there, GC, be thoughtful, be safe, be considerate. And remember: What works for you now—slutting around in the sex-positive/reclaiming-the-shit-out-of-that-word sense—may not work for you always. Don't look back on this part of your life with shame or regret if or when you elect to downsize your sex life, i.e., less sex, fewer sex partners/more sex, one sex partner. Do what's right for you, eliminate risks that can be eliminated, mitigate risks that can't be eliminated, and don't worry about what other people think.
