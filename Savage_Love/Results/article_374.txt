I'm sure you get a lot of these messages, but I just have to thank you for the work that you do. When my husband and I got married five years ago, we had already discussed things like "What happens if one of us cheats?" which we knew to talk about thanks to reading your column regularly. We frequently revisit the idea of opening up our marriage, though we haven't done it yet. And you know what? We might never do it. But being able to talk about it and be honest about meeting each other's needs (or not) has been a lifesaver to our marriage.
This week my husband approached me to let me know that he had a free profile on Ashley Madison. I would have never searched for his information, but he wanted me to know just in case. He said it fell under our "don't ask, don't tell" rules regarding flirting with other people and porn use. And even though I was initially kind of hurt, I agree with him. I can't overstate how thankful I am to have this kind of open communication with my husband about our sex life.
Oh, and we were both raised in super conservative households and consider ourselves Christians. I have a better sex life than any of my friends, too. THANK YOU!
Married Lady
You're welcome, MLâ€”and here's hoping your levelheaded reaction to the news that your husband had an account on Ashley Madison isn't a complete anomaly.
