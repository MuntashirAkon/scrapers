I'm a cute, mostly straight, twentysomething, single, and (safely) sexually active woman. This happens to me pretty often: I hook up with a guy, we start fooling around, and we're both really into it. I reach down, and he's full sail. Things progress-clothes come off, etc.-and, as is generally the polite order of things, the lady comes first. (This isn't the problem.) I'm not aggressive, but I'm not shy. I tell a partner what I like and how to do it. They are always happy to oblige. The thing is, after I get off, a lot of times, the guy is limp. (This is the problem.) They usually express frustration and indicate that they're very much turned on but it's just not working. Generally after a few times, they will stop having this problem, and we will end up having lots of fun. So I don't think I'm doing anything "wrong" to kill the boners. I think maybe I'm just intimidating. In fact, I've been told so. Why does this happen and how can I reduce the awkwardness? Should I talk about it or just ignore it? And should I keep trying to make him hard? Or will that just make his dick panic worse?
Fragile Ego Males
P.S. The more a guy likes me, the more this seems to happen
