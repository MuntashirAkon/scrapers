My girlfriend snooped on my browser history the other day specifically to see what porn I had been looking at. I've told her I look at porn a few times a week, and she said she didn't mind. She asked me what type of stuff I usually look at, and I was mostly honest. My viewing habits are pretty vanilla except for BBW porn. It's not my go-to, but it was what she found in my browser history the day she snooped. She had some issues, and I don't know how to address them. I'm not more attracted to overweight women than other women, but sometimes that type just does it for me. Compounding this, my girlfriend is overweight—not on par with the women in the videos I watched—and now she's worried that her weight is the only reason I'm attracted to her. It's not! How can I explain this to her and put her mind at ease?

If you looked only at porn that featured conventionally attractive women—all those skinny bitches—your girlfriend would be worried that you're not attracted to her because of her size. But she caught you looking at BBW porn, and now she's worried that her size is the only reason you're attracted to her. I don't think you can win this one, BBW, but you can try saying this to her: "I like women of all shapes and sizes, honey, including yours—as you can clearly see if you look at all the porn sites I've visited, instead of just obsessing about that particular one." I don't think it'll do much good, because your girlfriend probably doesn't want you looking at porn at all—saying it's okay, snooping, and grilling aren't signs of "okay with porn." So use private browsing, clear your browser history, or watch porn on a secure computer in a secret, undisclosed location.
