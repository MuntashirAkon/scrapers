My letter appeared in your column last week. I was the guy wondering what was up with the "straight" guy whose online personal ad said he had "an addiction to massive cocks in my ass." You said that the guy was most likely bi (and rounding down to straight), might be gay (and flying a false flag), but there was a very, very small chance he was actually straight (and turned on by the violation or doing "forced bi" for a dominant girlfriend).
I took your advice and sent the guy a message and he replied. I thought your readers would like to hear it directly from him: "Sorry for the delay. Dan was actually correct when he suggested that I was rounding down. At the core of it, I am bi. I am lucky to have a girlfriend that accepts and embraces me for me. I guess it could be considered a marketing ploy to brand myself as 'straight,' though I do identify as a straight male for the majority of my day."
So good call, Dan!
And guess what? The guy is a "Savage Love" reader! Before I messaged him his profile had been updated with this: "Straight with an addiction to massive cocks in my ass. Just read someone asked Dan Savage about the legitimacy of my ad, and yes, I'm real and serious." His ad is here.

Thanks for sharing, JAWDROP. And while I normally wouldn't include a link to a personal ad in the SLLOTD or a column, JAWDROP, I'm making an exception for "absolutbottom." The ad is anonymous, he's a reader, and he clearly gotta kick out of seeing his ad (and his ass) discussed in "Savage Love" last week. So if you're a "Savage Love" reader with a massive cock and a thing for straight-identified bi guys (who come complete with girlfriends game to have threesomes with other bi guys)... you might wanna check out the ass on this dude.
