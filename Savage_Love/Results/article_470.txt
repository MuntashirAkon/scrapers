From listening to your podcast, I know you appreciate feedback from the people you have given advice to, so here you have an update from the poor guy who (according to many comments to my letter) was being fooled by a pimp and a prostitute.
To recap: I met an escort, we experienced what seemed to be a mutual attraction on the first fuck, and she then invited me to go see Fifty Shades of Grey with her. A date. I took your advice and took her to the movie... after spending the night before at her place. I wound up spending the night with her again. We got irritated looks from some of the old women at the screening—they did not approve of her acting submissive toward me (just some hair pulling and making out)—but, hey, the reason she asked me to go see the movie at all was because during our first encounter I told her I was a dominant sadist. And after the movie, she was in the mood for trying out BDSM for herself—and now I've been introduced to her sister and her friends as the man she is dating, and as her "Mr. Grey" to some of her closer friends. And we've been seeing a lot more of each other since that movie date. I have no idea where the relationship between us is going, but we enjoy each other. We are two fucked-up people finding pleasure and company together—we just happened to meet in an unusual way. Thanks for advising me to go on the date, Dan.
And in response to some of the comments: No, she didn't want me to smuggle drugs up my ass. No, she didn't have a pimp who wanted to blackmail me. No, my letter was not viral marketing for the movie. Yes, I know it sounds like something made up—but sometimes reality surprises you. The moral of my story: Found someone you like and that person likes you back? Don't fucking worry about how you met and just see where it leads.
To Date Or Not To Date
Good advice, TDONTD. Thanks for the update!
