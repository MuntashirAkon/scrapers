Originally posted on January 22, 2014.I'm 45, female, and married to a smart, funny, intelligent 50-year-old man. We've been together nine years, married seven. The sex was good for the first year and then dropped off to nothing. He says, "I've had plenty of sex in my life. I'm just not interested anymore." During my first marriage, the sex was so bad that I thought, "If I could find a man who loved to cuddle, I could go the rest of my life without sex." Perfectly describes husband number two! Except now I feel more sexual than I ever have! I've discussed this with my husband endlessly and have mentioned open marriage, but nothing ever comes of it. I'm not an instigator, although I have tried a few times and have been rejected. Yes, he has had his testosterone checked. It's normal. Not even going to a therapist helped. What do I do? He's a great guy, he loves me and my grown kids unconditionally, but we are more friends/roommates than husband and wife. We have a safe, comfortable life, but I'm too young to go without that for the rest of my life!
