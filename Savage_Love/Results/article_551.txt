I am a straight 19-year-old girl in college. I broke up with my boyfriend of several months a week before Valentine's Day (a WHOLE nother situation), and during that relationship, I met this other guy, one of his friends. This friend has been in a relationship for 2.5 years. But his girlfriend cheated on him, and now he has a free card to go fuck someone else. He wants that person to be me! We have fooled around some, but even though I am not looking for a relationship right now, I have reservations about fucking someone who is in a relationship, even if it's on a Go Fuck Someone Else card. Advice?

My response after the jump...
Unless there are just two guys at your college—your ex and this dude with the Go Fuck Someone Else card—I would urge you to fuck someone else. This scenario has drama written all over it. Your ex will be pissed at you for fucking his friend, he'll be pissed at his friend for fucking you, the friend's girlfriend will be pissed at you for fucking her boyfriend—GFSE card or no GFSE card. Who needs that kind of grief? Find a hot student, RA, TA, or prof who isn't in your circle and fuck him instead.
