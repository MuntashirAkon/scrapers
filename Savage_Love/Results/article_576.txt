This just came in to the group editors email...
Hello editors,
I have been reading Savage Love for over a decade in your publication and will no longer be purchasing it as you have fired Dan Savage. Let me know if you decide to reinstate the only advice column that deals with sex positivity, education and consent in a nation plagued with bullying, shaming and sexual assault.  
Thank you,
Jerusha Rone
...and now I'm wondering if I have to go in to work today. I mean, is it true? Or did this person not flip through the paper and find my column (which used to be on the inside of the back page) in its new home (somewhere in the middle of the paper)?
Also, too: threatening to cease purchasing a free publication isn't a great negotiating strategy.
