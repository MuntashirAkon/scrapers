I cringed hard when I read the letter from the girl about her boyfriend texting his ex. I could easily be the ex she wrote about it, and so I have a slightly different perspective.
1. She needs to consider that it may have been more than sex on his side as well. Telling her it was "just sex" is easier for him to do now.
2. They may have always had a flirty relationship. He may not be responding overtly but he could be subtly encouraging the occasional borderline remark.
3. She may not actually be a damsel in distress. He may get off on being the sympathetic ear.
4. He justifies the ongoing relationship by telling himself (and you) that he's "helping" her.
