I have dilemma. I'm a married man, my wife and I have been together 20 years total, and our sex life is beginning to get kind of dull. Recently she told me she would like to have a FFM threesome. Our problem is finding another F. She said she would never do it with a friend—we don't think any of her friends would do it anyway—so I suggested dating sites since neither of us knows any bisexual women. My question to you is this: Would it be better if she made the profile on some dating sites or should I do it? She told me to do it because she's too shy to do it herself. I just think it would look better if she did it. What is your opinion on finding a third?
