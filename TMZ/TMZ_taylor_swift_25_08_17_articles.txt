Taylor Swift's new song,  "Look What You Made Me Do, " isn't a jab at Katy Perry, it's meant purely for Kanye West and Kim Kardashian. Taylor dropped her first single off her upcoming  "Reputation " album Thursday night and called out Kanye in the opening verse, where she sings  "I don't like your little games ... don't like your tilted stage. "  Our sources tell us the song is definitely targeting the Wests, who Taylor feels betrayed her by releasing their now infamous phone convo. Taylor's side of the story has always been ... they discussed the lyric but she never approved Kanye calling her  "bitch " in  "Famous. " We're told Taylor feels she was backstabbed by the couple and there will be more not-so-subtle hints in the official music video, which will debut Sunday during the VMAs.  Taylor released a short clip that zooms in on her sitting on a throne ... with the inscription,  "et tu, brute. " When the disses turn Shakespearean ... you know it's serious.  It's a famous line from Shakespeare's play  "Julius Caesar " when Caesar is being stabbed to death and recognizes one of his pals, Brutus, is in on it. The phrase is now meant to symbolize backstabbing. Taylor still played it safe for the video. She could've gone with  "Et tu, Kimye? "
Taylor Swift may be sorely disappointed at the VMAs Sunday, because she's gonna have no one to glare at ... we've learned Kim and Kanye are otherwise engaged. It would have been pretty epic ... Taylor showing off  "Look What You Made Me Do " as she stares down the royal couple, but we're told long before the single was released they decided the VMAs were not for them. They're in town, but we're told there's no particular reason for them to trek to The Forum near LAX. It's actually kinda brilliant ... Kim and Kanye become the center of attention at the music event, courtesy of Taylor Swift, and they don't have to lift a finger.
It's not news Taylor Swift and Kanye West dislike each other, but the timing of her new album release takes it to a whole new level. Taylor's album,  "Reputation, " is set to drop November 10, exactly 10 years to the day Donda West died from complications from cosmetic surgery. Donda was everything to Kanye and her death shattered him for years. In fact, his breakdown last year coincided with the death anniversary. In fairness, November 10 is a Friday ... the preferred day to drop albums. In fact, a source at Taylor's label tells us they picked the date  "based on other Universal Music Group releases. There is no correlation. " Nonetheless, Donda's death was such a big deal it's hard to forget, especially if you're feuding with her son.   TMZ broke the story ... when Kanye released  "Famous " with the lyric,  "I made that bitch famous " -- referring to Taylor -- she claimed he didn't give her a heads-up, but turns out Kanye recorded her saying just that.
It's now obvious Taylor Swift's been sharpening her lyrical knives during her hiatus -- she whipped 'em out for Katy Perry AND Kanye West in her new track,  "Look What You Made Me Do. "  Tay Tay just dropped a music video for the track, and the lyrics leave no doubt who she's attacking. She sings,  "I don't like your little games ... don't like your tilted stage " in the opening verse -- a clear reference to Kanye's last tour. Taylor also clearly refers to 'Ye calling her a bitch in,  "Famous " --  "The role you made me play of the fool ... no, I don't like you. " The 2nd verse seems to be targeting Katy for their feud over tour dancers -- and she plays off those snake teasers she's been posting. They're all over the animated music vid. The track is dripping with revenge shots like ...  "Maybe I got mine, but one day you'll get yours " and  "I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined. " It's always the quiet ones.
Taylor Swift's wasting her time -- and more importantly the world's -- with stupid secret jabs at her rivals ... according to songwriting legend Diane Warren. The rumor is Taylor packed her  "Reputation " cover art with hidden messages targeting the likes of Kanye, Kim, Katy and probably an ex-bf or 2. Diane, whose rep as maybe the most prolific writer of pop hits speaks for itself ... hints Swift should be focusing on her music.  Diane, for one, clearly ain't interested in busting out a magnifying glass to delve deeper into Taylor's beefs with celebs. DW dismisses it as seriously  "petty s**t " -- and also reminded us ... The Beatles did it better. Paul is dead. Look it up. 
 "Straight Outta Compton " actor R. Marcos Taylor -- who played Suge Knight in the flick -- allegedly went on a rampage at a New Jersey bank, threatening to kill employees and lunging at police. Cops say they were called to a TD Bank August 8 to handle an enraged Taylor. We're told the actor had an issue with a bank card and needed a new one, and he was hostile from the get-go. A witness tells us Taylor threatened an employee, saying,  "I will f***ing kill you. " Cops say when they arrived, Taylor squared off in a fighting stance so they pepper sprayed and then arrested him.  Taylor was charged with terroristic threats, obstruction of justice and disorderly conduct. It's been a rough month for the actor. TMZ broke the story ... he was arrested August 9 for assault after allegedly attacking employees at an Italian restaurant. He claims they were the aggressors.
