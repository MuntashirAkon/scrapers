Lady Alice's case was tried by Judge Jeffreys at the opening of the Bloody Assizes at Winchester. She pleaded she had no knowledge that Hickes's offence was anything more serious than illegal preaching. Furthermore, she had known nothing of Nelthorpe, who was not named in the indictment, but was nevertheless mentioned to strengthen the case for the Crown. She said she had no sympathy with the rebellion whatsoever.
Jeffreys' oversight of the trial later has come to define him for historians. He showed no pretence of impartiality, becoming "an eloquent addition to the prosecution", in the words of 21st-century historian Charles Spencer. Repeatedly he reminded the jury of John Lisle's role in the trial and execution of Charles I, always with the admonition that they should not consider it when weighing the question of her guilt. When the jurors expressed doubt about the case, he responded that "there is as full proof as proof can be ... for my part, I thought there was no difficulty in it."[2]
His antipathy to Lady Lisle, who often fell asleep during the trial, was obvious: when she asked if she would be allowed to speak in her own defence, Jeffreys reminded her that her husband had once condemned a man (King Charles I) to death without letting him speak. The jury reluctantly, after much pressure from Jeffreys, found her guilty after 15 minutes of deliberation.[2] As the law recognized no distinction between principals and accessories in treason, she was sentenced to be burned at the stake. Jeffreys said that he would have found her guilty "even if she had been [his] own mother". Brian Harris QC rejects much of the criticism of Jeffreys. 'Ultimately, while Jeffreys’ conduct of the trial was not faultless, it was not the judge’s conduct but the strength of the evidence against Alice which secured her conviction.'[4]
