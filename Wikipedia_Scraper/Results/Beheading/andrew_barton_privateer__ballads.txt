He is the subject of an English folk song entitled Sir Andrew Barton or Andrew Bartin, which is Child ballad number 167.
The most famous lines of this ballad are:
'I am hurt but I am not slain.
I'll lay me down and bleed awhile,
Then I'll rise and fight again.'
His story is also told in a Scottish Child ballad called Henry Martyn (Child ballad number 250). Rudyard Kipling wrote a short story connected with Barton in his Puck of Pook's Hill series.
