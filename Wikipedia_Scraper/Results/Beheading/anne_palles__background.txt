In 1692, the cunning woman Karen Gregers Madsens from Lommelev was accused of poisoning. She was hired by Ingeborg Olufsdatter in Nykøbing Falster to drug and murder her abusive and violent husband, Oswald Egger. Karen suggested that Egger was to be fed a bone from a corpse at the cometary, so as the dead was to come after and kill him. The lover of Ingeborg, Ole Boesen, acquired the bone, but it did not work, and Egger was instead murdered with poison. After having been interrogated by six priests, she confessed to practising magic and pointed out Anne Kruse, Abigael Nielsdatter and Anne Palles in Tåderup as witches, as well as 96 clients.
