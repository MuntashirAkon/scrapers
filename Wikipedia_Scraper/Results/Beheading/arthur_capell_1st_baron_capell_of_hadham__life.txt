Capell was the only son of Sir Henry Capell, of Rayne Hall, Essex, and his wife Theodosia Montagu, daughter of Sir Edward Montagu of Boughton House, Northamptonshire.[3] He was educated at Queens' College, Cambridge.[4] In April 1640, he was elected Member of Parliament for Hertfordshire in the Short Parliament and was re-elected MP for Hertfordshire for the Long Parliament in November 1640.[3][5][6] At first he supported the opposition to Charles's arbitrary government, on 5 December 1640 he delivered the "Petition from the county of Hertfordshire" outlining grievances against the King[6] with Capell continuing to criticise the King and the Kings advisers right through to the summer of 1641.[7] In June 1641 in an effort to raise additional revenue reduced the price of baronies from £400 to £350,[8] and Arthur Capell was raised to the peerage by the title of Baron Capell of Hadham, in the County of Hertford, on the 6 August 1641.[3][8] Capell was openly allying himself with the King's cause by early 1642,[8] on which side his sympathies were engaged.
On the outbreak of the war he was appointed lieutenant-general of Shropshire, Cheshire and North Wales, where he rendered useful military services, and later was made one of the Prince of Wales's councillors, and a commissioner at the Treaty of Uxbridge in 1645. He attended the queen in her flight to France in 1646, but disapproved of the prince's journey thither, and retired to Jersey, subsequently aiding in the king's escape to the Isle of Wight.[3]
Capell was one of the chief Royalist leaders in the second Civil War, but met with no success, and on the 27 August 1648, together with Lord Norwich, he surrendered to Fairfax at Colchester on promise of quarter for life.[9] This assurance was afterwards interpreted as not binding the civil authorities, and his fate for some time hung in the balance. He succeeded in escaping from the Tower, wading the moat once he had got over the walls, only to be betrayed by a Thames waterman who was engaged to row him from a hiding place at the Temple to one in Lambeth. He was again captured and was condemned to death by parliament on 8 March 1649,[3][10] and beheaded together with the Duke of Hamilton and Lord Holland.[3] The next day, after the execution his heart was removed and placed in a silver casket which was eventually presented to Charles II.[11]
