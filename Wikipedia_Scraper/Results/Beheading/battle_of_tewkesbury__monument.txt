The Tewkesbury Battlefield Society erected a monument to the battle in the form of two sculptures 5 metres (16Â ft) high, of a victorious mounted knight and a defeated horse. Titled Arrivall after the contemporary account of the battle, the work was created by Phil Bews out of green oak wood felled in Gloucestershire, and was dedicated on the anniversary of the battle in 2014.[21]
