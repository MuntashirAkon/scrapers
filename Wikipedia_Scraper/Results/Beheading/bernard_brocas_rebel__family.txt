Some time before 1380 he married Joan (died 1429), who was the daughter of either Sir Thomas Midelton or Gilbert Banbury of Holybourne. They lived at Beaurepaire in the parish of Sherborne St John in Hampshire and had six children, including
the elder son William Brocas (c1379-1456), MP for Hampshire and High Sheriff of Hampshire, and
the eldest daughter Catherine Brocas, who married Sir Robert Delamare of Aldermaston.
Although a convicted traitor's goods and lands were forfeit to the Crown, Henry IV was not vindictive to the family. Ten days after the execution, he let the widow Joan have her husband's goods and later that year the lands yielding an annual income of 300 pounds were granted to the elder son William.[2]
