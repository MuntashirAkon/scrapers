Charles went to Ireland and became a friend of the Earl of Essex. In February 1601 he took part in Essex' short-lived rebellion. He offered to pay Â£10,000 for his life, but to no avail. He was convicted of treason, and beheaded on Tower Hill for treason on 18 March 1601.[3] Executed with him was his fellow conspirator, Sir Christopher Blount.[4]
