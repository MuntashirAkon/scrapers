Partly inspired by his visit to the Spanish court in 1623,[74] Charles became a passionate and knowledgeable art collector, amassing one of the finest art collections ever assembled.[75] In Spain, he sat for a sketch by Velázquez, and acquired works by Titian and Correggio, among others.[76] In England, his commissions included the ceiling of the Banqueting House, Whitehall, by Rubens and paintings by other artists from the Low Countries such as van Honthorst, Mytens, and van Dyck.[77] His close associates, including the Duke of Buckingham and the Earl of Arundel, shared his interest and have been dubbed the Whitehall Group.[78] In 1627 and 1628, Charles purchased the entire collection of the Duke of Mantua, which included work by Titian, Correggio, Raphael, Caravaggio, del Sarto and Mantegna.[79] His collection grew further to encompass Bernini, Bruegel, da Vinci, Holbein, Hollar, Tintoretto and Veronese, and self-portraits by both Dürer and Rembrandt.[80] By Charles's death, there were an estimated 1760 paintings,[81] most of which were sold and dispersed by Parliament.[82]
