Ten days after Charles's execution, on the day of his interment, a memoir purporting to be written by the king appeared for sale.[302] This book, the Eikon Basilike (Greek for the "Royal Portrait"), contained an apologia for royal policies, and it proved an effective piece of royalist propaganda. John Milton wrote a Parliamentary rejoinder, the Eikonoklastes ("The Iconoclast"), but the response made little headway against the pathos of the royalist book.[305] Anglicans and royalists fashioned an image of martyrdom,[306] and in the Convocations of Canterbury and York of 1660 King Charles the Martyr was added to the Church of England's liturgical calendar.[307] High church Anglicans held special services on the anniversary of his death. Churches, such as those at Falmouth and Tunbridge Wells, and Anglican devotional societies such as the Society of King Charles the Martyr, were founded in his honour.[143][308]
With the monarchy overthrown, England became a republic or "Commonwealth". The House of Lords was abolished by the Rump Commons, and executive power was assumed by a Council of State.[309] All significant military opposition in Britain and Ireland was extinguished by the forces of Oliver Cromwell in the Third English Civil War and the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland.[310] Cromwell forcibly disbanded the Rump Parliament in 1653,[311] thereby establishing the Protectorate with himself as Lord Protector.[312] Upon his death in 1658, he was briefly succeeded by his ineffective son, Richard.[313] Parliament was reinstated, and the monarchy was restored to Charles I's eldest son, Charles II, in 1660.[314]
In the words of John Philipps Kenyon, "Charles Stuart is a man of contradictions and controversy".[315] Revered by high Tories who considered him a saintly martyr,[143] he was condemned by Whig historians, such as Samuel Rawson Gardiner, who thought him duplicitous and delusional.[316] In recent decades, most historians have criticised him,[317] the main exception being Kevin Sharpe who offered a more sympathetic view of Charles that has not been widely adopted.[318] While Sharpe argued that the king was a dynamic man of conscience, Professor Barry Coward thought Charles "was the most incompetent monarch of England since Henry VI",[319] a view shared by Ronald Hutton, who called him "the worst king we have had since the Middle Ages".[320]
Archbishop William Laud, who was beheaded by Parliament during the war, described Charles as "A mild and gracious prince who knew not how to be, or how to be made, great."[321] Charles was more sober and refined than his father,[322] but he was intransigent and deliberately pursued unpopular policies that ultimately brought ruin on himself.[323] Both Charles and James were advocates of the divine right of kings, but while James's ambitions concerning absolute prerogative were tempered by compromise and consensus with his subjects, Charles believed that he had no need to compromise or even to explain his actions.[324] He thought that he was answerable only to God. "Princes are not bound to give account of their actions," he wrote, "but to God alone".[325]
