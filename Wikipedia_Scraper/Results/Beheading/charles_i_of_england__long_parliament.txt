The Long Parliament proved just as difficult for Charles as had the Short Parliament. It assembled on 3 November 1640 and quickly began proceedings to impeach the king's leading counsellors of high treason.[157] Strafford was taken into custody on 10 November; Laud was impeached on 18 December; John Finch, now Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, was impeached the following day, and he consequently fled to the Hague with Charles's permission on 21 December.[158] To prevent the king from dissolving it at will, Parliament passed the Triennial Act, which required Parliament to be summoned at least once every three years, and permitted the Lord Keeper and 12 peers to summon Parliament if the king failed to do so.[159] The Act was coupled with a subsidy bill, and so to secure the latter, Charles grudgingly granted royal assent in February 1641.[160]
Strafford had become the principal target of the Parliamentarians, particularly John Pym, and he went on trial for high treason on 22 March 1641.[161] However, the key allegation by Sir Henry Vane that Strafford had threatened to use the Irish army to subdue England was not corroborated and on 10 April Pym's case collapsed.[162] Pym and his allies immediately launched a bill of attainder, which simply declared Strafford guilty and pronounced the sentence of death.[163]
Charles assured Strafford that "upon the word of a king you shall not suffer in life, honour or fortune",[164] and the attainder could not succeed if Charles withheld assent.[165] Furthermore, many members and most peers were opposed to the attainder, not wishing, in the words of one, to "commit murder with the sword of justice".[166] However, increased tensions and an attempted coup by royalist army officers in support of Strafford and in which Charles was involved began to sway the issue.[167] The Commons passed the bill on 20 April by a large margin (204 in favour, 59 opposed, and 230 abstained), and the Lords acquiesced (by 26 votes to 19, with 79 absent) in May.[168] On 3 May, Parliament's Protestation attacked the "wicked counsels" of Charles's "arbitrary and tyrannical government"; while those who signed the petition undertook to defend the king's "person, honour and estate", they also swore to preserve "the true reformed religion", parliament, and the "rights and liberties of the subjects".[169] Charles, fearing for the safety of his family in the face of unrest, assented reluctantly to Strafford's attainder on 9 May after consulting his judges and bishops.[170] Strafford was beheaded three days later.[171]
Additionally in early May, Charles assented to an unprecedented Act that forbade the dissolution of the English Parliament without its consent.[172] In the following months, ship money, fines in distraint of knighthood and excise without parliamentary consent were declared unlawful, and the Courts of Star Chamber and High Commission were abolished.[173] All remaining forms of taxation were legalised and regulated by the Tonnage and Poundage Act.[174] The House of Commons also launched bills attacking bishops and episcopacy, but these failed in the Lords.[175]
Charles had made important concessions in England, and temporarily improved his position in Scotland by securing the favour of the Scots on a visit from August to November 1641 during which he conceded to the official establishment of Presbyterianism.[176] However, following an attempted royalist coup in Scotland, known as "The Incident", Charles's credibility was significantly undermined.[177]
In Ireland, the population was split into three main socio-political groups: the Gaelic Irish, who were Catholic; the Old English, who were descended from medieval Normans and were also predominantly Catholic; and the New English, who were Protestant settlers from England and Scotland aligned with the English Parliament and the Covenanters. Strafford's administration had improved the Irish economy and boosted tax revenue, but had done so by heavy-handedly imposing order.[178] He had trained up a large Catholic army in support of the king and had weakened the authority of the Irish Parliament,[179] while continuing to confiscate land from Catholics for Protestant settlement at the same time as promoting a Laudian Anglicanism that was anathema to Presbyterians.[180] As a result, all three groups had become disaffected.[181] Strafford's impeachment provided a new departure for Irish politics whereby all sides joined together to present evidence against him.[182] In a similar manner to the English Parliament, the Old English members of the Irish Parliament argued that while opposed to Strafford they remained loyal to Charles. They argued that the king had been led astray by malign counsellors,[183] and that, moreover, a viceroy such as Strafford could emerge as a despotic figure instead of ensuring that the king was directly involved in governance.[184]
Strafford's fall from power weakened Charles's influence in Ireland.[185] The dissolution of the Irish army was unsuccessfully demanded three times by the English Commons during Strafford's imprisonment,[169] until Charles was eventually forced through lack of money to disband the army at the end of Strafford's trial.[186] Disputes concerning the transfer of land ownership from native Catholic to settler Protestant,[187] particularly in relation to the plantation of Ulster,[188] coupled with resentment at moves to ensure the Irish Parliament was subordinate to the Parliament of England,[189] sowed the seeds of rebellion. When armed conflict arose between the Gaelic Irish and New English, in late October 1641, the Old English sided with the Gaelic Irish while simultaneously professing their loyalty to the king.[190]
In November 1641, the House of Commons passed the Grand Remonstrance, a long list of grievances against actions by Charles's ministers committed since the beginning of his reign (that were asserted to be part of a grand Catholic conspiracy of which the king was an unwitting member),[191] but it was in many ways a step too far by Pym and passed by only 11 votes – 159 to 148.[192] Furthermore, the Remonstrance had very little support in the House of Lords, which the Remonstrance attacked.[193] The tension was heightened by news of the Irish rebellion, coupled with inaccurate rumours of Charles's complicity.[194] Throughout November, a series of alarmist pamphlets published stories of atrocities in Ireland,[195] which included massacres of New English settlers by the native Irish who could not be controlled by the Old English lords.[196] Rumours of "papist" conspiracies circulated in England,[197] and English anti-Catholic opinion was strengthened, damaging Charles's reputation and authority.[198] The English Parliament distrusted Charles's motivations when he called for funds to put down the Irish rebellion; many members of the Commons suspected that forces raised by Charles might later be used against Parliament itself.[199] Pym's Militia Bill was intended to wrest control of the army from the king, but it did not have the support of the Lords, let alone Charles.[200] Instead, the Commons passed the bill as an ordinance, which they claimed did not require royal assent.[201] The Militia Ordinance appears to have prompted more members of the Lords to support the king.[202] In an attempt to strengthen his position, Charles generated great antipathy in London, which was already fast falling into anarchy, when he placed the Tower of London under the command of Colonel Thomas Lunsford, an infamous, albeit efficient, career officer.[203] When rumours reached Charles that Parliament intended to impeach his wife for supposedly conspiring with the Irish rebels, the king decided to take drastic action.[204]
Charles suspected, probably correctly, that some members of the English Parliament had colluded with the invading Scots.[205] On 3 January 1642, Charles directed Parliament to give up five members of the Commons – Pym, John Hampden, Denzil Holles, William Strode and Sir Arthur Haselrig – and one peer – Lord Mandeville – on the grounds of high treason.[206] When Parliament refused, it was possibly Henrietta Maria who persuaded Charles to arrest the five members by force, which Charles intended to carry out personally.[207] However, news of the warrant reached Parliament ahead of him, and the wanted men slipped away by boat shortly before Charles entered the House of Commons with an armed guard on 4 January.[208] Having displaced the Speaker, William Lenthall, from his chair, the king asked him where the MPs had fled. Lenthall, on his knees,[209] famously replied, "May it please your Majesty, I have neither eyes to see nor tongue to speak in this place but as the House is pleased to direct me, whose servant I am here."[210] Charles abjectly declared "all my birds have flown", and was forced to retire, empty-handed.[211]
The botched arrest attempt was politically disastrous for Charles.[212] No English sovereign had ever entered the House of Commons, and his unprecedented invasion of the chamber to arrest its members was considered a grave breach of parliamentary privilege.[213] In one stroke Charles destroyed his supporters' efforts to portray him as a defence against innovation and disorder.[214]
Parliament quickly seized London, and Charles fled the capital for Hampton Court Palace on 10 January,[215] moving two days later to Windsor Castle.[216] After sending his wife and eldest daughter to safety abroad in February, he travelled northwards, hoping to seize the military arsenal at Hull.[217] To his dismay, he was rebuffed by the town's Parliamentary governor, Sir John Hotham, who refused him entry in April, and Charles was forced to withdraw.[218]
