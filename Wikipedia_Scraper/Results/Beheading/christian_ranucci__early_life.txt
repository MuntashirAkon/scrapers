Christian Ranucci was born in Avignon, France on April 6, 1954, to Jean Ranucci, a board painter and veteran of the Indochina War, and Héloïse Mathon, a caregiver.
When he was four years old, he witnessed his father slashing his mother in the face with a knife — similar to the one Ranucci would later use to commit murder[3] — at the door of a court after their divorce had been pronounced. However, other sources, like Ranucci's father, testified that his son did not really witness this attack, but only saw his injured mother as a nursemaid was carrying him in her arms.[4]
Mother and son soon fled, moving home numerous times, as Héloïse Mathon was afraid that her ex-husband would kill them both (although Jean never attempted to find his son). As a result of this experience, she became an overprotective mother. Years later, Ranucci, charged with Rambla's murder, confessed to the examining magistrate that he had lived his entire childhood with the constant fear that his father, depicted as violent by his mother, would eventually find and kill him.[5]
During his school years, Ranucci was described as a mediocre pupil, repeating a year, but still earning his National Diploma (BEPC) at the age of 17. He was often violent towards his schoolmates, and remained immature and uncommunicative as a young man.[6] Meanwhile, he worked as a waiter at a bar, Le Rio Bravo, owned by his mother, located in Saint-Jean-de-Moirans, near Voiron (Isère), which he ran when she was absent.[3]
They had lived in Nice since 1970. Ranucci eventually went to Wittlich, Germany in order to complete his military service, which ended in March 1974. According to testimony by several comrades from his army days, his behaviour was impulsive, and his reactions were sometimes disproportionate.[6] Later, as the murder case against him was unfolding, he was picked out as the abductor and offender of two children from Nice, but this was not pursued, nor formally proven. On May 24, 1974, he was hired by Ets COTTO, a company that made and sold air-conditioning equipment based in Nice, and began working as a door-to-door salesman.[7]
