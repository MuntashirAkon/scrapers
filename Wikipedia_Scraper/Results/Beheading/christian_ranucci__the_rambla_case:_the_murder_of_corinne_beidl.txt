In February 2005 Jean-Baptiste Rambla, Marie-Dolor√®s' brother, was arrested during the investigation into the disappearance of Corinne Beidl, his employer. Rambla had killed her as a result of a violent dispute about his salary. He was convicted of her murder and sentenced to an 18-year prison term in October 2008. According to his lawyers, his behaviour was influenced by drug addiction and the media coverage surrounding the guilt of his sister's murderer.[40]
