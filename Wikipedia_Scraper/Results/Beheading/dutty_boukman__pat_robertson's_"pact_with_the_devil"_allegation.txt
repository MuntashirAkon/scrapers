In the wake of the 2010 Haiti earthquake, veteran Christian radio and television personality Pat Robertson claimed that Haiti had been "cursed by one thing after another" since the late 18th century and, in an apparent reference to the Bois Ca√Øman ceremony, revived the allegation that Haitians had sworn a "pact to the devil."[18][19] This view was criticized by urban legend expert Rich Buehler, who claimed that Robertson's statement was incorrect on a variety of historical points, and propagated a common claim that vodou is Satanic in nature.[20]
Several Mainline and evangelical[21] Christian voices criticized Robertson's remarks as misleading, untimely and insensitive.[22][23][24][25]
