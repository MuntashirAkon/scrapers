^ The 3rd Duke of Somerset was attainted by Parliament on 4 November 1461, and most of his lands had been granted to King Edward IV's brother Richard, Duke of Gloucester, and other Yorkists.[1] 3rd Duke received a general pardon on 10 March 1463,[2] but after his execution Parliament annulled the act restoring him to his dignities, which again became forfeit and were not restored.[3] So although Edmund Beaufort was styled by supporters of the House of Lancaster as 4th Duke of Somerset by act of Parliament he had not legitimate right to use the title. In 1485, some twenty-one years after the death of the 3rd Duke, the 3rd Duke, along with Jasper Tudor, had all acts of attainder against him annulled in the first Parliament of Henry VII, "for their true and faithfull Allegeaunces and Services doune to the said blessed King Herrie [VI]."[4]
