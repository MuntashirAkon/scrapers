a. ^ The Earls of Arundel have been numbered differently depending on whether the claims of the first seven to have been Earls by tenancy are accepted. Edmund FitzAlan was the second member of the FitzAlan family to be definitely styled Earl of Arundel. He is therefore counted variously as the 2nd, 7th or 9th Earl.[1][36]
