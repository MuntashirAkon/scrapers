After participating in the planned rebellion, Edmund became less popular at court. He was still allowed to accompany the king's wife Philippa to her coronation in January 1330, but his appearances at court became less frequent.[2] At this point he became involved in another plot against the court, when he was convinced by rumours that his brother was still alive.[34][g] It later emerged that Roger Mortimer himself was responsible for leading Edmund into this belief, in a form of entrapment.[35] The plot was revealed, and in the parliament of March 1330 Edmund was indicted and condemned to death as a traitor.[34] Upon hearing that the verdict was death, the condemned earl pleaded with Edward III for his life, offering to walk from Winchester to London with a rope around his neck as a sign of atonement. Edward III however knew that leniency was not an option for the aforementioned entrapment utilized by Mortimer could extend to him and potentially be subversive to his own kingship if his father, Edward II truly was alive. Thus Edward III sanctioned the killing of his uncle. It was almost impossible to find anyone willing to perform the execution of a man of royal blood, until a convicted murderer eventually beheaded Edmund in exchange for a pardon.[2] Edmund's body was initially buried in a Franciscan church in Winchester, but it was removed to Westminster Abbey in 1331.[36]
The execution of a royal prince was a great provocation to the seventeen-year-old Edward III, who had not been informed about the decision, and it probably contributed to the king's decision to rise up against his protector.[37] In 1330, Edward III carried out a coup installing himself in personal control of government, and Mortimer was executed.[38] Among the charges against Mortimer was that of procuring Edmund's death, and the charges against the late earl of Kent were annulled.[39] In late 1325, Edmund had married Margaret Wake, sister of Thomas Wake, Baron Wake of Liddell, and the couple had several children.[2] His lands and titles descended on his oldest son by the same name, but this Edmund himself died in October 1331. The earldom then passed to the younger son John.[40]
Edmund was not particularly popular while he was alive, nor did he enjoy a good reputation after his death. His unreliability in political issues, and repeated shifts in allegiance, might have contributed to this. His household was also said to behave in a way that caused popular resentment, taking provisions as they passed through the countryside while offering little compensation.[2] At the same time, it has been pointed out that Edmund showed a great deal of loyalty to Edward II, in spite of receiving relatively little rewards and recognition from his brother.[41]
