With domestic opposition largely neutralised, the king turned his attention to Scotland. A major campaign was organised in August, but the effort ended in total failure when the English were routed by the Scots, led by Robert the Bruce, at the Battle of Old Byland on 14 October 1322.[17] Edward II himself had to flee the battlefield to avoid capture, and Edmund was with him as the royal army retreated to York.[18] The king's inability to handle the Scottish situation was becoming apparent. Andrew Harclay, who had defeated Lancaster at Boroughbridge, and for this had been created Earl of Carlisle and appointed Warden of the Marches to Scotland, signed a peace treaty with the Scots without royal sanction in January 1323.[19] When the king found out, he ordered Harclay's arrest. Edmund was one of the judges who passed judgement on Harclay, who was hanged, drawn and quartered for treason.[2] With Harclay gone, Edmund was given responsibilities for the defence of the northern border, but the situation remained untenable.[8] On 30 May 1323, Edmund was on the council that agreed to a thirteen-year truce with Scotland.[2]
Meanwhile, the English king's possessions in France were coming under threat from the French king. Charles IV of France demanded that Edward again pay homage for his Duchy of Aquitaine,[f] while at the same time threatening to confiscate the duchy under the pretext of a local dispute involving the priory at Saint-Sardos.[20] In April 1324, Edmund and Alexander de Bicknor, Archbishop of Dublin, were sent to France on a diplomatic mission.[21] While some historians have criticised Edmund for his failure to reach a diplomatic settlement,[22] others have pointed to the difficult circumstances he faced, and how others had fared little better.[16] When diplomacy failed, Edmund was appointed Edward's lieutenant in France on 20 July 1324.[2] Though there was a desperate need for reinforcements from England, these never arrived.[23] In the short war that followed, the English lands were quickly overrun by the French, and Edmund was besieged at La RÃ©ole. Here he held out until 22 September, at which point he was forced to surrender and agree to a six-month truce.[23]
