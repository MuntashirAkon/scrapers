Perkin Warbeck, an impostor claimant to the English throne, who claimed to be Edward's son Richard of Shrewsbury, reportedly resembled Edward. The novelist Rosemary Hawley Jarman in her novel "We Speak No Treason" fictionalised unconfirmed speculation that Warbeck could have been another of Edward's illegitimate sons.[57]
