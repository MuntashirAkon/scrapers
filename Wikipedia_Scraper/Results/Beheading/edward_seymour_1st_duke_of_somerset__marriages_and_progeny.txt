Edward Seymour married twice:
Firstly in about 1527, to Catherine Fillol, (or Filliol) (c.1507-1535) a daughter and co-heiress of Sir William Fillol (1453-1527), of Fillol's Hall, Essex and Woodlands, Horton, Dorset.[55] Catherine bore two sons, whose paternity however was questioned by her husband after it was alleged that she had had an affair (possibly with her father-in-law, Sir John Seymour), which resulted in both being excluded in 1540 from their paternal and maternal inheritances and all their claims to their father's dignities being postponed to his children by his second wife.[56] Ironically these two sons remained faithful to their father during his misfortunes and both were imprisoned with him in the Tower of London:

John Seymour (1527 – 19 December 1552), sent to the Tower of London where he died in December 1552,[57] having survived his father by 11 months. He successfully petitioned Parliament for the restoration of his maternal inheritance, but as her lands had been sold, he was awarded compensation in the form of the estate of Maiden Bradley, an Augustinian Priory in Wiltshire granted to his father at the Dissolution of the Monasteries by King Henry VIII, which had descended to his half-siblings.[58] However, he did not live to enjoy the grant and bequeathed it with all his other lands and goods to his younger brother Lord Edward Seymour.
Lord Edward Seymour (1529–1593)[59] of Berry Pomeroy, Devon, Sheriff of Devon.[60] He was sent to the Tower of London in 1551 but was later released, and became heir to his elder brother, from whom he inherited Maiden Bradley, today the seat of his descendant, the present Duke of Somerset.

Secondly, before 9 March 1535, to Anne Stanhope (c.1510-1587), only child and sole heiress of Sir Edward Stanhope (1462-1511) by his wife Elizabeth Bourchier (c.1473-1557), daughter of Fulk Bourchier, 10th Baron FitzWarin (1445-1479). Seymour's suspicions about the fathering of Catherine Fillol's sons led him to pass an Act of Parliament in 1540, entailing his estates away from the children of his first wife in favour of the children of Anne Stanhope.[61] By Anne, he had ten children:

Edward Seymour, Viscount Beauchamp of Hache (12 October 1537 – 1539), known by the courtesy title of one of his father's subsidiary titles. He died as a two-year old infant and predeceased his father.
Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford (22 May 1539 – 1621), in 1559 created Earl of Hertford and Baron Beauchamp of Hatch[2] by Queen Elizabeth I, the half-sister of King Edward VI. He married thrice: firstly in November 1560, Lady Catherine Grey, by whom he had two sons; secondly in 1582 to Frances Howard, daughter of Baron Howard of Effingham; thirdly in 1601 to Frances Prannell.
Lady Anne Seymour (1538–1588), who married twice: firstly to John Dudley, 2nd Earl of Warwick; secondly to Sir Edward Unton, MP, by whom she had issue.
Lord Henry Seymour (1540–?) married Lady Joan Percy, daughter of Thomas Percy, 7th Earl of Northumberland
Lady Margaret Seymour (1540 - ?) a noted Elizabethan author
Lady Jane Seymour (1541–1561) Maid of Honour to Queen Elizabeth I, also a noted Elizabethan author
Lady Catherine Seymour
Lord Edward Seymour (1548–1574), died unmarried and without issue
Lady Mary Seymour (born 1552) married twice:

Firstly (as his second wife) to Andrew Rogers (d.circa 1599), MP,[62] of Bryanstone, Dorset; without progeny. Her nephew Edward Seymour, Lord Beauchamp (1561-1612) later married Andrew's "notorious"[63] sister Honora Rogers, despite the strong opposition of his father Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford (1539-1621). Honora was referred to as "a baggage", and Lord Beauchamp had originally intended to have "but a night’s lodging with her".[63] Honora's son was William Seymour, 2nd Duke of Somerset (1588-1660)
Secondly she married Sir Henry Peyton.


Lady Elizabeth Seymour (1552 – 3 June 1602), who married Sir Richard Knightley, of Fawsley, Northamptonshire

Lady Elizabeth Seymour (1552 – 3 June 1602), who married Sir Richard Knightley, of Fawsley, Northamptonshire
The male line of Edward Seymour and Anne Stanhope died out with the seventh Duke of Somerset in 1750, when the descendants of Edward Seymour by his first wife, Catherine Fillol, inherited the Somerset dukedom in accordance with the Private Act of 1541.[61] However, the female line continued, and Queen Elizabeth II is descended from Somerset through his grandchild by Catherine Grey.
