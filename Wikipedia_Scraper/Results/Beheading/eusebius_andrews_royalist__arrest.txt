Barnard had been the spy of the council, and had only delayed the arrest of Andrews that other cavaliers might be, through him, decoyed to a like ruin. On his arrival in London, Andrews was examined by President Bradshaw, Sir Henry Mildmay, and Thomas Scot, with a view of extorting admissions to be used against others. Disappointed in this, they committed him to the Tower of London on a charge of treason in endeavouring to subvert the government; and the evidence of this design was furnished by the "Narrative" he had himself handed in. Andrews charged Bradshaw with setting spies to trepan him, and Bradshaw acknowledged and defended the practice. Andrews was kept close prisoner for sixteen weeks. As prisoners then had to bear their own expenses, "his score for necessaries was swollen beyond his ability to discharge", and "his friends were not permitted to visit or relieve him" (a few persons were allowed to see him on law business only in the presence of the lieutenant).[1] Having vainly petitioned the council four times for a pardon or a speedy trial, he addressed the same prayer to the parliament. The answer was his arraignment before the high court of justice on 16 August, where the attorney-general, Edmund Prideaux, urged his condemnation on the evidence of his own "Narrative".
