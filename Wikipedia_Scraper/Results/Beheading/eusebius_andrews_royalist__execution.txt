Andrews demurred to the jurisdiction of the tribunal, as a mere court-martial, not a court of record—'having power only to condemn, not to acquit'—and established in contravention of Magna Carta, the Petition of Right, and the promise made by the parliament not to interfere with the ordinary course of justice. Prideaux replied 'that they were not at leisure to take notice of his law cases, but only of his confession,' and the inevitable condemnation followed. Andrews had in the meantime again petitioned parliament, but a resolution was passed (19 August) that his confessions and examination having been transmitted to the high court, "it was not fit to interfere further". The usual sentence in treason cases was, however, altered to beheading, and he was executed on Tower Hill 22 August 1650. Andrews met his fate with firmness, kissing the axe (probably that used on the king and Lord Capel), hoping to meet his former masters that day in the presence of the Saviour, and thanking those in power for their courtesy in awarding him a mode of death suitable to his quality. He gave the executioner three pounds (£3)- all he had – as a fee and his last words were, "Lord Jesus, receive me!". His head was struck off at a blow.
