Francis was the only son of Sir Richard Weston of Ufton Court in Berkshire and Sutton Place near Mayford in Surrey[4] and Anne, the daughter of Oliver Sandys of Shere at Dorking in Surrey. In 1526, aged only fifteen, he is listed as a page at court. Although he was twenty years younger than the King, he quickly became a minor member of the King's circle, listed as beating Henry at bowls, tennis, dice and other games.[2] In 1532, he was made a Gentleman of the Privy Chamber, giving him frequent access to the King. Other honours followed, including becoming a Knight of the Bath at the coronation of Anne Boleyn in 1533.[5]
In 1530, he married Anne Pickering, daughter to Sir Christopher Pickering of Killington, Cumberland and by her had a son named Henry, born in 1535. An oak marriage chest with carved heads of Francis and Anne is preserved in Saffron Walden museum, Essex.[6]
