Francis died aged twenty-five when he was accused of committing adultery with Queen Anne Boleyn, treason and plotting to kill the king.[8] There is no evidence to support either of these accusations. Although a myth has arisen in the last twenty years that the men were accused of buggery as well as treason this is unlikely to be true.[6] This myth has arisen solely due to the unsubstantiated theories of Retha Warnicke in her 1989 biography of Anne Boleyn. None of the men were charged with buggery and there were no extant rumours of homosexuality relating to any of them. Francis was beheaded on Tower Hill, just outside the Tower of London, on 17 May 1536 along with his co-accused, George Boleyn, Viscount Rochford, William Brereton, Henry Norris and Mark Smeaton.[9]
