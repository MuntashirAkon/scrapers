Clifton served as Lieutenant of Dover Castle and as Captain of Pontoise, France where he was knighted. He came into an estate at Brabourne, Kent, by his marriage to an heiress, Isabel Herbert. He was Mayor of Canterbury in 1450, served as High Sheriff of Kent for 1439, 1450 and 1458 and represented Kent in the Parliament of 1455.
Clifton was not captain of Pontoise; he was not knighted there. There is no contemporary source that Clifton was ever at Pontoise; Hall is a Tudor historian. He was still an esquire when he became Treasurer of Calais in May 1451, not 1450. (Cal. Patent Rolls, 1446-52, p. 460)
He was briefly Treasurer of the Household of Henry VI and Treasurer of Calais 1450â€“60.
He was declared a traitor for his support of Margaret of Anjou. He took part in and was captured at the Battle of Tewkesbury during the Wars of the Roses and was beheaded in Tewkesbury market place along with other Lancastrian leaders on 6 May 1471.
