Horace Vernet, the King's painter, was ordered to make a drawing of the assassination attempt, which Eugene Louis Lami executed.[13][14] A plaque at n° 50 Boulevard du Temple commemorates the event.
A postmortem examination of Fieschi's brain was carried out by the anatomists Louis Pierre Gratiolet and François Leuret, to determine if it exhibited features that might explain his behavior.[15] Fieschi's death mask is displayed in England at Norwich Castle; the mask shows evidence of the facial and head injuries he received. His Machine infernale is preserved at the Museum of French History.
