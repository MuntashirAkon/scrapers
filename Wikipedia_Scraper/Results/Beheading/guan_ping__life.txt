Guan Ping was the eldest son of Guan Yu. Little about him is documented in historical records except that he was captured along with his father west of Maicheng (麦城, southeast of present-day Dangyang, Hubei) by the forces of Sun Quan in 220. They were executed in Linju (臨沮; in present-day Nanzhang County, Xiangyang, Hubei) later.[2]
