No descriptions of Guan Yu's physical appearance exist in historical records, but his beard was mentioned in the Sanguozhi. Traditionally, he is portrayed as a red-faced warrior with a long lush beard. The idea of his red face may have derived from a description of him in the first chapter of the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, where the following passage appears:
Xuande took a look at the man, who stood at a height of nine chi,[a][3] and had a two chi[b] long beard; his face was of the colour of a dark zao,[c] with lips that were red and plump; his eyes were like those of a crimson phoenix,[d] and his eyebrows resembled reclining silkworms.[e] He had a dignified air and looked quite majestic.
Alternatively, the idea of his red face could have been borrowed from opera representation, where red faces depict loyalty and righteousness.[citation needed] In illustrations of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Guan Yu is traditionally depicted wearing a green robe over his body armour.
Supposedly, Guan Yu's weapon was a guan dao named Green Dragon Crescent Blade, which resembled a glaive and was said to weigh 82 catties (about 18.25 kg or 40 lbs). A wooden replica can be found today in the Emperor Guan Temple in Xiezhou County, Shanxi.
