After a lengthy pre-trial process, Djandoubi eventually appeared in court in Aix-en-Provence on charges of torture-murder, rape, and premeditated violence on February 24, 1977. His main defense revolved around the supposed effects of the amputation of his leg six years earlier which his lawyer claimed had driven him to a paroxysm of alcohol abuse and violence, turning him into a different man.
On February 25 he was sentenced to death. An appeal against his sentence was rejected on June 9. In the early morning of September 10, 1977, twelve days before his 28th birthday, Djandoubi was informed that he, like the child murderers Christian Ranucci (guillotined on July 28, 1976) and Jérôme Carrein (guillotined on June 23, 1977), had not received a reprieve from President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing. Shortly afterwards, at 4:40 a.m., he was executed by guillotine at Baumettes Prison in Marseille.
While Djandoubi was the last person executed in France, he was not the last condemned.[5] No more executions occurred after capital punishment was abolished in France in 1981 following the election of François Mitterrand.[6]
