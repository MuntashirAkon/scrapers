Somerset had a son, Charles, with a mistress named Joan Hill. Charles, who was given the family name of Somerset, was later created Earl of Worcester in 1514. From him descend the Earls and Marquesses of Worcester and later the Dukes of Beaufort,[12] who are the last known male-line descendants of the Plantagenets and the Second House of the Counts of Anjou.[citation needed]
