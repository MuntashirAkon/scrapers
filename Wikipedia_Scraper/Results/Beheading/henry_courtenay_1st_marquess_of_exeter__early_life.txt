At the time of his birth in 1498 his paternal grandfather Edward Courtenay, 1st Earl of Devon (died 1509) was still living and Henry's father William Courtenay was his eldest son and heir apparent. In 1504, during the reign of the Tudor King Henry VII, William Courtenay was accused of maintaining correspondence with Edmund de la Pole, 3rd Duke of Suffolk, the leading Yorkist claimant to the throne, and the king ordered him incarcerated in the Tower of London and he was attainted in February 1504, which disabled him from inheriting his father's Earldom.[7]
King Henry VII died on 22 April 1509 closely followed by Edward Courtenay, 1st Earl of Devon, on 28 May 1509. The king was succeeded by his son King Henry VIII, the nephew of William Courtenay's wife, who released William from the Tower. On 24 June 1509 William took part in the coronation of Henry VIII and carried the Third Sword[8] during the ceremony. William enjoyed some favour with Henry VIII who reversed his attainder on 9 May 1511 and created him Earl of Devon on 10 May 1511, with the usual remainder to heirs male of his body.[9] William died a month later on 9 June 1511, before completing his official investiture as an Earl, but was by royal warrant buried with the honours due to an Earl. He left Henry Courtenay as his heir.
