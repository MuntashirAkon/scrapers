On 18 June 1525 Henry VIII created Henry Courtenay (as "Earl of Devon, Dominus of Okehampton and Plympton" (i.e. feudal baron of Okehampton and feudal baron of Plympton)),[17] Marquess of Exeter.[18] At that time Francis I of France had lost the Battle of Pavia and was held captive by Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. Henry VIII sent the new Marquess of Exeter to secure an agreement with French Regent Louise of Savoy and to pledge the assistance of the English king in negotiations for the return of Francis.
The Marquess of Exeter further served the interests of the King in the proceedings for the annulment of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon and signed the letter to Pope Clement VII in that regard.[19] He was placed second to the King at the Privy Council at which Cardinal Thomas Wolsey was charged with treason and signed the documents for his prosecution. He served as a commissioner for the formal deposition of Catherine in 1533.[20]
During the preparation of his Dissolution of the Monasteries, Henry VIII granted to Courtenay the stewardship of several monasteries[21] in 1535, which placed him in a key position for the forthcoming process. In 1536 Courtenay was a commissioner at the trial of Anne Boleyn,[22] the king's second wife who had been accused of adultery, incest, and high treason.
Courtenay and Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk were sent into Yorkshire to put down the Pilgrimage of Grace,[23] a Roman Catholic uprising that broke out on 15 October 1536. Courtenay failed in this task and retreated to Devonshire. On 15 May 1537 he served as High Steward at the trial for treason of Thomas Darcy, 1st Baron Darcy de Darcy,[24] a leader of the rebellion.
