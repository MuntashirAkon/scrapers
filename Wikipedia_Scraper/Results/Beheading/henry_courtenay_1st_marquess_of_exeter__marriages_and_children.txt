Henry Courtenay married twice:
Firstly, shortly after June 1515,[33] to Elizabeth Grey, suo jure Viscountess Lisle (1505–1519), the only child and sole heiress of John Grey, 2nd Viscount Lisle by his wife Muriel Howard, daughter of Thomas Howard, 2nd Duke of Norfolk.[34] Elizabeth had been the ward of Charles Brandon, later 1st Duke of Suffolk, and was betrothed to him when she was only eight years old. The betrothal was broken when Brandon married Mary Tudor, sister to Henry VIII. At this time, she became ward of Catherine of York, who betrothed Elizabeth to her son, Henry Courtenay. She died soon after the marriage without children.[35]
Secondly, on 25 October 1519,[36] he married Gertrude Blount (c.1499/1502 – 25 September 1558[37]), a daughter of William Blount, 4th Baron Mountjoy. She was arrested on 5 November 1538 with her husband and was attainted as his widow in July 1539, and imprisoned for several years until her attainder was reversed by Queen Mary, to whom she became a lady in waiting. She died on 25 September 1558 and was buried in Wimborne Minster in Dorset.[38] By Gertrude Blount he had two sons:

Henry Courtenay, who died young;
Edward Courtenay, 1st Earl of Devon (c. 1527 – 18 September 1556), eldest surviving son, who having spent 15 years incarcerated in the Tower of London was released on 3 August 1553, a few days after the accession of Queen Mary to the throne. She created him Earl of Devon on 3 September 1553.[39]
