Before 1530, Grey was betrothed to Catherine FitzAlan, the daughter of William FitzAlan, 18th Earl of Arundel, whom he later refused to marry.[1]
In 1533, with the permission of King Henry VIII he married Lady Frances Brandon (1517–1559), the daughter of Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk by his wife Mary Tudor, the sister of King Henry VIII. By his wife he had no surviving male progeny, only three daughters and co-heiresses:
Lady Jane Grey (1537–1554)
Lady Catherine Grey (1540–1568)
Lady Mary Grey (1545–1578)
