^ Note: The idea that he and Mary had a child in 1382 (Edward of England) (born and died April 1382 retrieved fromMarek, Miroslav. "anjou/anjou6.html#H4)". genealogy.euweb.cz. [self-published source][better source needed] is based on a misreading of an account which was published in an erroneous form by JH Wylie in the 19th century. It missed a line which made clear that the boy in question was the son of Thomas of Woodstock. The attribution of the name Edward to this boy is conjecture based on the fact that Henry was the grandson of Edward III and idolised his uncle Edward of Woodstock yet did not call any of his sons Edward. However, there is no evidence that there was any child at this time (when Mary de Bohun was twelve), let alone that he was called Edward. See appendix 2 in Ian Mortimer's book The Fears of Henry IV.
