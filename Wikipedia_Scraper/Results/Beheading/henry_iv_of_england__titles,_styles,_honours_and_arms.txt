Henry Bolingbroke
Henry, Earl of Derby (by courtesy until his father's death)
Henry, Earl of Derby and Northampton – restored 1384 to his father-in-law's earldom
Henry, Duke of Hereford – after the punishment of the Lords Appellant
Henry, Duke of Lancaster – upon his father's death
Henry IV, King of England and France, Lord of Ireland - by deposition of his cousin King Richard II
Before his father's death in 1399, Henry bore the arms of the kingdom, differenced by a label of five points ermine. After his father's death, the difference changed to a label of five points per pale ermine and France.[25] Upon his accession as king, Henry updated the arms of the kingdom to match an update in those of royal France – from a field of fleur-de-lys to just three.
