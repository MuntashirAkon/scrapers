In 1390 Scrope accompanied John Beaufort, half-brother of the future King Henry IV, on the Barbary Crusade to Mahdia, but otherwise little is known of his early life.[4] An annuity granted to him by King Richard II was continued by Henry IV after Richard's deposition, and in 1403 Scrope was styled 'king's knight', and fought on Henry IV's side at the Battle of Shrewsbury.[5] His uncle, Richard Scrope, Archbishop of York, was executed on 8 June 1405 for taking part in the Northern Rising against the King;[6] however Henry Scrope was not involved in his uncle's failed rebellion, and was serving the King in Wales when he inherited his father's title and lands in 1406.[7] In 1408 he accompanied Henry IV's daughter, Philippa, to Denmark for her marriage,[8] and in 1409 went to Paris on a diplomatic mission with Henry IV's half-brother, Henry Beaufort.[9]
According to Tait, it was during this period that Scrope came to enjoy the friendship and confidence of the future Henry V, by whose influence he was appointed Treasurer of England in 1410, and made a Knight of the Garter in the same year.[10]
Henry V succeeded his father in 1413, and in 1413 Scrope was sent on several diplomatic missions.[11] In 1414 he accompanied Bishop Henry Chichele to Burgundy to negotiate an alliance.[12]
