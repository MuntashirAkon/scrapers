A number of Vane's speeches to Parliament and other bodies were printed during his lifetime or shortly after, including The Speech Intended to Have been Spoken on the Scaffold, published in 1662.[202]
Vane's other printed works include:[203]
A Brief Answer to a Certain Declaration, 1637
The Retired Man's Meditations, 1655
A Healing Question Propounded, 1656
Of Love of God and Union with God, 1657?
The Proceeds of the Protector ... Against Sir Henry Vane, Knight, 1658
A Needful Corrective or Balance in Popular Government, 1659
Two Treatises: "Epistle General to the Mystical Body of Christ" and "The Face of the Times", 1662
The Cause of the People of England Stated, 1689 (written 1660-1662; the title may have been intended to be "Case" instead of "Cause")
A Pilgrimage into the Land of Promise, 1664
The Trial of Sir Henry Vane, Knight, 1662
The last work contains, in addition to his last speech and details relating to the trial, The People's Case Stated, The Valley of Jehoshaphat, and Meditations concerning Man's Life.[204]
Some contemporary works were incorrectly attributed to him. Clarendon, in his History of the Rebellion, assigns to Vane credit for one speech in support of the Self-Denying Ordinance; later historians find this attribution spurious. The Speech against Richard Cromwell is probably the composition of a later writer,[202] while The Light Shining out of Darkness may have been written by Henry Stubbe.[204]
