Henry VII died on 21 April 1509, and the 17-year-old Henry succeeded him as king. Soon after his father's burial on 10 May, Henry suddenly declared that he would indeed marry Catherine, leaving unresolved several issues concerning the papal dispensation and a missing part of the marriage portion.[17][20] The new king maintained that it had been his father's dying wish that he marry Catherine.[19] Whether or not this was true, it was certainly convenient. Emperor Maximilian I had been attempting to marry his granddaughter (and Catherine's niece) Eleanor to Henry; she had now been jilted.[21] Henry's wedding to Catherine was kept low-key and was held at the friar's church in Greenwich on 11 June 1509.[20] On 23 June 1509, Henry led the now 23-year-old Catherine from the Tower of London to Westminster Abbey for their coronation, which took place the following day.[22] It was a grand affair: the king's passage was lined with tapestries and laid with fine cloth.[22] Following the ceremony, there was a grand banquet in Westminster Hall.[23] As Catherine wrote to her father, "our time is spent in continuous festival".[20]
Two days after Henry's coronation, he arrested his father's two most unpopular ministers, Sir Richard Empson and Edmund Dudley. They were charged with high treason and were executed in 1510. Historian Ian Crofton has maintained that such executions would become Henry's primary tactic for dealing with those who stood in his way; the two executions were certainly not the last.[5] Henry also returned to the public some of the money supposedly extorted by the two ministers.[24] By contrast, Henry's view of the House of York – potential rival claimants for the throne – was more moderate than his father's had been. Several who had been imprisoned by his father, including the Marquess of Dorset, were pardoned.[25] Others (most notably Edmund de la Pole) went unreconciled; de la Pole was eventually beheaded in 1513, an execution prompted by his brother Richard siding against the king.[26]
Soon after, Catherine conceived, but the child, a girl, was stillborn on 31 January 1510. About four months later, Catherine again became pregnant.[27] On New Year's Day 1511, the child – Henry – was born. After the grief of losing their first child, the couple were pleased to have a boy and festivities were held,[28] including a two-day joust known as the 1511 Westminster Tournament. However, the child died seven weeks later.[27] Catherine had two stillborn sons in 1514 and 1515, but gave birth in February 1516 to a girl, Mary. Relations between Henry and Catherine had been strained, but they eased slightly after Mary's birth.[29]
Although Henry's marriage to Catherine has since been described as "unusually good",[30] it is known that Henry took mistresses. It was revealed in 1510 that Henry had been conducting an affair with one of the sisters of Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham, either Elizabeth or Anne Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon.[31] The most significant mistress for about three years, starting in 1516, was Elizabeth Blount.[29] Blount is one of only two completely undisputed mistresses, few for a virile young king.[32][33] Exactly how many Henry had is disputed: David Loades believes Henry had mistresses "only to a very limited extent",[33] whilst Alison Weir believes there were numerous other affairs.[34] Catherine did not protest, and in 1518 fell pregnant again with another girl, who was also stillborn.[29] Blount gave birth in June 1519 to Henry's illegitimate son, Henry FitzRoy.[29] The young boy was made Duke of Richmond in June 1525 in what some thought was one step on the path to his eventual legitimisation.[35] In 1533, FitzRoy married Mary Howard, but died childless three years later.[36] At the time of Richmond's death in June 1536, Parliament was enacting the Second Succession Act, which could have allowed him to become king.[37]
