Henry married his last wife, the wealthy widow Catherine Parr, in July 1543.[133] A reformer at heart, she argued with Henry over religion. Ultimately, Henry remained committed to an idiosyncratic mixture of Catholicism and Protestantism; the reactionary mood which had gained ground following the fall of Cromwell had neither eliminated his Protestant streak nor been overcome by it.[134] Parr helped reconcile Henry with his daughters, Mary and Elizabeth.[135] In 1543, an Act of Parliament put them back in the line of succession after Edward. The same act allowed Henry to determine further succession to the throne in his will.[136]
