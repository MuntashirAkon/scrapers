Like his father, the younger Despenser was accused of widespread criminality. Examples include:
Theft from relatives: Despenser seized the Welsh lands of his wife's inheritance, ignoring the claims of his two brothers-in-law and cheated his sister-in-law Elizabeth de Clare out of Gower and Usk
Theft: forced Alice de Lacy, Countess of Lincoln, to give up her lands
Torture: he had Lady Baret's arms and legs broken until she went insane
Murder: unlawfully killing a prisoner (Llywelyn Bren) who was awaiting trial[7]
Piracy: during his exile he became a pirate in the English Channel, "a sea monster, lying in wait for merchants as they crossed the sea"[8]
False imprisonment and death threats: he imprisoned Sir William Cokerell in the Tower of London, where Cokerell was forced to pay to save his life[9]
