Hugh le Despenser the Younger tried to starve himself before his trial,[11] but he did face trial on 24 November 1326, in Hereford, before Mortimer and the Queen. In Froissart's account of the execution, Despenser was then tied firmly to a ladder, and—in full view of the crowd—had his genitals sliced off and burned in his still-conscious sight, then his entrails slowly pulled out, and, finally, his heart cut out and thrown into the fire. Froissart (or rather Jean le Bel's chronicle, on which he relied) is the only source to mention castration specifically; other contemporary accounts have Despenser hanged, drawn and quartered, which usually did not involve castration.[12]
Finally, his corpse was beheaded, his body cut into four pieces, and his head mounted on the gates of London.[2]
