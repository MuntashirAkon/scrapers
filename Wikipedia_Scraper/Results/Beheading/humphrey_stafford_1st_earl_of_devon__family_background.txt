The Staffords of Hooke in Dorset and Southwick in Wiltshire were a cadet branch of the earls of Stafford and later dukes of Buckingham. Humphrey's grandfather was another Humphrey Stafford, called Sir Humphrey "of the silver hand" (d. 1442).[b] His heir was a grandson – yet another Humphrey Stafford – who died childless in 1461. This left Humphrey Stafford, the future Earl of Devon, heir to the family lands, the greatest part of which was in Dorset and the rest mostly in Somerset and Wiltshire. Humphrey's father, William, was already dead by this time, having fallen victim to Cade's rebellion on 18 June 1450.[2] William's uncle, and Humphrey's great uncle, was John Stafford, Archbishop of Canterbury (1443–1452).[3]
The inheritance of these family lands made Stafford the greatest landowner in the county of Dorset. Through his mother Katherine, he was also heir to the possessions of her father John Chidiock, another major south-western landowner.[3] At some point – definitely after 21 June 1450 – he married Isabel, daughter of Sir John Barre of Herefordshire.[2]
