He married Emmeline Crowmer (1398 – 5 January 1452), daughter of William Cromer, twice Lord Mayor of London.[4] Their children included:
Elizabeth de Fiennes (1348 – 1386), married first her maternal uncle Sir William Cromer (c.1422 – 1450), Lord of Turnstall, then secondly to Alexander Iden, Lord of Westwell, both of whom attained the position of High Sheriff of Kent; and
William de Fiennes, 2nd Baron Saye and Sele (b. circa 1428 at Broughton Castle, Broughton, Bloxham Hundred, Oxfordshire; d. 1471 during the Battle of Barnet, Barnet, then in Hertfordshire).
James appears as a named character in the historical play Henry VI, Part 2, written by the famed English bard, William Shakespeare. His son William was an actual participant in the War of the Roses, and in the decisive Battle of Barnet referenced in the final part of Shakespeare's trilogy, Henry VI, Part 3.
