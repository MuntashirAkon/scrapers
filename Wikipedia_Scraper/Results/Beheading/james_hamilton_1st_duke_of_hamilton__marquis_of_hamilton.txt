In 1625 the 2nd Marquis died[2] at Whitehall of a seizure. His death was blamed on fever, although the speed of his death and his age, thirty-six, made many suspect poison.[citation needed] King James died three weeks later. The new Marquis received all his father's titles, and also the same annuity his father had received from the court of Â£2500 sterling. At the coronation of King Charles I, Hamilton bore the Sword of State at Westminster Abbey.[4]
In 1628, Hamilton, was made a Gentleman of the Bedchamber, Knight of the Garter, a privy councillor in both England and Scotland, and in the same year was made Master of the Horse, a post he stayed in until 1644.:[5] He represented the King of Bohemia at the baptism of the infant Prince Charles.[6]
