James was born in 1606 at Hamilton Palace in Lanarkshire, the son of James, Marquis of Hamilton, and the Lady Ann Cunningham, daughter of James, Earl of Glencairn. Following the death of his insane great-uncle James, Earl of Arran in 1609, the infant was styled Earl of Arran.[1]
The young Earl of Arran's close ancestor was the Princess Mary, daughter to James II of Scotland and Mary of Gueldres. After the death in 1612 of Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, James became third in line to the throne of Scotland, after Charles, Duke of Rothesay, and his sister Elizabeth.
James VI's first visit to Scotland since the Union of the Crowns occurred in early 1617, whilst in Scotland, he was apparently charmed by the Marquis, and invited him to court in London. The Marquis duly arrived in London in August of that year, with his eleven-year-old son. Although like most Noblemen's sons of the time he had a private tutor, James Bale, Arran's time spent at court in the ensuing years did not consist of much formal education.[citation needed] To remedy this, Arran was sent to Exeter College, Oxford; he matriculated on 14 December 1621.[2]
The Duke was interested in art from a young age and collected Venetian paintings through his agent Viscount Basil Feilding.[3] An inventory of his collection was made sometime after Charles I's retreat from London in November 1642 and before 12 April 1643, which included 600 entries, of which half were Venetian paintings from the collections of Bartolomeo della Nave and others.[3] A good portion of this collection later came into the hands of the Archduke Leopold Wilhelm in Brussels and forms the core of the Kunsthistorisches Museum today.
The Marquis meanwhile had been intriguing with George, Duke of Buckingham. Like all ambitious upstarts at court, Buckingham was keen to consolidate his new-found fortunes by allying himself and his family with established and wealthy families. Buckingham proposed to wed Arran to his niece Mary, daughter to William, Viscount Feilding, an undistinguished Warwickshire Squire.[citation needed] Hamilton, despite his misgivings regarding Buckingham's lowly origins was impressed enough by his influence with the King, to accept his suggestion.[citation needed] On 16 June 1622 the fifteen-year-old Arran married 9-year old Mary Feilding in the presence of the King.[citation needed] Arran was not consulted and later came to bitterly resent it.[citation needed]
