Lord Derby was a man of deep religious feeling and of great nobility of character, who though unsuccessful in the field served the king's cause with single-minded purpose and without expectation of reward. His political usefulness was handicapped in the later stages of the struggle by his dislike of the Scots, whom he regarded as guilty of Charles I's death and as unfit instruments of the Restoration. According to Clarendon he was "a man of great honour and clear courage", and his defects the result of too little knowledge of the world.[3]
