Lord Derby married on 26 June 1626 Charlotte (1599–1664), daughter of Claude, duc de Thouars and Countess Charlotte Brabantina of Nassau.[3] Her maternal grandparents were William the Silent and Charlotte of Bourbon. They were parents of four daughters and five sons:[3]
Charles (1628–1672) his first son and heir.[3]
Charlotte (died young)
two sons (died young)
Henriette (17 November 1630 – 27 December 1685), married William Wentworth, 2nd Earl of Strafford, died without issue
Amelia (1633 – 22 February 1702/3), married John Murray, 1st Marquess of Atholl.
Edward (7 January 1639 – October 1664), unmarried
William (18 October 1640 – 25 October 1670), unmarried
Catherine, married Henry Pierrepont, 1st Marquess of Dorchester, died without issue
Charles's two sons, William, the 9th Earl (c. 1655–1702), and James, the 10th Earl (1664–1736), both died without sons, and consequently, when James died in February 1736, his titles and estates passed to Sir Edward Stanley (1689–1776), a descendant of the 1st Earl. The Earls of Derby are his descendants.[3] Meanwhile, the Barony of Strange passed in 1736 to the 2nd Duke of Atholl, grandson of James's daughter Amelia (see above).[citation needed]
