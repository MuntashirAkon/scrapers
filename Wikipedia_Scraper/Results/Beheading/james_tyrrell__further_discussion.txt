In a television programme first broadcast on Channel 4 in the UK on 21 March 2015, the historian David Starkey announced as his the discovery in royal records that both Henry VII and his wife Elizabeth, the sister of Edward V and Richard Duke of York, were present throughout Tyrrell's trial.
Contemporary documents originally retrieved by scholar Rosemary Horrox record the king and queen were lodged in the Royal Apartments at the Tower during Tyrrell's trial, which was not held at the Tower itself.[13] Starkey assumed this as validating More's account of Tyrrell's alleged confession and argued that it finally confirmed him as the man who oversaw the murder of the Queen's brothers, presumably at behest of Tyrrell's overlord Richard III. However, the programme ended without any proof, other explanations or rebuttals being offered for Starkey's assumptions and speculations.
