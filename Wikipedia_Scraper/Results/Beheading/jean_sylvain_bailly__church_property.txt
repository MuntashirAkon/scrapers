In an unsuccessful attempt at financial reconstruction, the National Assembly had taken control of church property, making it available to buyers through the issue of non-negotiable bonds known as "assignats".[4]:53 Bailly, along with the Municipal Bureau, then came up with a proposition on March 10, 1790, asking the government to give the city of Paris 200,000,000 livres worth of church land for it to sell to private investors in a period of three years. For their work in selling the land, Bailly and his administration would retain 50,000,000 livres. The National Assembly agreed to this deal.[4]:53â€“54 In August 1790, Bailly allowed investors to begin the purchasing of church property.[4]:55 A year had yet to pass before 28,000,000 livres worth of land had already been sold.[4]:56 Bailly's proposal proved successful in generating revenue for Paris and the French state.
