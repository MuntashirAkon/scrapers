In July 1793, Bailly left Nantes to join his friend Pierre Simon Laplace at Melun, but was there recognised and arrested. On 14 October, he was pressed to testify against Marie Antoinette but refused. On 10 November 1793, he was brought before the Revolutionary Tribunal in Paris, speedily tried, and sentenced to death the next day. On 12 November 1793, he was guillotined at Champ de Mars, a site selected symbolically as the location of his betrayal of the democratic movement. The little red flag he had used to give the order to fire on the crowds on the Champs de Mars was tied to the cart that took him to his death, and burned in front of him before he was executed.[11] It was the revival of this event after 10 August in 1793 along with the persecution of Marat that led to the death of Bailly.[9]:213 He was forced to endure the freezing rain and the insults of a howling mob. When a scoffer shouted, "Tu trembles, Bailly?" ("Do you tremble, Bailly?"), he stoically responded, "Oui, mais c'est seulement de froid." ("Yes, but it is only the cold.") In the words of the 1911 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, "He met his death with patient dignity; having, indeed, disastrously shared the enthusiasms of his age, but taken no share in its crimes."
