Bailly was a member of the Club de 1789, one of the most well-known societies at the time.[4]:98 Though calls on his time from his mayoral duties restricted his involvement in the group, by May 1790, Bailly had risen to presiding officer of the club. In 1791, Jean Sylvain Bailly joined the Jacobin Club, but no active role was taken by him.
