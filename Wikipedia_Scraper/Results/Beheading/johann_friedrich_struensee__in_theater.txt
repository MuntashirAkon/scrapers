Michael Meyerbeer wrote a play called Struensee (Stuttgart and TÃ¼bingen: Cotta 1829, premiered in Munich in 1828), based on the eponymous character's life, to which his brother Giacomo Meyerbeer wrote music. The play was originally forbidden under the rule of the Prussian King Frederick William III, and finally allowed by his more liberal successor Frederick William IV and premiered in Berlin in 1856.[9]
