Some sources claim that the body of Thomas Bradshaw had previously been removed by his son, James or John Bradshaw,[12][13] who re-buried his father's remains on a hill near Martha's Brae on Jamaica and marked the spot with a cannon. A location now known as "Gun Hill" is 2.5 miles south-west of the northern port city of Falmouth, in Trelawny Parish. One of the three men had children who removed to Highland County, Virginia. James Bradshaw acquired the land in Jamaica where his father's remains were buried. Several sources recorded an inscription with the cannon found on Gun Hill, Jamaica, and associate the quote that Rebellion to tyrants is obedience to God to John Bradshaw.[14]
