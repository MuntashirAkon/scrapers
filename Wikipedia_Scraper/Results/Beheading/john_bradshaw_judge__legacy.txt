While some political philosophers have defended Bradshaw,[15] most legal authorities have taken the narrow legal view expressed in 1999 by Michael Kirby (then a Justice of the High Court of Australia) that the High Court of Justice for the trial of Charles I of which Bradshaw as president was illegal,[16] however in his 2005 book The Tyrannicide Brief (a detailed biograph of John Cook, the prosecutor at the trial), Geoffrey Robertson Q.C. put forward the argument that while the court was illegal due to the political settlement reached at the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660, the trial anticipated the developments in humanitarian law in the second half of the 20th century, and that the leading participants in the trial are to be admired rather than condemned.[17][18][19]
