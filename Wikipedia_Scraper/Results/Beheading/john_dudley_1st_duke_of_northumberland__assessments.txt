A black legend about the Duke of Northumberland was already in the making when he was still in power, the more after his fall.[205] From the last days of Henry VIII he was to have planned, years in advance, the destruction of both King Edward's Seymour uncles—Lord Thomas and the Protector—as well as Edward himself.[206] He also served as an indispensable scapegoat: It was the most practical thing for Queen Mary to believe that Dudley had been acting all alone and it was in nobody's interest to doubt it.[207] Further questions were unwelcome, as Charles V's ambassadors found out: "it was thought best not to inquire too closely into what had happened, so as to make no discoveries that might prejudice those [who tried the duke]".[208] By renouncing the Protestantism he had so conspicuously stood for, Northumberland lost every respect and became ineligible for rehabilitation in a world dominated by thinking along sectarian lines.[209] Protestant writers like John Foxe and John Ponet concentrated on the pious King Edward's achievements and reinvented Somerset as the "good Duke"—it followed that there had also to be a "wicked Duke".[210] This interpretation was enhanced by the High and Late Victorian historians, James Anthony Froude and A. F. Pollard, who saw Somerset as a champion of political liberty whose desire "to do good"[211] was thwarted by, in Pollard's phrase, "the subtlest intriguer in English History".[50]
As late as 1968/1970, W.K. Jordan embraced this good duke/bad duke dichotomy in a two-volume study of Edward VI's reign.[212] However, he saw the King on the verge of assuming full authority at the beginning of 1553 (with Dudley contemplating retirement) and ascribed the succession alteration to Edward's resolution, Northumberland playing the part of the loyal and tragic enforcer instead of the original instigator.[213] Many historians have since seen the "devise" as Edward's very own project.[note 6] Others, while remarking upon the plan's sloppy implementation,[214] have seen Northumberland as behind the scheme, yet in concord with Edward's convictions; the Duke acting out of despair for his own survival,[50] or to rescue political and religious reform and save England from Habsburg domination.[215]
Since the 1970s, critical reassessments of the Duke of Somerset's policies and government style led to acknowledgment that Northumberland revitalised and reformed the Privy Council as a central part of the administration,[216] and that he "took the necessary but unpopular steps to hold the minority regime together".[217] Stability and reconstruction have been made out as the mark of most of his policies;[218] the scale of his motivation ranging from "determined ambition"[219] with G.R. Elton in 1977 to "idealism of a sort" with Diarmaid MacCulloch in 1999.[220] Dale Hoak concluded in 1980: "given the circumstances which he inherited in 1549, the duke of Northumberland appears to have been one of the most remarkably able governors of any European state during the sixteenth century."[221]
John Dudley's recantation of his Protestant faith before his execution delighted Queen Mary and enraged Lady Jane Grey.[199] The general opinion, especially among Protestants, was that he tried to seek a pardon by this move.[222] Historians have often believed that he had no faith whatsoever, being a mere cynic.[223] Further explanations—both contemporary and modern—have been that Northumberland sought to rescue his family from the axe,[224] that, in the face of catastrophe, he found a spiritual home in the church of his childhood,[225] or that he saw the hand of God in Mary's success.[226] Although he endorsed the Reformation from at least the mid-1530s,[10] Dudley may not have understood theological subtleties, being a "simple man in such matters".[199] The Duke was stung by an outspoken letter he received from John Knox, whom he had invited to preach before the King and in vain had offered a bishopric. William Cecil was informed:[227]
I love not to have to do with men which be neither grateful nor pleasable. I assure you I mind to have no more to do with him but to wish him well ... he cannot tell whether I be a dissembler in religion or not ... for my own part, if I should have passed more upon the speech of the people than upon the service of my master ... I needed not to have had so much obloquy of some kind of men; but the living God, that knoweth the hearts of all men, shall be my judge at the last day with what zeal, faith, and truth I serve my master.[228]
Northumberland was not an old-style peer, despite his aristocratic ancestry and existence as a great lord.[229] He acquired, sold, and exchanged lands, but never strove to build himself a territorial power base or a large armed force of retainers (which proved fatal in the end).[230] His maximum income of £4,300 p.a. from land and a £2,000 p.a. from annuities and fees, was appropriate to his rank and figured well below the annuity of £5,333 p.a. the Duke of Somerset had granted himself, thus reaching an income of over £10,000 p.a. while in office.[231] John Dudley was a typical Tudor Crown servant, self-interested but absolutely loyal to the incumbent sovereign: The monarch's every wish was law.[232] This uncritical stance may have played a decisive role in Northumberland's decision to implement Edward's succession device, as it did in his attitude towards Mary when she had become Queen.[233] The fear his services could be inadequate or go unacknowledged by the monarch was constant in Dudley,[234] who also was very sensitive on what he called "estimation", meaning status.[235] Edmund Dudley was unforgotten: "my poor father's fate who, after his master was gone, suffered death for doing his master's commandments", the Duke wrote to Cecil nine months before his own end.[236]
John Dudley was an imposing figure with a strong temperament who could also charm people with his courtesy and a graceful presence.[237] He was a family man, an understanding father and husband who was passionately loved by his wife.[238] Frequent phases of illness, partly due to a stomach ailment, occasioned long absences from court but did not reduce his high output of paperwork, and may have had an element of hypochondria in them.[239] The English diplomat Richard Morrison wrote of his onetime superior: "This Earl had such a head that he seldom went about anything but he had three or four purposes beforehand."[240] A French eyewitness of 1553 described him as "an intelligent man who could explain his ideas and who displayed an impressive dignity. Others, who did not know him, would have considered him worthy of a kingdom."[41]
