The 16 executors of Henry VIII's will also embodied the Regency Council that had been appointed to rule collectively during Edward VI's minority.[36] The new Council agreed on making Edward Seymour, Earl of Hertford Lord Protector with full powers, which in effect were those of a prince.[37] At the same time the Council awarded themselves a round of promotions based on Henry VIII's wishes; the Earl of Hertford became the Duke of Somerset and John Dudley was created Earl of Warwick.[38][note 1] The new Earl had to pass on his post of Lord Admiral to Somerset's brother, Thomas Seymour, but advanced to Lord Great Chamberlain. Perceived as the most important man next the Protector, he was on friendly terms with Somerset,[39] who soon reopened the war with Scotland. Dudley accompanied him as second-in-command with a taste for personal combat.[40] On one occasion he fought his way out of an ambush and, spear in hand, chased his Scottish counterpart for some 250 yards (230Â m), nearly running him through.[41] In the Battle of Pinkie Dudley led the vanguard, being "one of the key architects of the English victory".[42]
The Protector's agrarian policy and proclamations were inspired by a group of intellectuals sometimes called "the commonwealth men". These were highly critical of landlords and left many commoners with the impression that enclosures were unlawful.[43] As one of England's major landowners, Dudley soon feared that this would lead to serious trouble and discreetly tried to warn Somerset.[44] By the summer of 1549 there was widespread unrest or even rebellion all over England.[45] The Marquess of Northampton had been unable to restore order in and around Norwich,[46] so John Dudley was sent to get hold of Kett's Rebellion. Dudley offered Robert Kett a pardon on the condition that the peasant army disband at once. This was rejected and the next night Dudley stormed the rebel-held city with a small mercenary contingent and drove the rebels out after fierce street fighting; 49 prisoners he had immediately hanged. Two days later Kett, who had his main camp outside the city, confronted the royal army, resulting in a slaughter of over 2,000 peasants. In the following weeks Dudley conducted courts-martial which executed many rebels, perhaps up to 300.[47] For the enraged and humiliated local gentry this was still not enough punishment, so Dudley warned them: "Is there no place for pardon? ... What shall we then do? Shall we hold the plough ourselves, play the carters and labour the ground with our own hands?" [48]
The Lord Protector, in his proclamations, appealed to the common people.[49] To his colleagues, whom he hardly consulted,[50] he displayed a distinctly autocratic and "increasingly contemptuous" face.[49] By autumn 1549 the same councillors who had made him Protector were convinced that he had failed to exercise proper authority and was unwilling to listen to good counsel.[51] Dudley still had the troops from the Norfolk campaign at his disposal, and in October 1549 he joined the Earl of Southampton and the Earl of Arundel, prominent religious conservatives, to lead a coup of councillors to oust the Protector from office.[52] They withdrew from court to London, meeting in Dudley's residence. Starting with the Protector, each side issued proclamations accusing the other of treason and declared to act in defence of the King's safety.[53] Somerset tried in vain to raise a popular force and entrenched himself with the King at the fortress Windsor Castle. Military force near King Edward's presence was unthinkable and, apparently, Dudley and Archbishop Cranmer brokered an unofficial deal with Somerset, who surrendered.[54] To keep appearances, the 12-year-old King personally commanded his uncle's arrest.[55] For a moment there was hope of a conservative restoration in some quarters.[56] However, Dudley and Cranmer secured the Reformed agenda by persuading Edward to appoint additional Reformed-minded members to the Council and Privy Chamber.[57] In December 1549 Southampton tried to regain predominance by charging Dudley with treason, alongside Somerset, for having been an original ally of the Protector.[58] The scheme misfired when Dudley invited the Council to his house and baffled the plotters by exclaiming, with his hand at his sword and "a warlike visage": "my lord, you seek his [Somerset's] blood and he that seeketh his blood would have mine also".[59]
Dudley consolidated his power through institutional manoeuvres and by January 1550 was in effect the new regent. On 2 February 1550 he became Lord President of the Council, with the capacity to debar councillors from the body and appoint new ones.[60] He excluded Southampton and other conservatives, but arranged Somerset's release and his return to the Privy Council and Privy Chamber.[61] In June 1550 Dudley's heir John married Somerset's daughter Anne as a mark of reconciliation.[62] Yet Somerset soon attracted political sympathizers and hoped to re-establish his power by removing Dudley from the scene,[63] "contemplating", as he later admitted, the Lord President's arrest and execution.[64] Relying on his popularity with the masses, he campaigned against and tried to obstruct Dudley's policies.[65] His behaviour increasingly threatened the cohesion vital within a minority regime.[66] In that respect Warwick would take no chances,[67] and he now also aspired to a dukedom. He needed to advertise his power and impress his followers; like his predecessor, he had to represent the King's honour.[68] His elevation as Duke of Northumberland came on 11 October 1551 with the Duke of Somerset participating in the ceremony.[69] Five days later Somerset was arrested, while rumours about supposed plots of his circulated. He was accused of having planned a "banquet massacre", in which the Council were to be assaulted and Dudley killed.[70] Somerset was acquitted of treason, but convicted of felony for raising a contingent of armed men without a licence. He was executed on 22 January 1552. While technically lawful,[71] these events contributed much to Northumberland's growing unpopularity.[72] Dudley himself, according to a French eyewitness, confessed before his own end that "nothing had pressed so injuriously upon his conscience as the fraudulent scheme against the Duke of Somerset".[73]
