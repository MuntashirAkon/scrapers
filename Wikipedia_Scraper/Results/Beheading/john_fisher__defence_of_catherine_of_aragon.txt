When Henry tried to divorce Queen Catherine of Aragon, Fisher became the Queen's chief supporter.[9] As such, he appeared on the Queen's behalf in the legates' court, where he startled the audience by the directness of his language and by declaring that, like St John the Baptist, he was ready to die on behalf of the indissolubility of marriage.[10] Henry VIII, upon hearing this, grew so enraged by it that he composed a long Latin address to the legates in answer to the bishop's speech. Fisher's copy of this still exists, with his manuscript annotations in the margin which show how little he feared the royal anger.[11] The removal of the cause to Rome brought Fisher's personal involvement to an end, but the King never forgave him for what he had done.
