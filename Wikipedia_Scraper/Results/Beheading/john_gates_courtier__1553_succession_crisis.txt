John Gates was deeply involved in the succession crisis of 1553, and Lady Jane Grey claimed that he had confessed to have been the first to have induced King Edward to name her his successor.[12] Notwithstanding Gates' commitment to Edward's will,[13] his putative role in its conception has been questioned by Narasingha P. Sil on the grounds that he probably was not as close to the young King as traditionally believed.[14] On 14 July 1553 Gates led the troops of the royal household to East Anglia in the campaign against Mary Tudor.[15] He was arrested with Northumberland at Cambridge and tried at Westminster Hall on 19 August 1553.[16] On 22 August 1553 he took the Catholic communion, recanting his Protestant faith in a ceremony at St. Peter ad Vincula in the Tower precincts.[17] Immediately afterwards he was executed together with the Duke of Northumberland and Sir Thomas Palmer on Tower Hill.[18] According to one chronicle the following scene had taken place shortly before at the Lieutenant of the Tower's garden gate:
"Sir John," sayeth the duke, "God have mercy upon us, for this day shall end both our lives. And I pray you forgive me whatsoever I have offended; and I forgive you with all my heart, although you and your counsel was a great occasion hereof." "Well, my lord," sayeth Sir John Gates, "I forgive you as I would be forgiven; and yet you and your authority was the only original cause of all together; but the Lord pardon you, and I pray you forgive me." So, either making obeisance to [each] other, the duke proceeded [towards the scaffold].[19]
His Essex estates at Rivenhall and Shalford were confiscated by the Crown.[20]
