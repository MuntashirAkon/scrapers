Originating from an ancient Essex gentry family going back to King Edward III, John Gates had a thorough training as a lawyer at Lincoln's Inn.[2] He married Mary Denny, sister of Sir Anthony Denny,[3] and served Queen Catherine Parr from 1543–1545.[4] He was a member of King Henry VIII's Privy Chamber, first as a groom, from 1542. From 1546 he was in charge, with his brother-in-law, of the King's personal finances and his "dry stamp", a substitute, to the King's convenience, for Henry's "sign manual" or personal signature. These positions of trust implied considerable influence.[5]
Under King Edward VI Gates became a Chief Gentleman of the Privy Chamber after the fall of Protector Somerset in the autumn of 1549.[6] He rose to Vice-Chamberlain of the Royal Household on 8 April 1551;[4] a few days later he was admitted to the Privy Council under the leadership of John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland.[7] In these positions Gates was a significant channel of communications between the Duke and the young King[8] and was granted custody of the King's signet in December 1551.[9] In July 1552 he was appointed Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.[4]
He was a Justice of the Peace for Essex from 1532 until his execution and served as High Sheriff of Essex for 1549–50. Gates was also a soldier and as Sheriff went several times into Essex to arrest rioters and carry through the official destruction of "superstitious altars".[10] He was also Captain of the Gentlemen Pensioners (the royal guard) from April 1551.[11]
