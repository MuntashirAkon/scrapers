He was the third son of Thomas Holland, 1st Earl of Kent by his wife Joan of Kent, "The Fair Maid of Kent", daughter of Edmund of Woodstock, 1st Earl of Kent, a son of King Edward I (1272â€“1307). The Earl of Kent was a title that was created multiple times, including once for Edmund of Woodstock and once for John Holland. Joan later married her cousin Edward, the Black Prince, the eldest son and heir apparent of her first cousin King Edward III, by whom she had a son King Richard II, who was thus a half-brother of John Holland.
