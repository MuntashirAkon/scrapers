Born around 1610, Hotham was the son of Sir John Hotham and his wife, Katherine Rodes.
As a young man, Hotham served in the army of the Prince of Orange during the Thirty Years War in the Netherlands from 1629 to 1631; he may have been present at the 1629 English siege of Bois-le-Duc. In 1640, Hotham became a member of parliament for Scarborough, North Yorkshire during the Long Parliament and the Short Parliament.
