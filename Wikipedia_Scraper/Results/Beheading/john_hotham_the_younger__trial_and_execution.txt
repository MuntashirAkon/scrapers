In the summer of 1643, the Committee ordered Hotham's arrest. He fled Nottingham, but was arrested with his father while trying to get back to Hull. In December 1644, both men were tried on treason charges in London. Hotham tried to shift all the blame to his father, but was convicted anyway. On 1 January 1643, John Hotham the younger was executed by beheading. His father was executed the next day.[2]
