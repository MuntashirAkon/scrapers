Hussey was implicated along with his cousin as complicit in the 1536 uprising known as the Pilgrimage of Grace. Though Hussey denied participation in the rebellion, he was accused of conspiring to change laws and depose the king, and that he abetted those who made war on the king in October 1536.[8] The charges may have been levied in part because of Hussey's Catholic sympathies,[9] and because Hussey and his wife, having served 'Princess' Mary, were partisans on her behalf.[10] Hussey was indicted and tried for treason, and found guilty by the House of Lords. He was beheaded in Lincoln in 1536,[1] while his cousin, Thomas Darcy, was executed on Tower Hill.[3]
Hussey's statement ("confession") survives.[11]
