Hussey was born in Sleaford, Lincolnshire, England, son of William Hussey, an English judge and Chief Justice of the Kingâ€™s Bench. His mother was the former Elizabeth Berkeley.[4] Hussey's siblings included Sir Robert Hussey (d.1546), the father of Elizabeth Hussey, the 'Mistress Crane' at whose home at East Molesey the first of the Marprelate tracts, Martin's Epistle, was printed in October 1588; Elizabeth Hussey, who married Richard Grey, 3rd Earl of Kent; and Mary Hussey, who married William Willoughby, 11th Baron Willoughby de Eresby.
In 1497, at the Battle of Blackheath, Hussey was knighted. Six years later, he was made "Knight of the Body", bodyguard to King Henry VII, followed by an appointment as "Master of Lyfield Forest", Rutland in 1505 and Comptroller of the Household in 1509. On 16 August 1513, at the battle of the Spurs, he was promoted to Knight banneret.
