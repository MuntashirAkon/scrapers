^ See Haydn's name. Haydn was baptized "Franciscus Josephus" (Franz Joseph), but "Franz" was not used during Haydn's lifetime and is avoided by scholars today ("Haydn, Joseph" by James Webster in Grove Music Online, accessed 18 January 2007).
^ The date is uncertain. Haydn told others he was born on this day (Geiringer (1982, 9); Jones (1810, 8)), but some of his family members reported 1 April instead (Geiringer). The difficulty arises from the fact that in Haydn's day official records recorded not the birth date but the date of baptism, which, in Haydn's case, was 1 April (Wyn Jones 2009, pp. 2–3).
^ Haydn made the remark to his friend and biographer Georg August Griesinger; cited from English version by Vernon Gotwals (Griesinger 1963:17).
^ Haydn reported this in his 1776 Autobiographical sketch.
^ Finscher 2000, p. 12. Jones (2009:7) dates the visit to early summer, i.e. cherry season, since during the visit Reutter plied the child with fresh cherries as a means of inducing him to learn to sing a trill.
^ Various individuals bore the title "Countess Thun" over time. Candidates for the countess who engaged Haydn are (a) "the elder Countess Maria Christine Thun", (Webster 2002); (b) Maria Wilhelmine Thun (later a famous salon hostess and patroness of Mozart), (Volkmar Braunbehrens, 1990, Mozart in Vienna).
^ Webster 2002, p. 8. Webster expresses doubts, since the source is the early biography of Nicolas-Étienne Framery, judged (Webster 2002, p. 1) the least reliable of Haydn's early biographers.
^ This date is uncertain, since the early biography of Griesinger (1963) gives 1759. For the evidence supporting the earlier date see Landon & Jones (1988, p. 34) and Webster (2002, p. 10).
^ Mrs. Haydn's paramour (1770) was Ludwig Guttenbrunn, an artist who produced the portrait of Haydn seen above (Landon & Jones 1988, p. 109). Joseph Haydn had a long relationship, starting in 1779, with the singer Luigia Polzelli, and was probably the father of her son Antonio (Landon & Jones 1988, p. 116).
^ Robbins Landon and Jones (1988, 100) write: "Haydn's duties were crushing. We can notice the effect in his handwriting, which becomes hastier as the 1770s turn to the 1780s: the notation starts to become ever more careless in the scores and the abbreviations multiply."
^ This view is given, for instance, by Webster (2002, p. 13) and Landon & Jones (1988, p. 37).
^ According to Jones, the London visits yielded a net profit of 15,000 florins. Haydn continued to prosper after the visits and at his death left an estate valued at 55,713 florins. These were substantial sums; for comparison, the house he bought in Gumpendorf in 1793 (and then remodeled) cost only 1370 florins (all figures from Jones 2009:144–46).
^ From Burney's memoirs; quoted from Landon & Jones (1988, p. 234)
^ The premier performance did not take place until 1951, during the Florence May Festival. Maria Callas sang the role of Euridice. The opera and its history are discussed in Geiringer 1982, pp. 342–43.
^ The house, at Haydngasse 19, has since 1899 been a Haydn museum (16 Top-Rated Museums and Art Galleries in Vienna – 16. Haydn House by Bryan Dearsley; Haydnhaus, Vienna Museum).
^ Dies (1810:141). "Clavier" in the original German is ambiguous; literally "keyboard," it is used by extension to denote a keyboard instrument such as the piano or harpsichord.
^ Of Haydn's plight Rosen (1971/1997) wrote, "The last years of Haydn's life, with all his success, comfort, and celebrity, are among the saddest in music. More moving than the false pathos of a pauper's grave for Mozart ... is the figure of Haydn filled with musical ideas which were struggling to escape, as he himself said; he was too old and weak to go to the piano and submit to the discipline of working them out."
^ This is the view of Geiringer (cited below, p. 198), who gives the testimony of Haydn's early biographer Giuseppe Carpani.
^ The inscription continues (in abbreviations) "et Beatae Virgini Mariae et omnibus sanctis" ("and to the Blessed Virgin Mary and all the saints"). The image is taken from the 1900 edition of Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians; it does not identify the work in question.
^ The date of Haydn's bout with smallpox is not preserved. It was prior to the time he was hired by Countess Thun (i.e. as a young adult; see above), since it is recorded that when she first encountered Haydn she observed his scars as part of the generally poor impression his appearance made on her. See Geiringer (1983:34)
^ Sutcliffe (1989, p. 343) mentions this in a criticism of contemporary Haydn performance practice: "[Haydn's] music sometime seems to 'live on its nerves' ... It is above all in this respect that Haydn performances often fail, whereby most interpreters lack the mental agility to deal with the ever-changing 'physiognomy' of Haydn's music, subsiding instead into an ease of manner and a concern for broader effects that they have acquired in their playing of Mozart."
^ Hughes (1970, p. 112) writes: "Having begun to 'develop', he could not stop; his recapitulations begin to take on irregular contours, sometimes sharply condensed, sometimes surprisingly expanded, losing their first tame symmetry to regain a balance of a far higher and more satisfying order."
^ Rosen (1997, p. 57) writes, "the period from 1750 to 1775 was penetrated by eccentricity, hit-or-miss experimentation, resulting in works which are still difficult to accept today because of their oddities." Similar remarks are made by Hughes (1970, pp. 111–12)
^ See Webster (2002, p. 18): "the term has been criticized: taken from the title of a play of 1776 by Maximilian Klinger, it properly pertains to a literary movement of the middle and late 1770s rather than a musical one of about 1768–1772."
^ Original German "Neu, gantz besonderer Art"; Sisman (1993, 219)
^ Rosen's case that Opus 33 represents a "revolution in style" (1971 and 1997, 116) can be found in chapter III.1 of (Rosen 1971 and 1997). For dissenting views, see Larsen (1980, p. 102) and Webster (1991). For discussion of the development of the same trend in Haydn's style in the symphonies that preceded the Opus 33 quartets see Rosen (1988:181–86).
^ Rosen discusses the popular style in ch. VI.1 of Rosen (1971 and 1997).
