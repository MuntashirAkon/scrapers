The week following the attack, Greyhound Canada announced it was pulling a series of nationwide advertisements which included the slogan, "There's a reason you've never heard of bus rage." The incident has led to numerous calls and petitions demanding increased security on intercity buses.[22]
After the incident, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) attempted to run an ad in the Portage Daily Graphic comparing the killing of McLean to the consumption of animals.[23] The paper's publisher refused to run the ad.[24]
The family of Tim McLean have brought a lawsuit of $150,000 against Greyhound, the Attorney General of Canada, and Vince Li.[25]
On June 3, 2010, Li was granted supervised outdoor walks within his mental health facility as voted by the provincial review board.[26]
On February 16, 2011, two passengers, Debra Tucker, of Port Colborne, Ontario and Kayli Shaw, of London, Ontario filed a lawsuit against Li, Greyhound, the RCMP, and the Government of Canada for being exposed to the beheading. They were each seeking $3 million in damages.[27] On July 14, 2015, the two women dropped their lawsuit. [28]
On May 30, 2011, the CBC reported that Li was responding well to his psychiatric treatment and that his doctor had recommended that he receive more freedoms, phased in over several months.[29]
On May 17, 2012, the National Post reported that Li had been granted temporary passes that would allow him out of the Selkirk Mental Health Centre for visits to the town of Selkirk, supervised by a nurse and peace officer.[30] In an interview, Li spoke for the first time, saying that he began hearing "the voice of God" in 2004 and that he wanted to save the people from an alien attack.[31]
On February 27, 2014, the CBC reported that on March 6, Li would be allowed to have unsupervised visits to Selkirk, starting at 30 minutes and expanding to full-day trips. Since 2013, he had been allowed to have supervised visits to Lockport, Winnipeg, and nearby beaches. Those visits were then relaxed.[32]
On July 17, 2014, the Toronto Sun reported that one of the first officers on the scene, Cpl. Ken Barker, an RCMP officer, had committed suicide.[33] The family stated in his obituary that he was suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder.[34]
On February 27, 2015, CBC News reported that Li was given unsupervised day passes to visit Winnipeg so long as he carried a functioning cellular telephone while using them.[2]
On May 8, 2015, CTV News reported that Li would be granted passes to group homes in the community.[35]
In February 2016, it was reported that Li had legally changed his name and was seeking to leave his group home to live independently.[36] He won the right to live alone in February 26 upon the recommendation of the Criminal Code Review Board.[37]
On February 10, 2017, the Manitoba Criminal Code Review Board ordered Li be discharged. Li was granted an absolute discharge. There will be no legal obligations or restrictions pertaining to Li's independent living.[38][39]
