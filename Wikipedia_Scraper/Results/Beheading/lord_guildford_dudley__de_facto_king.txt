King Edward, in his "Device of the Succession", settled the Crown on his cousin once removed, Jane Grey, bypassing his half-sisters, Mary and Elizabeth. After Edward's death on 6 July 1553 the Duke of Northumberland undertook the enforcement of the King's will.[13] The envoys of the Holy Roman Empire and France were sure of the plan's success.[14] Jane was reluctant to accept the Crown: She gave in after remonstrances by an assembly of nobles, including her parents and in-laws; Guildford chimed in with a lovelier approach, with "prayers and caresses".[15] On 10 July Jane and Guildford made their ceremonial entry into the Tower of London.[16] Residing in there, Guildford wanted to be made king; according to her own later account, Jane had a long discussion about this with Guildford, who "assented that if he were to be made king, he would be so by me, by Act of Parliament".[17] But then, Jane would agree only to make him Duke of Clarence; Guildford replied that he did not want to be a duke, but king.[18] When the Duchess of Northumberland heard of the argument she became furious and forbade Guildford to sleep any longer with his wife. She also commanded him to leave the Tower and go home, but Jane insisted that he remain at court at her side.[19]
According to later remarks by the Imperial ambassadors, the daily Council meetings were presided over by Guildford, who allegedly also dined in state alone and had himself addressed in regal style.[20] Antoine de Noailles, the French ambassador, described Guildford as "the new King".[21] The Imperial court in Brussels also believed in the existence of King Guildford.[17]
