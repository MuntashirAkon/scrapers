A year after her imprisonment she was granted permission to visit the surrounding countryside on condition she returned and slept behind the abbey's walls at sundown. A month later, in June, she was given permission to leave the abbey but not to venture closer than ten miles towards Versailles, thus cancelling out the idea of going to her beloved Château de Louveciennes. Hence she managed to purchase property belonging to the family of the wife of Madame de la Garde's younger son from back when she was a teenager. Two years later, she moved to Louveciennes.[28] In the following years, she had a liaison with Louis Hercule Timoléon de Cossé-Brissac.[29] She later also fell in love with Henry Seymour (of Redland),[30] whom she met when he moved with his family to the neighbourhood of the Château. In time, Seymour became fed up with his secret love affair and sent a painting to Madame du Barry with the words 'leave me alone' written in English at the bottom, which the painter Lemoyne copied in 1796. The duc de Brissac proved the more faithful in this ménage-a-trois, having kept Madame du Barry in his heart even though he knew of her affair with Seymour. During the French Revolution, Brissac was captured while visiting Paris, and was slaughtered by a mob. Late one night, Jeanne heard the sound of a small drunken crowd approaching the château, and into the opened window where she looked out someone threw a blood-stained cloth. To Jeanne's horror, it contained Brissac's head, at which sight she fainted.
