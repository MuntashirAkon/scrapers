A Criollo,[3] Padilla was born in Chipirina, Upper Peru (now Chipirina, Chayanta Province, Bolivia) in 1774, the son of a local landowner. He spent the early years of his life near his hometown, joining the army at an early age. He participated in the enforcement and execution of Damaso Katari, Tupac Amaru's successor in La Paz.
Though studying to be a lawyer at the University of Saint Francis Xavier, Padilla left school to marry Juana Azurduy (born 1781[4]) in 1805.[5] Her father was Spanish and her mother was Mestizo.[3]
