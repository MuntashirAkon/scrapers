When not at Court, the Countess lived chiefly at Warblington Castle in Hampshire and Bisham Manor in Berkshire.[23] She and her husband were parents to five children:
Henry Pole, 1st Baron Montagu (c. 1492 – 9 January 1539), notable as one of the peers in the trial of Anne Boleyn; married Jane Neville, daughter of George Nevill, 5th Baron Bergavenny, and Joan FitzAlan; beheaded by order of Henry VIII. A great-grandson of Henry Pole was Sir John Bourchier, a regicide of King Charles I of England – a great-great-grandnephew of Henry VIII.
Arthur Pole (bef 1499 – b. 1532), Lord of the Manor of Broadhurst in Sussex; married Jane Lewknor, daughter of Roger Lewknor and the former Eleanor Tuchet, herself daughter of the 6th Baron Audley and the former Anne Echingham.
Reginald Pole (c. 1500 – 17 November 1558), cardinal, papal legate in various regions, including England, and the last Roman Catholic Archbishop of Canterbury.
Geoffrey Pole (c. 1501-1562), Lord of the Manor of Lordington in Sussex, suspected of treason by King Henry VIII and accused of conspiring with Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor; lived in exile in Europe; married Constance Pakenham, granddaughter and heir of Sir John Pakenham. John Pakenham was ancestor to Sir Edward Pakenham, brother-in-law to Duke of Wellington.
Ursula Pole (c. 1504 – 12 August 1570), married Henry Stafford, 1st Baron Stafford.
Margaret would have of course been a monarch if not for her and Warwick's being disinherited from the royal succession. However, one of her descendants did succeed to the throne - Elizabeth II is her 14-times-great-granddaughter.
