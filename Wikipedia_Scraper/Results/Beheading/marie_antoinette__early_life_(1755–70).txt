Maria Antonia was born on 2 November 1755 at the Hofburg Palace in Vienna. She was the youngest daughter of Empress Maria Theresa, ruler of the Habsburg Empire, and her husband Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor.[4] Her godparents were Joseph I and Mariana Victoria, King and Queen of Portugal; Archduke Joseph and Archduchess Maria Anna acted as proxies for their newborn sister.[5][6] Shortly after her birth she was placed under the care of the governess of the imperial children, Countess von Brandeis.[7] Maria Antonia was raised together with her three-year older sister Maria Carolina, with whom she had a lifelong close relationship.[8] She had a difficult relationship with her mother, but both the empress and her daughter loved each other.[9]
Maria Antonia spent her formative years between the Hofburg Palace and Sch√∂nbrunn, the imperial summer residence in Vienna,[10] where on 13 October 1762, when she was seven, she met Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, two months her junior and a child prodigy.[11][12][13][14]
Despite the private tutoring she received, the results of her schooling were less than satisfactory.[15] At the age of ten she could not write correctly in German or in any language commonly used at court, such as French and Italian,[16] and conversations with her were stilted.[17][18]
Under the teaching of Christoph Willibald Gluck, Maria Antonia developed into a good musician. She learned to play the harp,[15] the harpsichord and the flute. She sang during the family's evening gatherings, as she had a beautiful voice.[19] She also excelled at dancing,[20] had "exquisite" poise,[20] and loved dolls.[20]
