For many revolutionary figures, Marie Antoinette was the symbol of what was wrong with the old regime in France. The onus of having caused the financial difficulties of the nation were placed on her shoulders by the revolutionary tribunal,[209] and under the new republican ideas of what it meant to be a member of a nation, her Austrian descent and continued correspondence with the competing nation made her a traitor.[210] The people of France saw her death as necessary step toward completing the revolution. Furthermore, her execution was seen as a sign that the revolution had done its work[211]
Long after her death, Marie Antoinette remains a major historical figure linked with conservatism, the Catholic Church, wealth, and fashion. She has been the subject of a number of books, films and other media. Politically engaged authors have deemed her the quintessential representative of class conflict, western aristocracy and absolutism. Some of her contemporaries, such as Jefferson, attributed to her the start of the French Revolution.[212] For others, Marie Antoinette was a victim of her family's ambition and the general situation in France. Even her critics have recognized her qualities as a mother and her courage in dying.
