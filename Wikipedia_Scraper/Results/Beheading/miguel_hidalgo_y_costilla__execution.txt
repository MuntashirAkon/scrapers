Hidalgo was turned over to the bishop of Durango, Francisco Gabriel de Olivares, for an official defrocking and excommunication on 27 July 1811. He was then found guilty of treason by a military court and executed. There are many theories about how he was executed, the most famous that he was killed by firing squad and then decapitated on 30 July at 7:00 in the morning.[18] Before his execution, he thanked his jailers, two soldiers, Ortega and Melchor, for their humane treatment. At his execution, Hidalgo stated "Though I may die, I shall be remembered forever; you all will soon be forgotten." [16][31] His body, along with the bodies of Allende, Aldama and José Mariano Jiménez were decapitated, and the heads were put on display on the four corners of the Alhóndiga de Granaditas in Guanajuato.[1] The heads remained there for ten years until the end of the Mexican War of Independence to serve as a warning to other insurgents.[10] Hidalgo's headless body was first displayed outside the prison but then buried in the Church of St Francis in Chihuahua. Those remains were transferred to Mexico City in 1824.[16]
Hidalgo's death resulted in a political vacuum on the insurgent side until 1812. The royalist military commander, General Felix Calleja, continued to pursue rebel troops. Insurgent fighting evolved into guerrilla warfare,[21] and eventually the next major insurgent leader, José María Morelos y Pavon, who had led rebel movements with Hidalgo, became head of the insurgents, until Morelos himself was captured and shot in 1815.[10]
