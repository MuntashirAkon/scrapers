When the Mayflower was anchored off Cape Cod, Standish urged the colony's leaders to allow him to take a party ashore to find a suitable place for settlement.[23] On November 15, 1620, he led 16 men in a foot exploration of the northern portion of the Cape.[24] On December 11, a group of 18 settlers, including Standish, made an extended exploration of the shore of Cape Cod by boat,[25] spending their nights ashore surrounded by makeshift barricades of tree branches. The settlers were attacked one night by a group of about 30 Native Americans. At first, the Englishmen panicked, but Standish calmed them, urging the settlers not to fire their matchlock muskets unnecessarily.[26] The incident took place in present-day Eastham, Massachusetts and came to be known as the First Encounter.
After further exploration, the Pilgrims chose a location in present-day Plymouth Bay in late December 1620 as the site for their settlement. Standish provided important counsel on the placement of a small fort in which cannon were mounted, and on the layout of the first houses for maximum defensibility.[2] Only one house (consisting of a single room) had been built when illness struck the settlers. Of the roughly 100 who first arrived, only 50 survived the first winter.[27] Standish's wife Rose died in January.[28]
Standish was one of the very few who did not fall ill and William Bradford (soon to be governor of Plymouth Colony) credited him with comforting many and being a source of strength to those who suffered.[29] Standish tended to Bradford during his illness, and this was the beginning of a decades-long friendship.[30] Bradford held the position of governor for most of his life and, by necessity, worked closely with Standish. The two men were opposites in terms of character; Bradford was patient and slow to judgment, while Standish was well known for his fiery temper.[31] Despite their differences, the two worked well together in managing the colony and responding to dangers as they arose.[32]
