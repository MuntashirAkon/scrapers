During the 1640s, Standish took on an increasingly administrative role. He served as a surveyor of highways, as Treasurer of the Colony from 1644 to 1649, and on various committees to lay out boundaries of new towns and inspect waterways.[68] His old friend Hobbamock had been part of his household, but he died in 1642 and was buried on Standish's farm in Duxbury.[37]
Standish died on October 3, 1656 of "strangullion" or strangury, a condition often associated with kidney stones or bladder cancer.[13] He was buried in Duxbury's Old Burying Ground, now known as the Myles Standish Cemetery.[69] [70]
