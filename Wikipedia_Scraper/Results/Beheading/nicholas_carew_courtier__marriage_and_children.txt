Nicholas Carew married Sir Francis Bryan's sister Elizabeth.[19] Ironically, it was Carew's brother-in-law who was part of the committee that sat in the trial against him and pronounced him guilty, which left Bryan's sister impoverished.[20] During the reign of Mary I, their son Sir Francis Carew was restored to Nicholas' estates, though he preferred to stay out of politics. Francis Carew's sister Anne married the diplomat Nicholas Throckmorton; their daughter Elizabeth married Sir Walter Raleigh.[21]
