Owen Tudor was an early casualty of the Wars of the Roses (1455â€“1487) between the House of Lancaster and the House of York. He joined his son Jasper's army in Wales in January 1461, a force which was defeated at the Battle of Mortimer's Cross by Edward of York. Tudor was captured and beheaded at Hereford, where his head was placed on the market cross, "and a madde woman kembyd hys here and wysche a way the blode of hys face"[10] and set 100 candles about him. However Tudor expected to be imprisoned rather than executed.[11] Moments before his execution he realized that he was to die and murmured "that hede shalle ly on the stocke that wass wonte to ly on Quene Katheryns lappe."[12] His body was buried in a chapel on the north side of the Greyfriars' Church in Hereford. He had no memorial until his illegitimate son, David, paid for a tomb before the friary was dissolved.[1]
