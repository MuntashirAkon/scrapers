On May 6, 1932, a book fair was being held at the Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild in Paris, and the President of France, Paul Doumer, was present.
Gorguloff arrived at the hotel concealing a Browning FN Model 1910 gun. He then approached the President from behind, pulled out his gun and fired three shots. Two of them hit the President, one in the back of the head and the other in the right armpit. The President fell to the floor. He was rushed to the Beaujon Hospital in Paris but died the next day. One of the authors at the exhibition, Claude Farrère, managed to wrestle with Gorguloff until the police arrived. Gorguloff's motive for the murder was that he believed that France had failed to support the White Movement in Russia against Bolshevism.
Gorguloff was arrested and brought to trial at the Assize Court on 25 July 1932. Two days later, after rejecting the idea that he was insane, the jury condemned Gorguloff to death. On 20 August, the Court of Cassation, France's final appeal court, rejected a defence of insanity. On 14 September, Gorguloff was executed at La Santé prison in Paris by guillotine. His last words were "Россия, моя страна!" ("Russia, my country!").
The gun used in the assassination is now in the Musée des Collections Historiques de la Préfecture de Police in Paris.
