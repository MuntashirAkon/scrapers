In July 1313, Philip married Joan the Lame (French: Jeanne), daughter of Robert II, Duke of Burgundy,[20] and Agnes of France, the youngest daughter of Louis IX. In an ironic twist to his "male" ascendancy to the throne, the intelligent, strong-willed Joan, an able regent of France during the king's long military campaigns, was said to be the brains behind the throne and the real ruler of France.
Their children were the following:
John II (26 April 1319 – 8 April 1364).[21]
Marie (1326 – 22 September 1333), who married John of Brabant, the son and heir of John III, Duke of Brabant, but died shortly afterwards.
Louis (born and died 17 January 1329).
Louis (8 June 1330 – 23 June 1330).
A son [John?] (born and died 2 October 1333).
A son (28 May 1335), stillborn.
Philip (1 July 1336 – 1 September 1375), Duke of Orléans
Joan (born and died November 1337).
A son (born and died summer 1343).
After Joan died in 1349, Philip married Blanche of Navarre,[22] daughter of Joan II and Philip III of Navarre, on 11 January 1350. They had one daughter:
Joan (Blanche) (May 1351 – 16 September 1371),[21] who was intended to marry John I of Aragon, but who died during the journey.
