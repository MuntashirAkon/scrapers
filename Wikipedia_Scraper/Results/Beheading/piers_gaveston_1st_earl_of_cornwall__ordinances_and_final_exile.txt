On 5 August 1309, Gaveston was reinstated with the earldom of Cornwall.[51] It did not take long, however, for him to alienate the earls once more. The chronicles tell of how Gaveston gave mocking nicknames to other earls, calling Lincoln 'burst-belly', Pembroke 'Joseph the Jew', Lancaster 'the fiddler' and Warwick 'the black dog of Arden' (from the forest of Arden in Warwickshire).[52] Gaveston also began to exploit his relationship with the King more ostentatiously, obtaining favours and appointments for his friends and servants.[53] The political climate became so hateful that in February 1310, a number of the earls refused to attend parliament as long as Gaveston was present.[54] Gaveston was dismissed, and, when parliament convened, the disaffected barons presented a list of grievances they wanted addressed. On 16 March, the King was forced to appoint a group of men to ordain reforms of the royal household.[55] This group of so-called Lords Ordainers consisted of eight earls, seven bishops and six barons.[56] Among the earls were supporters of the King, like Gloucester and John of Brittany, Earl of Richmond, as well as strong opponents, like Lancaster and Warwick.[57]
While the Ordainers were at work drafting their reform document, Edward decided to address one of the main causes behind the discontent: the Scottish situation.[56] Edward II had, almost immediately after his accession, abandoned the relentless Scottish campaigns of his father.[58] As a result, Robert the Bruce had been able to regain the initiative in the war, reconquer lost territory, and stage destructive raids into the north of England. To aggravate matters, Edward had continued to raise extortionate taxes, ostensibly for the war in Scotland, but without showing any result.[59] If the King could produce victory against the Scots, this would go a long way towards undermining the work of the Ordainers.[60] In June, the King summoned the magnates for a military campaign, but most of the Ordainers refused on the basis of the work they were performing.[61] When the King departed for Scotland in September, only Gloucester, Warenne and Gaveston among the earls accompanied him.[62] The campaign proved frustrating for Edward, when Bruce refused to engage in open battle, or even get involved in negotiations. In February, Gaveston was sent with an army north from Roxburgh to Perth, but he failed to track down the Scottish army.[63]
While the royal army was in the north, Edward received news from London that the Earl of Lincoln had died on 6 February 1311.[64] This meant that a moderating influence on the baronial party had been lost, at the same time as the antagonistic Earl of Lancaster – who was Lincoln's son-in-law and heir – emerged as the leader of the Ordainers.[65] With the Ordainers ready to present their programme of reform, Edward had to summon a parliament. In late July he appointed Gaveston Lieutenant of Scotland, and departed for London.[66] Bruce still evaded the English successfully, in early August even staging a raid into northern England, and shortly after this Gaveston withdrew to Bamburgh Castle in Northumberland.[67] When parliament met on 16 August, the King was presented with a set of proposed reforms of the royal household, as well as specific attacks on individuals, including a demand for the renewed exile of Piers Gaveston.[68] Edward initially offered to agree to the reforms as long as Gaveston was allowed to stay, but the Ordainers refused. The King held out for as long as he could, but eventually had to agree to the Ordinances, which were published on 27 September.[69] On 3 November, two days after the allotted deadline, Gaveston left England for the last time.[70]
