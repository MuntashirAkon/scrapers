Some writings by Priscillian were accounted orthodox and were not burned. For instance he divided the Pauline epistles (including the Epistle to the Hebrews) into a series of texts on their theological points and wrote an introduction to each section. These canons survived in a form edited by Peregrinus. They contain a strong call to a life of personal piety and asceticism, including celibacy and abstinence from meat and wine. The charismatic gifts of all believers are equally affirmed. Study of scripture is urged. Priscillian placed considerable weight on apocryphal books, not as being inspired but as helpful in discerning truth and error.[2] It was long thought that all his writings had perished, but in 1885, Georg Schepss discovered at the University of WÃ¼rzburg eleven genuine tracts, published in the Vienna Corpus in 1886. [13]Though they bear Priscillian's name, four describing Priscillian's trial appear to have been written by a close follower.
According to Raymond E. Brown (1995), the source of the Comma Johanneum, a brief interpolation in the First Epistle of John, known since the fourth century, appears to be the Latin Liber Apologeticus by Priscillian.[14]
The modern assessment of Priscillian is summed up by Henry Chadwick (1976).[15]
