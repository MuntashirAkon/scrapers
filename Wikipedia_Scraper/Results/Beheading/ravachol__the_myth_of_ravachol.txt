Ravachol became a somewhat romanticised symbol of desperate revolt and a number of French songs were composed in his honour, such as la Ravachole, to the tune of la Carmagnole.
Ravachol has also appeared as a minor character in Frank Chadwick's role playing game Space: 1889 as well as in several of his memoirs.
In 2011, the character of the anarchist "Claude Ravache" appeared in the movie Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows. He was clearly inspired by Ravachol.
