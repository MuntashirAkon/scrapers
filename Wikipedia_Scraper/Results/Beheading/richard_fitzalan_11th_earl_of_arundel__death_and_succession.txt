On 12 July 1397, Richard FitzAlan was arrested for his opposition to Richard II,[2] as well as plotting with Gloucester to imprison the king.[10] He stood trial at Westminster and was attainted.[11] He was beheaded on 21 September 1397 and was buried in the church of the Augustin Friars, Bread Street, London.[2] Tradition holds that his final words were said to the executioner, "Torment me not long, strike off my head in one blow".[12]
In October 1400, the attainder was reversed, and Richard's son Thomas succeeded to his father's estates and honors.[2]
