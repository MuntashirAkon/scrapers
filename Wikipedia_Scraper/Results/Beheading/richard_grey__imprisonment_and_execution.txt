After the death of Edward IV on 9 April 1483, and Grey's half-brother becoming Edward V, Grey's whole life soon fell apart due to the ruthlessness shown by his late stepfather's brother, Richard, Duke of Gloucester. On 30 April 1483, while accompanying Edward V to London from Wales with their uncle Anthony Woodville, 2nd Earl Rivers, Grey was arrested by Richard, Duke of Gloucester (later Richard III) at Stony Stratford and, with Rivers, imprisoned in the north of England.[2] Within a few weeks, Grey's lands and offices had been redistributed to others, even though he had not legally been deprived of them.[citation needed] After Edward V was declared illegitimate, Richard, Duke of Gloucester, ascended the throne as Richard III. Grey and his uncle were then executed at Pontefract Castle on 25 June 1483.[1] Richard Grey was aged around 26 at the time of his execution.
