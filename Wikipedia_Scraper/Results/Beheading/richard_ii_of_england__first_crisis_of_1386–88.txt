The threat of a French invasion did not subside, but instead grew stronger into 1386.[3] At the parliament of October that year, Michael de la Pole – in his capacity of chancellor – requested taxation of an unprecedented level for the defence of the realm.[32] Rather than consenting, the parliament responded by refusing to consider any request until the chancellor was removed.[33] The parliament (later known as the Wonderful Parliament) was presumably working with the support of Gloucester and Arundel.[3][34] The king famously responded that he would not dismiss as much as a scullion from his kitchen at parliament's request.[35] Only when threatened with deposition was Richard forced to give in and let de la Pole go.[36] A commission was set up to review and control royal finances for a year.[37]
Richard was deeply perturbed by this affront to his royal prerogative, and from February to November 1387 went on a "gyration" (tour) of the country to muster support for his cause.[38] By installing de Vere as Justice of Chester, he began the work of creating a loyal military power base in Cheshire.[39] He also secured a legal ruling from Chief Justice Robert Tresilian that parliament's conduct had been unlawful and treasonable.[40]
On his return to London, the king was confronted by Thomas of Woodstock (now Duke of Gloucester), Arundel and Thomas de Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, who brought an appeal[d] of treason against de la Pole, de Vere, Tresilian, and two other loyalists: the mayor of London, Nicholas Brembre, and Alexander Neville, the Archbishop of York.[41] Richard stalled the negotiations to gain time, as he was expecting de Vere to arrive from Cheshire with military reinforcements.[42] The three earls then joined forces with Henry Bolingbroke, Earl of Derby (Gaunt's son, later King Henry IV), and Thomas de Mowbray, Earl of Nottingham – the group known to history as the Lords Appellant. On 20 December 1387 they intercepted de Vere at Radcot Bridge, where he and his forces were routed and he was obliged to flee the country.[43]
Richard now had no choice but to comply with the appellants' demands; Brembre and Tresilian were condemned and executed, while de Vere and de la Pole – who had by now also left the country[42] – were sentenced to death in absentia at the Merciless Parliament in February 1388.[44] The proceedings went further, and a number of Richard's chamber knights were also executed, among these Burley.[45] The appellants had now succeeded completely in breaking up the circle of favourites around the king.[3]
