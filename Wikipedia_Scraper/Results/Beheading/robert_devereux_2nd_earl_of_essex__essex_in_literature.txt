At least two fencing treatises are dedicated to Robert, Earl of Essex. They are as follows:
Vincentio Saviolo – His Practice (1595)[21]
George Silver – Paradoxes of Defence (1599)[22]
Robert Devereux's death and confession became the subject of two popular 17th-century Broadside Ballads, set to the English folk tunes Essex Last Goodnight and Welladay.[23][24] Numerous ballads lamenting his death and praising his military feats were also published throughout the 17th century.[25]
