While the Earl of Pembroke title went to his younger, legitimate half-brother William,[3] Richard realised success through his own merit and his descendants: "Sir Richard Herbert, of Ewyas, who, though illegitimate, is ancestor of the men who have really, in modern times, rendered the name of Herbert illustrious."[5]
In 1465, Richard Herbert was granted Westminster, manors of Grove, Radnore, Mookas, Brutescourt, Throuckeston, Westhide, Egelton, Redehire, Howton and Wormeton Tirell, co. Hereford.[6]
He was successful as a Gentleman Usher to Henry VII and appointed Constable and Porter of Abergavenny Castle on 22 July 1509.[3][4] While Richard is most frequently titled "Sir Richard Herbert," there is debate as to whether Richard was a knight. Richard Herbert in "The Knights of England" was knighted in 1513, three years after this subject's death.[7] According to Sil, Richard was never knighted, but was an Esquire.[3] Richard is titled Esquire in 1465 when he was granted manors and lands.[6]
In many sources, however,[1][2][4][5] Richard is referred to as "Sir Richard Herbert." An article titled "The Family of Herbert" from The Gentleman's Magazine states that he was knighted by King Henry VIII,[8] in which case Richard would have been knighted in the last year of Richard's life (died 1510) and the first year of Henry VIII's reign, which began in 1509.
