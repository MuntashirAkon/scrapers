Kyriell served under Henry V of England in Normandy, and in 1436 held the fortress at Le Crotoy in Picardy.[3] He served under John, Lord Talbot at this period, around Rouen, and was created knight-banneret by 1443.[1] He led the English forces in the 1450 French victory, the Battle of Formigny.[4]
Released after being captured at Formigny, Kyriell was a Member of Parliament. There he showed himself a Yorkist, by his opposition to Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset.[5] He was openly a Yorkist commander by 1460, as heavy fighting began in the Wars of the Roses.[6] Warwick the Kingmaker had Kyriell elected to the Order of the Garter on 8 February 1461, with himself and two others.[7]
At the Second Battle of St Albans, eight days later, Kyriell was on the losing side captured while guarding the king, Henry VI of England, who was a Yorkist prisoner. Margaret of Anjou had Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales pronounce the fate of the Yorkist guard, and they were beheaded.[8]
