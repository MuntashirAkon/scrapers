According to preserved court and church documents from the National Archives, the manslaughter took place on Boxing Day, 1822 when Putkonen was celebrating his name day in the village of Jauhomäki, Pieksämäki at his landlord's house. He had invited neighbors over, and was serving food and hard liquor to the guests. Putkonen was drunk, and had apparently been so earlier over the Christmas holidays as well.[1]
Mr. Lasse Hirvonen, a father of five, had joined Putkonen's party. At some point, apparently angered by Hirvonen's dining manners, Putkonen unexpectedly attacked Hirvonen and shoved him on the floor. Other guests separated Putkonen and pushed him out of the house. There, Putkonen tried to grab an axe, but Hirvonen's brother-in-law managed to tame him.[1]
After some while Putkonen was let back into the house. He was still angered, and after noticing Hirvonen, he fetched a meter-long piece of birch firewood from outside. Hirvonen was lighting up his pipe at the time of the attack, so he didn't see Putkonen hitting him to the forehead with the log. Unconscious, Hirvonen collapsed on the floor, blood flowing from his ears and nose. He never woke up, and died two days later.[1]
