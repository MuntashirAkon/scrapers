Thomas Cromwell was a patron of Hans Holbein the Younger, as were St. Thomas More and Anne Boleyn. In the New York Frick Collection, two portraits by Holbein hang facing each other on the same wall of the Study, one depicting Thomas Cromwell, the other Thomas More, whose execution he had procured.[77]
