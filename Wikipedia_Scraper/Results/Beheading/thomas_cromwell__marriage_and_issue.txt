At some time during these years, Cromwell returned to England, where around 1515 he married Elizabeth Wyckes (d. 1529).[12] She was the widow of Thomas Williams, a Yeoman of the Guard, and the daughter of a Putney shearman, Henry Wykes, who had served as a gentleman usher to King Henry VII.[9] The couple had three children:[13]
Gregory Cromwell, 1st Baron Cromwell (c. 1520–51), who was Elizabeth Seymour's second husband.
Anne Cromwell (died c. 1529)
Grace Cromwell (died c. 1529)
Cromwell's wife died early in 1529[12] and his daughters, Anne and Grace, are believed to have died not long after their mother. Provisions made for Anne and Grace in Cromwell's will, dated 12 July 1529, were crossed out at some later date.[14][15] Gregory outlived his father by only 11 years, succumbing to sweating sickness in 1551.[16][17][18][19][20]
Thomas Cromwell also had an illegitimate daughter, Jane (c. 1535 – 1580),[21] whose early life is a complete mystery. According to novelist Dame Hilary Mantel, "Cromwell had an illegitimate daughter, and beyond the fact that she existed, we know very little about her. She comes briefly into the records, in an incredibly obscure way — she's in the archives of the county of Chester."[22][23][24][25] Jane married William Hough (c. 1527–1585), of Leighton in Wirral, Cheshire, around 1550.[12][26] William Hough was the son of Richard Hough (1508–73/74) who was Cromwell's agent in Chester from 1534-40.[27][28][29][25] It is unknown what role Thomas and Gregory Cromwell played in her life. Jane and her husband William Hough remained staunch Roman Catholics, who, together with their daughter, Alice, her husband, William Whitmore, and their children, all came to the attention of the authorities as recusants during the reign of Elizabeth I.[30]
