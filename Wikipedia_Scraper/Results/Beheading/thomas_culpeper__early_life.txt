Thomas Culpeper was the second of the three sons of Alexander Culpeper (d.1541) of Bedgebury, south of Maidstone in Kent, and his second wife, Constance Harper. His older brother, also named Thomas, was a client of Thomas Cromwell.[1] The brothers were known for collecting valuable items for the royal family during their time at court.[2] He was distantly related to the Howard clan, who were immensely powerful at the time, being a distant cousin[3] of Joyce Culpeper, Catherine Howard's mother. They were particularly influential after the fall of Cardinal Wolsey in 1529, and for a brief time under the reign of Anne Boleyn, who was one of their cousins.
