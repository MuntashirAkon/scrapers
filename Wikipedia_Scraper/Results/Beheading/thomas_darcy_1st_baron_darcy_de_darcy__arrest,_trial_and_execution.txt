Darcy was apprehended, brought up to London, and lodged in the Tower of London, as were several other of the northern leaders at the same time.
Examined by the Privy Council, Darcy used the occasion to make clear his hatred and contempt for Thomas Cromwell: "thou that art the very original and chief causer of this rebellion and mischief and likewise art the cause of apprehension to us that be noblemen and dost earnestly travail to bring us to our end and strike off our heads."[21] He warned Cromwell, prophetically, that he must not count on the King's favour towards him lasting, forÂ : "others that have been in such favour with Kings that you now enjoy have come to the same end you bring me to" and expressed his hope that even if Cromwell struck off every nobleman's head, "yet one (i.e. the King) shall remain that shall strike off yours".[21]
An indictment found against Darcy and the other northern leaders on 9 May at York says that they had conspired together in October, first to deprive the king of his royal dignity by disowning his title of Supreme Head of the Church of England, and secondly to compel him to hold a parliament; that they had afterwards committed divers acts of rebellion; that after being pardoned they had corresponded with each other, and that Darcy and others had abetted Bigod's rebellion in January. On these charges he and his old friend, John Hussey, 1st Baron Hussey of Sleaford were arraigned at Westminster on 15 May before the Marquess of Exeter as Lord High Steward, and a number of their peers.[3]
They were condemned to suffer the extreme penalty for treason, but the punishment actually inflicted upon them was decapitation, which Lord Hussey underwent at Lincoln, where he was conveyed on purpose to strike terror where the insurrection had begun. But Darcy was beheaded on Tower Hill on 30 June.[1] His head was set up on London Bridge, and his body, according to one contemporary writer, was buried at Crutched Friars. But if so, it must have been removed afterwards; at least, if a tombstone inscription may be trusted, it lies with the bodies of other Darcys in the church of St Botolph's Aldgate.[3]
Following his arrest and conviction in 1537, his lands and property were seized,[1] and in 1539, he was posthumously attainted, the barony was forfeited and his knighthood degraded.[1][3] During the reign of Edward VI, his eldest son, Sir George Darcy, was restored in blood, by an Act of Parliament, in 1548, to the dignity of Baron Darcy.[22] Some sources state, however, that this was a new creation, rather than a restoration of his father's forfeited barony.[23] It is remarkable that the new Baron Darcy, took his place in the House of Lords as the junior baron and not in the 1509 precedence of the former Barony, whereas, his son took his seat in the House of Lords in the precedence of the former barony, which assumption seems to have been condoned by the House.[23] Although he never regained any of his father's lands,[1] the title of Lord Darcy of Aston, descended to his heirs male until it became extinct for lack of issue in 1635.[22]
