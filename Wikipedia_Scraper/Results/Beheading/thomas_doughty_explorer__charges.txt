When the Swan became separated from the rest of the fleet during a severe storm, Drake became convinced that Doughty was practising witchcraft. On 17 May 1578, upon the reunion of the fleet, Drake and Doughty had a final quarrel; Drake struck Doughty and ordered him tied to the mast. By 3 June both Doughty and his brother, John Doughty were under house arrest and the sailors were forbidden to interact with them whatsoever. Drake accused Doughty of being "a conjurer and a seditious person" and his brother of being "a witch and a poisoner".[4]
