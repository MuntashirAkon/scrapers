Doughty's execution is the subject of Robert E. Howard's Solomon Kane poem, "The One Black Stain."
In the episode of the 1960s UK children's TV series Sir Francis Drake 'The Doughty Plot', the story of how Doughty was tried and executed is recounted, though it is not historically accurate and makes Drake out as the hero.
In 1980, "Drake's Venture", a full costume drama of the key events was made for television, with John Thaw as Francis Drake and Paul Darrow as Thomas Doughty.
