He was the son of the 2nd Earl of Kent and Lady Alice FitzAlan. His maternal grandparents were the 10th Earl of Arundel and Lady Eleanor of Lancaster. He was also a nephew of King Richard II, and a Knight of the Garter.
On his father's death in 1397 he succeeded him as 3rd Earl of Kent and 4th Baron Holland. At that time Kent's uncle King Richard II was removing the Duke of Gloucester and his associates from power, and sent Kent to arrest his own uncle, the Earl of Arundel. In reward he received a share of the forfeited estates, and on 29 September 1397 was created Duke of Surrey. Another uncle, the Earl of Huntingdon, was created Duke of Exeter on that day as well.
