Pope Leo XIII beatified Thomas More, John Fisher and 52 other English Martyrs on 29 December 1886. Pope Pius XI canonised More and Fisher on 19 May 1935, and More's feast day was established as 9 July. Since 1970 the General Roman Calendar has celebrated More with St John Fisher on 22 June (the date of Fisher's execution). On October 31, 2000 Pope John Paul II declared More "the heavenly Patron of Statesmen and Politicians".[4] More is the patron of the German Catholic youth organisation Katholische Junge Gemeinde.[78]
In 1980, despite their opposing the English Reformation, More and Fisher were jointly added as martyrs of the reformation to the Church of England's calendar of "Saints and Heroes of the Christian Church", to be commemorated every 6 July (the date of More's execution) as "Thomas More, Scholar, and John Fisher, Bishop of Rochester, Reformation Martyrs, 1535".[5]
More is also listed in the calendars of saints of some of the other churches in the Anglican Communion including:
The Anglican Church of Australia has "July 6: John Fisher and Thomas More, martyrs (died 1535)".
The Anglican Church of Brazil has "July 6: Thomas More, Martyr, 1535".
The Anglican Church of Canada has "July 6: Thomas More died 1535 Commemoration" in its Book of Alternative Services Calendar, and has "July 6: The Octave Day of St Peter and St Paul, and Thomas More, Chancellor of England, Martyr 1535." in the July section of its Book of Common Prayer Calendar.
The Anglican Church of Southern Africa has "July 6: Thomas More, Martyr, 1535".
Among those on which More is not listed are the calendars of the Episcopal Church in the United States, the Scottish Episcopal Church and the Anglican Church in Hong Kong and Macau.
