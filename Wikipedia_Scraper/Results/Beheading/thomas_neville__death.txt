He was then taken to Middleham Castle in Yorkshire, the principal seat of his Neville relatives, and beheaded on 22 September 1471. His head was set on London Bridge, ‘looking into Kentward’.[7] A brother is stated to have been a prisoner at the same time, but he managed to take sanctuary at Beverley.[7]
