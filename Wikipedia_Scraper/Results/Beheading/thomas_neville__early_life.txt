In his youth Thomas was a notable sailor, receiving the freedom of the City of London in 1454 for his work in eliminating pirates from the English Channel and the North Sea. In this he was closely associated with his father's relatives: Lord Fauconberg's elder brother, Richard Neville, Earl of Salisbury was a commissioner for the keeping of the seas in 1453-5, and in 1455 Salisbury's eldest son Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick was entrusted with sole responsibility for the keeping of the seas, a post he effectively retained for the rest of his life.
