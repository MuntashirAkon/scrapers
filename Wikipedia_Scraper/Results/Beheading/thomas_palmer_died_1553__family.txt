Of Sir Thomas's two elder brothers, the first, Sir John, known as ‘Buskin Palmer’ or ‘Long Palmer,’ was sheriff of Surrey and Sussex successively in 1533 and 1543. Palmer [John] was a sick man when he made his will on 7 January 1563 and he died before the day was out.[2] His second brother was Sir Henry Palmer (d. 1559), of Wingham in Kent. Sir Henry married Jane, daughter of Sir Richard Windebank of Guisnes, and left three sons—Sir Thomas Palmer ‘the Travailer,’ Arnold, and Edward.
