Meanwhile, in 1538, Thomas was sent to the embassy at the French court. He was one of those appointed to meet Anne of Cleves, King Henry’s fourth wife, at Calais on 13 December 1539.[9] A few weeks later he was sent to Ferdinand, King of Hungary and brother of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor to enlist support for Henry against France and Scotland. He arrived at Vienna in July, and remained there two years. In May 1543, he was appointed ambassador to the Netherlands.[10] He was given this posting to remove him from King Henry's court, for the King’s marriage to Catherine Parr. [11] War breaking out between England and France, Seymour was made marshal of the English army in the Netherlands on 26 June, being second in command to Sir John Wallop. On 24 July 1543, with a strong detachment, he captured and destroyed the castles of Rinquecen and Arbrittayne near the French city of Boulogne.[12] For a short time, he held the chief command during Wallop's illness.[13] Due to his position of privilege as a royal uncle and as a reward for his services, Thomas was made Master-General of the Ordnance in 1544 and Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports in 1545, both very senior military positions.
