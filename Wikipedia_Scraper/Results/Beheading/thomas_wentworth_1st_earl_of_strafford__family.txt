Strafford was married three times:[36]
Margaret Clifford (died 1622), daughter of Francis Clifford, 4th Earl of Cumberland.
Arabella Holles (died October 1631), daughter of John Holles, 1st Earl of Clare. Married in February 1625.
Elizabeth Rhodes, daughter of Sir Godfrey Rhodes. Married in October 1632; she died in 1688.
Strafford's honours were forfeited by his attainder, but his only son, William, who was born on 8 June 1626, received them all by a fresh grant from Charles I on 1 December 1641. In 1662 Parliament reversed his father's attainder, and William, already 1st Earl of Strafford of the second creation, became also 2nd earl of the first creation in succession to his father.[44]
In addition to William, Strafford and Arabella had two daughters who outlived him:[44] Anne, born October 1627,[44] who married Edward Watson, 2nd Baron Rockingham; and Arabella, born October 1630,[44] who married Justin McCarthy, Viscount Mountcashel. Through his daughter Anne, Strafford was the ancestor of the prominent statesman Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham. He had a daughter, Margaret, with his third wife.[44] The hatred felt by so many for Strafford did not extend to his widow and children, who were generally regarded with compassion: even at the height of the Civil War Parliament treated "that poor unfortunate family" with consideration.[45]
