Tiradentes' plan was to take to the streets of Vila Rica on the day of derrama in February 1789, when tax was due to Portugal and the sentiment of revolt among Brazilians would be stronger, and proclaim a Brazilian Republic. However, the movement was disclosed to the governor, who canceled the derrama and ordered the imprisonment of the rebels. Joaquim Silverio dos Reis, a member of the movement, betrayed the group in exchange for waiving of his taxes.
The trial lasted almost three years. Tiradentes assumed complete responsibility for the movement. Ten members of the group were sentenced to death, but Queen Maria I of Portugal commuted all the sentences, except that of Tiradentes, from death to degradation.
