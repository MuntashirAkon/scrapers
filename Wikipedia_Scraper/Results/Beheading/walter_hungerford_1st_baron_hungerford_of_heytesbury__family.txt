In an appeal for protection which she addressed to Thomas Cromwell in about 1536,[15] she asserted that he kept her incarcerated at Farleigh for three or four years, made some fruitless attempts to divorce her, and endeavoured on several occasions to poison her.[16] There were no children from the marriage.[17] After Hungerford's execution, she became the second wife of Sir Robert Throckmorton (d.1581).[1]
