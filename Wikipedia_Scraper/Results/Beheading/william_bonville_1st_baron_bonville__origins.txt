The Bonvilles were an old West Country family. The date of William Bonville's birth is uncertain. Cokayne states that he was born 30 August 1393, while Richardson states that various documents indicate he was four years of age in 1397, 16 years of age in 1408, and 21 years of age in 1414.[2] He was born at Shute, Devon, the son of Sir John Bonville (c. 1371 – 21 October 1396) and Elizabeth FitzRoger (15 August 1370 – 15 April 1414).[3][4] From this marriage, Bonville had a brother and sister, Thomas and Isabel.[5] [6] Elizabeth survived her husband and remarried to Richard Stucley (died before 1441)[7] of Ridgewell, Essex, Member of Parliament for Sussex, with whom she had two sons, Roger and Hugh Stukeley.
