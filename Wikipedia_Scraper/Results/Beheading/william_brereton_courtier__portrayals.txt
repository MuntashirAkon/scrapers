William Brereton was portrayed by James Gilbert on the Showtime series, The Tudors, during season 2. The show plotted him as a Catholic assassin in the guise of courtier, commissioned by the Pope (Peter O'Toole) and ambassador Eustace Chapuys (Anthony Brophy) to assassinate Anne Boleyn (Natalie Dormer) to revert King Henry VIII (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) from steering the English state at collision course with the Catholic Church. He was accused of having had carnal knowledge of the queen. Unlike the others in his position, who either denied – George Boleyn (Pádraic Delaney) and Henry Norris (Stephen Hogan) – were tortured into admitting it – Mark Smeaton (David Alpay) – or acquitted – Thomas Wyatt (Jamie Thomas King) – Brereton falsely admitted his guilt to Thomas Cromwell (James Frain), knowing that it would ensure the Queen's conviction for high treason, and thus the fulfilment of his objective, albeit at the cost of his own life.
On The Tudors, although Brereton was an actual historical figure, his character was totally fictionalised. William Brereton is portrayed as a young man, while in reality he was almost fifty. Moreover, he was not a Jesuit, nor was he commissioned by the Pope to assassinate Anne Boleyn. Anne was crowned queen in 1533 and executed in 1536,[18] while the Pope did not formally establish the Jesuit order until 1540. Brereton was probably collateral damage when Thomas Cromwell moved against the Boleyn faction and decided to get rid of him in the same coup.[6]
In Wolf Hall, a TV mini-series adaptation of the historical novel by Hilary Mantel, he was played by Alastair Mackenzie.
