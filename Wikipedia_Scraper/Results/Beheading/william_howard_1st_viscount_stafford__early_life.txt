William grew up in a nominally Anglican household, his father having converted to the Church of England in 1616.[1] William was undoubtedly exposed to Roman Catholic influences, as almost all of the Howard family remained loyal to that faith even when they conformed outwardly to the Established Church.[2]
His grandfather, Philip Howard, 20th Earl of Arundel had been imprisoned by Elizabeth I in the Tower of London for being a Catholic and had died there in 1595 after 10 years' imprisonment. In 1620, William was placed in the household of Samuel Harsnett, Bishop of Norwich for an education, then attended St John's College, Cambridge, at age 11 in 1624, but did not receive a degree.[3] He was still regarded as a member of the Church of England in 1633, when he was listed as an Ecclesiastical Commissioner.[1]
