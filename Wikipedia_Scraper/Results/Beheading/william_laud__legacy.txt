Laud is remembered in the Anglican Communion with a commemoration on 10 January. His collected works in seven volumes were published between 1847 and 1860 in the Library of Anglo-Catholic Theology.
The historian Patrick Collinson in 1980 condemned Laud as "the greatest calamity ever visited upon the English Church".[25]
In 2016, following the example of The King's School Gloucester, Reading School named their 5th house "Laud House" after him.
