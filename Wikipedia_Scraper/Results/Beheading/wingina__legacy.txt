Raleigh's 1584 expedition recorded the name of the regional king (Wingina) and reported to Queen Elizabeth I that he ruled over a land known as Wingandacoa. She was probably influenced by this report to modify the name of the colony to "Virginia", in part alluding to her status as the "Virgin Queen." It is the oldest surviving English place-name in the United States not wholly borrowed from a Native American word, and the fourth oldest surviving English place name, though it is Latin in form.[5] However, on Raleigh's subsequent voyage to the area, he recorded that Wingandacoa, the Carolina Algonquian word the English had heard upon his first arrival in 1584, means "What good clothes you wear!" and was not the native name of Wingina's country.[citation needed]
