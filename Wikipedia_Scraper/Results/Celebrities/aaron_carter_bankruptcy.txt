On November 22, 2013, Carter filed a bankruptcy petition to shed more than $3.5 million in debt,[48] mostly taxes owed from the money made at the height of his popularity.[49] "This is not a negative thing," Carter publicist Steve Honig told CNN. "It's actually very positive. It's him doing what he needs to do to move forward."[49] The petition states that Carter's biggest creditor is the U.S. government; "he owes the Internal Revenue Service $1.3 million in back taxes from his income in 2003, when Carter was just 16."[49]
In 2014, Carter settled all of his tax debt.[50]
