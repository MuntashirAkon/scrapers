It's just all having fun—with a good cause".[55] Jim Farber, writing for the Daily News, called the song a "dead-brained piece of generic dance music, without a single distinguishing feature," and suggested that the single made Kardashian the "worst singer in the reality TV universe."[56]

We want there to be something more, some reason or context, some great explanation that tells us what it is like to live in this very day and age, but there is not. Kim Kardashian's ass is nothing but an empty promise."[74] However, the stunt "set a new benchmark" in social media response,[75] and Paper's website received 15.9 million views in one day, compared with 25,000 views on an average day.[76][77]
