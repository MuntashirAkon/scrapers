Monk is of Welsh ancestry and was born October 17, 1959. This is shown in the episode "Happy Birthday, Mr. Monk", which takes place on a Wednesday of the week of October 16, 2009 (It is stated that his 50th birthday is the next day, which would be Thursday, October 17, 2009).
It is known he was born in the fictitious Marin County town of Tewksbury, to parents Agnes (Rose Abdoo) and Jack Monk, Sr (Dan Hedaya). His parents were very strict and over-protective, although his mother was emotionally distant and seemed to have difficulty expressing affection.[27] Adrian's father, Jack Monk, abandoned the family when Adrian was eight years old when he went out for Chinese food and did not return.[20] Adrian has an agoraphobic brother named Ambrose (John Turturro), from whom he was estranged for seven years following Trudy's death.[29] Monk states that his mother died in 1994.[30] The episode "Mr. Monk and the Marathon Man" reveals that Monk ran track in high school, but quit when he entered college. The episode "Mr. Monk and the Other Detective" reveals that his alma mater is the University of California, Berkeley. In "Mr. Monk and the Class Reunion", it is revealed that Monk had the nickname "Captain Cool" in college, and Natalie is amused to find that he got it from the fact he spent every weekend defrosting the student lounge refrigerator in his dormitory. His dorm room was number 303.
In the episode "Mr. Monk and the Three Pies", it is revealed that Monk was angry at his brother for never contacting him after Trudy's death.[29] When the two are reunited, Ambrose admits he did not call Adrian because he believed that he was responsible for the incident. Trudy was getting Ambrose cough medicine and was in the store's garage when she was killed.[29]
Their father, Jack, remained unseen in the series until the season 5 episode "Mr. Monk Meets His Dad".[20] Jack explains that he did not return to his family because the message in his fortune cookie read "Stand by your man", which he interpreted to mean that he should follow his own path.[20] Adrian does not forgive his father at first, but warms up to him while assisting him on his duties as a truck driver.[20] Jack mentions reading Sherlock Holmes stories to Adrian, who eventually learned to solve the mysteries before hearing the stories' endings.[20] At the end of the episode, Jack teaches Adrian how to ride a bike â€” something he was not there to do when Adrian was a child.[20] Jack also mentioned that he has a son from another wife, named Jack Jr. (Steve Zahn).[20] Monk later meets Jack Jr. in the episode "Mr. Monk's Other Brother", and helps to clear him of murder.[22]
Throughout the series, Adrian mourns his wife Trudy (Melora Hardin/Stellina Rusich), who was killed by a car bomb he believes was meant for him on December 14, 1997.[15][31] The death of his wife exacerbated Monk's already existing obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).[24][32][33] One year later, the San Francisco Police Department granted him a psychological discharge.[17] Monk calls it "a temporary suspension" and hopes to be reinstated.[17] His grief over Trudy's death is intense and with him every day of his life; he has stated more than once that he is never truly happy and never expects to be truly happy ever again.[34] Since Trudy's death, Monk has been consulting with San Francisco police detectives on various cases.[15]
As the series progresses, Monk makes several discoveries in his ongoing search for the man who killed his wife.[35] He discovered that the car bomb was indeed meant for Trudy and was built by a man named Warrick Tennyson (Frank Collison),[36] who was hired by a six-fingered man named Frank Nunn (Courtney Gains).[35][37] In the sixth-season finale, he finally catches up with Nunn, who claims to be yet another pawn with no idea why Trudy was killed.[37] This turns out to be part of a larger plot to have Nunn set up another bombing and then frame Monk for killing him; he is shot before Monk can have him arrested or convince him to surrender the name of his employer in Trudy's murder.[37] Once Monk is cleared in Nunn's death, the police find correspondence from Nunn dating back to the era of Trudy's death.[37] There are no names discovered, but there is a reference to the person responsible, referred to as "The Judge".[37] In the two-part series finale, "Mr. Monk and the End", it is revealed that "The Judge" is Ethan Rickover, an actual courtroom judge portrayed by Craig T. Nelson.
Trudy gave birth to a daughter, Molly Evans, on January 2, 1983. Had she not been adopted out and Trudy not murdered, this would technically make Adrian Molly's stepfather.
In the pilot episode "Mr. Monk and the Candidate", Monk plays the clarinet during his visit of Trudy's grave. His clarinet abilities show up again in "Mr. Monk and the Red-Headed Stranger" when he is invited to play the clarinet with Willie Nelson. Though Monk is not seen playing the clarinet afterwards, it occasionally is brought up in conversation (such as during a conversation with Kris Kedder in "Mr. Monk Goes to a Rock Concert").
