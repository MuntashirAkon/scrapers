Monk was originally envisioned as a "more goofy and physical" Inspector Clouseau type of character.[3][4][5] However, co-creator David Hoberman came up with the idea of a detective with obsessive-compulsive disorder.[3] This was inspired by his own bout with self-diagnosed obsessive-compulsive disorder; in a Pittsburgh Post-Gazette interview, he stated that, "Like Monk, I couldn't walk on cracks and had to touch poles. I have no idea why â€“ but if I didn't do these things, something terrible would happen."[4]
Other fictional inspirations include Columbo[3][6][7] and Sherlock Holmes, and his obsession with neatness and order may be an homage to Hercule Poirot.[3] Like Holmes, and occasionally Poirot, Monk is accompanied by an earnest assistant with little or no detective ability, similar to Doctor Watson and Captain Hastings, respectively;[8] Monk's two major allies from the police department, Captain Stottlemeyer and Lieutenant Disher (credited as "Deacon" in the pilot episode), are reminiscent of Inspector Lestrade and Chief Inspector Japp, Holmes's and Poirot's well-meaning but ineffectual respective police counterparts. In addition, Monk has a brother whose abilities of deduction are even more amazing than his, yet much more geographically limited due to his own personal problems, somewhat in the style of Mycroft Holmes (who is more adept than Sherlock but also notoriously lazy).[6][9][10]
When trying to think of a possible name for the character, co-creator Andy Breckman decided to look for a "simple monosyllabic last name"
Co-creator David Hoberman revealed that the casting sessions were "depressing".[11] USA Network's executive vice president Jeff Wachtel stated that looking for the right actor to portray Monk was "casting hell".[12] After two years of developing, the producers still had not found an actor to play the part.[11] Although Michael Richards was considered, distributors of the show ABC and Touchstone worried that the audience would typecast him for more comedic roles after his previous work as Cosmo Kramer on the sitcom series Seinfeld.[2][13] After Richards dropped out of the project, he went on to star in another series about a private detective, The Michael Richards Show, which was canceled after six episodes.[14]
