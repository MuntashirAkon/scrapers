Howard Rosenberg of the Los Angeles Times called Monk "TV's most original sleuth ever".[25] In a review of the show's pilot, Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle stated: "With his history and his sympathetic but funny 'problems', he [Monk] becomes one of television's most likable characters and floats a show that is, to be frank, riddled with improbability and simplicity".[38] Monk is ranked number 99 on Bravo's list of The 100 Greatest Television Characters of All Time.[39][40] He was named one of TV's Smartest Detectives by AOL.[41]
