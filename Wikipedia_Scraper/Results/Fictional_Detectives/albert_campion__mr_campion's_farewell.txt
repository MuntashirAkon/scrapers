Crime writer Mike Ripley recently undertook the challenge of completing an unfinished Campion manuscript, started by Philip Youngman Carter before his death.[7] The fragment of manuscript, which contained revisions and minor corrections but no plot outline, character synopsis or plan, was bequeathed to Margery Allinghamâ€™s sister Joyce; upon her death in 2001, the manuscript was left to officials of the Margery Allingham Society.[8] It was not until 2012 when Ripley, with the approval and agreement of the Margery Allingham Society, took up the challenge of completing Youngman Carter's manuscript, which has become Mr Campion's Farewell.
The novel was published in March 2014 by Severn House Publishers.[9]
