^ The line comes from A Vagabond Song, included in Carman's 1896 collection More Songs from Vagabondia. It is the first line to the third and final verse, which reads in full:
There is something in October sets the gypsy blood astir;
We must rise and follow her,
When from every hill of flame
She calls and calls each vagabond by name.[135]
^ Whether or not Jim might have been picked up by a ship without a radio set is an issue of debate in the days after he falls overboard. Shirley hopefully suggests that "[p]erhaps he was picked up by a ship that hasn't a wireless," to which Beverly responds that "[e]very ship these days has a wireless."[322] The issue at the root of Beverly's assertion was actually litigated four years previous to World Cruise in a now famous case, The T. J. Hooper.[323]
