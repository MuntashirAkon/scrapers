He is a member of the Queensland police force, although the novels are set throughout Australia.[3]
Bony often works undercover, usually as a station hand or labourer, with only a few senior police aware of his true identity. He frequently uses the alias Nat Bonnar, but other names such as Robert Burns[4] are used also. He often states that "my friends call me Bony".
He has an unblemished record of solving cases, and he is sometimes lent out by the Queensland Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to other jurisdictions that experience a murder unsolvable by the local authorities. He has an overall apathetic opinion of authority, frequently disregarding direct orders from his superiors. He mentions that he has been sacked several times, but due to his skill, is always reinstated almost immediately.
Bony is a tracker without peer, often seeing what other and lesser trackers have missed.
