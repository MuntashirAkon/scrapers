While working on the second Bony novel The Sands of Windee Arthur Upfield discussed many plot ideas with his outback companions, including Snowy Rowles who committed three murders using methods similar to those described in Upfield's novel. When Rowles was caught, Upfield was forced to testify at his trial. The ensuing publicity surrounding the murders greatly improved the sales of Upfield's novel, and the ensuing notoriety helped with kickstarting Upfield's rise to fame.
