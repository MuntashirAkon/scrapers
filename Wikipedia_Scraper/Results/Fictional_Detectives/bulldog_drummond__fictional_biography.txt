The Bulldog Drummond stories of H. C. McNeile follow Captain Hugh "Bulldog" Drummond, DSO, MC. Drummond is a member of "the Breed", a class of Englishman who were patriotic, loyal and "physically and morally intrepid".[2] Drummond is a wealthy gentleman, formerly an officer in the fictional "Royal Loamshire Regiment", who, after the First World War, spends his new-found leisure time looking for adventure. McNeile first wrote the Drummond character as a detective for a short story in The Strand Magazine, but the portrayal was not successful and was changed for the novel Bull-dog Drummond, which was a thriller.[2][a] The character was an amalgam of McNeile's friend Gerard Fairlie, and his idea of an English gentleman,[2] although writer J.D. Bourn disputes Fairlie's claim to be a model for the character, noting that "he was still at school when Sapper created his ... hero".[4] Drummond also had roots in the literary characters Sherlock Holmes, Sexton Blake, Richard Hannay and The Scarlet Pimpernel.[5]
Drummond's wartime experience had given him a series of abilities akin to that of a hunter: stealth—"he could move over ground without a single blade of grass rustling"—and the ability to incapacitate others—"he could kill a man with his bare hands in a second".[6] During his time on the Western Front he would take himself on solitary raids through no man's land.[7] Drummond was also proficient in jujutsu and boxing, was a crack shot,[8] played cricket for the Free Foresters, and was an excellent poker player.[9] In addition to Drummond's physical attributes is his common sense, which allows him to equal and beat his opponents, even if they have a superior intellect.[10]
Drummond is characterised as large, very strong, physically unattractive and an "apparently brainless hunk of a man",[11] He is six feet tall, weighs around 14 stone,[12] and has a "cheerful type of ugliness which inspires immediate confidence in its owner".[13] Throughout his exploits, Drummond is joined by several of his ex-army friends and colleagues, including Algy Longworth (who would appear in many of the films, as Drummond's sidekick), MC; Toby Sinclair, VC;[b] Peter Darrell and Ted Jerningham.[15] Dummond's ex-batman from his military days, James Denny, runs Drummond's flat on Half-Moon Street in Mayfair, London, along with Mrs Denny. (Denny appeared as Drummond's sidekick in the radio series, a version of the character named Tenny appeared in the films)[16] Drummond is a gentleman with a private income;[7] he is also construed as "a brutalized ex-officer whose thirst for excitement is also an attempt to reenact  [sic] the war",[17] although the character was later described by Cecil Day-Lewis, author of rival gentleman detective Nigel Strangeways, as an "unspeakable public school bully".[18]
The novel Bulldog Drummond begins when Drummond places an advertisement in a newspaper looking for adventure to lift the ennui of his life in post-war London. The response comes from Phyllis Benton, who is concerned for the health and well-being of her father, over whom Henry Lakington and Carl Peterson have a hold. At the end of the novel Drummond and Phyllis marry, and remain married throughout the course of the McNeile and Fairlie series of books, in contrast to the films, which generally portray Drummond as unmarried.[19] Phyllis becomes integral to the plot of some of the novels: she is kidnapped by Irma Peterson in several stories,[20] including The Black Gang[21] and The Female of the Species.[22]
In the matter of his personal tastes, Drummond is a member of the fictional Junior Sports Club, a gentleman's club on St. James's Square, London.[23] His preferred drink is beer[24] although he also enjoys drinking martinis and is knowledgeable about wines.[25] Drummond owns both a Rolls-Royce and a Bentley.[16]
Although Drummond's actions are intended to maintain the conservative status quo of Britain,[2] academic Hans Bertens considers that instead, he comes across as "a murderous exponent of a fierce competitive individualism".[26]
The first four books deal with Drummond against Carl Peterson, who becomes Drummond's arch-enemy. Peterson is also a master of disguise and uses several aliases. Peterson is killed in the fourth book, The Final Count,[27] although Fairlie brings him back for his final novel, The Return of the Black Gang.[28] Drummond forms a grudging respect for Peterson, and offers an honourable duel to the death at the end of The Third Round, instead of the usual summary justice that normally befalls members of Peterson's gang.[29] The writer Richard Usborne sees Peterson as "quite a sympathetic character. Almost, in fact, a hero",[30] and wrote that "authors ... fall in love with their big villains ... Sapper came to love Carl Peterson dearly, and so did Drummond".[31]
The title of the fifth Bulldog Dummond book, The Female of the Species refers to Rudyard Kipling's line "the female of the species is more deadly than the male".[22] Irma is described by Jonathon Green as "the slinky epitome of a twenties 'vamp'",[32] and by Lawrence Treadwell as dark, sexy and from an oriental background, "a true femme fatale".[33] After Carl Peterson's death in The Final Count, Irma swears revenge on Drummond and kidnaps his wife—whom he had met in Bulldog Drummond—with the intent of killing him in the ensuing chase.[29] Irma Peterson appears in six of McNeile's books, and in a further five by Fairlie.[33][c]
