His popularity spans three generations of Bengalis across the world and two generations of Doordarshan viewers in India. Filmmakers from Basu Chatterji to Satyajit Ray, Manju Dey to Swapan Ghosal, Rituparno Ghosh to Anjan Dutt have made celluloid and television versions of some Bomkesh story or another. The first Byomkesh Bakshi to grace the Bengali screen was Uttam Kumar picked by Satyajit Ray to play the detective in Chiriakhana (1967).
Anjan Dutt made three full-length feature films adapted from Byomkesh Bakshi mysteries. The first, Byomkesh Bakshi, was adapted from Adim Ripu rooted in the tragic story of a young man born of an illicit relationship desperate to be acknowledged by his biological father. The next, Abar Byomkesh was adapted from Chitracbor and the third, released early this year was Byomkesh Phire Elo adapted from Beni Sanhar. Abir Chatterjee plays Byomkesh in all three.
The Sunday Suspense series of 98.3 Radio Mirchi (Kolkata) adapted total nine novels of Byomkesh Bakshi for audio stories which include Satyanweshi, Makorshar Rosh, Agnibaan, Roktomukhi Neela, Khunji Khunji Nari, Adwitiyo, Lohar Biscuit, Seemonto Heera & Pother Kaanta performed by Mir Afsar Ali and Deep.
