Saradindu Bandopadhyay penned down 32 Byomkesh stories from 1932 to 1970 prior to his death, In his early stories Ajit Banerjee is described as his companion cum chronicler of his stories.But in some cases there Ajit also investigates in absence of Byomkesh (Makarshar rosh, ShoiloRahasya), These stories are all written traditional Bengali language but later stories it has been shifted to colloquial (cholite) language.Even it is also found that the later stories are not penned down by Ajit, as because he is much more engaged in publication business.
These stories are not very complicated, but very grasping one with series of events.From the first one Satyanweshi, where byomkesh destroys an international drug racket, to house hold mysteries and crimes like Arthamanartham, Makarshar Rosh etc all are equally enjoyable. Byomkesh gradually ages thorough out the series, and he has a son who is mentioned as Khoka(little boy) in the series, Saradindu doesn't want to continue the Byomkesh stories, that's why he stopped writing byomakesh stories from 1938 to 1951. At that time he was busy in script writing in Bombay.After his return to West Bengal, there is still craving for Byomkesh stories and he wrote Chitra chor in 1951 and gradually so on to 1970, when his last story "Bishu pal badh"(Killing of Bishu Pal) was not completed owing to his untimely death.
