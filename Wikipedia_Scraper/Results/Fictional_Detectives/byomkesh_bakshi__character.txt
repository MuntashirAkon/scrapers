Byomkesh is the first grown-up, professional detective and in his moods and mannerisms, he represented the Bengali middle class. Solving mysteries was a hobby for Jayanta. He was seldom bothered by material factors like remuneration. But for Byomkesh, the detective business is his livelihood. He wants to be paid for services rendered. He’s also a man who knows he’s working in a dangerous field – Byomkesh owns a gun that he occasionally carries with him. Though we don’t see him using it, the fact that he has it is a sign that these cases are not child’s play.
Byomkesh is a normal, educated, middle-class Bengali man; not a larger-than-life figure like Blake or Jayanta; or an eccentric, drug-addicted genius like Sherlock Holmes. Most of his cases revolve around a social issue that makes them relevant in addition to being mysterious. In at least three stories, he catches the murderer only to let them go scot-free because he considers them to be victims of circumstances. Speaking about Byomkesh in an interview, Sharadindu said,
“I had always tried to place the Byomkesh stories at a certain intellectual level.You can treat them as social fiction. In every man’s life, certain problems crop up from time. Byomkesh tries to solve such problems. I have never ignored the reality while writing those stories.”[5]
