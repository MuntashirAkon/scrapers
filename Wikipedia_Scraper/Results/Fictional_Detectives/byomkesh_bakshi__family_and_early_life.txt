Byomkesh Bakshi is described in Satyanweshi as "a man of twenty three or twenty four years of age who looked well educated." In the story Adim Ripu, there is some information about Byomkesh's early childhood. His father was a mathematics teacher at school and at home Byomkesh Sankhya philosophy practiced, and his mother was the daughter of the house of Vaishnava. When Byomkesh was seventeen years old, his father and mother died of TB. Later, Byomkesh passed the university with scholarship (jol pani).
During the Second World War and after the independence of India, Ajit and his family live in a mess house of Harrison Road. The only other person, except Bomkesh, is his attendant, Putiram. On Bomkesh's request, Ajit starts living at the house. Later, they decided to buy land in Keyatala in south Kolkata and shift to their new residence. It is also known that Bomkesh did not like being called a detective. He thought the intelligence associated with the word was not quite suitable for him. Thus he fashioned a new name for himself and had it inscribed on a brass plate in front of his house. The plate read " Bomkesh Bakshi Satyanweshi (Seeker of Truth)". Unlike other lead characters in detective stories, Bomkesh Bakshi marries, ages, contemplates buying a car etc. Byomakesh meets Satyavathi, whom he later marries, in the story "Arthamanartham" where her brother Sukumar is charged with a murder.[3]
