Saradindu was greatly influenced by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and in turn Byomkesh is greatly influenced by Sherlock Holmes. Ajit who is Byomkesh's friend and lives with him is also a writer and acts as the quintessential Watson in Byomkesh mysteries. Byomkesh lives with Ajit in a flat in Calcutta in the early stories, in the later ones Byomkesh gets married and even has a son, which is quite a contrast to the life long bachelor Holmes who stays away from anything conjugal. Byomkesh in many cases cogitates on the armchair trying to decrypt an obscure puzzle and in other cases is quite in the thick of action. Byomkesh is not pretentious and this can be seen in many stories where he is often underestimated and even ridiculed by the police. Byomkesh uses both deductive and intuitive methods to solve the sensational crimes in which he becomes embroiled. [2]
