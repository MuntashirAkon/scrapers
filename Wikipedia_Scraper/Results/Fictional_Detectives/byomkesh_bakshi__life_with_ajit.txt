As Sharadindu Bandhopadhay most well known character Byomkesh Bakshi first appeared as a character in the story Satyanweshi (truth seeker). The story is set in 1931 in the Chinabazar area of Kolkata where a 'non government detective' Byomkesh Bakshi on the permission of the police commissioner starts living in a mess in that area under the pseudonym of Atul Chandra Mitra to probe a series of murders. Most of the stories are written by Sharadindu under the pen name of Ajit who is said to have met Byomkesh in the mess at Chinabazar, a friendship that remained till the last novel. There is a sense of a rooted relationship between the two which elevates Ajit from the status of the customary satellite to that of an associate. Ajit understands Byomkesh as few others do; he works as Byomkesh’s sounding board and sometimes though not very often—offers insights that expedite the deduction processes of his friend.[4]
