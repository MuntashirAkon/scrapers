Cadfael is a Welsh name derived from the words cad ("battle") and mael ("prince").[4] Peters wrote that she found the name "Cadfael" only once in the records, given as the baptismal name of Saint Cadog, who later abandoned it.[5] There are differing pronunciations of the name Cadfael; Ellis Peters intended the "f" to be pronounced as an English "v" and suggested it be pronounced CAD-vel,[6] although normal Welsh pronunciation would be [ˈkadvaɨl] (approximately CAD-vile).[7] The name is commonly mispronounced /ˈkædfaɪl/ (CAD-file) in English (including the television series), and Peters once remarked that she should have included a guide for this and other names in the series that have uncommon pronunciations.[6]
