Calleigh is a ballistics and tool mark specialist originally from Louisiana. She is fluent in Spanish and has a bachelor's degree in physics from Tulane University. While working for the New Orleans Police Department, she gained the nickname "Bullet Girl" for her knowledge of, and expertise with, firearms. Calleigh is an almost eternal optimist, with a sunny disposition and a smile to match. However, this attitude does not in any way interfere with her quest to put criminals where they belong. She is pretty much universally liked by her co-workers, who sometimes remark on her being nearly "way too happy". And while she does not believe in supernatural curses and the like, she does believe in karma.[1] Though her time as a CSI has exposed her to intense violence and gore, in season two it is shown that she has an intense fear of ants which Eric Delko helps her overcome.[2] In season seven, it's also shown that Calleigh uses a Sanyo Pro-700 that has been digitally modified to have as big a screen as her cell phone.[3]
