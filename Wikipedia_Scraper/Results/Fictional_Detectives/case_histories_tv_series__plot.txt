Private investigator Jackson Brodie (Jason Isaacs), a former soldier and policeman, belies a deeply empathetic heart under his tough-guy exterior. He's unable to resist coming to the rescue and is a magnet for the bereaved, the lost and the dysfunctional. Intriguing, moving and funny, the character-driven stories conjure up a richly imagined world in which Jackson Brodie attempts to bring resolution to the victims of unexplained mysteries and comfort to the survivors of personal tragedies. He is the ultimate survivor himselfâ€”a bruised optimist, compelled to help others. Assisted by his faithful colleague Louise Munroe (Amanda Abbington), Jackson attempts to provide answers to those without hope of ever finding them any other way.[9]
