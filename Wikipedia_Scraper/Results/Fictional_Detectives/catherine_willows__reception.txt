For her portrayal of Catherine, Helgenberger received two Golden Globe Award nominations for Best Actress in a Television Series Drama in 2001 and 2002.[5][6] At the 6th Golden Satellite Awards, Helgenberger was nominated for Best Actress in a Drama Series. She also earned two Primetime Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series.[7] In 2005, Helgenberger won Favorite Female TV Performer at the 31st People's Choice Awards.[8]
Catherine was listed at number 82 on Bravo's 100 Greatest TV Characters, along with Gil Grissom.[9] She was also included in TV Guide's list of "TV's Sexiest Crime Fighters".[10] A writer for the publication commented "It's not difficult to believe that Catherine Willows was once an exotic dancer at a Vegas strip club. Thankfully, it's because of a regular at that gig that led her to pursuing higher education and eventually snare a CSI job."[10]
While reviewing the pilot episode, Mark A. Perigard from The Boston Herald thought that Catherine was an exception to the show's "revolting characters", calling her "harried but compassionate".[11] Mia Jones from After Ellen praised the character, commenting "CSI's Catherine Willows oozes feminine sex appeal even when she's bogged down with a bullet-proof vest, a gigantic utility belt, baseball cap and aviators. She is the anti-Debra Morgan."[12]
