The first season première "Murder by the Book" was written by Steven Bochco and directed by Steven Spielberg. Jonathan Demme directed the seventh-season episode "Murder Under Glass". Jonathan Latimer was also a writer. Actor Ben Gazzara, a friend of Falk's, directed the episodes "A Friend in Deed" (1974) and "Troubled Waters" (1975).
Falk himself directed the last episode of the first season, "Blueprint for Murder". Actor Nicholas Colasanto, best known for playing Coach on Cheers, directed two episodes, "Swan Song" with Johnny Cash, and "Étude in Black".
Patrick McGoohan directed five episodes (including three of the four in which he played the murderer) and wrote and produced two (including one of these). Vincent McEveety was a frequent director, and homage was paid to him by a humorous mention of a character with his surname in the episode "Undercover" (which he directed).
Two episodes, "No Time to Die" and "Undercover", were based on the 87th Precinct novels by Ed McBain,[26] and thus do not strictly follow the standard Columbo/inverted detective story format.
Columbo episodes contain a variety of music that contributes to the uniqueness of each. The score becomes of particular importance during turning points of the plots. "The Mystery Movie Theme" by Henry Mancini written for the NBC Mystery Movie was used extensively in the whole of 38 episodes, from 1971 to 1977. Unlike the other elements of the Mystery Movie wheel, Columbo never had an official theme as such, although some composers did write their own signature pieces (such as Dick DeBenedictis and Gil Mellé). Several composers created original music for the series, that was often used along with "The Mystery Movie Theme":
Dick DeBenedictis (23 episodes, 1972–2003)
Patrick Williams (9 episodes, 1977–92)
Bernardo Segall (10 episodes, 1974–76)
Billy Goldenberg (7 episodes, 1971–74)
Gil Mellé (4 episodes, 1971–72)
Jeff Alexander (1 episode, 1975)
Oliver Nelson (1 episode, 1972)
Dave Grusin (1 episode, 1968)
Bob Prince (1 episode, 1977)
Jonathan Tunick (1 episode, 1978)
John Cacavas (3 episodes, 1989–91)
James Di Pasquale (2 episodes, 1990)
Steve Dorff (2 episodes, 1991)
Dennis Dreith (1 episode, 1990)
Richard Markowitz (1 episode, 1990)
David Michael Frank (1 episode, 1990)
Ken Jordan (1 episode, 2003)
Series Music department included:
Henry Mancini — composer: "Mystery Movie" theme / "Sunday Mystery Movie" theme (38 episodes, 1971–77)

Patrick Williams received two Emmy nominations for Outstanding Music Composition for a Series in 1978 (for "Try and Catch Me") and 1989 (for "Murder, Smoke and Shadows"). Billy Goldenberg was nominated in the same category in 1972 for "Lady in Waiting".
Columbo also featured an unofficial signature tune, the children's song "This Old Man". It was introduced in the episode "Any Old Port in a Storm" in 1973 and the detective can be heard humming or whistling it often in subsequent films. Peter Falk admitted that it was a melody he personally enjoyed and one day it became a part of his character.[27] The tune was also used in various score arrangements throughout the three decades of the series, including opening and closing credits. A version of it, titled "Columbo", was created by one of the show's composers, Patrick Williams.[28]
