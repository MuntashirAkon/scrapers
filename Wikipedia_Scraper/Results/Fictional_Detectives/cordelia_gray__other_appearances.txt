Gray was highlighted in volume 14 of the Detective Conan manga's edition of "Gosho Aoyama's Mystery Library", a section of the graphic novels where the author introduces a different detective (or occasionally, a villain) from mystery literature, television, or other media. Her name was also used to create a cover name for one of the series' main characters, Ai Haibara: as stated by professor Hiroshi Agasa in volume 18, the "Hai" (ÁÅ∞) kanji meaning "gray" in her surname is a tribute to Cordelia.
Cordelia Glauca from the Japanese anime Tantei Opera Milky Holmes is a descendant of Cordelia Gray, and Gray's ghost also appears in the ninth episode of the first season.
Her name serves as inspiration for the pen name Cordelia, adopted by Nancy Callahan in her letters to the imprisoned John Hartigan in Sin City.
