Cordelia lives near Thames Street in an apartment with furniture bought from second-hand dealers or during auctions in the suburbs.
At first shy and unconfident, as the story progresses she learns how to solve a case and becomes methodical and serious.[3] A stoic girl, she deals with the suicide of Bernie calmly. Whilst she seems to like order and knowledge, and seems as though she remains focused to the task, during many occasions within The Skull Beneath The Skin she becomes somewhat superficial and conscious of her appearance, compared to that of the more privileged of her clients. Cordelia loves travelling and reading, and is jealous of her privacy.[4] She is a decent shooter. Despite being educated in a Catholic convent, she isn't a strong believer.
