Russell is presented to the audience as incredibly intelligent, though he didn't receive any formal education until college. His parents, hippies, were itinerant folk musicians, who named him for artist Richard Diebenkorn[6] and raised him in a camper-van. He was married to Barbara Russell,[7] but wound up divorcing her;[8] together they had a son, Charlie, who is a student and basketball player at Western Las Vegas University; a daughter, Maya, who in turn has a daughter of her own, Kaitlyn; and two other children.[7] Professionally, it is revealed that Russell had previously worked as the Director of a crime lab in Seattle, Washington, alongside Detective Daniel Shaw and blood spatter analyst Julie Finlay. He comes to Las Vegas as the new Night Shift Supervisor, since Catherine Willows and Nick Stokes were demoted as a result of Internal Affairs removing Raymond Langston from the team.
