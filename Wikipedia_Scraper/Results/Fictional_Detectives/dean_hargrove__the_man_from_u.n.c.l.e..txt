He became a writer for The Man from U.N.C.L.E. late in the show's first season (1964). His biggest involvement with UNCLE was in the second season when he wrote episodes that included a two-parter, "The Alexander the Greater Affair", later repackaged as the film One Spy Too Many. He did not work on the third season of UNCLE and wrote just one two-parter for the short-lived fourth season.[3]
