Hall's portrayal of the title character remains a towering achievement, one that eclipses the show's other shortcomings and rough patches".

Joshua Alston with Newsweek mentioned the character, along with Tony Soprano and Jack Bauer, as an example of the growing popularity of antiheroes.[47] Commenting that Hall was "adept at portraying repressives", Ginia Bellafonte of The New York Times said this vigilante operates on the "stylized libertarianism that sees institutional failure wherever it looks".[48] Calling Dexter "the thinking woman's killer", Wendy Dennis of Maclean's remarked that the show enjoys a high female audience because they are attracted to damaged men who are still sweet, handsome, and dependable.[49] He appeared in Comcast's list of TV's Most Intriguing Characters.[50] Paste ranked Dexter Morgan number 6 on their list of the 20 Best Characters of 2011.[51]

Connections were established between Dexter Morgan and Mark Twitchell, of Edmonton, Alberta, during his first-degree murder trial. After weeks of testimony and evidence presented in court, Twitchell was found guilty of the planned and deliberate murder of 38-year-old Johnny Altinger on April 12, 2011.[52] Twitchell, an aspiring filmmaker, had adopted the persona "Dexter Morgan" on Facebook and made a movie that was similar to how Dexter operates in the TV show.[53] Prosecutors alleged that Twitchell had begun a double life inspired by Dexter.[54] Twitchell wanted to re-enact the life of Dexter Morgan, and after writing a script for a Dexter movie, began posing as a woman online interested in having an affair with married men.[55] Detective Mark Anstey of the Edmonton Police Service was quoted as saying, "We have a lot of information to suggest he definitely idolizes Dexter", and Twitchell had posted a Facebook status stating that he believed he had "way too much in common with Dexter Morgan".[56][57] A nonfiction book on the case, The Devil's Cinema, detailed how Twitchell had written chilling Facebook status updates under his Dexter Morgan account, including, "Dexter is patiently waiting for his next victi... uh, play date buddy", but his followers did not know how true these posts really were.[58]
Andrew Conley said the show inspired him to strangle his 10-year-old brother.[59] In an affidavit filed in Ohio County court, police said Andrew stated that he "watches a show called Dexter on Showtime, about a serial killer, and he stated, 'I feel just like him.'".[60] Even further, after killing his brother, he put a plastic bag over his brother's head, mimicking a practice that Dexter ritualistically commits to dispose of his victims.[61]
