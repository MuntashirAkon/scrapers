Two different omnibus editions of the collected Dr. Thorndyke short stories exist. The British edition is R. Austin Freeman, The Famous Cases of Dr. Thorndyke: Thirty-seven of His Criminal Investigations as set down by R. Austin Freeman (London: Hodder & Stoughton, 1929 and later reprintings). The American edition is R. Austin Freeman, The Dr. Thorndyke Omnibus: 38 of His Criminal Investigations as set down by R. Austin Freeman (New York: Dodd, Mead, 1932 and later reprintings). The American edition includes one story, "The Mandarin's Pearl," printed in the first Thorndyke short-story collection, John Thorndyke's Cases, but omitted from the British omnibus. Two other stories, "The Man with the Nailed Shoes" and "A Message from the Deep Sea", though also appearing in the first Dr. Thorndyke short-story collection, John Thorndyke's Cases, were omitted from the British and American editions of the omnibus collection.
The order in the list appearing below is that of the American edition, which reprinted the five collections of stories in the following order (with two omissions already noted and also indicated below): The Singing Bone, Dr. Thorndyke's Cases, The Magic Casket, The Puzzle Lock, and The Blue Scarab. The British edition gives the stories in a different order from that of the American edition, indicated below by a bracketed note appearing after each story title giving its place in the British edition, denoted by the abbreviation UK and a two-digit number.
The first six stories of the list are "inverted" detective stories, divided into two parts. In the first part of each story, Freeman presented an account of the commission of a crime; in the second part, he presented an account, by Thorndyke's colleague Dr. Christopher Jervis, of Dr. Thorndyke's solution of the crime. The remaining stories are called "direct" stories.
A modern publisher, Battered Silicon Dispatch Box, issued a 10-volume edition of the complete works of R. Austin Freeman, including all the Thorndyke novels and short stories. Amazon released two volumes of electronic versions of "Dr. Thorndyke Mysteries Collection", each containing four of the original books.

A short series featuring Dr Thorndyke was produced by the BBC in 1964, entitled Thorndyke. The title character was played by veteran British actor Peter Copley.
Based on the stories written by R Austin Freeman, the episodes, all of which except the pilot are missing from the BBC archive, were as follows:
"The Case of Oscar Brodski" (Pilot — as part of BBC series Detective)
"The Old Lag"
"A Case of Premeditation"
"The Mysterious Visitor"
"The Case of Phyllis Annesley" (adapted from 'Phyllis Annesley's Peril')
"Percival Bland's Brother" (adapted from 'Percival Bland's Proxy')
"The Puzzle Lock"
Two stories were also adapted as part of the Thames TV series The Rivals of Sherlock Holmes, in 1971-3. These were:
"A Message from the Deep Sea" (from the first series and starring John Neville as Thorndyke)
"The Moabite Cipher" (from the second series and starring Barrie Ingham as Thorndyke)
Both series are available on DVD: in the UK from Network Video and in the USA from Acornmedia.[citation needed]
On September 14, 1963 Mollie Hardwick adapted Mr. Pottermack's Oversight on Saturday Night Theatre for the BBC Home Service in the Series Murder for Pleasure. [1]
Starting in 2011 the BBC aired radio adaptations of some of the Thorndyke short stories, Thorndyke: Forensic Investigator on BBC Radio 4 Extra.[2]
