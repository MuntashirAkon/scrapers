Like Sherlock Holmes, Lord Peter Wimsey, and Nero Wolfe, tales featuring Chesterton's priest detective continue to be created even after the original author's death. John Peterson has written a further forty-four mysteries solved by the indomitable Father Brown. Peterson's stories are set many decades after Chesterton's and, in them, Father Brown is a still spry nonagenarian priest attached as associate pastor to St. Dominic's Catholic parish in Bardo County someplace in the rural American Midwest. Peterson's stories are shorter than Chesterton's and, of course, in a much different style than Chesterton's paradoxical, quirky, and alliterative English, but, in them Father Brown still offers his insights into the criminal mind, serving justice and offering mercy.[6]
