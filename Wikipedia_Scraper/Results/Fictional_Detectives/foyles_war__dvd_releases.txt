In the UK, the first three series of Foyle's War were originally released as two separate 2-disc DVDs per series, containing two episodes each and released on the same day, and with episode titles instead of series numbers to keep them apart. This solution was originally also used for the DVD release of TV series 4. However, in March 2007, distributor Acorn Media (who handles the distribution both in the UK and the US), began re-releasing series 1â€“3 as four disc DVDs for the UK, as they had from the start in the US, and labelling them with series numbers. A complete boxed set of the series (1 thru 8) has been made available.
