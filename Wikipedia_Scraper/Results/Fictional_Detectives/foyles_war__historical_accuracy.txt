The series is notable for its attention to historical detail, and the drama is frequently moved along by historical events of the Second World War. Creator Anthony Horowitz considered that to honour the veterans of the war it was important to get the details correct.[notes 1] As the series progressed, Horowitz became more interested in the "murder mystery" format than the portrayal of history and exploration of the Home Front.[notes 2] However, the Imperial War Museum is credited in an advisory capacity in some episodes. The series' creators take great trouble over sets, props and costumes.
