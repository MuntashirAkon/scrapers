TunFaire is the capital of the kingdom of Karenta. It is a large, sprawling city, home to people and creatures of all types. Some of the areas of TunFaire include:
Wizard's Reach: The area in which Garrett's house is located.
The Hill: Where the major sorcerers, wealthy individuals, and war leaders of TunFaire live.
The Bustee: The poorest and most dangerous neighborhood in TunFaire.
The Safety Zone: An area where species can intermix without fear of prejudice, created by Morley Dotes and home to The Joy House.
The Dream Quarter: Home to the major churches and chapels of TunFaire.
The Tenderloin: A mafia-controlled red light district where anything can be purchased for the right price.
The Dead Zone: The political area of the city.
The Joy House is a bar and restaurant in the Safety Zone, owned and operated by Morley Dotes. Morley's henchmen can often be found working the bar. The establishment serves only vegetarian and non-alcoholic fare. Morley lives in an apartment suite on the second floor, reached by a set of stairs near the bar; a speaking tube allows the bartender to communicate with him.
In Petty Pewter Gods, Morley decides to renovate the Joy House, turning it into The Palms, a more upscale establishment that caters to TunFaire's elite.
An imperial charity, the Infirmary is supposed to provide medical care for the indigent population of TunFaire. Due to lack of funding, few patients at the Bledsoe receive any medical attention at all. The Bledsoe is also the city's insane asylum. It has been said that the poor conditions are not as much due to financial problems but the corrupt administration. The hospital workers even make money by providing the insane patients for home entertainments.
The Al-Khar is an old, decrepit building that serves as the main jail in TunFaire. It is also the headquarters for the city Watch.
Karenta is the kingdom in which TunFaire is located. Karenta has been at war with another kingdom, Venageta, for over a hundred years. Part way through the series, this war will abruptly end, leading to unrest in the city of TunFaire.
The Cantard is a huge geographical region eight hundred miles to the south of TunFaire. The Cantard contains the majority of the world's silver mines (in Garrett's world silver is a necessary material for the working of magic), which has led to the Cantard Wars between Karenta and Venageta. Most of the countryside is desert, while the coastal fringe is hemmed by swampy islands where Garrett once fought as a Marine.
Many human residents of TunFaire have a shared history of fighting the war in the Cantard, because of the mandatory five years of service required of all male citizens. Soldiers could then enlist with a voluntary two years which few took up, followed by another voluntary twenty year that very few survived. As only humans were subject to such conscription, many non-humans moved to TunFaire to make up for this labor shortage, and racism against these immigrants flared up when the troops returned home and found few jobs waiting for them.
