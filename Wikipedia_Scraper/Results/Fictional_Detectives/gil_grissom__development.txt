Gil Grissom first appears in CSI: Crime Scene Investigation on the pilot episode. After this he appeared in almost every single episode of the show's first eight years, except in "Hollywood Brass", from season five, an episode that turns entirely around Jim Brass; besides him, only three other regular characters appear.[7] William Petersen did not appear during the season six episode "Gum Drops". This episode was originally going to be how Grissom was convinced that an abduction victim was still alive. When Petersen's nephew died, he flew home and was unavailable for the filming of the episode, which was rewritten to be centered on Nick.[8] During 2007 (CSI's season seven) William Petersen took a break from CSI to appear in a five-week run of the Trinity Repertory Company production of Dublin Carol in Providence, Rhode Island, resulting in Grissom taking a sabbatical, being replaced by Liev Schreiber, as Michael Keppler, who developed a small story arc through "Sweet Jane", "Redrum" and "Meet Market". Also in 2007, the character appeared in a two part crossover with another CBS series, Without a Trace. It was the sixth episode of the sixth season entitled Where and Why. The plot of the crossover between CSI and Without a Trace involved a serial killer that had eluded capture in Nevada and had escaped to New York City. Gil Grissom was brought in to assist in the apprehension.
