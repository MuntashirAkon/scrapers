In February 2015, Amazon Prime showed the series Bosch, based on the novels. The ten-episode series starred Titus Welliver as Harry Bosch, with Annie Wersching and Jamie Hector co-starring as Officer Julia Brasher and Det. Jerry Edgar respectively. Henrik Bastin of Fabrik Entertainment produced and Jim McKay directed. The series followed Bosch "as he pursues the killer of a 12-year-old boy while standing trial in federal court on accusations that he murdered a suspected serial killer in cold blood."[8]
According to Connelly, a number of changes were made "to the world of Harry Bosch ... in making the shift from page to screen". In the series, Harry "is 47 years old and a veteran of the first Gulf War in 1991, where he was part of a Special Forces team that cleared tunnels. He has now been a police officer for twenty years with a one-year exception when he re-upped with the Army after 9/11, as many LAPD officers did. He came back to the force after serving in Afghanistan and again encountering tunnel warfare."[9]
A "13 day shoot" on the pilot episode of the series began in Los Angeles on 4 November 2013, while Connelly kept a daily "set journal".[10] The pilot was released on Amazon Prime in February 2014, and the full series was shown in February 2015.[11][12] On March 18, 2015, Bosch was renewed for a second season,[13] which takes inspiration from Connelly's novels Trunk Music, The Drop, and The Last Coyote.[14] The second season premiered on March 11, 2016. Amazon renewed Bosch for a third season soon after the second season was released, which will adapt novels The Black Echo and elements of A Darkness More Than Night. The third season premiered on April 21, 2017.[15] On October 16, 2016, Bosch was renewed for a fourth season.[16]
