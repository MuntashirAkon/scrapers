Japp has been depicted in seven novels written by Christie, all featuring Hercule Poirot:[2]
The Mysterious Affair at Styles (1920)
The Big Four (1927)
Peril at End House (1932)
Lord Edgware Dies (1933), also known as Thirteen at Dinner
Death in the Clouds (1935), also known as Death in the Air
The A.B.C. Murders (1936), also known as The Alphabet Murders
One, Two, Buckle My Shoe (1940), also known as An Overdose of Death and The Patriotic Murders. This is his last appearance in any work by Christie.
Japp was mentioned by Colonel Weston in Evil Under the Sun, the next book in the Poirot series after his final appearance. Japp is also mentioned in the novel "Taken at the Flood" by Superintendent Spence during a conversation with Hercule Poirot.
In most of these appearances, Japp is a minor character with minimal interactions with Poirot or involvement in the plot. However, Japp emerges as a major character and partner to Poirot in Lord Edgware Dies. He returns in this capacity in Death in the Clouds and One, Two, Buckle My Shoe, before being written out of the series. In number of appearances, Japp is comparable to Arthur Hastings who was featured in eight of the Poirot novels.[2]
Japp also appears in Charles Osborne's novelisation of Christie's 1929 stage play Black Coffee.
