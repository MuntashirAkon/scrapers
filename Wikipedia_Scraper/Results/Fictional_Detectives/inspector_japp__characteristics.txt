James Japp, while being a competent detective, is no match for Poirot; he frequently finds himself a step behind the great detective but has developed a grudging respect for the man's abilities over their years together. Japp and Hastings often commiserate on their confusion and inability to keep up with Poirot on cases. At times, Japp cannily plays upon Poirot's ego in order to nudge the detective into taking up cases, but in such ways as Poirot does not seem to realize that Japp is maneuvering him.
Japp and Hastings are also generally astonished to find that Poirot cannot understand anything typically English (like cricket, which he maintains is utter nonsense).
