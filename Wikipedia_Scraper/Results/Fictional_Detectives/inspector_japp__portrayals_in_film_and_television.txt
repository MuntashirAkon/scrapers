The role of Japp is played by Philip Jackson in the British TV series Agatha Christie's Poirot, where Hercule Poirot's character is played by David Suchet. Before Suchet took on the role of Poirot, he had previously played Japp himself in the 1985 film Thirteen at Dinner, where Peter Ustinov played Poirot. Philip Jackson also plays Japp alongside John Moffat's Poirot in an ongoing series of BBC Radio adaptations, produced contemporaneously with the Suchet TV series. The portrayal of Philip Jackson is considered to be one of the best and most popular portrayals of Japp to date. Jackson portrays Japp as working-class and 'thoroughly British', not very intelligent but an extremely diligent, canny and active police officer with a good but rather dry sense of humour, characteristics which often serve as a perfect foil to Poirot's personality, who is intelligent, elegant, upper-class but rather slow in movements and of a very serious nature.
Japp is played by Melville Cooper in the 1931 film adaptation of Christie's stage play Black Coffee.
As the word Jap is pronounced in the same way as the chief inspector's name, he was renamed Inspector Sharp (シャープ警部, Shaapu-kebu) in the Japanese anime series Agatha Christie's Great Detectives Poirot and Marple (NHK, 2004).
In the Professor Layton series of puzzle video games for the NintendoDS and Nintendo3DS, the fictional Scotland Yard chief inspector Chelmey appears visually and contextually as a comically incompetent caricature of Inspector Japp as played by Philip Jackson.
