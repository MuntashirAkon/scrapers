Morse is ostensibly the embodiment of white, male, middle-class Englishness, with a set of prejudices and assumptions to match. He may thus be considered a late example of the gentleman detective, a staple of British detective fiction. This background is in sharp contrast to the working-class origins of his assistant Lewis (named after another rival clue-writer Mrs.Â B. Lewis); in the novels, Lewis is Welsh, but in the TV series this is altered to a Tyneside (Geordie) background, appropriately for actor Kevin Whately. Lewis is also middle-aged in the books.
Morse's relationships with authority, the establishment, bastions of power and the status quo, are markedly ambiguous, like some of are his relations with women. He is frequently portrayed as patronising female characters. However he empathises with women, and once noted that the female sex is not naturally prone to crime, being caring and non-violent. He is not shy to show his liking for attractive women and often dates those involved in cases. Indeed a woman he falls in love with sometimes turns out to be the culprit.
Morse is highly intelligent. He is a crossword addict and dislikes spelling and grammatical errors; in every personal or private document that he receives, he manages to point out at least one mistake. He claims that his approach to crime-solving is deductive, and one of his key tenets is that "there is a 50 per cent chance that the person who finds the body is the murderer". Morse uses immense intuition and his fantastic memory to get to the killer.
Among Morse's conservative tastes are that he likes to drink real ale and whisky, and in the early novels, drives a Lancia. In the television and radio productions, this is altered to a suitably British vintage Jaguar Mark 2. His favourite music is opera, which is echoed in the soundtracks to the television series, along with original music by Barrington Pheloung.
