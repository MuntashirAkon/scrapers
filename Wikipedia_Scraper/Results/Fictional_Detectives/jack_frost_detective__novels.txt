Wingfield published six novels about DI Frost, starting with Frost at Christmas in 1984. In 2011, 2012 and 2013, three new Frost books were published under the name James Henry. In the case of First Frost, this pseudonym refers to James Gurbutt and Henry Sutton, but in Fatal Frost and Morning Frost it refers to Gurbutt only.
