From 2000 to 2001 Randall was played by Bob Mortimer in the remake of the series.[3] By contrast to the original series, Randall on this occasion is a far more moral individual, refusing to become involved with Jeannie after Marty's death despite being significantly tempted, and displaying little real interest in other women even when they make their attraction clear. He shows a greater understanding of other people than the original, but lacks his hand-to-hand combat skills, with most of the physical side of their cases being handled by Jeannie.
