Deaver was born outside Chicago in Glen Ellyn, Illinois, and grew up in a creative family. His mother was an artist, and his father an advertising writer. [4] His sister Julie Reece Deaver is an author of young adult novels. [5] Deaver was a journalist, folksinger, and attorney.[6] He lives alone and does a great deal of cooking in all cuisines. The book that inspired him to write was From Russia With Love, a James Bond novel by Ian Fleming. [7]
Deaver's most popular series features his regular character Lincoln Rhyme, a quadriplegic detective, and NYPD Detective Amelia Sachs. Deaver stated in a 2006 Early Show interview that he would rotate between his new series and Lincoln Rhyme each year. Virtually all of his works feature a trick ending or multiple trick endings.
Deaver's 2001 book The Blue Nowhere features criminal hackers (one using social engineering to commit murder), as well as a law enforcement computer crime unit. In this book, Deaver gives credit to Lee de Forest, the inventor of the Audion (also known as the triode tube), who is thus considered to have opened the world to electronic development.)[8]
Deaver edited The Best American Mystery Stories 2009.
Three of Deaver's novels have been produced into films:
A Maiden's Grave made for TV as film Dead Silence 1997
The Bone Collector released 1999
The Devil's Teardrop made for TV 2010
Deaver also created the characters and—in a collaboration with 14 other noted writers—wrote the 17-part serial thriller The Chopin Manuscript narrated by Alfred Molina that was broadcast on Audible.com from September 25 to November 13, 2007. It is now also available in print.
Deaver was chosen to write an official new James Bond novel:[9] Carte Blanche[10] is set in 2011 and was published on May 25, 2011.[11] He is the second American author to write Bond novels, after Raymond Benson.
