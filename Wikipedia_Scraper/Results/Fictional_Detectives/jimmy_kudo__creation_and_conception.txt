The idea that Jimmy Kudo would be turned into a child stemmed from the idea of a Tortoiseshell cat Sherlock Holmes as a protagonist.[3] Gosho Aoyama's idea was the cat would indicate the crucial evidence needed to solve the case; a performance the child-turned Jimmy does to help those around with the investigation. Jimmy was inspired by the fictional private eye Shunsaku Kudo.[4] Aoyama revealed that his editor was against the name Conan due to the protagonist from the anime series Future Boy Conan sharing the same name and had suggested to name him Doyle instead. The author stuck with the name Conan believing it would overtake the Future Boy series. According to Aoyama, Jimmy's catch phrase Shinjitsu wa Itsumo Hitotsu! (真実はいつもひとつ!, literally There is only one truth!) was thought of by the anime adaptation's script writer and drawn into chapter 96 of the manga at the same time.[3] In the English localization, the catch phrase was translated as "One Truth Prevails".[5]
