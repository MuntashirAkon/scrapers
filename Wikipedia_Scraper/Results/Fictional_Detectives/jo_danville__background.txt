Jo Danville joins the team as the new Assistant Supervisor, replacing Stella Bonasera.[1] She comes from Virginia, where she worked for the FBI. Her field of expertise is DNA evidence, and her moral standpoint is that everyone is innocent until the science proves otherwise. She also has a background in criminal psychology, which makes her very effective at getting under the skin of potential suspects when she questions them.
While working in the FBI's crime lab in Washington D.C., she discovered a long-time respected lab technician had covered up evidence of a mistake he made for a case. Jo brought this to the attention of the defense attorneys, costing her support in the city and pushing her to move.
Upon her arrival at the crime lab, she walks into the empty lab (because everyone’s attending Lindsay Monroe’s medal presentation) and finds a dead body.[2]
Her badge number is 8278.[3]
