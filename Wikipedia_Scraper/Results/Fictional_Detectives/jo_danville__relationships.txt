She has a very good working relationship with Mac Taylor, and he treats her like an equal, as opposed to his Assistant Supervisor. In the season 7 premiere, she meets Taylor and the rest of the team in the lab after finding the dead body of a woman on her arrival to the lab.
She has revealed that she is a fan of the Alabama Crimson Tide college football team during a case involving stolen jewelry (in real life, actress Sela Ward's alma mater is the University of Alabama); and once worked for a burlesque club at college, but only as an accountant, much to the intrigue and later the disappointment of Mac. She also, like her predecessor Stella Bonasera, often shows concern for Mac, as in the episode "Nothing for Something" when she notices that Mac had been wearing the same suit three days running.
