Other television programmes have utilised the same formula of a magician helping police to solve crimes,[13] such as the U.S.-made programmes The Magician, starring Bill Bixby, which aired in 1973â€“74, and 1986's short-lived Blacke's Magic, starring Hal Linden.[14] Other current American series utilising a similar format include The Mentalist and Psych, each of which revolves around "mind-readers" who use their skills to help solve crimes and mysteries.[13]
There were two attempts to make a U.S. version of Jonathan Creek. The first involved Castle Rock, the production company behind series such as Seinfeld, but the initial scripts were not felt to be good enough, and David Renwick's scripts were rejected by CBS.[15] The second attempt, also by Renwick, was for Whoopi Goldberg and would have included Alan Davies.[15]
