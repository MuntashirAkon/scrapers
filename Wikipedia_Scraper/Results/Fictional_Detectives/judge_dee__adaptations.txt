The stories have been adapted into comic strips by Dutch artists Fritz Kloezeman [4] between 1964 and 1969 and Dick Matena in 2000. [5]
Judge Dee has been adapted for television twice in English.
In 1969, Howard Baker produced six Judge Dee stories for Granada Television.[6] These episodes were in black and white and were not a ratings success. The series was criticised for using an English actor, Michael Goodliffe, with unconvincing make-up to play the Judge.[citation needed]
In 1974, Gerald Isenberg adapted the novel The Haunted Monastery into a television movie, titled Judge Dee and the Monastery Murders. It starred Khigh Dhiegh as Judge Dee. With the exception of the star (who generally played East Asian roles but was of English and North African descent), the movie had an all-Asian cast, including Mako, Soon-Tek Oh, Keye Luke, and James Hong. The writing was credited to Nicholas Meyer and Robert van Gulik.[7] It was nominated for an Edgar Award, for Best Television Feature or Miniseries in 1975.
Some of Robert van Gulik's Judge Dee stories have been adapted for Chinese TV by CCTV. As of 2012, four different DVD series are available with one series so far with English subtitles. CCTV produced series in 2004, 2006, 2008 and 2010. The series from 2010, entitled "Detective Di Renjie" has been produced on DVD by Tai Seng entertainment with English subtitles.[citation needed]
