Grafton announced that book 24 ("X") would be released in 2015 and book 25 ("Y" Is for Yesterday) in 2017.[5] When asked about the title of book 24, Grafton told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune that the title "almost has to be Xenophobe or Xenophobia. I've checked the penal codes in most states and xylophone isn't a crime, so I'm stuck."[6] Ultimately, Grafton broke the usual title pattern, naming the 24th book simply "X".
Grafton has stated that the twenty-sixth and final book in the series will be titled "Z" Is for Zero and released in 2019.[5][7] In 2009 Grafton told a Los Angeles Times interviewer that the final novel will "coincide with Kinsey's 40th birthday in 1990".[7] In July 2011 Grafton told The Wall Street Journal, "You're never going to have to watch Kinsey Millhone go through menopause."[8]
Kinsey and Me (1992) - a collection of Kinsey Millhone short stories along with other short stories about Grafton's own mother. It was originally published in 1991 (but without the stories concerning Grafton's mother; they were written later), by Bench Press, owned by Grafton's husband, Steven Humphrey. That limited publication ran to 326 copies (300 numbered and 26 lettered),[9] and was re-published in January 2013 as a collection of the Kinsey short stories (including The Lying Game) plus stories depicting "Kit Blue", which involve a fictionalized version of Grafton's mother.[10]
"The Lying Game" (2003) - a Kinsey Millhone short story which appeared in the September 2003 special 40th anniversary Lands' End catalogue. It also appeared as a separate pamphlet given to attendees at Malice Domestic 2011 conference, where Grafton was recognized for Lifetime Achievement. It is included in the 2013 version of Kinsey and Me.
