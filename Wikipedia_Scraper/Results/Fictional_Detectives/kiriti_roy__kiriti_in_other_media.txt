Though the sleuthâ€™s celluloid debut happened late, the timeless appeal of Kiriti has already procreated three movies and one more in the pipeline. So far, the character of Kiriti has been essayed by Chiranjeet Chakraborty in Kiriti Roy (2016), Indraneil Sengupta in Kiriti O Kalo Bhromor (2016) and Priyanshu Chatterjee in Ebong Kiriti (2017). A fourth movie is in the making, Nilachale Kiriti.

There are future plans to create a TV series on Kiriti Roy.

The radio adaptations of Kiriti are mainly in the form of Sunday Suspense stories over the last few years. In and around the nineteen eighties, an attempt was made to create a radio series on Kiriti's tales.
