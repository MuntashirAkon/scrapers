The somewhat better-known first Kojak theme, in two distinct arrangements, is the work of Billy Goldenberg, who scored the early episodes. John Cacavas composed the third main title theme used throughout the show's fifth and final season. In addition, Cacavas composed the music score for most of the series.
Goldenberg's first Kojak theme had lyrics; though the identity of their writer was not widely known as March 2016 began, Sammy Davis Jr. performed them, as the song "We'll Make It This Time," on his album The Song And Dance Man.
