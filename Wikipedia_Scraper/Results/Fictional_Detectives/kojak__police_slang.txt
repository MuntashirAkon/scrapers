Kojak used a red, magnetically mounted Federal Signal Fireball rotating emergency light atop his unmarked police vehicle (a bronze 1973 Buick Century Regal 455, and later, a copper 1975 version of the same car). This type of emergency light has popularly come to be known as a "Kojak Light" among police. During the series, Kojak's duty weapon was either a Smith & Wesson Model 15 .38 Special revolver with a two-inch barrel or a .38 Special snub nosed Smith & Wesson Bodyguard. The latter type of revolver was the kind typically carried by New York City Police Department detectives of that era. Kojak usually carried it in the front right pocket of his overcoat or suit jacket, or he carried it in his hand as he approached a scene where he was expecting danger. This became known as carrying a weapon "Kojak Style" or as the "Kojak Carry" by police.
