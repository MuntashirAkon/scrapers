Joseph R. "Joe" Mannix is a regular guy, without pretense, who has a store of proverbs on which to rely in conversation. What demons he has mostly come from having fought in the U.S. Army during the Korean War, where he was initially listed as MIA[11] while he was a prisoner of war in a brutal POW camp until he escaped.[12] Over the length of the series, a sizable percentage of his old Army comrades turn out to have homicidal impulses against him,[12][13][14][15][16][17] as does his fellow running back from his college football days.[18] During the series, Mannix is also revealed to have worked as a mercenary in Latin America.[19] Like the actor who plays him, Mannix is of Armenian descent. He speaks fluent Armenian from time to time during the series,[11][20][21][22] as well as conversational Spanish.[9]
Mannix is notable for the high level of physical punishment he withstands. During the course of the series, he is shot and wounded over a dozen separate times, and knocked unconscious around 55 times.[23] He frequently takes brutal beatings to the abdomen; some of these went on quite a long time, particularly by the television standards of the era. Whenever he gets into one of his convertibles, he can expect to be shot at or run off the road by another car or find his vehicle sabotaged. Nevertheless, he keeps his cool and perseveres until his antagonists are brought down. While making the television pilot "The Name Is Mannix", Connors dislocated his shoulder running away from a From Russia with Love–type pursuit from a helicopter,[1] and broke his left wrist punching a stuntman who happened to be wearing a steel plate on his back. This character aspect was lampooned multiple times by radio comedians Bob and Ray, as "Blimmix", portrayed as dim-witted, and ending with Blimmix being soundly beaten by his adversary. These parodies retained the Lalo Schifrin–composed theme song at the beginning and conclusion.
Connors later expressed his concerns over what he saw as the show's dismissive attitude toward violence and its consequences, citing the example of Mannix being thrown down a flight of stairs and appearing without a scratch almost immediately after.
Starting in season two, Mannix lives at 17 Paseo Verde, West Los Angeles. Mannix grew up in a town called Summer Grove, where he was a star football and basketball player. Summer Grove had a thriving Armenian immigrant community. As of 1969, Mannix's mother had died 10 years earlier, and Mannix had not been back to the town since the funeral. Mannix's estranged father, Stefan, was still living in Summer Grove, and Mannix and his father would start a reconciliation.[11] When Mannix returns to Summer Grove for a case three years later, his father and he are on good terms.[21] Following military service in the Korean War, Mannix attended Western Pacific University on the GI Bill, graduated in 1955, and obtained his private investigator's license in 1956. He is a black belt in karate. Throughout the series, he appears proficient in a variety of athletic pursuits, including sailing, horseback riding, and skiing. He is an accomplished pool player, golfs regularly, and is also a skilled airplane pilot. In the first season, he carries a Walther PP semiautomatic pistol. From the second season on, Mannix carries a Colt Detective Special snubnosed revolver in .38 Special caliber.
In 1971, Connors guest-starred on an episode of Here's Lucy entitled "Lucy and Mannix Are Held Hostage".
In 1997, Connors reprised the role of Mannix on an episode of Diagnosis: Murder entitled "Hard-Boiled Murder", which serves as a sequel to the Mannix episode "Little Girl Lost".
"Mannix" was used as a reference several times by Mystery Science Theater 3000 when there was a foot chase or a fight.
