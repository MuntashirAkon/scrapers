Riptide, a once-popular detective series whose ratings had declined to the point of cancellation after airing against Moonlighting in the 1985â€“86 television season, aired an episode (the show's second-last) in 1986, in which that show's detectives acted as mentors to "Rosalind Grant" (Annette McCarthy) and "Cary Russell" (Richard Greene), the bickering stars of a television detective show pilot. Although their names were an allusion to Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, the characters were written as parodies of Shepherd and Willis, even adopting some of their real mannerisms and clothing styles, and their dialogue contained many nods, both obvious and subtle, to Moonlighting's writing style.
The episode was explicitly promoted by NBC (Riptide's network) as a Moonlighting parody, and was publicized as such widely enough that Riptide's producers felt obliged to clarify that they liked Moonlighting and intended the episode as an homage.[28]
The sixth-season premiere of Alvin and the Chipmunks was an entire spoof of Moonlighting entitled "Dreamlighting". In this episode, Alvin and Brittany parodied the main characters as "David Alvinson" and "Bratty Hayes".
