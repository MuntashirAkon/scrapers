He passes the supreme test of being rereadable. I don't know how many times I have reread the Wolfe stories, but plenty. I know exactly what is coming and how it is all going to end, but it doesn't matter. That's writing.

How would you feel if someone wanted to continue the Wolfe series after you laid aside your pen?
I don't know whether vampirism or cannibalism is the better term for it. Not nice. They should roll their own.
After the death of Rex Stout's widow in October 1984,[47] the Stout estate approved the continuation of the Nero Wolfe series. In 1986 journalist Robert Goldsborough published the first of seven Nero Wolfe mysteries issued by Bantam Books. Goldsborough's approach was faithful to the Rex Stout works, but he added his own touches, including an updated frame of reference (Archie now uses a personal computer to file Wolfe's germination records; Wolfe's ancient elevator is finally replaced by a more efficient model; etc.). Goldsborough's first effort, Murder in E Minor (1986), was a bestseller, and was hailed as an excellent mystery.[48][not in citation given] Goldsborough often drew on his own background in advertising, education and journalism for color and detail.
1986: Murder in E Minor — Wolfe comes out of self-imposed retirement to investigate the death of a boyhood friend, who became a famous symphony conductor.
1987: Death on Deadline — Wolfe intervenes when his favorite newspaper is about to be taken over by a muck-raking publisher.
1988: The Bloodied Ivy — Murder on the college campus, mingled with the attractions and pitfalls of having dedicated groupies as graduate students.
1989: The Last Coincidence — The fallout of the alleged date rape of Lily Rowan's niece.
1990: Fade to Black — Dirty work at an advertising agency.
1992: Silver Spire — Behind-the-scenes intrigue at a successful televangelism ministry based in Staten Island.
1994: The Missing Chapter — In retrospect, the author's explicit farewell to Nero Wolfe: the story concerns the murder of a mediocre continuator of a popular detective series.
Goldsborough resumed the series in 2012 with Archie Meets Nero Wolfe, a prequel to Stout's novels. The books are published by the Mysterious Press.[49]
2012: Archie Meets Nero Wolfe — A prequel imagining how Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin met and became a team.[50]
2014: Murder in the Ballpark — Nero and Archie investigate the murder of a state senator at a baseball game at the Polo Grounds.
2015: Archie in the Crosshairs[51]
2016: Stop the Presses!
2017: Murder, Stage Left[52]
Maurice Richardson's "The Last Detective Story in the World" (1946) is a Sherlock Holmes pastiche in which Nero Wolfe appears along with many other detectives and villains from crime fiction history. First printed in the May 1946 issue of the British magazine Liliput, the story was reprinted in Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine (February 1947).
Viola Brothers Shore wrote a parody titled "A Case of Facsimile" (1948) in which Nerissa Wolfe, Samantha Spade and Elsie Queen assist Shirley Holmes in solving a mystery. The story appeared in the October 1948 issue of Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine.
Thomas Narcejac included a pastiche of Rex Stout's Nero Wolfe titled The Red Orchid (L'orchidee rouge) in his collection Faux et usage de Faux (Librairie des Champs-Elysées 1952). The story was translated by Lawrence G. Blochman for the January 1961 issue of Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine.
Marion Mainwaring's 1954 novel Murder in Pastiche parodies nine famous fictional detectives, including Nero Wolfe (as "Trajan Beare").
Randall Garrett's Lord Darcy novel Too Many Magicians (1966) includes an appearance by the Marquis of London, a fat genius who looks and talks like Nero Wolfe, never leaves home, and is intensely interested in his hybridized plants. He has an assistant, Lord Bontriomphe (a literal French translation of "Goodwin"), who is first seen examining an exhibition of plants (like Archie in "Black Orchids"), and a cook corresponding to Fritz Brenner. The title pays homage to that of many Nero Wolfe stories, from Too Many Cooks (1938) to Too Many Clients (1960).
Lawrence Block's Make Out with Murder (1974) and The Topless Tulip Caper (1975) are tongue-in-cheek mystery novels in which wisecracking narrator Chip Harrison is assistant to Leo Haig, a fat detective who explicitly emulates Nero Wolfe (raising tropical fish instead of orchids in his Manhattan brownstone). Block revisited the characters in "As Dark as Christmas Gets" (1997), a short story commissioned by Otto Penzler and collected in Christmas at The Mysterious Bookshop (2010).
Julian Symons's Great Detectives: Seven Original Investigations (1981) includes his story "In Which Archie Goodwin Remembers." The author's interview with Archie Goodwin in retirement is illustrated by Tom Adams.
John Lescroart places numerous clues in his novels Son of Holmes (1986) and Rasputin's Revenge (1987) to suggest that the main character, Auguste Lupa (the son of Sherlock Holmes and Irene Adler), later becomes Nero Wolfe.[53]
Charles E. Burns, a charter member of The Wolfe Pack, relates how Wolfe and Archie met in "Firecrackers" (1990), a pastiche collected in Nero Wolfe: The Archie Goodwin Files (2005), edited by Marvin Kaye.[54]
William L. DeAndrea's Written in Fire (1995), a historical mystery set in the Old West, features frontier lawman Lewis "Lobo" Blacke. Confined to a wheelchair after he is shot in the back, Blacke takes over a newspaper and is assisted by reporter Quinn Booker, who becomes his biographer. DeAndrea completed a sequel, Fatal Elixir (1997), published posthumously.
Alan Vanneman, a published writer of two novel-length Sherlock Holmes pastiches, also wrote Three Bullets: A New Nero Wolfe Threesome in the early 2000s. The first of the three novelettes takes place in the original timeline (1930s), while the last two stories see Nero Wolfe, Archie Goodwin and the rest transferred to the 21st century, post-9/11 New York, to the "online era". The trilogy can be freely downloaded.[55]
Loren D. Estleman created the rotund amateur detective Claudius Lyon, who is so obsessed with Nero Wolfe's style of life that he duplicates it with just enough of a difference that his idol won't be entitled to take legal action. Ex-con Arnie Woodbine narrates the comic stories (printed in Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine), which include "Who's Afraid of Nero Wolfe?" (June 2008), "The Boy Who Cried Wolfe" (September–October 2008) and "Wolfe at the Door" (February 2009).[56]
Dave Duncan wrote the Venice Trilogy (2007–2009), starring the legendary clairvoyant, astrologer, and physician Maestro Nostradamus, who solves mysteries for the rulers of Venice, Italy while never leaving his apartments. Instead he sends the young swordsman Alfeo Zeno on various investigative tasks around the city, seeking clues, arranging interviews, and generally stirring up trouble until something happens. Nostradamus holds a similar disdain for women, and Alfeo's primary romantic partner is a highly-ranked courtesan, similar in station to Lily Rowan (an independent socialite).[57]
David Langford wrote the short story "If Looks Could Kill" for the Midnight Rose anthology EuroTemps (1992), featuring the Wolfe pastiche Caligula Foxe, a London-based detective in a world where some people have paranormal abilities, although Foxe is offended by any suggestion his own deductive skills might qualify as such. Like Wolfe, Foxe seldom leaves his home (an "old house in Westbourne Terrace") and is prone to "relapses". He cultivates paranormal saprophytes. The story is narrated by his legman Charlie Goodman, and other characters include their chef Franz, fellow detectives Paul Sanza, Terry Carver and Sally Cole, and Government official Mr Cream (a near-anagram of Cramer). In the collection of Langford pastiches He Do the Time Police in Different Voices, "If Looks Could Kill" is credited to "R*x St**t".
