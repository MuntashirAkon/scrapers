One of his main characters was Jake Lassiter, an ex-Penn State linebacker and lawyer, who has appeared in 10 novels. Lassiter has been described by Booklist as “one of the most entertaining series characters in contemporary crime fiction” and by The Miami Herald as having “a lot more charisma than Perry Mason ever did.”[4]
Arguing Miami lawyers Steve Solomon and Victoria Lord appeared in four books. The interaction between the law partners has been described by Bookreporter.com as “reminiscent of the very best of David and Maddie in Moonlighting.”[5] The Chicago Sun-Times' review of Solomon vs. Lord declared: "Remarkably fresh and original with characters you can't help loving and sparkling dialog that echoes the Hepburn-Tracy screwball comedies."[6]
