Carvalho was a communist in his youth, but also a CIA agent.
The gastronomic passion of Carvalho and Biscuter reflects that of the author, so every novel includes passionate culinary descriptions of the most diverse dishes.
Though Carvalho is a man of vast culture, a shocking feature of his personality is his frequent use of books from his extensive library as firewood.
Though he is of Galician origin, Barcelona is his city. Although Carvalho is a great traveller and many of his adventures take place in other locations, the importance of the character has given the Catalan capital that mythical literary city air that Carvalho so much loves in other cities, such as the Singapore of William Somerset Maugham.
