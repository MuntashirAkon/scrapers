Various novels starring Carvalho have been adapted for television, although none of the TV adaptations were as successful as the books. An eight-part TVE series starring Eusebio Poncela (with Ovidi Montlor as Biscuter) appeared in 1986, followed by an Argentinian-Spanish co-production with Juan Diego that was cancelled after the first episode; and finally, a ten-part Italian-Spanish co-production starring Juanjo Puigcorbé and Jean Benguigui in 1999.
Carvalho novels have been adapted to film on four occasions:
Tatuaje (Tattoo, 1976), by Bigas Luna, starring Carlos Esteban.
Asesinato en el Comité Central (Murder in the Central Committee, 1983), by Vicente Aranda, starring Patxi Andión in the role of the detective.
El laberinto griego (The Greek labyrinth, 1990), by Rafael Alcázar, starring Omero Antonutti (in a character who changed the name Carvalho for Bardón).
Los mares del sur (The Southern Seas, 1991), by Manuel Esteban, with Juan Luis Galiardo in the role of Carvalho and Carlos Lucena as Biscuter.
