Writing as Spencer Quinn,[2] Abrahams is the author of the Chet and Bernie Mysteries. These stories are told from the point of view of Chet, Bernie Little's canine partner in the Little Detective Agency.
It was not initially known that Abrahams was Quinn. It took some work by journalists to determine who "Quinn" really is.[3]
Chet has his own website,[4] and is on Facebook.
