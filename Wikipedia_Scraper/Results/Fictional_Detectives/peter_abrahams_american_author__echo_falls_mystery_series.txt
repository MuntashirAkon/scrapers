Abrahams has started a series for younger readers called the Echo Falls Mysteries. There are currently three books in the series: Down the Rabbit Hole, Behind the Curtain, and Into the Dark. They are all based around teen super sleuth Ingrid Levin-Hill who, inspired by her role model of Sherlock Holmes, solves mysteries throughout the series.
