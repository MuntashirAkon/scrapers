20th Century Fox has released all five seasons of Remington Steele on DVD in Region 1 in four box sets.[49] The Season 1 DVD inadvertently echoed an ongoing joke in the series in that Stephanie Zimbalist, who had top star billing when the show was on air, was initially omitted from all promotional material connected with its release, as well as the DVD box itself, as Fox Video chose to promote Pierce Brosnan as the sole star. Subsequently, a sticker saying "Also starring Stephanie Zimbalist" was added to the packaging as an afterthought. This omission was corrected with the release of the second season which gave Zimbalist star billing with her photograph appearing on the box. Additionally, Zimbalist is featured on the behind-the-scenes featurettes contained therein. The first season boxed set also has a picture of Doris Roberts on the back cover, even though she didn't join the show until the second season.
Season 1 has also been released in Region 2 & 4.
