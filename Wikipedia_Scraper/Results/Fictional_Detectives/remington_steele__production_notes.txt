Every episode title has the word "Steele" in it.
At the end of every episode, the MTM kitten "Mimsie" has an animated deerstalker's cap on its head and a meerschaum pipe in its mouth, a la Sherlock Holmes. The pipe falls from the kitten's mouth and bounces twice on the bottom of the screen as it meows.
