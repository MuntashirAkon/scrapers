Remington Steele is best known for having launched the career of Pierce Brosnan[1] and for serving as a forerunner of the similar, edgier series Moonlighting,[2] and was also an influential part of television history in its own right. Recent evaluations, in the wake of the show's full release on DVD, conclude that Steele was solidly crafted, well-acted and groundbreaking in its own way.[3] Other recent evaluations have also noted that series has aged better than some other series of its time and genre.[4]
Remington Steele referenced film noir in the mystery storylines.[5] It subverted 1970s detective show conventions by telling its stories from the point of view of an independent, professional woman.[6] At a time when hour-long series were serious and half-hour series were humorous, Steele incorporated multiple styles of comedy into the standard detective format.[7] It pioneered the slowly evolving "will they or won't they" relationship arc that is now common to television drama of all genres.[8][9]
In an interview recorded in 2005 for a DVD special feature, Remington Steele co-creator Michael Gleason and star Stephanie Zimbalist discuss the large number of women who have approached them over the years to express their appreciation for the character of Laura Holt. Speaking of the women she meets, Zimbalist said "They are extraordinary women.... They are interesting. They do interesting things. They are smart. They're independent. They're sort of, what my character was – and I meet them all the time."[10] Also in 2005, Robin Rauzi published an article in the Los Angeles Times saying that Laura Holt was her hero.[11] In a subsequent interview Rauzi elaborated, saying that Laura "was one of the only examples of an unmarried modern career woman on TV that I could identify with at that time" and that Laura "didn’t seem that far away from who I was and who I could be." Rauzi concludes, "I’ve decided to stop being embarrassed to say Remington Steele changed my life. It did and for the better."[12]
