Jury is melancholic and moody. He was orphaned as a young child in the Second World War (his father, an RAF pilot, was lost in combat, his mother died in the German bombing of London), he lived briefly with his uncle's family but the uncle also died and Jury spent most of his childhood in an unpleasant group home. Although he is handsome, kind and attractive to women, he is unlucky in love (spectacularly soâ€”one of novels involves the death of a woman with whom he has a sudden, passionate affair). His good looks and the ease with which he wins the hearts of women and children arouse envy in his wealthy and cultured friend, Plant, but neither of them is successful in romantic relationships.
