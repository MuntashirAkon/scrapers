Stella is a half-Greek, half-Italian orphan (though she identifies more with her Greek side) who grew up at St. Basil's Orphanage. She left when she was eighteen (episode 115, "Til Death Do We Part"). In the season 5 episode "Grounds for Deception", it is revealed that Stella's mother was a restoration painter from Naousa who brought two-year-old Stella with her when she came to New York with an exhibit. Soon after the exhibit, her mother was killed in a traffic accident. Stella is fluent in Greek and has spoken some Italian on the Can You Hear Me Now episode (Season 4, episode 1). She has briefly read a Cyrillic Russian message in the Blink episode (Season 1, episode 1) and also briefly spoke in Russian with a spray-on pantyhose suspect in the Run Silent, Run Deep episode (Season 2, episode 20). She was in foster care in her early life. It is revealed that a professor, whom Stella was close to, got her out of foster care. Stella is also religious and can be seen crossing herself with holy water in a church (episode 8, "Three Generations Are Enough).
