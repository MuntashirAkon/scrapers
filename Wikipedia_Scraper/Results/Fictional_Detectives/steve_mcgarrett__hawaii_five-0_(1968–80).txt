In the original show, Steve McGarrett was portrayed by Jack Lord from 1968 to 1980.[2] McGarrett was a former United States Navy officer and Detective Captain in the Honolulu Police Department who had been requested by Governor Paul Jameson to head the Five-0 Task Force, a fictional equivalent of the state police. He was portrayed as a highly driven cop and workaholic, often staying at his office until midnight. It was said that he "only takes orders from the Governor and God â€“ and occasionally even they have trouble".[3]
McGarrett had a sister Mary Ann (Nancy Malone).[4] Their father was murdered by criminals when they were young. It was revealed that this personal tragedy was what motivated McGarrett to become a police officer.[5]
McGarrett was an alcoholic but stops drinking by season 11 for unexplained reasons.[6] Throughout the series he drives a black Mercury; a 1967 2 door Mercury Marquis hardtop with a red interior in the pilot only,[7] followed by a 1968 4 door Mercury Park Lane Brougham hardtop,[8] then ultimately a 1974 4 door Mercury Marquis Brougham hardtop in subsequent episodes.[9]
