In Japan, there is a total of 71 volumes with 44 full cases, 17 Kindaichi's short cases, 7 Akechi's short cases, and 1 Takato's full case. Together, the volumes have sold over 90 million copies in Japan, making it one of the best selling manga of the 1990s.[19] There are currently 11 volumes[20] in the new re-run after serialisation of Detective School Q completes.
17 volumes have been published in North America, all except 2 with a complete story. The later volumes are unlikely to see print in the United States unless their relatively poor sales improve.[21] New readers are recommended to read the volumes in order, since later stories sometimes reference killers or characters from previous tales, especially Kindaichi's nemesis, who will reappear in at least one of the mysteries not yet published. In general, all the mysteries followed a certain theme (such as a famous legend/story), or have a certain modus operandi. Various bilingual (Japanese-English) volumes have been released.[22][23][24][25]
