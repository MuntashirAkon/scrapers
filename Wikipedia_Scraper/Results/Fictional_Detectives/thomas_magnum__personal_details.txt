Personal details: In "Memories are Forever" (Ep.2.05), Magnum’s drivers license was shown briefly on screen giving the viewer the following . Hair BRN, Weight 205, Height 6'4", Eyes BL, DOB 1/05/46, and his old address (pre Robin’s Nest) of 11435 18th Ave., Honolulu, HI 96816.
Age/Birthday: The first episode to reference Magnum’s birthday was "Memories are Forever" (Ep.2.05, aired November 5, 1981) which listed it as on his driver's license.

"Try to Remember" (Ep.2.15, aired February 4, 1982) Magnum— waking up in the hospital with a serious head wound—gives his birthday as August 8, 1944.
"Letter to a Duchess" (Ep.4.06, aired November 10, 1983) Magnum gives his age as 38, putting his birth date between November 1944 and November 1945, assuming the air date of the episode corresponds exactly to the date in the fiction.
In "On Face Value" (Ep.4.19, aired March 15, 1984) Magnum makes a point of being ten—not yet eleven—on August 4, 1956 when he attended his first Tigers game during their pennant race. This would put his birthday between August 5, 1945 and August 3, 1946. (August 8, 1945 fits in the "Duchess" range, matches the year Selleck was born, and would fit with a wounded Magnum having simply misspoken the year in "Remember". On-the-other-hand, January 5, 1946—also in this episodes range—would match his driver's license.)
"Murder 101" (Ep.5.8, aired November 15, 1984) Magnum's PI license is shown, which lists his date of birth as January 5, 1946.
"Forty" (Ep.7.17, aired February 2, 1987) is about Magnum’s 40th birthday, putting his birth in February 1947, assuming the air date of the episode corresponds exactly to the date in the fiction, which does not fit with any of the above dates.

Narrating Catchphrase: "I know what you're thinking...," "And you're wrong/right..." is one of Selleck's starring character's favorite narrating voiceover catchphrase throughout 8 seasons.
