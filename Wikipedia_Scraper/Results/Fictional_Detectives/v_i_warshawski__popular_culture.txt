Warshawski was highlighted in volume 12 of the Detective Conan manga's edition of "Gosho Aoyama's Mystery Library", a section of the graphic novels where the author introduces a different detective (or occasionally, a villain) from mystery literature, television, or other media. The characters in the pictures will occasionally show something that is associated with the character, such as the deerstalker of Sherlock Holmes or the outfit of Arsene Lupin. Warshawski is depicted in a thoughtful pose and with a darkened eye.
In the Flash animated Internet cartoon, Homestar Runner, V. I. Warshawski is mentioned on Version 10.2 and Version 16.2 of Marzipan's Answering Machine.
