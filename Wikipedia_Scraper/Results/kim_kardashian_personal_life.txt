In 2000, 19-year-old Kardashian eloped with music producer Damon Thomas.[114] Thomas filed for divorce in 2003. Kardashian later credited their separation to physical and emotional abuse on his part.[115] Prior to the completion of her divorce, Kardashian began dating singer Ray J.[114]
In May 2011, Kardashian became engaged to NBA player Kris Humphries, then of the New Jersey Nets, whom she had been dating since October 2010.[116] They were married in a wedding ceremony on August 20 in Montecito, California.[117] Earlier that month, she had released her "wedding fragrance" called "Kim Kardashian Love" which coincided with her own wedding.[39][118] A two-part TV special showing the preparations and the wedding itself aired on E! in early October 2011, amidst what The Washington Post called a "media blitz" related to the wedding.[119] After 72 days of marriage, she filed for divorce from Humphries on October 31, citing irreconcilable differences.[120] Several news outlets surmised that Kardashian's marriage to Humphries was merely a publicity stunt, to promote the Kardashian family's brand and their subsequent television ventures.[121] A man professing to be her former publicist, Jonathan Jaxson, also claimed that her short-lived marriage was indeed staged and a ploy to generate money. Kardashian filed suit against Jaxson, saying his claims were untrue, and subsequently settled the case which included an apology from Jaxson.[122] A widely circulated petition asking to remove all Kardashian-related programming from the air followed the split.[123] The divorce was subject to widespread media attention.[124]
Kardashian began dating American rapper and longtime friend Kanye West in April 2012, while still legally married to Humphries.[125] Her divorce was finalized on June 3, 2013,[126] while Kardashian gave birth to her first child with West, daughter North West, on June 15, 2013.[127] Kardashian and West became engaged on October 21, Kardashian's 33rd birthday,[128] and married on May 24, 2014 at Fort di Belvedere in Florence, Italy.[129] Her wedding dress was designed by Riccardo Tisci of Givenchy[130] with some guests' dresses designed by designer Michael Costello.[131] Kardashian gave birth to her second child, son Saint West, on December 5, 2015.[132] The couple's high status and respective careers have resulted in their relationship becoming subject to heavy media coverage; The New York Times referred to their marriage as "a historic blizzard of celebrity."[5]
As of May 2014, Kardashian was estimated to be worth US$45 million.[133] In 2015, Forbes reported she had "made more this year than ever as her earnings nearly doubled to $53 million from 2014's $28 million," and reported that she "has monetized fame better than any other."[134] Much of her income include wholesale earnings of the Sears line, the Kardashian Kollection, which raked in $600 million in 2013 and the Kardashian Beauty cosmetics line, Kardashian-branded tanning products, the boutique-line DASH, as well as sponsored Instagram and Twitter posts which are collectively worth $10,000-25,000 per post.[135]
Kardashian has expressed pride in her Armenian and Scottish ancestry,[136][137] although she is not a citizen of either country and cannot speak Armenian.[138] She has advocated for the recognition of the Armenian Genocide on numerous occasions, and encouraged President Barack Obama and the United States government to consider its acknowledgement.[139][140][141]
In April 2015, she traveled to Armenia with her husband, her sister Khloé, and her daughter North and visited the memorial of the victims in Yerevan.[142] In April 2016, Kardashian wrote an article on her website condemning The Wall Street Journal for running an advertisement denying the Armenian Genocide.[143] During an interview with GQ for the July 2016 issue, Kardashian described herself as a Liberal Republican, fiscally conservative but socially progressive.[144]
