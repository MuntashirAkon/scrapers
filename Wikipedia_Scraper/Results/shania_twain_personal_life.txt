Twain met producer Robert John "Mutt" Lange after he heard her original songs and singing from her debut album; he then offered to produce and write songs with her. They first met at Nashville's Fan Fair in June 1993 and quickly became close. They were married on December 28, 1993 and Twain gave birth to their son Eja (pronounced Asia) in August 2001.[88]
On May 15, 2008, a spokesperson for Mercury Nashville announced that Twain and Lange were separating after Lange allegedly had an affair with Twain's best friend, Marie-Anne Thiébaud.[89][90] Their divorce was finalized on June 9, 2010.[91] On December 20, 2010, Twain's manager said that Twain was engaged to Frédéric Thiébaud (the Swiss former husband of her former best friend Marie-Anne Thiébaud), an executive at Nestlé.[92][93] They married on January 1, 2011 in Rincón, Puerto Rico.[94]
In 2009, Twain was reported as having the Perfect Face. The BBC reported on a study, led by the University of Toronto and the University of California, San Diego, which appeared in the journal Vision Research.[95]
In September 2010, it was confirmed that Twain was to release her autobiography, From This Moment On, on May 3, 2011,[96] and the cover work for the book was released on March 2, 2011.[97] Twain is a vegetarian[98][99] and is also a devotee of Sant Mat, an Eastern spiritual philosophy which calls for daily meditation as well as abstinence from alcohol, drugs and premarital sex.[100]
