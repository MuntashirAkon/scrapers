One of Swift's earliest musical memories is listening to her maternal grandmother, Marjorie Finlay, sing at church.[2] As a child, she enjoyed Disney film soundtracks: "My parents noticed that, once I had run out of words, I would just make up my own".[181] Swift has said she owes her confidence to her mother, who helped her prepare for class presentations as a child.[182] She also attributes her "fascination with writing and storytelling" to her mother.[183] Swift was drawn to the storytelling of country music,[184] and was introduced to the genre by "the great female country artists of the '90s"—Shania Twain, Faith Hill and the Dixie Chicks.[185][186] Twain, both as a songwriter and performer, was her biggest musical influence.[187] Hill was Swift's childhood role model: "Everything she said, did, wore, I tried to copy it".[188] She admired the Dixie Chicks' defiant attitude and their ability to play their own instruments.[189] The band's "Cowboy Take Me Away" was the first song Swift learned to play on the guitar.[190] Swift also explored the music of older country stars, including Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Dolly Parton and Tammy Wynette.[13] She believes Parton is "an amazing example to every female songwriter out there".[191] Alt-country artists such as Ryan Adams,[192] Patty Griffin[193] and Lori McKenna have inspired Swift.[23]
Swift lists Paul McCartney, The Rolling Stones,[127] Bruce Springsteen, Emmylou Harris, Kris Kristofferson, and Carly Simon as her career role models: "They've taken chances, but they've also been the same artist for their entire careers".[23][194] McCartney, both as a Beatle and a solo artist, makes Swift feel "as if I've been let into his heart and his mind ... Any musician could only dream of a legacy like that".[195] She admires Springsteen for being "so musically relevant after such a long period of time".[196] She aspires to be like Harris as she grows older: "It's not about fame for her, it's about music".[197] "[Kristofferson] shines in songwriting ... He's just one of those people who has been in this business for years but you can tell it hasn't chewed him up and spat him out", Swift says.[198] She admires Simon's "songwriting and honesty ... She's known as an emotional person but a strong person".[199]
Swift has also been influenced by many artists outside the country genre. As a pre-teen, she enjoyed bubblegum pop acts including Hanson and Britney Spears; Swift has said she has "unwavering devotion" for Spears.[200][201] In her high school years, Swift listened to rock bands such as Dashboard Confessional,[202] Fall Out Boy,[203] and Jimmy Eat World.[204] She has also spoken fondly of singers and songwriters like Michelle Branch,[204] Alanis Morissette,[205] Ashlee Simpson,[206] Fefe Dobson[204] and Justin Timberlake;[207] and the 1960s acts The Shirelles, Doris Troy, and The Beach Boys.[208] Swift's fifth album, the pop-focused 1989 was influenced by some of her favorite 1980s pop acts, including Annie Lennox, Phil Collins and "Like a Prayer-era Madonna".[209]
Swift's music contains elements of pop, pop rock and country.[210] She self-identified as a country artist until the 2014 release of 1989, which she described as a "sonically cohesive pop album".[211] Rolling Stone asserted, "[Swift] might get played on the country station, but she's one of the few genuine rock stars we've got these days".[212] The New York Times noted, "There isn't much in Ms. Swift's music to indicate country—a few banjo strums, a pair of cowboy boots worn onstage, a bedazzled guitar—but there's something in her winsome, vulnerable delivery that's unique to Nashville".[213] According to The Guardian, Swift "cranks melodies out with the pitiless efficiency of a Scandinavian pop factory".[214]
Swift's vocals have been described by Sophie Schillaci from The Hollywood Reporter as "sweet, but soft".[215] In studio recordings, the Los Angeles Times identified Swift's "defining" vocal gesture as "the line that slides down like a contented sigh or up like a raised eyebrow, giving her beloved girl-time hits their air of easy intimacy".[216] Rolling Stone, in a Speak Now review, remarked: "Swift's voice is unaffected enough to mask how masterful she has become as a singer; she lowers her voice for the payoff lines in the classic mode of a shy girl trying to talk tough."[217] In another review of Speak Now, The Village Voice noted that her phrasing was previously "bland and muddled, but that's changed. She can still sound strained and thin, and often strays into a pitch that drives some people crazy; but she's learned how to make words sound like what they mean."[218] The Hollywood Reporter opines that her live vocals are "fine", but they do not match those of her peers.[215] In 2009, they were also described as "flat, thin, and sometimes as wobbly as a newborn colt".[219] However, Swift has received praise for refusing to correct her pitch with Auto-Tune.[220]
In an interview with The New Yorker, Swift characterized herself primarily as a songwriter: "I write songs, and my voice is just a way to get those lyrics across."[23] A writer for The Tennessean conceded in 2010 that Swift is "not the best technical singer", but described her as the "best communicator that we've got".[221] Swift's vocal presence is something that concerns her and she has "put a lot of work" into improving it.[222] It was reported in 2010 that she continues to take vocal lessons.[223] She has said that she only feels nervous performing "if I'm not sure what the audience thinks of me, like at award shows".[224]
Swift uses her life experiences as an inspiration in her work.[225] In her songs, Swift often addresses the "anonymous crushes of her high school years" and celebrities.[226] Swift frequently criticizes ex-boyfriends,[227] an aspect of her songwriting downplayed by The Village Voice: "Being told What Songs Mean is like having a really pushy professor. And it imperils a true appreciation of Swift's talent, which is not confessional, but dramatic."[228] However, New York believes the media scrutiny over her decision to "mine her personal life for music … is sexist, inasmuch as it's not asked of her male peers".[229] The singer herself has said that not all her songs are factual and that they are sometimes based on observations.[230] Aside from her liner note clues, Swift tries not to talk about song subjects specifically "because these are real people. You try to give insight as to where you were coming from as a writer without completely throwing somebody under the bus".[231]
For a female to write about her feelings, and then be portrayed as some clingy, insane, desperate girlfriend in need of making you marry her and have kids with her, I think that's taking something that potentially should be celebrated—a woman writing about her feelings in a confessional way—that's taking it and turning it and twisting it into something that is frankly a little sexist.
The Guardian has praised Swift for writing about teenage years "with a kind of wistful, sepia-toned nostalgia" over the course of her first two albums.[214] New York has remarked that many singer-songwriters have made great records as teens, but "none made great records so explicitly about their teens". The magazine has also compared her work to Brian Wilson.[233] In Fearless, Swift featured fairy tale imagery and explored the disconnect "between fairy tales and the reality of love".[234] Her later albums address more adult relationships.[194] In addition to romance and love, Swift's songs have discussed parent-child relationships, friendships,[235][236] alienation, fame, and career ambitions.[183] Swift frequently includes "a tossed-off phrase to suggest large and serious things that won't fit in the song, things that enhance or subvert the surface narrative".[237]
Rolling Stone describes Swift as "a songwriting savant with an intuitive gift for verse-chorus-bridge architecture".[238] According to The Village Voice, she uses third-verse point of view reversals frequently.[237] In terms of imagery, repetition is evident in Swift's songwriting. In The Guardian's words, "she spends so much time kissin' in the rain that it seems a miracle she hasn't developed trenchfoot".[214] Slant Magazine adds, "to Swift's credit, she explores new lyrical motifs over the course of [her fourth] album".[239] Although reviews of Swift's work are "almost uniformly positive", The New Yorker has said she is generally portrayed "more as a skilled technician than as a Dylanesque visionary".[23]
