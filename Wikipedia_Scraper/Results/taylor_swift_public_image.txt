Swift's personal life is the subject of constant media attention.[240] In 2013, Abercrombie & Fitch marketed a slogan T-shirt with a "slut-shaming" remark directed toward her.[241] The New York Times asserted that her "dating history has begun to stir what feels like the beginning of a backlash" and questioned whether Swift was in the midst of a "quarter-life crisis".[242] Swift has said that she is unwilling to discuss her personal life in public,[240] as she believes that talking about it can be "a career weakness".[243]
Rolling Stone remarks upon her polite manner: "If this is Swift's game face, it must be tattooed on because it never drops."[244] The magazine also takes note of her "ease with glad-handing",[34] and The Hollywood Reporter credits her as "the Best People Person since Bill Clinton".[245] While presenting Swift an award for her humanitarian endeavors in 2012, Michelle Obama described her as a singer who "has rocketed to the top of the music industry but still keeps her feet on the ground, someone who has shattered every expectation of what a 22-year-old can accomplish".[246] Swift considers Obama to be a role model.[247] Swift is one of the most followed people on social media, and is known for her friendly interactions with her fans.[248][249] She has delivered holiday gifts to fans by mail and in person, dubbed "Swiftmas".[250] She considers it her "responsibility" to be conscious of her influence on young fans,[251] and has said that her fans are "the longest and best relationship I have ever had".[252]
Often described by the media as "America's Sweetheart",[253] Swift insists that "I don't live by all these rigid, weird rules that make me feel all fenced in. I just like the way that I feel like, and that makes me feel very free". She refuses to take part in overly sexualized photo-shoots,[254] although Bloomberg L.P. views her as a sex symbol.[255] Swift was named an Icon of American Style by Vogue in 2011.[256] In 2014 she topped People's annual best dressed list.[257] In 2015, she was named Woman of the Year at the Elle Style Awards,[258] and ranked first in Maxim's Hot 100 list.[259]
Swift has also appeared in various power listings. Due to her success and earnings, she was included in Time's annual list of the 100 most influential people in 2010 and 2015.[260] From 2011–15, she appeared in the top three of Forbes' Top-Earning Women In Music with earnings of $45 million, $57 million, $55 million, $64 million and $80 million respectively.[261] In 2015, she became the youngest woman ever to be included on Forbes' 100 most powerful women list, ranked at number 64.[262] In 2016, Swift topped Forbes' annual list of the 100 highest-paid celebrities with $170 million—she also ranked among the top ten in 2011, 2013 and 2015.[263] She was one of the finalists for Time Person of the Year in 2014.[264] In June 2017, Forbes estimated Swift's net worth to be $280 million.[265]
