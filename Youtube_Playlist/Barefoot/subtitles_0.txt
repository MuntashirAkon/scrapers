[Music] [Music] Halloween isn't just for kids why should they have all the fun I've invited some friends for trick-or-treat dinner and Miguel is setting the table cut this black and orange thing going what is Halloween first I'm making a black cocktail espresso martinis with a twist of orange zest followed by a delicious loin of pork with fennel rosemary and garlic served with oven-roasted applesauce and string beans with garlic to ward off the vampires and for dessert a devilishly rich chocolate cake with glow-in-the-dark orange buttercream [Music] I so for halloween i thought i'd make a fabulous halloween cake i wanted to do something with black and orange how many desserts are black and orange so i thought i'd make a chocolate cake with orange buttercream very halloween so I'm going to start with half pound of butter cup of sugar and a cup of brown sugar or didn't just give it a little extra flavor fracture or sugar with molasses at it I just want lightly packed right in I'm just going to cream these medium high speed into their light and fluffy about five minutes so while those are creaming we're going to get the dry ingredients together the first thing you need is to only half cups of all-purpose flour this is really handy it's a 2-cup measure [Music] one half cups of really good cocoa powder [Music] the arrows 240 teaspoons of baking soda and a half teaspoon salt the cubic trumpet case to make sure it's really moist and light so I'm just going to sift these together didn't want a Halloween Horror instead of a Halloween tree ok that's the dry ingredients next thing in these three eggs because I'm always wary about eggs everyone still why you get a bad one I do them into it separate ball okay that's one just let it mix in completely this is the importance of creaming the butter really well because then all the other ingredients go in really easily the three eggs three teaspoons of good vanilla vanilla and chocolate a really important flavor combination the next thing you're the wet ingredients buttermilk need wanting to have cups three-quarters of a cup of sour cream the butter milk and sour cream are going to make it a really moist cake and the last thing is coffee three tablespoons of brewed coffee it just really brings out the chocolate flavor whisk these together the best way to keep it bad or really light is to mix the dry ingredients in the wet ingredients ultimately into the batter starting and ending with the dry ingredients and we're just going to turn on low and then just add about a quarter of the dry ingredients to the batter and then a third of the wet ingredients it's important that they mix really well but not over mix and then another quarter it's a great cake the orange buttercream on top is just wild maybe I'll decorate with some Halloween candy ok that's the wet ingredients and now the last of the dry ingredients perfect so I'm going to put this and a half sheet pan let's actually can buy this in specialty cookware stores what i did was i greased it and floured it and then it tapped out the excess so it's just a light dusting of flour on it for the whole batter in here Sol will smooth the top I'm gonna bake this cake 350 degrees for about 25 to 30 minutes until a toothpick just comes out clean okay into the oven and then I'm gonna go see what kind of spell Miguel is casting on my dining room oh my god this looks scary how fast is very gothic I like that good oh I love these gorgeous what are you doing so we're gonna have orange flows on the table love orange flowers we're going to have some witches hats on the plates oh these are great and can we wear them those of you we're going to have orange bags with a votive inside you give a nice orange glow water today I'll slimy like a haunted house exactly all along the table I'm gonna go contra black cock tip for Halloween you better go do that I was trying to think of some kind of cocktail that would get everybody in the Halloween sphere would be something black and I came up with an espresso martini with an orange twist I think it'll do the trick espresso martinis doesn't it sound like a great idea so the first thing in use two cups of espresso I need these presso earlier so it's cool i like to make it with decaf I don't want to have jittery guests I'm making a lot of these enough for eight people right into a picture to Kosovo orange vodka you can really make these in individual drinks it's two ounces of espresso two ounces of orange vodka and one ounce of coffee liqueur or person but I'm making a big picture of them and then later what I'm going to do is I'm going to shake them with ice really good and one cup of coffee flavored liqueur kemps that look like Halloween at what I'm just going to stir this up and then later I'm going to serve it over ice and a shaker with a nice twist of orange it's going really good and now i'm going to make loin of pork with oven-roasted apple sauce to go with it [Music] when autumn comes in East Hampton I'm always the first to go to the apple orchard and get all different kinds of wonderful flavor and apples and I always have to make applesauce it's homemade applesauce that I make in the oven it's just delicious I have six pounds of apples three pounds of Macintosh and three pounds of Granny Smith and I actually combine them just has much more flavor the Granny Smith are really tart but McIntosh are sweet you can use whatever you like McCain Winesap the more different kinds of apples you use the more depth of flavor the applesauce will have granny smith you can usually find all year round okay so it peeled and cored them just put them right in the bowl ok that's the apples next I'm going to do orange juice and orange zest so the juice and zest of two oranges this recipe really exemplifies how I feel that cooking it's all about making the apples taste more apple like and in this case sort of apple pie like so that's the zest we'll put it right in and then the juice of two oranges this will actually not only flavor it but it also keep the apples from turning brown well thats citrus ok that's the oranges and a dilemma it's just one moment give it a little tartness the best thing about this recipe is instead of doing on the top of the steps you're always adjusting it and worrying about it Bernie it cooks in the oven so you put it in the oven and just forget about it for an hour so the zest of one lemon and the juice of one lemon will put it through a sieve so I don't get the seeds and the applesauce nobody wanted aight intimacy this is all together okay now into the pot so i'm using a Dutch oven that has a lid all the juice all the apples all the zest cut the cup of brown sugar I use light brown sugar whatever you have around is just fine lightly cat a little bit of butter just to give a little richest four tablespoons right in don't even have to mix it two teaspoons of cinnamon half a teaspoon of allspice and here's the surprise if you take some of these red apple peels and bake them along with the apples it all comes out a sort of a rosy color it's just gorgeous and right into the oven have a crowd coming for Halloween I'm going to make a roast loin of pork with fennel and garlic and rosemary what I've done is I've asked the butcher to give me a French loin of pork so the bones had been scraped and just a little layer of fat on the top to keep it really moist and I'm gonna make a delicious rub to go with it the first thing it needs six cloves of garlic right listen process it a third of a cup of chopped rosemary leaves just a little rough chop for it brings the food processor 2 tablespoons of lemon zest and 2 teaspoons of fennel seeds just going to grind it up from a nap smiles or muster a few other things great I'm going to add two tablespoons of olive oil only this is a rub so it just has to go on outside capital good Dijon mustard tablespoon of salt and about a teaspoon of black pepper now that's pretty easy so now for the loin of pork so this is about a five pound loin of pork it's got 10 bones when I serve it and we'll slice it into individual portions so we just take the rub and just put it right on top I've let them meet sit out for about 30 minutes and that way it's not so cold when it goes in the oven and it cooks more evenly it's going to be so delicious with girl extreme beans and warm apple sauce okay into the oven 400 degrees for about an hour and a quarter until the internal temperature is 140 degrees and next I'm gonna make some really scary orange buttercream to go on my chocolate cake [Music] what's a halloween party without a great halloween dessert so I've made the chocolate sheet cake and I'm going to do bright orange buttercream to put on top if two-thirds of a cup of water and two cups of sugar I'm just going to melt the sugar in the water it'll lay it on and then I'm going to get it up to 240 degrees in the meantime I'm gonna whip some egg whites I need six egg whites they have to be room temperature so you get really good volume this actually classic buttercream to make four wedding cakes and I've made a lot I just need the white so you can save the yolks for something else I think ice cream there's some really quick butter creams that you can just make sugar and butter and flavorings and it's really much easier but I have to say it's nothing like this okay that's six egg whites I'm since the sugar in water and see how it's doing perfect is boiling away and now what I'm going to do is take my candy thermometer just put it in I want to bring it up to 240 degrees and still just fine by itself okay six egg whites into the mixer with a whisk attachment quarter of a teaspoon of cream of tartar a little bit with going to whip it on high until they form soft peaks come on perfect we're there 240 degrees we pour it into a pitcher because easier to pour into the buttercream this is so five and I'm just very very slowly pour it into the egg whites just a very thin stream of sugar syrup would you really slowly so you don't deflate the egg whites fantastic oh the sugar syrup in now little lady cook for about 10 to 15 minutes miguel adoption is amazing thank you so much no at love it's both halloween spooky but it's also very elegant are you in charge of candles yes and I've got a cake that's going to go perfectly with [Music] Wow leave it to Miguel to do an incredible room not just a table setting but the whole room so I think this is cool enough it has to be room temperature the sugar and the syrup this is what it looks like it's basically meringue just wonderful and it's the base for the buttercream that I'm going to do on my halloween cake so just going to turn it on medium speed now we have butter lots of butter five sticks of butter it's a pound and a quarter just a little bit at a time so it gets really next in and the butter has to be absolutely room temperature not just sort of soft it has to be completely room temperature I leave it out like overnight make sure it's completely soft okay that's all the button 2 teaspoons of bid gonna give it lots of flavor three tablespoons of cars to occur No and now to make it a really scary halloween cake one tablespoon of orange food coloring all orange food coloring differs so it depends on how intense yours is this is pretty intense you might need a little more clear the decks because of cape all fools how's that for orange icing so I'm just going to put it right on the cake actually find a palette nice the best thing for spreading out I say like I just smooth it out a nice simple layer and i'll show you how to make it really nice and smooth hot water okay ok now we're ready for decoration and since it's Halloween of candy corn just like we always remember thinking about something I'm not gonna let you see okay don't look [Music] really there and who's that Halloween is just for kids [Music] okay these are espresso martinis it is indeed my creation and I thought it was as close to a black drink that you could possibly get Miguel cheers everybody [Music] until I get back to finish Tim so the lot of forks been resting for about 20 minutes and that allows all the juices to get back into the meat which is really important keeping it just tender and moist so now I'm just going to slice them in between each bone and then arrange it on the platter just keep it warm with foil it's perfect just slightly pink can do this without the box but I always think it's just so elegant to do it with the bones it smells so good until the rosemary garlic fennel seeds even the lemon zest okay just going to cover with foil to get everything else ready the Apple skins are out they turn this sauce a nice rosy color just going to mix it with a whisk just to break up the apples perfect okay into the serving dish the big ladle it's gonna be so good with a loin of pork rosemary and garlic [Music] okay last thing to do before dinner stream beans with garlic boiling water salt and about a pound and half of string beans for eight people I'm just going to blanch them for about a minute or two I think the best way to cook vegetables is to blanch them first and then saute them with flavor just going to drain them okay now what I'm going to do is sauté them a big saute pan a few tablespoons of butter few tablespoons of olive oil get the best properties of both let's reclose the garlic just toss the beans in to pull the toss there's so much prefer putting the vegetables and the meat on one platter next to meat looks so much better perfect I say that looks good enough to eat and the apple sauce and we're ready for dinner [Music] [Music] okay guys you've had your treat now i'm going to show you the trick watch this [Music] [Music] Halloween isn't just for kids or do they have all the fun I've invited some friends for trick-or-treat dinner and Miguel is setting the table got this black and orange thing
