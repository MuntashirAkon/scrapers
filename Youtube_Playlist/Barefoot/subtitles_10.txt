[Music] creme brulee is the ultimate guide dessert naked and he'll follow you anywhere but tonight a magnet for my girlfriend's creme brulee is this incredible creamy custard hard caramelized top absolutely delicious the three cups of cream can't make creme to live in that creme and I'm going to scald it which means it's not going to boil but they're going to be little bubbles all the way around the outside and it's just under boiling so I need one whole egg into the mixer fitted with a paddle attachment which is what this is and then you pour egg yolk half a cup of sugar just going to turn the mixer on low and mix them just until they're combined you don't want to need frothy whippy stuff just until they're combined just like that and then I'm going to add the scalded milk so I'm just going to pour it really slowly into the eggs don't want scrambled eggs beginning moves like creme really just looks like a great custard so I'm just going to flavor it with two things vanilla 1 teaspoon love vanilla my favor and 1 tablespoon of Grand Marnier she's really orange flavored liqueur and or whatever kind of look her you have around the house don't buy a whole bottle just for one tablespoon perfect then I put it into five ramekins or for my friends and I one extra for Jeffrey when he comes home it's the guy dessert thing perfect a [Music] water bath will ensure that the custards could even pitcher really helps it's just about halfway up the sides of the dishes so do for the oven 300 degrees for 35 to 40 minutes and then I'm going to chill the custard and my friends and I are going to blowtorch the caramelized sugar together that's going to be fun boy have I got a treat for you there vanilla custard but they might have a little Grand Marnier ma and how about if we brulee the top the burnt sugar I'll show you how so in take a tablespoon of sugar and just put right on the top of the cold custard and actually if you need to take your finger and run it along the top of that just to smooth it out to get it all the way and this is the fun part so this is a little kitchen torch so you turn it on watch that understand my dad dangerous okay you want it nice and high keep your hand away and you just hold it right down on the sugar and it'll burn it get under the blow torch you can actually do it in the broiler but I just think it comes out much better this way and it's so much more fun okay that's their job excellent well done everybody whoo
