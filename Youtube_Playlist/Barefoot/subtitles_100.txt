my friend Miguel is coming for dinner tonight on his way to Paris and I thought what should we make him for dinner and then I had the idea before Guignol and that way his vacation can start tonight even before he lands in Paris tomorrow so the first thing I'm gonna make is beef bourguignon which is really just beef stew with red wine and I'm gonna serve it with a salad with a creamy mustard vinaigrette and maybe a Kurile which is champagne with a little bit of kir in it mmm sounds good for the beef bourguignon what I have here is about a half a pound of bacon I cooked it in a tablespoon of oil I'm gonna take it out which leaves some of the fat in the pan and then I'm gonna cook the beef and the vegetables and the wine little kind yak it's gonna be really good together you know I think Americans think of French food as this sort of fancy pinkies up kind of thing and I love the really traditional recipes that have real country food so the next thing I'm going to do is take two and a half pounds of Chuck which is a fairly inexpensive cut of meat not like filet of beef and I've cut it in cubes and I'm going to dry it a little bit if the cubes are dry they'll Brown better in the pan just salt pepper and then I'm going to brown them in the pan just do it in a single layer so they Brown really evenly oh this looks great so that meets all nice and brown and it really brings out the flavor so I'm gonna take this and take it out of the pan onto the plate with the bacon and just put it all together want to save all the juices and it's all gonna go back in the pan later okay and then the next thing I'm gonna do is put in the rest of the meat this is a really traditional French recipe and I just think it's a much easier way to make it it takes much less time but it's wonderful for entertaining because you've got the meat and the vegetables and everything all together in the puffs and if you make it a day or two in advance all the flavors just get better and better you just have to heat it up before dinner okay that's done I'm just gonna take this out mm-hmm it smells so good already now I'm just gonna finish prepping the vegetables I have a pound of carrots and now what I'm going to do is throw them into the pot with all the juices from the beef and the bacon and cook them for about 10 or 15 minutes until they're just tender and I'm going to add two large yellow onions and the tablespoon of salt and two teaspoons of freshly ground pepper it seems like a lot but it's a big stew I'm just gonna saute this for about 15 minutes until the vegetables are just tender and the onions are nicely browned this is so great Miguel I think is picking up flowers and dessert while I make dinner so it makes it so much easier and really more fun I love a good collaborative meal so the next thing I'm going to do for the beef bourguignon is put in chopped garlic I'm about to close very often recipes call for onions and garlic to go in together but I think the garlic really burns very quickly so I tend to do the onions for about 10 to 15 minutes and then the garlic for only the last minute and then you get all the flavor of the garlic and no burning so two cloves of garlic right in with the carrots and the onions I'm just going to stir that up a minute while I go get the cognac see what I'm trying to do is sort of set up the table the sort of French look and I think you know the topiaries have that sort of sense of French formula garden so I think I would love this very evening okay sure you know what I'm also gonna pick those two one I'll grab the green that's great this is what I like one-stop shopping she loves big bows so that's nice big bow perfect in a clear paper yes that'll be great so I need to have a cup of cognac I'm gonna pour it into the pot and now comes the fun part I'm gonna flame it stand back but the flame does is it burns off all the alcohol that leaves a gorgeous flavor of cognac okay and then I'm going to put all the meat and the bacon and all those gorgeous juices right back in and then a whole bottle of red wine good red wine you want to make sure it's wine that you drink and actually you can even serve the same wine with dinner I did say a whole bottle and then I'm going to add a little bit of beef broth I just want enough so that it covers almost covers me but not quite and don't spend days making beef broth the can of it is just fine tablespoon of tomato paste I actually get it in a tube so it's really easy to keep stored in the refrigerator okay keep it nice and fresh with the top on and the last thing here is fresh herbs fresh thyme mmm smelling awfully good I think Miguel's gonna be pleased so now it's simmering which is perfect now this is the other novel thing about this recipe instead of cooking it on top of the stove as most beef bourguignon is and I'm endlessly fiddling turning up the heat turning down that he I discovered that if I cooked it at 250 degrees in the oven for an hour and 15 minutes instead of like two and a half hours as they usually are it comes out perfectly done so into the oven an hour and 15 minutes at 250 degrees and we're gonna have to beef bourguignon I love how in France they serve salad and cheese after the main course so since we're having a French dinner why not so what I'm gonna do is make salad with creamy mustard vinaigrette I'll show you how easy it is so the two key ingredients are vinegar and olive oil I'm going to start with it vinegar got three tablespoons mustard is Dijon mustard I like chopped garlic so I'm gonna put chopped garlic and just a little hint of it not a lot and you want to chop it up really finely so that nobody gets a big bite of garlic just to flavor the vinaigrette so that should do it that goes right into the vinaigrette I use an egg yolk to mull safai the vinaigrette but if you don't want to eat a raw egg just leave it out it's just fine so one egg yolk a little bit of salt remember a vinaigrette has to be really highly seasoned because you can put a lot of lettuce leaves in lots of freshly ground black pepper my friend Patricia Welles is incredible cookbook writer and teacher said this is the most frequently asked question she gets is how to make a vinaigrette and the truth is it's really easy so I'm just gonna whisk all this together and then pour in half a cup of olive oil really slowly this looks great so here's the secret about this is I put the lettuce right on top and store it that way until I'm ready to serve it and then I toss the vinaigrette and the lettuce together at the last minute so Miguel and I have beef bourguignon salad with creamy mustard vinaigrette I think he's getting deserved Anna I need your help yes I'm not looking for me tonight and I decided to buy dessert so you want to bring dessert yes and she's making beef bourguignon would you suggest I take um something fallish I would think something pears something found buried what is that Wonder and that is a plum tart and you know what you're gonna get that tip sometime yes that is a nice one that's a good choice it's very nice at this time of year there's still nice don't get them for quite a while so um they're nice that's all scrape thank you so have a nice dinner well thank you of course you do now comes the fun part kir Royale it's a great thing to have before dinner kir Royale is creme de cassis and champagne now how bad can that be cassis is black currant liqueur and I'm just gonna put a tiny - I have to taste it make sure it's okay before Miguel gets here tiny - in the bottom of a champagne glass these are really mounting glasses but you can use old fashioned ones I'd have to open up all the champagne mmm how good does that look uh-huh hello hi Miguel just hahaha hi sweetie mwah and guess what I'm testing right now kir Royale whoa Melba for one I can lipstick all over you ruin your reputation oh my god what did you get - a little my tart from loaves and fishes oh my god this is so beautiful Wow a little kir Royale are you available little cassis just a drop right I like the glasses thank you very modern champagne glasses aren't they very nice and this is dinner with Miguel Cheers huh I can't wait to see what you brought what did you bring well first of all some roses for you Oh Miguel they're so beautiful and very French kisser sort of all green and white right I love the fair shake and because I know you're making French food yeah having you know Kyoya I also decided we're gonna set the day one with a very French EMU oh good some topiaries oh that's great so I'm gonna thank my things okay I'm gonna go sit up the table okay fantastic yeah okay bye and I'm gonna carry on with Abby for venue before you know should be a really thick and delicious stew and the traditional French one has lots of mushrooms in it so I'll show you what I do with the mushrooms you really don't want to wash them because there's something about them they just absorb all that water and they just get sort of watery so what I'm gonna do is just brush them off or the towel or paper towel anything like that and then I'm gonna slice them up and saute them in a little butter and if they're really big I'll take the stems out but it's not usually necessary so it's about a pound of mushrooms doesn't have to be exact I know Miguel is doing a table setting in there and I'm sure it's gonna be totally over the top but just gorgeous okay then the next thing I'm going to do is just slice them really thickly you don't want little thin slices want gorgeous thick slices traditionally beef bourguignonne served with noodles or potatoes but one day my assistant Barbara and I decided to test that and we found it was okay but the best thing is if you take a grilled piece of bread rub it with garlic and then pour the beef bourguignon over it it's sort of like gravy and bread who wouldn't like that it was really good so that's what I'm gonna do for Miguel okay so big chunk of butter high heat just let that melt big wooden spoon so when you're sautéing something you always want to let the butter get really hot and then throw it in it'll really seal the flavor okay nice little sizzle going and go the mushrooms so I'm just going to saute those for about 10 minutes until they're really needy and delicious and tender beef bourguignon home stretch so the mushrooms are done oh whoa oh that smells so good can't wait to see what Miguel is doing for the table setting so I only have a few more things to do with a beef bourguignon and the first is I'm gonna thicken it a little bit a little butter and flour two tablespoons of butter 3 tablespoons of flour you it's a really easy way to thicken the sauce just mash the flour and the butter together whenever room-temperature butter so they go together just takes a second but it's really worth doing right okay okay that looks like it's done just till it's all mashed together just gonna put it in and cook it just a bit I'm just going to mmm love the way this smells I can smell the cognac and the wine and carrots and onions who wouldn't want that for dinner got every last bit so beef bourguignon has small whole onions and I'm going to show you a trick instead of peeling all those onions I use frozen small whole onions and they taste just great when it comes to big onions I don't mind peeling and chopping them but when they're really small I like the frozen ones and you just dump them in mix it up the lessons the mushrooms that have been sauteed okay right in I'm gonna let this simmer away for about 15 minutes until all those flavors are together the beef and the bacon carrots onions little garlic all that wine and cognac and mushrooms it's just smells so gorgeous time for dinner so I'm just going to take a cut clove of garlic and instead of chopping it I'm just gonna rub it right on this bread so you get all the oils and the essence of garlic without the bite of it and each plate is gonna have one big chunk of country bread and lots of beef or Guignol okay a little bit of chopped parsley on the top is always nice so just run your knife along the stems and you cut off the leaves since it's just the two of us I think might be nice to have everything on the table at once so we can really relax the beef bourguignon salad with creamy mustard vinaigrette big chunk of Brie and a nice tart for dessert so I think I'll get Miguel to help me oh my god Miguel this is so beautiful like it's like a French garden like at a Mondrian Easthampton yeah it's fabulous so you want to come help me and get everything the table before you yawns ready and a little salad and a little green I'm gonna do the beef bourguignon do you want to get some salad you tell great drawer I've got the salad already but don't mix the vinaigrette on the bottom we'll mix it just before we eat it how's that mmm smells great that's not great yeah I've been looking forward to dinner all day me too I've been looking forward to seeing you and I love what you do the B oh you do oh thanks I actually stole some hydrangea leaves from my hydrangeas sexy looks very pretty yeah yeah great well of course it has to be all right Wow you and I have had some good times in Paris my know we love Paris what's not to love exactly especially if you're home with you and your cooking oh that was fun wasn't it okay a little bit of parsley all right like that a little bit of parsley why don't I take these and you can take the salad in the Brie perfect and I'd say we're ready for dinner great come with me oh okay Miguel are you ready for a treat I'm almost ready but your face you are we're good how's that yeah no cheese and got everything great no wine for the one I love someone I just want to smell this unit from here

enough to go on my next book I think he's gonna fuck this oh good I think you're gonna drive business away from French restaurants not a little salad yeah maybe some cheese this is my secret I put the vinaigrette in the bottom and then I talked it just before ready to eat it give me the plates how about the green ones okay fantastic okay and maybe a nice slice of Brie to go with that I'll do that okay good thank you somebody else does it feel like your vacation started already one more glass and it will Cheers bon voyage grab the green that's great this is what I like one-stop shopping she loves big clothes so that's nice big bow perfect in a clear paper yes that'll be great so I need to have a cup of cognac I'm gonna pour it into the pot and now comes the fun part I'm gonna flame it
