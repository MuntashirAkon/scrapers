I have to say I make a mean guacamole I'll show you how so take for ripe Hass avocados those are the ones that are brown on the outside when they're ripe cut each one in half and then I use a knife just to get the seed out be careful you don't get your hand usually guacamole is a puree of avocados it doesn't have a lot of flavor I think it's got to have great flavor and really chunky texture these are perfectly ripe you want them so they're bright green if they're too ripe they turn brown inside it's not good then immediately at three tablespoons of freshly squeezed lemon juice just to stop the avocado from browning there all these theories about how to keep guacamole from turning brown but forget them all it's really simple fresh lemon juice one lemon should do it eight dashes of Tabasco sauce which gives Baucom only a really spicy kick I like it really spicy you can decide how hot you want yours 1/2 a cup of small diced red onion and a minced clove of garlic then a teaspoon of kosher salt that's the same as black pepper and just toss everything together then using a sharp knife slice through the avocados into the finely diced this is the secret to really good guacamole it mixes all the ingredients together and it stays really chunky this way finally at a medium tomato that's been seated and small diced it's seated so it doesn't make the guacamole watery I put the tomatoes in last because I don't want them to change the color of the guacamole toss everything together and you've got great easy guacamole
