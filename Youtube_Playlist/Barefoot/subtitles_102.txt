[Music] my friend TR is incredibly good-looking he's got lots of style needs a little bit of help in the food department so I promised to put together party with him for his friend that will really knock their socks off and I'm gonna share with him my five rules of entertaining hey what are friends for so what I thought we'd do is roasted eggplant spread for when everybody arrives and then for dinner a baked Virginia ham and a big platter of roasted winter vegetables and then for dessert I'm gonna give them a lemon cake from my freezer that's really easy and I'm gonna make lemon curd form so I can pour it over the lemon cake I think it's gonna be really easy for him and his friends are gonna be very impressed okay that's good I'm gonna do it really easily by putting in a food processor with one and a half cups of sugar I'll show you how instead of zesting all these lemons this is a really easy way to do it okay I'm just gonna chop it up really finely in here so I want to make sure the lemon zest is really finely pureed into the sugar just a little bit more you can tell it someone can really smell the lemon oil so that's good okay so I'm gonna put into the mixer a quarter of a pound of butter want it to be room temperature so it's easy to mix so next thing is this wonderful lemon sugar that I've just made it smells great I'm just gonna mix look the butter and sugar mix them together and then with a mixer on low speed I'm gonna add four extra-large eggs one at a time well maybe two at a time the pinch of salt and the last thing is 1/2 a cup of lemon juice great and now I'm just gonna cook it together for like about ten minutes until it gets nice and thick okay I'm just gonna put this on the really low flame for about ten minutes it looks really curdled when it's going in but don't worry it's gonna get very smooth when it cooks so low heat and you don't ever want it to boil otherwise the eggs actually will cook and you'll have lemon scrambled eggs not a good idea [Music] thank you for doing this I'm so happy to do it I needed a little help yeah well you've come to the right place good so get yourself relaxed so I'm making lemon curd for you dessert first absolutely deserve it so we're celebrating your new house that's exciting yeah finally after what how many months of renovations it's really worth it yeah you can even start mmm first rule of entertaining make it really easy the best parties are the ones where the host and hostess are having fun so I really about make very relaxed and having a really good time okay into the fridge right the next rule of Entertainer is making in advance so we're gonna make a roasted eggplant dip choose your weapon first things an eggplant like a medium eggplant you want to cut that in half and I see it's an easy thing is you don't even have it feeling just cut it really up and then maybe right down the middle just like that you know the peeler everything don't even have to peel it and that great right so the next thing is our two red peppers I'll show you a really easy way to do the peppers just run your knife right down side just like oh that's a great idea that it's like two of excellent yeah exactly okay now we need one red onion and then just cut it across there's a wall up and right on the top put it right on top there okay you don't feel garlic really hmm I think I cut off the end kind of like the onion you keep that right maybe take the whole corrode snap just chop it up you know sort of rough chop it's all gonna cook together what we need is some olive oil [Music] salt and pepper you in charge of salt and petrol lots of it I don't how much vegetables really need yeah freshly ground pepper so what how does this what are we doing so what's gonna happens we cook it and the vegetables are get really tender and soft right and then we're gonna put in a food processor and make a really chunky spread out of it with a little bit of tomato paste you'd be surprised how good it is yeah and you're gonna serve it with like feta and olives and some chips to dip how's that sound that's how Spencer how easy is that right alright you're gonna do the messy hand things together yeah this is the fun part it's great perfect I'd say that looks fabulous oh okay into the oven 400 degrees for about 45 minutes until all the vegetables are really tender and delicious and then we'll make the roasted eggplant for it so you've got rule number one is make it really easy rule number two is making an advance and next I'm going to tell you vegetables we smells great the onions and the red peppers okay you want to get the tomato paste or we can finish the roasted eggplant spread so this is the third tip got tomato paste the third tip now I'm not telling you yet so you want to put that what you call this and I'll scoop them in oh cool just use this I can really smell it you can see it's wonderful I love the red onions I think they're really sweeter okay and you try and get all of them in not on the food processor so the next thing is a tablespoon of tomato paste okay so now you're just gonna pulse it a few times so it's you want a really coarse keep going keep going until it's all trucked up that looks perfect okay so yeah I don't anything would be great to serve this with is if you get feta yeah but it right now feta and olives and maybe some chips I think it'd be really great with that what kind of chips like those yellow corn chips would be great it's kind of scoop it you're gonna help with the shopping list right that's the third tip uh-huh is you want to buy as much as you can and just make a few things so I'll help you with a shopping list you want to put that much yes refrigerator and I think it's a gorgeous day we need to do this in the garden so it's come with me [Laughter] [Music] by everything that you can buy no it's really important to just make a few things and shop for everything else your friends won't have more fun if you spent days making this party so alright so you have eggplant spread roasted eggplant right and you're gonna get feta tripe and some olives to go with it what kind of olives I don't know what do you like like kalamata olives those Greek olives or I sometimes like those oil-cured olives with their to prove all their wrinkly ones their wrinkly chips chips yeah chips would be good to scoop them yeah and then this is what I was thinking about for dinner and I thought maybe a big Virginia ham with a glaze like with mustard it's so easy won't believe it and then maybe some roasted winter vegetables you're like butternut squash and carrots and what else would be good sweet potatoes and I'm gonna do parsnips which are like carrots but they're white and they have sort of a carrot like flavor they're really good dessert we did the curd we did the lemon curd and I'm gonna give you the lemon cakes in the freezer and strawberries right servers are great that'd be really nice and I'm gonna make the ham glaze yeah thank you so much okay everybody I will see you okay after your chopping okay bye sweetie I know I have to make the ham glaze but maybe just a minute and this son as much as I'd like to lie around in the garden all day I did promise to you I'd help him with dinner so what I'm gonna do is a spiral cut ham with a glaze that has mustard and chutney it's just wonderful so the first thing is I'm making the glaze is six cloves of garlic right into the food processor the next thing is eight and a half ounces of mango chutney really can use any kind that you can find half a cup of Dijon mustard now these measurements aren't exact if you like mustard you want a little more use it if you want a little less garlic use less and one cup of brown sugar I use light brown sugar but if dark brown sugar works for you it's fine too and orange zest and orange juice my handy dandy zester whenever I use juice I always try and use the zest because frankly I think it has more flavor [Music] hey ready how are you good have you got that out that's my little sake you know oh thank you very much joy have a good one you too [Music] [Music] so just period it until it was really smooth and then when I get to TRS house I'm going to pour it on the ham and bake it off a big brown and crusty and delicious [Music] great black olives [Music] so entertaining rule number four make food that's really familiar and comforting makes people feel great this isn't the time to try and show off and impress your friends with lots of fancy things I like to make things that are just warm and familiar and make people feel really good so in that vein I'm making roasted winter vegetables forty are the key to roasting vegetables as you want to make sure you have big chunks of vegetables because when they roast they sort of shrink down a little bit so I have lots of carrots and we'll mix them all on the sheet pan together this is a butternut squash it's one of my favorite vegetables it's sort of tough you'll see on the inside and what I've done is I've peeled it just like that all the way around and then cut it in half and cut out the seeds and then chopped it in big cubes so I've already got one done which is all I need so that's gonna go right on the sheet pan with the carrots okay the next thing is sweet potatoes somehow sweet potatoes and yams always get confused but what you find here is always sweet potatoes yams are more of a yellow and a little sort of starch here and the next thing is parsnips so if you haven't seen it parsnip this is it looks like a carrot it's not orange obviously it's white but it's really I just think they're really delicious and they're sort of sweet the way carrots are sweet so you can cut them in in half like that in big dices but I've got it already peeled and diced so it's just gonna go on the sheet pan how easy is that just cutting and chopping and now what are we would you I'll get them ready for TR to roast in the oven by pouring olive oil lots of salt remember vegetables really use up the salt say you want make sure it's well seasoned and freshly ground pepper right on top it's a really simple vegetable because there's so many different kinds it's also really flavorful okay and then I'm just gonna toss them together with my hands Sotiris just gonna put this in the oven with a big Virginia ham and I say his friends are gonna be really impressed and I'm the only one that's gonna know how easy it was [Music] [Music] I'm great so how's the shopping successful yeah easy we lucky I do yeah fantastic put the ham in the fridge great I love your pool I'll be swimming in that pool may have to call the police to get me out of here that's huge oh my god you'll be having ham sandwiches for a long time but it's gonna be really good so you won't mind put the ham and the ham in the pan no just that side all right it's perfect actually this is great look how fabulous this is it's already sliced you can see its spiral cut so when you're ready to serve it it's all ready to go isn't it great yeah you just peel each slice right off like but for an hour I could take a card that's it for now we're just gonna pour the I need a spatula all right so what's in the glass the glaze has mustard and honey and chutney and garlic it's so good and you know the hams already cooked it's actually smoked so you just have to make sure it's heated through and then the top is gonna be really brown and crusty really good okay I already smell did you preheat the oven to 350 yes ma'am all right my guy okay into the oven oh my god really heavy 350 for an hour and it's gonna be glazed and gorgeous and delicious so I can open the oven door [Music] next is Rusted winter vegetables that looks great usually I roast them at a high temperature like 425 for about 25 or 30 minutes but since you have one oven and the ham is in there 350 you're gonna roast it at 350 for 45 minutes and they'll be perfect okay so you wanna pop in the oven okay perfect and then I'll show you what else I brought roasted eggplant spread remember we made this yeah not so long ago actually the good thing is you can really make it a few days in advance so so just put it in the dish we only have dessert left right one of my favorite things I'm gonna take a big dollop of lemon curd and put it right on the plate okay great I'm just put the strawberries in the ball okay everything's all ready I feel confident it looks gorgeous great thank you which leads me to rule number five yeah a really good look at the back before your guests arrive thank you so much it was really fun I love you back here [Music] to get numb me so now it happens dim with us is its roasted eggplant spread and now it's eggplant red peppers olive oil garlic onions it's delicious
