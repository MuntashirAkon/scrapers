[Music] my friend Joe tie redesigned my new garden so in return I've decided to make him lunch while he plants the walled herb garden I'm making him a delicious fresh green pea soup and serving it with a dollop of creme fraiche then we'll have roasted pepper and goat cheese sandwiches with basil from the garden and when his work is done we'll have a big slice of carrot and pineapple cake to celebrate so I thought maybe soup a sandwich I'm nice cake for dessert that would be nice so I'm gonna make fresh pea soup and I'm gonna start the soup with one leek so I've just used the light green parts and white parts and then thinking about leek says they're really good but they have a lot of dirt in them so you want to be sure that they're really well clean I'm cutting them in quarters and then you can see the dirt inside so I'm just gonna wash them really well just do this really carefully make sure you get all the sand out in between the leaves took the smallest amount can ruin the most delicious soup okay that should be good so I'm just gonna chop these up roughly the soups pureed so there's really no need to make it perfectly chopped just big rough chop okay so into the pot just about a tablespoon of butter one cup of chopped leeks okay so the next thing I want to do is I need 1/2 a cup of onion leeks have a very mild flavor and onions have a little more strength so it gives it a little more complex flavor okay simple onion chopping keep your fingers out of the way and this way if you leave the root intact the whole onion stays together it's much easier than it's scrambling across the board okay into the pan with the butter on the leeks big spoon give it a stir so these are gonna cook for about about 10 minutes until the onions and the leeks are really tender sort of translucent it's actually a great day cuz Joe gets to garden I get to cook we all get to do exactly what we want to do and then we have a good lunch any chicken stock I like to make my own and peas so the first thing I do is put in two cups of chicken stock I really like to use homemade chicken stock but if you don't have it use a can and I'm just cooking away in the kitchen I just throw some chicken and vegetables into a big pot let it boil away for four hours and you have really good chicken stock and peas this is the key I actually use frozen peas because I think they're better in this fresh peas by the time they get to market they're a little sort of starchy these 10 ounces of frozen peas so I'm just gonna let this cook for about three minutes remember they're blanched before they're put in the package so they're already pretty cooked [Music] it's actually a really specific flavor I don't use it very much because it tends to overpower whatever year cooking but somehow with the peas in the mint it's nice nice fresh flavor I need about a third of a cup of fresh mint leaves that should be bit right okay right into the soup new teaspoon salt little pepper might be a quarter of a teaspoon give it a little heat give it a stir and that's it pretty simple so if you put all of this soup into the blender and turn it on you're gonna be wearing it it's gonna be all over your kitchen so what I do is put one ladle of soup into the blender put the lid on let's put it on low and then take this little top part off and just slowly put the soup in [Music] and it with a few peas on the counter but you're not going to end up with soup all over you [Applause] smells great I can smell the peas and the mint and onions and leeks okay that's good and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna chill the soup and then let it run add some creme fraiche to a little richness it can serve it cold but when we heat it later so into the fridge and I'm gonna make a nice sandwich dip it with a soup so the next thing I'm gonna make is a roasted red pepper and goat cheese sandwich it's a really good sandwich I wanted to be really special for Joe so the first thing I do is roast some red peppers now usually peppers are roasted over an open flame so they char the outside but this is so much easier five hundred degrees into the oven for about thirty minutes and some be so delicious mix with a balsamic vinaigrette and capers and a goat cheese sandwich can't wait til lunch [Music] at least melt great red pepper and goat cheese sandwiches perfect when you want to make something really special you want to keep it really simple so what I've done is I've roasted these peppers for about 30 minutes I just want to cover them with foil and that way the steam is gonna get under the skins and that's gonna be really easy to peel off in the meantime we make it funny Greg I like to use a fruity olive oil but now that's something that's really strong 2 tablespoons 1 tablespoon of good bosonic vinegar 2 cloves of garlic right in the vinaigrette and then 2 tablespoons of drained capers perfect just whisk it all together and that's just a nice balsamic vinaigrette with capers okay now for the peppers see if these is steamed well they smell wonderful too I just let them cooling a little bit so I can take the peel off just make sure you discard the seeds in the stem and then just peel the peppers peel the skin off the peppers it's sort of bitter and it's a little tough so it's really much more pleasant to eat if the if it's peeled off okay next one and then just peel it off and the flesh of the pepper is just so delicious okay just toss them let the peppers marinate with a garlic and that's gonna be so good with the creamy goat cheese with herbs and the roasted red peppers I know it shows up to in that herb garden Wow Oh Joe my Gardens so beautiful thank you oh love it well you don't mind if I undo some of those herbs over there do I need lots of them makes them grow faster honey basil underneat chives time to make lunch [Music] all I have left to do now is eat up the soup make the sandwich and Joe and I are gonna have lunch so first I'm gonna do is I took a this is a cheap bottle which I really like I'm just gonna open this up and then just spread it on the bottom of the sandwich this is a girl looking herb goat cheese just cuz I like lots of flavor okay so that's the goat cheese one layer of nice roast peppers this is actually too many roast peppers for the sandwich but they're great for salads or antipas toes with capers in the garlic mmm I'll sell my vinaigrette little piece make sure you have one nice layer okay and then fresh basil leaves right on top I wouldn't want to have this for lunch okay the last piece of basil now I'm gonna do some red onion just very very thin slices okay just take the peel off the outside and just really sort of scatter them put the top on we're gonna cut this in quarters I'm not gonna smell the soup goat cheese and red peppers a great combination okay onto the tray let's see how the soup is doing now which is perfectly reheated just needs a little dollop of creme fraiche about a quarter of a cup and now some fresh chives right into the soup give it a stir this is like a study in green green peas green chives green leeks so that's gonna be great with a sandwich I need just a little extra dollop of creme fraiche a little snip of chives not bad lunch for cooking a gardener so you'd like the chives in the pea soup stores right from your garden perfect it seems you've owned them down there were charges in the garden hmm so can I do other herbs in the garden yeah absolutely um what else would you want I use rosemary I use thyme a lot good parsley great can I go to the garden center and get it sure good I never treat for you after you're done with that cuz you'll need a little strength I'm gonna make you a carrot and pineapple cake oh absolutely perfect [Music] what could be more appropriate dessert for a gardener than a carrot cake the first thing I need is a pound of grated carrots it's actually really important to do it on this kind of a box grater if you do it in a food processor the carrots get too wet and the cake will fall okay so that's a pound of carrots I'm gonna need about a half a cup of pineapple and instead of buying a whole pineapple for a half a cup I just bought some all cut up if you're gonna buy a fresh pineapple a golden pineapple is really really sweet okay that should be about a half a cup now for the batter first thing in these two cups of sugar - next I need one two third cups of vegetable oil this cake is good it doesn't use butter it uses oil 3 eggs I always break them into another container you never know when you're gonna get a bad egg and ruin everything you've already done okay that's three okay we'll turn this mixer on add the X she's pretty vanilla okay that's the wet ingredients now the dry ones I need two and a half cups of flour and put into the sieve because I always sieve the dry ingredients two teaspoons of cinnamon two teaspoons of baking soda 1 and a half teaspoons of salt I'm so stiff that together this just mixes it and make sure that if there any little things in the flour that you don't want your cake that's it on low speed just add the dry ingredients slowly you don't want the flour to clump in the cake remember this is the point you don't want to over mix it so the flour doesn't get tough perfect okay a cup of chopped walnuts one cup of raisins it's a really chunky party cake love it it's one of my favorites okay that goes in and then to make sure the raisins and walnuts don't sink to the bottom of the pan I'm gonna put in a tablespoon of flour and just toss them around that's a good trick whenever you have raisins nuts chocolate chips in a cake just flour them they won't sink to the bottom okay so I'm just gonna fold in the flour nuts and raisins just fold them in by hand you don't want to overmix the dough so and I'm gonna add the carrots and pineapple so it's 1 pound of carrots grated it's actually a great way to get carrots into your kids half a cup of chopped pineapple it's like old-fashioned carrots and pineapple and carrots and just fold those in it's a really thick batter it takes a little work to fold it in but it's worth it okay now we need two inch cake pans what I've done is I've buttered and floured the pants and I put parchment paper and it's really important to make sure that you can get the cake out once you've baked it so I'm gonna put half in each pan it's gonna be a two layer cake and later I'm gonna make delicious cream cheese frosting to put on it okay just smooth it out into the oven 350 degrees for about an hour which will give me just enough time to go the garden center to get some fresh herbs you can never have too many fresh herbs in the garden [Music] I love to use fresh herbs when I'm cooking I use rosemary a lot it's good for marinades and lamb and time I use it a lot anything Provence all with garlic and Parmesan love the way it smells and parsley the world's most underrated herb it's got great flavor these are little seedlings and they're gonna get huge I'll have lots of parsley this is flat leaf parsley and - curly parsley these are gonna get big - it's gonna be fantastic herb garden I have to get them back to Joe and then I'm gonna frost my carrot cake [Music] now for the best part of the carrot cake the frosting I'm gonna make a classic cream cheese frosting so I need 3/4 of a pound of cream cheese half a pound of butter I'm just gonna combine them don't whip them and once he sends vanilla and a pound of confectioner's sugar if you're worried about Levinson the confectioner sugar just said that before you put it in nobody needs lumpy icing okay I'm gonna go get the case [Music] and had good to those look carrot and pineapple cakes frostings done so it's very simple cream cheese butter vanilla confection sugar so I've got a serving plate I was like a nice flat plate like a cake stand and for a double layer cake I always turn it upside down so the flat layer is up in the middle and then in order to make sure that cake plate stays clean while I iced it just going to put little pieces of brushing paper around and then I'll pull the mat after I'm done icing it that way you don't end up with a cake that's gorgeous and a plate that's a mess okay that's that glass of icing so I'm just going to the middle first doesn't even have to go to the edge because when you put the second layer on it's gonna sort of smush it out to the edge that's a technical term smush okay now for the second layer the second layer I want rounded side up so it looks like a really old-fashioned cake and that way the two flat sides are together and it makes a better fit and now lots of icing on the outside you really want to do the sides first then the top so you want to just fold it right over the edge and what I'm gonna do is really apply it first and then go back and make sure it looks really beautiful cause you want the sides to be sort of straight I want to look like a snowball you want to look like a really nice cake start on the top but I fold it over to the sides and then we can fix it later I'm using what's called a pallet knife it's a really flexible spatula and it's great for icing okay now that's got a general layer of frosting and we do is with a clean knife I'm just gonna go I'm gonna make the sides straight by going over them just go up it down making the sides straight just do it really slowly and carefully and if you get crumbs in something just go over it now I'm gonna just repair the top make sure it's really pretty yeah just nice okay yeah then take parchment paper comes out and it doesn't take the icing with it excellent nice edge okay now I need a little decoration just something simple I think just look right around the edge somehow I don't want to put a carrot on top that doesn't look appealing but pineapple that works and that's it I'd say Joe and I have a really great treat he's been working hard in the garden and I've been working hard in the kitchen we deserve it [Music] you deserve a big piece of cake hmm that's terrific so those herbs at the garden center okay perfect and excellent choice but maybe in the spring we can take carrots I can make you more carrot cake wasn't coffee thank you very much Cheers thank you so much I love my garden it's amazing and that's it pretty simple so if you put all of this soup into the blender and turn it on you gonna be

make a nice sandwich to go with the soup [Music] so the next thing we're gonna make is a roasted red pepper and goat cheese sandwich it's a really good sandwich I wanted to be really special for Joe

much more pleasant to eat if the if it's peeled off okay next one and then just peel it off and the flesh of the pepper is just so delicious okay just toss them let the peppers marinate with a garlic and that's gonna be so good with the creamy goat cheese with herbs and the roasted red peppers can't wait I know it shows up to in that herb garden Wow Oh Joe my Gardens so beautiful thank you and time I use it a lot anything Provence saw with garlic and Parmesan love the way it smells and parsley the world's most underrated herb it's got great flavor these are little seedlings and they're gonna get huge so I have lots of parsley this is flat leaf parsley and two curly parsley these are gonna get big - it's gonna be fantastic herb garden I have to get them back to Joe and then I'm gonna frost my carrot cake you [Music] now for the best part of the carrot cake the frosting I'm gonna make a classic cream-cheese frosting so I need 3/4 of a pound of cream cheese half a pound of butter I'm just gonna combine them don't whip them and once he spends the night and a pound of confectioner's sugar if you're worried about Levinson the confectioner sugar just save it before you put it in nobody needs lumpy icing okay I'm gonna go get the case [Music] and had good to those look carrot and pineapple cakes frostings done so it's very simple cream cheese butter vanilla confection sugar so I've got a serving plate I was like a nice flat plate like a cake stand and for a double layer cake I always turn it upside down so the flat layer is up in the middle and then in order to make sure that cake plate stays clean while I iced it just going to put little pieces of parchment paper around and then I'll pull them out after I'm done icing it that way you don't end up with a cake that's gorgeous and a plate that's a mess okay that's that blast of icing so just gonna do the middle first doesn't even have to go to the edge because when you put the second layer on its go and sort of smush it out to the edge that's a technical term smush okay now for the second layer the second layer I want rounded side up so it looks like a really old-fashioned cake and that way the two flat sides are together and it makes a better fit and now lots of icing on the outside you really want to do the sides first and then the top so you want to just fold it right over the edge and what I'm gonna do is really apply it first and then go back and make sure it looks really beautiful cuz you want the sides to be sort of straight don't want to look like a snowball you want to look like a really nice cake start on the top but I fold it over to the sides and then we can fix it later I'm using what's called a pallet knife it's a really flexible spatula and it's great for icing okay now that's got a general layer of frosting and we do is with a clean knife I'm just gonna go I'm gonna make the sides straight by going over them just go cut it down making the sides straight just really slowly and carefully and if you get crumbs in something just go over it now I'm going to just prepare the top make sure it's really pretty yeah just eyes okay yeah I'm gonna take parchment paper comes out and it doesn't take the icing with it excellent nice edge okay now I need a little decoration just something simple I think just like right around the edge somehow I don't want the carrot on top that doesn't look appealing but pineapple that works that's it I'd say Joe and I have a really great treat he's been working hard in the garden and I've been working hard in the kitchen we deserve it [Music] you deserve a big piece of cake hmm that's terrific so those herbs at the garden center okay perfect an excellent choice but maybe in the spring we can plant carrots I can make you more carrot cake wasn't coffee thank you very much Cheers thank you so much I love my garden it's amazing and that's it pretty simple so if you put all of this soup into the blender and turn it on you're gonna be wearing it it's gonna be all over your kitchen so what I do is put one ladle of soup into the blender put the lid on
