[Music] my friend Miguel Flores biana and I have worked together for years he's been a respected magazine editor and now he's decided to become a photographer and he's very good he's coming today to photograph my garden I think I'll make him lunch and maybe something beautiful to photograph I'll make him an easy and colorful lemon fusilli with arugula followed by his favorite poem cake que tan and for photographing maybe some roasted tomatoes with fresh basil from my garden and for dinner tonight I think I'll make myself a salad with basil green goddess dressing with Miguel behind the lens I better be sure that these recipes are ready for their close-ups [Music] my plum cake Titanic is a twist on a classic French dish called tarte tatin which is made with apples but I'm gonna make it with plums instead so I'm gonna make a little bit of caramel with a cup of sugar and 1/3 of a cup of water it's gonna cook it over medium heat until it's nice and caramelized and brown wonderful and I'm gonna start cutting up the plum so I'm gonna cut these farms in half just take out the little pits which is sometimes not that easy to do these pumps are available sort of late summer early autumn and they're just wonderful they're called Italian prune plums if you want to make this cake another time you can make it with peaches or apples so delicious and it's really easy so I'm going to start with a 9 inch pie plate that I've greased and about 10 to 12 plums depending on the size of the plums let's see if these will make it around and I'm going to take the plums and put them cut side down at a decorative fashion because this is gonna turn upside down you want them to be really pretty we put as many as you can in the chocolate okay last pump might say that was perfect um the caramels already it's nice and warm to a very warm chestnut kind of color just swirl be sure you never stirred I'm just gonna pour it right over the plums and it's gonna make a wonderful caramel crust that's gorgeous why is Miguel out in the garden photographing he should be in you're photographing this so for the cake part of my plum cake take town first thing in these six tablespoons of butter it's 3/4 of a stick 3/4 of a cup of sugar it's a pretty easy cake but it's got a little lemon zest in it so it's got great flavor I'm just gonna cream that together until it's light and fluffy Saiki mosted in the bowl I need two extra-large eggs let's turn the mix it down to low and put in the eggs one at a time just until they're really incorporated don't worry about over beating it now [Music] I'm just gonna scrape down the sides make sure it's well incorporated okay well that's Mexican really great some lemon zest that I have a teaspoon of lemon zest just that's really nice flavor to the cake batter and I think really complements the plums okay half a teaspoon of lemon zest and a half a teaspoon of pure vanilla extract mmm love that started a cup of sour cream [Music] okay that's the sour cream those are the wet ingredients now I'm gonna do the dry ingredients I need a cup and 2 tablespoons of flour don't ask why 2 tablespoons it just works and actually when I measure flour I fluff it first with a cup or the spoon and then just level it off just to ensure the same measurement each time I need 1/2 a teaspoon of baking powder and a quarter of a teaspoon of salt kosher salt just sift them all together perfect what makes for online just put all the dry ingredients in mmm it's good it's not the lemon zest [Music] just makes it just until it's mixed actually I tend to stop it even before it's just mixed and finish it with a spatula this is actually the time to not over beat the batter because it'll develop the gluten in the flour and you'll end up with bread dough instead of cake not good so I just make sure it's really mixed with a spatula I'm just going to pour this right over these plums what's amazing is the caramel is hardened completely but when it bakes the juices from the plums and the caramel will just get very soft and they'll get right into the cake and it's just delicious so spread this out mmm I'm gonna bake this 350 degrees for about 30 to 40 minutes so I think next I'm gonna do some tomatoes with basil for Miguel to photograph I have some tomatoes and there's great basil in the garden it'd be nice from def something beside Gardens to photograph so into the oven this could be really good dessert [Music] I'm Miguel how's it going hey it's going well I take some basil I need yeah I'm gonna take some pictures oh come on ready come on I love this much much more tuna today yeah take pictures of the garden anyways with my tomatoes once more I'm out of here [Music] some girls asked me to do food that's pretty enough to photograph and of course I want to do food that's good enough to eat so I'm gonna do both I thought would be nice to make roasted tomatoes with basil I mean how colorful is that so what I'm gonna do is I take plum tomatoes and the interesting thing about plum tomatoes is they really available year-round but they really don't have a lot of flavor so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna roast them and it really concentrates the flavor so I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take the seeds and the core out because they don't have as much flavor I really just want to have the shell collect the flavorings that I'm gonna put into it anytime you want concentrated flavor of something just roasted [Music] okay first flavoring is garlic just means two cloves of garlic chop it up really fine girl looks actually amazing cuz when it's raw it's really sort of pungent and not pleasant to eat but when it cooks if it's not too high temperature it just has a wonderful sweet flavor okay I'm supposed to break this over the tomatoes try and get it into the shells a quarter of a cup of olive oil just gonna drizzle it over don't want to have tablespoons of good balsamic vinegar just enough so you get a little bit in each one two teaspoons of sugar that really helps the caramelization may be suppressed it doesn't make it sweet at all one nifty spoons of salt [Music] and heaven teaspoon of pepper okay into the oven 450 degrees for about 25 to 30 minutes I'm gonna just finish it with lots of basil and they'll be ready for their close-up I think the plum cake 210 is just ready well it looks pretty good uh looks great as tempting as it is to turn it out now it has to sit for 15 minutes otherwise the caramel just all run off the last thing I want to do for these tomatoes that Miguel is gonna photograph I'm gonna do just a shower of fresh basil on it I'm just gonna take the leaves roll them up this is called julienne or ship nod just roll them up like a little cigar and then just slice them mmm so function it's wonderful okay right on top of the tomatoes a little bit of flake salt always looks gorgeous in a photograph hi Miguel I've got tomatoes for you to photograph oh good what do you think that's the moment I was waiting for okay I'm gonna leave them to nude photographs I'm gonna go finish lunch I'll join you in a minute okay [Music] well it's time for the moment of truth to see if I can actually take this plum cake to town out of the pan it's kind of like when you open the oven door and you don't know whether the souffle is risen but we shall see it's been sitting for about 10 or 15 minutes it's still really warm and hopefully the Carol will be exactly right okay the big moment straight over beautiful it looks sometimes it creates a little bit of a vacuum so you just have to run your knife right underneath it now that I've flunked a tattoo isn't that gorgeous I'm gonna dust it a little bit of confectioner sugar it'll be just gorgeous I think the girl's gonna love this hey desserts
