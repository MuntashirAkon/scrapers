[Music] my friends coming for dinner on Friday night and I've got a really hectic week so I've got a plan I'm gonna make one thing every day and then by Friday all the cooking done and the table set here goes on Monday I'm making rosemary polenta which I'll just have to saute before the party Tuesday it's coconut macaroons would be great with coffee on Wednesday I'm testing recipes for my next book so I'll test a recipe for chicken with morels that I can serve on Friday Thursday I'll buy the ingredients for an arugula and parmesan salad and make the lemon vinaigrette and on Friday my friends will think I spent the entire day cooking and only you and I will know the truth one of the things I love the most about my garden is having fresh herbs there's something about just walking out the back door and just picking something the time will really last all winter so I can use it all year round but in the spring I planted this rose right but I'm serious it was about this big when I planted it I can't believe it's gotten so big rosemary is really great for especially for lamb but for today I'm gonna flavor my polenta with it I need about two branches so handy having it right out the back door [Music] so for my first dish for the week I'm gonna make polenta which is like a corn no pudding there are two kinds of planted this very soft polenta it has to be made just before you serve it and there's a firm polenta which you can make at least a week in advance so for my party I'm gonna make the one you can make in advance so the first thing on it I've done is I've heated a quarter of a pound of butter which is one stick and a quarter of a cup of olive oil and then I'm gonna put all kinds of flavorings into it teaspoon of rosemary right into the butter and oil one teaspoon of crushed red pepper flakes give it a little heat and one tablespoon of freshly chopped garlic which I've already done here it's about three cloves so it's a lot of garlic but it's a lot of polenta also great I'm just gonna saute that for about a minute just to cook the garlic so while that's Aarti I'm just gonna add 1/2 teaspoon of salt and 1/2 teaspoon of pepper oh that smells great smell garlic and rosemary cook them together okay that's perfect now I'm gonna add three cups of chicken stock homais it's always better but if you don't have it you can use two canned chicken stock two cups of half-and-half good news is can sit in the fridge and you can just saute it up whenever you want to have it for dinner and now comes the base of polenta which is ground cornmeal it's yellow cornmeal I need two cups this is a nice stone ground cornmeal if you can find it but any good cornmeal is fine a medium grind if you have a choice okay that's two cups the nice 2 cup measure I'm just gonna sprinkle it in slowly while I'm whisking to make sure I don't have any lumps just keep sprinkling and whisking and this is gonna firm up really fast that's good okay now I'm just gonna cook it for a minute to until it gets thick just keep whisking it to get any lumps out just about like that Oh hard work okay off the heat I'm just gonna add about 1/2 a cup of freshly grated Parmesan cheese I would tell you is this okay gonna be so good so now I'm gonna pour it into a form so we're just gonna chill this and then the day the party cut it out in triangles or circles whatever I feel like okay and into the fridge one dish down for my party on Friday and I'm off to work [Music] [Applause] well we're going to have to decide which recipes we want to list on the website I'm good I could do that how about cheese straws great idea and of course it's got to be creme brulee right set it that's everything we're out of here all right I think we got a lot done today I think we accomplished a lot today so the next thing I'm gonna make my party on Friday are coconut macaroons it's sort of classic Jewish holiday thing made for Passover because it has no flour in it I make them all the time they're really great and won't believe how easy it is it's one bag 14 ounces of sweetened condensed milk it's one can and a teaspoon of vanilla extract and just fold these together until they're well mixed so the next thing I need is whipped egg whites into the mixer quarter of a teaspoon of salt the salt helps it whip okay that should do it so let me take them on a list they stand up just like that perfect so I'm just gonna lightly fold this into this coconut mixture and what this does is lighten it so it's not quite so dense okay that's all the ingredients so I'm just gonna fold this in you just want to do this carefully you don't want to deflate the egg whites we're gonna scoop them out on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper when we bake these at 325 for about 25 to 30 minutes and then after they cool I'm gonna put them in an airtight container and there's still gonna be fresh for the party on Friday how great is that into the oven and tomorrow I'm gonna make chicken morels for just the main course [Music] today's the day for testing recipes for my new book an addition to testing them over and over again to make sure I've got them right I'd like to road test them on my friends so I'm gonna make chicken with morels today and then I'm gonna serve it for my party on Friday night so I'm going to start with morels which these are dried morels from time to time you can find them fresh but dried morels are pretty available and they have this really sort of pungent woodsy flavor sort of like gym socks but they're really good so I'm gonna soak them in very very hot tap water for about 30 minutes and it's gonna reconstitute them okay while those are soaking I'm gonna start the chicken yeah six boneless chicken breasts and I'm gonna take some flour salt and pepper and just dust them before I saute them just mix it together I think we'll do three at a time that's what's gonna fit in the pan just cut them lightly that's good and messy so I'm just gonna pour a little bit of clarified butter in the pan and saute the chicken breasts just until they're browned on both sides for about eight to ten minutes total it's very important to heat the butter or oil in a pan first because then when the chicken hits you want to sear it so it really seals in the juices okay let's put the chicken breast right in coat them and then shake off the flour and while those are cooking up flour the other three chicken remember it's going in the oven later I'm gonna add the other three chicken breasts okay now I'm gonna drain them around let's not care for the slotted spoon for your fingers anyone okay chicken I think it's probably ready to turn okay shallot for the sauce perfectly okay this batch goes into the casserole and now I'm just gonna make the sauce about a third of a cup of showers by dinner better two cloves of garlic and the morels okay just I'll tell you that until the shallots are cooked and now what I'm going to do is add some Madeira and that's gonna do what's called deglazing the pan it's gonna get all those sort of brown bits from the chicken into the sauce that's gonna be totally delicious one cup of madeira Madeira is a Spanish wine that's like sherry and it's gonna flavor the sauce fabulously okay that's gonna cook for a little bit and now I'm gonna add eight ounces of creme fraiche which is a very thick French cream like sour cream but actually even thicker cup of heavy cream mix that into the sauce okay new two tablespoons of lemon juice and that's actually gonna cut sort of the sweetness of the richness of the cream and the creme fraiche it's a nice combination and teaspoon of salt 3/4 of teaspoon of pepper I'm just gonna let that simmer for about 10 minutes until it's reduced and thickened [Music] while I'm working on a recipe I always think of notes I want to add to it just when I head to first one was that morels are wild mushrooms and they're dried you can find them especially a food store or by mail order and the second one is that creme fraiche sometimes you just can't find it sour cream is a great substitution okay that's done so smells amazing oh it's nicely reduced it's not thick it's just a little bit thickened and wonderful okay you pour it over the chicken oh I'm gonna get every single bit from that pan the morale was some shallots Madeira hmm that's wonderful so while he was on a bake this at 375 for about 12 minutes just until the chickens cooked it's gonna be really good on Friday night okay main course done tomorrow I'm gonna shop W Rugal and Parmesan for my salad [Music] so for tomorrow night's supper I want to make a salad I love a lemon vinaigrette I think maybe shaved parmesan on top of would be great but I need a lettuce that's gonna stand up to that these lettuces are beautiful these little bit lettuces but I think they're too delicate I needed a really strongly flavored lettuce and a romaine would be nice a little stronger but sort of classically Caesar salad let's see mescaline this will be great arugula it's peppery it's got a nice bite to it and it's a classic Italian combination with Parmesan that's what I'm gonna do it looks beautiful there are two types of really good Italian parmesan cheese Grana Padano and Reggiano I personally prefer the Reggiano it's really good and you can tell that it's Reggiano from the rind it's usually stamped Reggiano on the rind so buy a big chunk grate it yourself and it's gonna be wonderful on my arugula salad and love arugula it's got a nice peppery slightly bitter flavor I just think it's a great salad leaf and with a parmesan which actually is a little sweet that's a great contrast and lemon vinaigrette it's one of my favorites and I'm gonna spin them in my salad spinner my favorite tools just lift them out of the water you want to go near the sand that settles at the bottom salad seems like the thing you have to make up the last minute what do I like to do is get all the ingredients ready the vinaigrette the lettuce the parmesan and just throw it together just before I serve it I love the salad spinner now the thing about salad spinners it gets all the water off the lettuce so the vinaigrette clings better so it's a really important thing to do look how much water came out of that it's amazing so my secret is that I keep the arugula right in the salad spinner and it acts as a crisper in the refrigerator so into the refrigerator it would be perfect for tomorrow I'm gonna make the lemon vinaigrette I need quarter of a cup of lemon juice should be one or two lemons depending on the size [Music] [Applause] [Music] have a cup of olive oil 1/2 a teaspoon of salt [Music] quarter of a teaspoon of pepper I'm just gonna whisk it up in this little mixing bowl that was so sweet of Michael to bring the flowers by I was so busy he also brought me Alka Miller which is this lime green some very fuzzy stuff which I love just keep working your way around cutting that stems and what I did here to make it easy for myself is really pick one color sort of lime green the flowers have a lot of yellow in it but they also have a lot of green and the best thing about this is it's really better for cut roses the day before because by tomorrow they're gonna open up and be really full it's a great thing to do ahead when you're having a dinner party okay so I'm nice modern black table so I thought I'd do a modern table setting very unusual for me so I've black bamboo mats and a white napkin with a little lime green dot to match the flowers pull it all together a fork for the main course and a salad fork it's going to put the salad fork on the outside done so I've got the food done I got the table setting done and it's gonna take no time to get rid of tomorrow and I'm gonna have to get apart oh what a day the good news is I've got everything almost done deep breath and I'm ready to go we hit the tipping rails I made this on Monday we put it fresh so it's nice and set cut these in triangles flour each one a little bit on the outside it's gonna make a really nice crust really like dust it off a little bit of heat so when the plan to head to the pan makes a nice crust so it's crisp on the outside and creamy inside and I'm gonna keep it warm in the oven until they're not just about ready to turn nice and brown they get and then onto the pan they want in the oven that's why I'm ready to serve dinner into the oven so this the lemon fresh lemon juice olive oil salt and pepper lightly put it on the center remember you can only put more vinaigrette on but not less and now just the parmesan a big slices of parmesan you can use a small knife but it's much harder I always find a special appeal or easier to do right on the time sounds all ready blend it and thickener in the oven after you want to start this hour yes okay so it's arugula with lemon vinaigrette and Parmesan for me all right I'm in charge of the chicken dr1 I think you need a little sausage thank you so it's polenta with parmesan Jesse you in charge of one I think I am would you like something a little French wine for a French chicken with him around how is it so far okay nobody wants dessert everybody did you mother used to make my 15 is for you got here
