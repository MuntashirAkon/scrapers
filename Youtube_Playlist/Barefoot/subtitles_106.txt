[Music] my friends are coming over and I said I was going to make a Mexican themed meal so I thought with the Mexican chicken soup it'd be great to have jalapeno cheddar cornbread I'm going to start with the dry ingredients first they need 3 cups of flour all-purpose flour 1 cup of cornmeal I use medium we have a choice of a medium grind or a fine grind I use medium grind one cup of yellow cornmeal a little bit of sweetness quarter of a cup of sugar 2 tablespoons of baking powder 2 teaspoons of salt really important ingredient to make sure got enough salt in it to bring out the flavors and stir those together now we're going to put together the wet ingredients so the first thing I need is two sticks of butter can't make cornbread with that good butter it's a half a pound it's going to melt that in the meantime I need three eggs I'd say most cornbread is really dry but this is very moist lots of flavor took up the milk okay and the melted butter I'm going to whisk it in make sure the eggs are broken up pour this into the middle of the dry ingredients make a big well in the middle pour it in and just start you don't want to over mix it it'll get tough so just stir it in just as much as you need to in order to make it really moist okay so that's eight ounces of cheddar I'll put it all in just leave a little bit for the topping and I need 1/3 of a cup of chopped scallions just roughly chopped okay that should be about a third and now the jalapeno is a hot part if some recipes say like a large jalapeno I don't know what a large jalapeno is but this would be as hot or as mild as you like okay right into the batter so with the cheddar scallions and jalapeno and only tastes good but it looks great I'm just going to stir it up just until it's all moist okay into the pan I've got a 9 by 13 inch greased pan just brush it with butter just pour the cornbread and smells good it looks good grated cheddar on the top big shavings of grated cheddar and some chopped scallions to separate that one okay into the oven 350 degrees for about 30 to 35 minutes guess jalapeno cheddar corn bread [Music]
