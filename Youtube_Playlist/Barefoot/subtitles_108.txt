I thought I'd make cream of wild mushroom soup to start because I can make the whole thing in advance and then just heat it up before dinner I'm starting with five ounces of each of three mushrooms portobello cremini and shiitake if you can't find all three just pick one okay nice clean mushrooms so the next step is to separate the mushroom stems from the calves that ones just can't take off the stems I love the nutty sort of meaty flavor of the wild mushrooms so chop the stems just a rough chop because it's all going to get cooked together and then for more flavor go chop the carrot any kind of vegetables you have that will flavor the stock it's great way to use them up okay so now it hit the canned tablespoon of olive oil tablespoon of butter and go the onions carrots and the mushroom stem these just will cook for about ten to fifteen minutes until they get really nice and caramelized and okay big sprig of thyme right in and let that cook when you get the rest of the soup ready so first thing when they use is the week and then you see at the grocery store but people don't use it so much here [Music] so you some butter and oil again so to get the best flavor of the butter in the best learning temperatures of the oil leaks go into the pin that's going to saute for about 15 to 20 minutes they have great flavor the meantime and then pour some water into the stock I need 6 cups of water since it's a similar way for best 30 minutes if you get the really rich mushroom stock and then later I'm going to add it to the soup okay so the next thing you want to do for the soup is cut up the mushroom caps I quarter half inch slices okay that's it for the mushrooms I'm just going to go into the pan with the leeks in the butter just give them a stir and those are going to cook for about 10 minutes until all the moisture from the mushroom this gets out into the soup okay now I'm going to strain the stock [Music] make every last bit okay so the next thing is add a little flour to these mushrooms it's amazing how much they cook down so I need a quarter of a cup of flour what this is going to do is thicken the soup set it right to the mushrooms cook it for a minute perfect I need a cup of dry white wine and if we have Anna frigerator it what smells great okay some fresh thyme leaves about teaspoon give it a stir and now I'm going to add the stock look how gorgeous that is just in the stem [Music] okay last ingredient put one cup of cream and then cup of half-and-half and 1/2 cup of fresh parsley give it a stir so I'm going to chill this and I'm going to heat it up just before dinner this is fantastic I think actually the best soup but I said look at Elijah's thank you really [Music]
