[Music] since we live by the water Geoffrey's always saying let's get a boat I think oh great I'm gonna learn how to sail then I'm gonna be making lunch and at the end I'm gonna be swabbing down the deck I don't think so so when my friends Barbara and Bobby Lieberman invited us on their new tugboat I thought great Oh Mike Lynch so we're starting with fresh lime daiquiris and a spicy eggplant dip with toasted pita triangles then since it's lunch on the water I'm making orzo with roasted shrimp easy to serve and a whole meal in itself and for dessert slices of a barefoot classic coconut cake just the thing for an afternoon on the water this is my idea of boating a delicious lunch with friends and somebody else's both mr. Trump adores I was great dish for crowd best part of it is the longer it sits the better it gets so the first thing to do is roast some shrimp a little olive oil salt and pepper it's actually a surprising way to cook shrimp on a sheet pan in the oven I just find it really gives it more flavor it's 2 pounds of shrimp to about 32 shrimp okay into the oven high temperature 400 degrees for exactly six minutes and they're gonna be really delicious and succulent and I think the orzo is just about ready so I cook 3/4 of a pound of orzo and going salted water with a splash of olive oil good luck whoa okay that's drained this is gonna go right into the big bowl the lemon vinaigrette the first thing you need is 1/2 cup of freshly squeezed lemon juice the big lemons have a better quarter of a cup each after the other code and I have a cup of olive oil one teaspoon of pepper I just pour it right over the pasta it's gonna seem like a lot of vinaigrette but pasta really absorbs it may gives a great flavor okay I think the shrimp are ready okay so while those are cooling I'm gonna cut up some herbs and vegetables for the salad so the first thing I need is a cup of chopped scallions and then I'm just gonna run my knife right down the middle okay just rough chop the scallions and later red onions are gonna give this lots of sharp flavor right into the salad next thing is a cup of freshly chopped parsley [Music] I use flat leaf parsley I think it has more flavor but you feeling curly parsley it's just fine right it got 1 cup of fresh Dale so I'm gonna chop it roughly no it's really important to use fresh herbs especially when it's a salad like this but if you have some leftover and you want to chop it up just put it in little containers freeze it and then just defrost it when you need it okay one cup of dill right into the salad next thing is cucumbers so just run it down the middle and just do cubes so one seedless cucumber sometimes they're called English cucumbers too but whatever they're called they're delicious right into the salad I have a cup of diced red onion into it I just wanted to flavor the salad okay the next thing is the shrimp I think that perfectly cool [Music] okay all the flavor it just gonna toss it all together and then the last thing it's one of my favorite ingredients good feta and just put it in as gently as possible so it doesn't get all broken up toss it in it's perfect for sitting on the dock watching the boats contemplating life I'm gonna refrigerate it no I think I'm gonna go see if I can find some good ideas for the table I have this idea it might be fun to have a boat flag for a tablecloth and I think I've come to the right place these these look really small though oh this is an American flag why do I think it's not a good idea to put on an American flag here's he shot and said enough that looks like might be perfect I say that looks like a great tablecloth this rope is great I think be fun to tie the napkins I don't know it's a little too earthy not quite the red white and blue theme I have in mind I'll keep looking this looks like it's perfect nice white around a blue napkin I'd say that's perfect I need a few yards interesting contraption well that was an unusual shopping list I've got everything I've got my yacht ensign for tablecloth I've got rope to tie up the napkins and now I have to go home and make that coconut cake I think one of those popular recipes of all times that I've ever written with coconut cupcakes and so many people have emailed me and asked if they can make it into a cake that I rework the recipe a little bit and I'm making coconut cake so I'm gonna do for my friends today start with 3/4 of a pound of unsalted butter at room temperature need 2 cups of sugar I was gonna cream that at medium speed until it's really light and fluffy okay I'm low speed I'm just gonna add these one at a time until they're incorporated okay extra large one and a half teaspoons of vanilla extract turn them to low so I'm not wearing the vanilla one and a half teaspoons of pure almond extract okay now for the dry ingredients so first I need three cups of flour just fluff it up first and then carefully scoop it just level it off I always put it through a sifter it combines the leavening ingredients and the flour and salt but it also make sure that there's no little pieces in it one teaspoon baking powder half a teaspoon of baking soda 1/2 a teaspoon of salt just dip them all together in a cloud flour okay perfect now what I'm gonna do isn't it for a cup of milk I'm going to add the milk and the dry ingredients ultimately to the batter starting and ending with the flour so about a quarter of the flour a third of the milk this keeps the batter nice and light blend really well another quarter of the flour my friends Barbara and Bobby live about a half an hour away from me very convenient it was like just fold the batter because I think bottom of the bowl never gets as well mixed as the top does I just want to make sure it's well mixed okay four ounces of coconut you can really find it in any grocery store just fold it in carefully I've got two 9-inch cake pans priest and floured and half an H okay let's go slow this out so these are gonna bake 350 degrees for 45 to 55 minutes then I'm gonna do a cream cheese frosting yeah the coconut cakes are cool they smell so good and now it's my cream cheese frosting for it so the first thing I need is a pound of cream cheese it needs to meet room temperature so you can make it nice and smooth have a pound of butter it is frosting after all I'm just gonna mix it together you don't want to whip it just stir it together I'm gonna add a pound of sifted confectioner sugar I've already sifted this just add it slowly yeah okay and then some flavorings 3/4 of a teaspoon of good vanilla extract quarter of a teaspoon of almond extract just a drop and just mix that until it's smooth mmm okay I'm just gonna put it on the cake okay so the two cakes I'm going to do one upside down so we have a flat surface for the second cake let's put some frosting right in the middle it's like one big coconut cupcake okay another second where if you want a cake that's a little old-fashioned I put it right side up so it's a little rounded on the top if you want it more elegant so it's flat you put it bottom side up so it's very flat but this is an old-fashioned cake so I'm gonna do it this way sometimes with the chocolate ganache cake I do it upside down mm-hmm this looks great okay more icing so I'm gonna ice the entire cake and then we're gonna dust the whole outside with coconut okay so I usually do the sides first just easier just do this very gently you don't want any crumbs in the icing but remember the coconuts gonna hide any imperfections now that doesn't look bad at all does it and the last touch is coconut we're gonna take the shredded coconut and just press it on the sides the icing soft enough so it'll hold it about 6 ounces of coconut so all together there's about 4 ounces in the cake and 6 ounces on top so you need about 10 ounces of coconut so that's a coconut cake yes I'm gonna make roasted eggplant dip and we have with drinks on the dock I thought it'd be really great to have some roasted eggplant dip with our daiquiri sitting out on the dock bar burn Bobby I think it's me fantastic so it's a fairly simple process maybe like 1-inch chunks I've already done one this is the second one so two eggplants so the next thing is red onion one red onion also in chunks just dress them all together one red pepper also one inch cubes and this is really rough cuz in the end it's gonna get pureed I just find things have the most flavor when you roast them with olive oil salt and pepper really just gets into the vegetable or whatever it is the meat whatever you're making okay to close the garlic minced right on top Olive Oyl three tablespoons of olive oil why don't have teaspoons of salt a lot depends on how big the eggplants are half a teaspoon of pepper and a half teaspoon of cayenne pepper give it a little heat I thought you want to measure you don't want it too hot okay I'm just gonna clean hands just toss it all together and then I'm gonna roast it at a high temperature 400 degrees for 45 minutes and the onion and the eggplant and the garlic it's all gonna be so sweet and delicious [Music] and people start talking about things like tablescapes it makes me crazy I like a really nice table but it's got to be fairly something simple and something I can do so I'm just gonna take since we're doing the nautical theme although we take a nice basic bright blue napkin and with this great white rope that I got it's sailing rope I'm just gonna make some kind of a knot that's it I'm not much of a sailor so oh that looks like it been sailing that right perfect I'm just gonna cut it off now I know where this good sailing rope it's hard to cut I think that looks great so I need to make six of these so if I can do that again perfect I'm gonna need a curry after this I'll make a sailor out of me yet tips and is already so the vegetables are cool for the rest of eggplant dip I'm just gonna have a few things two tablespoons of lemon juice 2 tablespoons of tahini which is a sesame seed paste has great flavor for this too and I'm just gonna puree it until it's really chunky I don't like it when it's too smooth perfect we're gonna mix it in with some fresh parsley I'm gonna serve it with pita bread who wouldn't like that some fresh parsley me about three tablespoons it just gives it a little fresh color and flavor one of the things I never do it at a party to serve like a million hors d'oeuvres one really nice thing with a drink is all anybody wants okay right in say what a difference it makes it's really nice some kind of Farish herb okay into the ball take maybe a little garnish he said parsley it's gonna be really good with a daiquiri but then what wouldn't be good with a daiquiri I know they're all these fancy drinks between the sheets I never know what they are I like the classics I thought boats the Caribbean it's got to be run based drink why is it most cocktail recipes making one cocktail who drinks one cocktail I'm having a party I'm gonna make a lot of daiquiris so the first thing I need is two cups of rum good dark rum and need lots of fresh lime juice I need one and a half cups right the only other ingredient is sugar syrup and they have 2/3 of a cup of sugar syrup what it is is a cup of sugar and a cup of water that I cooked together until the sugar dissolved it's very often using drinks just mix it all together and then later I'm gonna shake it up with ice really good daiquiris but for transporting to the party right into a quart container whoa just made it okay that's ready to go now I have to just pack up everything else and we have a party all right Barbie you don't get it thank you so much for this gorgeous setting oh my god I can't wait to get on the so tell me what's in this again or should I plant peppers garlic okay okay right there so I'm waiting they're very patient you know one big trouble okay what don't you get I'm just gonna have a really big piece she works it off thinking about India okay everybody take a plate in your spoon Anchors Away I can't wait to start eating but the day doesn't get any better the company doesn't get any better okay Bobby can we keep going how about all the way to Paris we're not coming back
