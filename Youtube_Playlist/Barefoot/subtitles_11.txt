in the dinner and bringing the main course I'm doing everything else I'd say this is gonna be half the work and twice the fun I'm taking one of my favorite appetizers curried crab strudels and maple baked beans to go with Barbara's spiral ham plus a fennel and orange salad on the side and for dessert spicy poached pears [Music] no matter how easy a dinner party is it's always more fun to share the responsibilities of the friend my friend Barbara liver Minh is providing the location and she's making a ham that's gonna go with these baked beans so the first thing I did was I soak the beans overnight in the refrigerator I've got about a pound of red kidney beans here with about enough water just to cover them so I'm gonna just want to flavor the beans while I cook them I'm gonna cut one onion and eighths and just put it right in I'm gonna put in a bay leaf just once you do it and six or eight whole peppercorns just to give it some spice I'm gonna take these out later just bring this to a boil and then lower the heat and simmer it for about 15 minutes we're just gonna go to the pantry and get some sweet things and some hot things to give this lots of flavor okay first some sweet things well I have to have medal syrup actually it's interesting that maple syrup is the later in the season it's harvested the darker it is and sort of more full-bodied I like grade-a medium amber so that's maple syrup and I think some brown sugar would be good and now some spicy things ketchup and I think when you use this Chinese chili paste that's gonna give it some good heat okay I'm gonna add lots of flavor first thing is maple syrup can of maple baked beaten so that maple syrup someone do 3/4 of a cup of maple syrup this makes a lot of baked beans okay I find if you cook them all together all the spices it actually blends really well so can put them in a pot next thing is half a cup of ketchup these could catch it always use good ingredients what comes out as only as good as what goes in half a cup of ketchup and half a cup of brown sugar later I'm gonna add some things that we give really a lot of spice which is great to sort of balance the sweet okay that's a half a cup so now I'm gonna give it some spice I'm gonna end chinese chili paste which is a great ingredient to use it's not that unusual you can actually find at the grocery store one tablespoon of freshly grated ginger take the peel off the ginger it's not digestible some vegetables you don't want to peel because the nutrition is in the peel but ginger you definitely want to peel you really want to use fresh ginger it's got the most flavor so I need a tablespoon of grated ginger this really adds a lot of flavor and a lot of warmth to the dish we wonderful with the baked ham okay that's a tablespoon of freshly grated ginger just think how much flavor that's gonna put in and the last thing is one teaspoon of salt so this is the spice mix gonna heat it up with one and a half cups of cooking liquid from the beans just take some of the liquid from the bean stock perfect I'm just gonna give this a stir and let it simmer for about six minutes until the flavors blend in the meantime I think the beans are done and just check them and you can see the the covering just starts to come off when they're done they're perfect okay I'm just gonna drain the beans and I'm gonna save the cooking liquid so if it gets a little dry in the pot I can always add it later great Cup dance and extra liquid [Music] now everything's gonna go in one big pot [Music] okay the beans are just gonna go right in want to add all the spices which have been cooking together for about five or six minutes it's gonna be so flavorful [Music] this smells fantastic and now just to make sure it's really good I'm going to add about four or five ounces of good bacon that's about four or five slices gonna chop it up half of its gonna go tucked into the baked beans and half that's gonna be on top to make sure it gets a nice crust on top so half just goes right in but just fold it in and then hats gonna be strewn all over the top make sure it's really nice and moist and delicious and the smoky flavor gets into it all right lid goes on I'm gonna put these in the oven 225 degrees for 6 hours and they're gonna be so delicious next I'm gonna make crab strudels first I have a little time I think we'll hang out with Jeffrey [Music] so we're really having a dinner party tonight we are but it's a deliverance they're doing half the work I can hang out with you I like that that's terrific I always loved is there something delicious with cocktails something substantial but not so heavy that it makes you feel like you've eaten dinner already so I thought for the Liberman's I met crab strudels so first thing I need is some chopped scallions this has crabmeat scallions a little curry powder just delicious actually chop up the whole scallions some people think you should only eat the light green and white parts but I'm not quite sure why they all have flavor so I need three scallions a little bit of butter and a pan to cook them let that melt the chopped scallions in to close with garlic just mince them right up I like to put the girl again after the scallions have cooked so that garlic doesn't burn in goes the garlic that's too close chopped okay teaspoon of curry powder one good curry powder but not so spicy that it overwhelms the crabmeat okay while that cooks I'm gonna get the crab meat ready so I have one pound of lump crab meat got it at the seafood shop I just want to sort of pick through it and make sure there there are no shells every once in a while you run into a shell nobody wants to bite into shell so don't try not to break it up too much but just feel around perfect so now I need chopped parsley but two teaspoons should do it students are really flexible you can pretty much put whatever you think is appropriate in them and he left over to have a chicken and curry leftover just wrap it in a little strudel bake it and you've got a nice appetizer okay parsley a little bit of lime juice put it right in again these are flavors that really enhance the crab meat that just make it taste wonderful without overwhelming the delicate flavor [Music] okay that's good let's see how a scallions and garlic are done it's smells so good and that's gonna go right in scallions garlic and curry toss it all together this is the filling I'm gonna wrap it in phyllo dough brush it with lots of butter and then bake it off with the liver mince okay need a little bit of melted butter and now for the phyllo dough phyllo does classic Greek pastry it's very very very thin you don't want to try and make it yourself it comes in the freezer section of the grocery store and you defrost it in the refrigerator overnight so an unroll this package think about it is you want to keep it as moist as you possibly can so I put it right here on the stone I'm gonna do four layers for each strudel so take one piece of phyllo dough put on the board brush it with butter like that I actually use breadcrumbs so that the layers don't stick together when you put them together so second layer see how thin they are they're amazing what butter we're breadcrumbs these are great because you can make them in advance in fact you can make a lot of them and just freeze them so they're wonderful foragers and the fourth layer and then just press this okay and I'm gonna turn it on its edge turn it like this take the crab meat filling run up a nice roll down the side that so it'll roll up with that one inch then take the end roll it right around the crab meat and roll it as tight as tightly as you can just like that just keep rolling in each of these layers is gonna make it really nice and flaky one you can slice it and bake it okay so that's one I'm gonna brush the top with butter so it gets nice and brown when I bake it and then we're gonna bake it at Barbara's house okay the next one [Music] you [Music] I'm just slicing these into like one and a half inch slices on a diagonal I'm gonna bake them in a roll and then after they come out of the oven I'm just gonna slice them all the way through I'm gonna get to Barbara's I'm gonna bake them 400 degrees for 15 to 20 minutes and they're gonna be crisp on the outside and delicious on the inside and next I'm gonna make pears poached in a sweet dessert wine vinsanto so good [Music] time to make dessert I'm going to make poach fruit in vinsanto so first I'm going to make a poaching liquid I need 750 milliliter bottle of vinsanto which is that sweet dessert wine that you very often get an Italian restaurants you dip biscotti in it it's going to be delicious with pears and dried fruit then I need 2 cups of water 1 stick of cinnamon little spice 6 cloves 6 whole cloves about 6 if you like it really spicy you can always add more and one and a half cups of sugar zest of one orange classically pears approaching Saturn but it's so expensive that I decided maybe I should try some other sweet dessert wine and see if I can get the same kind of flavor and I actually like it better I think it's wonderful and the zest of a lemon so you get sort of the fruity essence of the the pears in the poaching liquid and the poaching liquid gets into the pears okay the lemon zest goes in and the last thing is a vanilla bean we love vanilla I'm going to raise the heat bring it to a boil and then let it simmer for about ten minutes and I'll get a little rich and syrupy now we're gonna get the pears ready music Bosc pears they're actually ripe when they're brown when they're green they're not quite ripe so these guys are really ripe they're hard also so if you press them it's gonna seem like they're not ripe but they are just as long as they're not green I'm just gonna peel each one I try to leave the stems on so they look really nice you can also cut them in half and take the cores out if that's the triptych Ferb we're just gonna do them all I think it looks really great and I think the poaching liquids just about done gonna put the pears in I'm just gonna lay them on their sides I love that my friend Barbara's doing half the work not only makes it easier to have a party but she's a really great party giver makes it so much more fun okay so these are gonna cook for about 20 minutes until the pears are really tender and they've absorbed all that wonderful vinsanto sauce and then later I'm going to add figs prunes and apricots and a little puff up in the liquid that'd be really good and dinner's almost ready to take to Barbara's and she's gonna make a wonderful ham [Music] hey here's a ham I called about morning Bob yes we do take a peek sure oh it's beautiful and how do I cook it a fully cooked ham I'm gonna preheat the oven to 325 okay put the hand min approximately an hour and a half need an internal temperature of 130 degrees I can do this okay sure you can thank you for doing all the work for me look nice great so I'm going to snip off the little hard stems from about one and a half cups of figs and just put them right into the poaching liquid with the pears I love a dish like this where the pears and the vesanto and the figs they all sort of flavor each other it's just wonderful and then wanting to have cups of dried apricots I'm just gonna approximate it it's a great dish when pears are in season and the only good fruit you can get are dried fruit and three quarters of a cup of pitted prunes I don't like the pits and things so it's good to have them pitted I know that the fruits simmer for about five to ten minutes until the pears are just perfectly cooked and all the dried fruit is all plumped up and it absorbs all the wonderful cooking liquid and then I'm gonna chill it all all I have to do is make fennel salad and we're off to the libertage last thing to do for the dinner with the Liberman's gonna make a really crunchy fennel salad with orange it's gonna be delicious with the baked beans but this is fennel you can find them in the grocery store it used to be hard to find but you can find them anywhere now and you just want the bowl I'm gonna cut it in half and then just cut the little core out which is kind of tough let's cut that little core out so I've got the slicing disk in just put it right in the top right down look how great that is how easy was that very thinly sliced fennel so the next thing I want to slice four oranges just peel the oranges with a little knife and I'm just gonna slice it right onto the salad if it's easier just to slice it right on the board fennel was a very sort of savory taste has really particularly interesting sort of anise flavor the orange is sweet and then the vinaigrette with the lemon is tart so it's great okay so that's three oranges just toss them together okay now I'm gonna make a lemon vinaigrette quarter of a cup of olive oil two tablespoons of lemon juice could be orange but I think these a little bit of tartness depending on the size of the lemon that will either be half a lemon or a whole one okay teaspoon of salt half a teaspoon of pepper just stir it all together okay now I'm just gonna drizzle the vinaigrette right on the fennel normally in a salad I'd wait until I'm ready to serve it but because the fennel is really firm it can handle being dressed right now I'm gonna put a little bit of arugula round the outside it's really great combination flavors it's sweet its tart it's gonna be wonderful with a ham and big boost just a sprinkling of fennel fronds why not use the whole thing look so pretty and that's a really easy salad to go with big beans in him it's time to pack up and go [Music] maple baked beans looks so good and after such a ham and big being dinner it's
