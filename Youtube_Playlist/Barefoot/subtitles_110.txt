this weekend took a little vacation one of my favorite city Chicago I'm here visiting a couple friends who are of course gay florists but even though I'm out of the Hamptons I still can't manage to get my way out of cooking I'm so excited because Jeffrey's finally coming home from a two-month business trip to Mykonos how fun is that he'll be flying in tomorrow so I of course have to have a meal ready and waiting for him the moment he walks in the door this weekend I only have about twenty dollars in my wallet so I decided to make my famous twenty dollar chicken salad that's just out of this world and bursting with flavor it's Jeffrey's absolute favorite I used to be his favorite it's simple it's fresh it's the only reason I'm still married Jeffrey didn't tell me that when he was going to Mykonos for two months he was going to take the good Amex letting me strapped for cash luckily this chicken salad recipe is super easy and simple to make it's four ingredients and then you bind it together neither mayonnaise or cream cheese whatever you have on hand just put it in Jeffrey never puts in Japanese everybody's any meal so let's get started so first we're just going to start with some boiled chicken I've got about a pound of it here and I'm going to slice it up into tiny bite-size pieces one thing I love about Chicago is spending little bakeries I tell them I'm a piano teacher and gain their trust and they get discounts on brioche now the next ingredient is just about a cup of chopped grapes now you want to chop them in either halves or quarters depending on the size but you'll want them very petite mix I was just bag of walnuts already chopped about a quarter of a cup that's a real earthy flavor to that Jeffrey loves nuts he doesn't want you i nuts great now the last thing you'll need is just a red onion I made about half of it and you'll want to dice it actually probably a nice immense will be much better I have to hurry up and finish this before Jeffrey get something I don't see thanks me I'm just kidding Jeffrey never touches you now the last ingredient we're going to use is mayonnaise back in my bag oh that's complete Jeffrey now hi honey where are you dinner's almost ready listen sweetheart my flight got canceled so I'm gonna stay but I made your favorite chicken okay great
