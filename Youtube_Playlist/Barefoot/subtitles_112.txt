[Music] years ago some dear friends of mine had their wedding right here in my garden and I thought wouldn't it be fun to invite them back for an anniversary dinner with their two children same time same place next a letter since we did lamb for my friend's wedding I thought wouldn't it be nice to have rack of lamb for their anniversary party the good news is it's an incredibly easy dish to make it's a little expensive but it's really wonderful so I've got two racks of lamb here that I got at the butcher and when I did this I asked them to French it which actually means to scrape the meat off the bone and to leave just a little bit of fat on the outside so it keeps it really moist so for the coating and you've one and a half tablespoons of kosher salt lots of fresh rosemary two tablespoons of chopped rosemary what you do is just peel it off the stem rosemary is really traditional for lamb and actually sews garlic and mustard so I've combined all three of them together and this it gives it lots of flavor I'm just going to chop it coarsely because it's going to really get pureed in the food processor so two tablespoons of fresh rosemary and three cloves of garlic right inside we're just gonna puree this first this girl's minced now the last two ingredients are half a cup of Dijon mustard and a tablespoon of balsamic vinegar this gives it a little punch we like punch just provide that together [Music] and that's the coding so this is just gonna sit at room temperature until all the flavorings get into the lamb and then I'm gonna cook it a really high temperature 450 degrees for 20 to 25 minutes until it's gorgeous and juicy and rare it's gonna be so good and how easy was that my friend Miguel has come to help me with a table setting for my anniversary party he usually does things totally over-the-top but somehow in this case I think it's really appropriate oh my girl this looks fantastic no you like it oh you've got little lights in there yeah you know for the wedding need some these trees are blooming we put a regular white tablecloth over the table yeah and we're gonna add a few accents do love this is like it's like a veil exactly no actually Janice's dress was like this it was like a ballerina stew - it had sort of a bodice and there's incredible skirt and it looked just like this she's gonna love it I hope so that's what's not to love it's just gorgeous that's fantastic I bet you you can give it to her when her daughter gets her daughter's three and a half now so what's going on the table well I was thinking that everything should be wide yeah yeah so I want to do flowers on your jugs yeah and I'm gonna use your white tulips what you gave those these are French jelly jars oh I get them at flea markets and then we're having also doll candles and I love the way I love the height of all this fantastic Thank You Miguel all right I'm gonna go do my wedding cake otherwise we're not having dessert and I've gone dinner in my table except for my friend's wedding I made them a carrot cake wedding cake and I thought this time since their children are coming wouldn't it be fun to make carrot cake cupcakes so that's what I'm going to do I'm going to start with two cups of sugar one of the third cups of vegetable oil three eggs and it's just one of Anila good vanilla I'm just gonna whisk that together for a while well I get the other ingredients ready so what I have here in the sifter is two cups of flour two teaspoons of baking soda and one and a half teaspoons of salt I'm going to add two teaspoons of ground cinnamon [Applause] this is a great thing to do for entertaining because you can make the cupcakes in advance and the icing in advance and just assemble them before serving and they'll sift all this together perfect and now with the mixer on low speed I'm just gonna put them into the eggs and oil and vanilla mixture those cinnamon smell so good okay everywhere and now I want to do the wet ingredients it's a pound of carrots grated this is the good-for-you part a cup of raisins and a cup of chopped walnuts and what I'm gonna do is just add like a tablespoon of flour to it and that keeps all of these ingredients from sinking the bottom of the cupcakes and now I'm just going to combine the two mixtures I can really smell the cinnamon it's good put these cupcakes on a tiered cake stand so they look like a wedding cake when they're done okay the batter into the carrots it's a great way to get carrots into your children they won't even know the cupcakes are good for them and then after I bake these I'm gonna slather them with cream cheese frosting how bad can that be okay last thing is into the cupcakes my handy dandy ice cream scoop right into the pan one scoop in each and then I'm gonna bake them at 400 degrees for about 10 minutes and then lower the temperature to 350 for about 30 to 35 minutes until they're perfectly done my friends are coming for an anniversary dinner and what I thought would be really great with the rack of lamb is orzo with roasted vegetables what it is is like roast all these vegetables a very high temperature and they get really sweet and delicious and then mix them with orzo which is a rice shaped pasta lemon vinaigrette feta fresh basil it's gonna be really delicious [Music] yellow pepper you can use anything you want to have orange peppers that's great [Music] and then the last thing is olive oil salt and pepper give it lots of flavor toss it all together and I'm gonna roast this at a high temperature 425 for about 40 minutes until it's brown and crusty it's colorful it's delicious and it's good for you carrot cake cupcake icing this is my kind of recipe butter cream cheese sugar and no cooking so I'm gonna start with half a pound of butter [Music] it's really important that this is room temperature and not just leave it out for a few minutes before but like really over I leave it out overnight the cream cheese and the butter so it's really like squishy 3/4 of a pound of cream cheese also room temperature so it's nice and soft and just cream them together lightly til they're combined and then add a teaspoon of vanilla and then the last thing is powdered sugar I actually like to sieve it cuz then it doesn't have any lumps in it nothing worse than icing with lumps in it with it and then just on a low speed just gonna put it right into the mixer just stir it together last stir with a spatula get rid of this clear the decks and this is the fun part I send the cupcakes the last one took a Heather okay it's really up to you but I like lots of icing I see a carrot cake is basically a vehicle for the icing and they're gonna be gorgeous [Music] I'm Miguel this is so lovely I'm glad you like that the dream in the middle of the orchard I brought to your plates and silverware this is actually great I love the way to the fridge that little bit of green really sets off the white perfectly yes not through white it's not too white it just is not a wedding after all I'm also do the main course there so now I'm gonna do the final assembly on the orzo with roasted vegetables vegetables are all cooked and they're crusty and brown just wonderful all the juices and it goes into the orzo which remembers the pasta that's shaped like rice okay left to get all the juices and the bits of vegetables and in the bowl it's all the flavor next thing I'm gonna do is make a vinaigrette which is space of the really simple lemon vinaigrette it's about a third of a cup of lemon juice it's gotta be fresh an equal amount of olive oil lots of salt really makes a difference in this remember the orzo doesn't have any salt in it at all so you want to make sure that it really has flavor just whisk it together it's a wonderful vinaigrette for like a ruble and Parmesan or just a simple green salad so support overall the orzo and the vegetables just enough so it absorbs it it's really best to do this when the orzo is hot because then it absorbs all that lemon vinaigrette and then I'm gonna add lots of really delicious fresh things like scallions just gonna chop up some scallions I like to use the white and the green parts but both have lots of flavor I like when you can really see it and taste it you know exactly what you're eating so lots of chopped scallions fresh basil leaves it's a really good summary dish it goes with so many things chicken and lamb and fish make it in huge quantities and it lasted my frigerator for days chop basil putting all my favorite things in this you chop the feta I think it's really good with this what I like to do with feta is actually die said I don't like when it's all crumbled up and makes a salad look messy so I'm just gonna dice it carefully and then just put it in he's really good fed it makes a difference lots of feta and toss it all together all the flavors of the basil and scallions and feta and sweet roasted vegetables and the last thing I'm gonna put on is toasted pignoli so what I've done is heat them in a pan in a dry pan until they just browned I'm gonna put them right on top how great is that oh ok looks so good mmm a little more salt the words are really absorbs the salt it's fresh it's good for you it would be wonderful with a rack of lamb for the lamb looks great all the mustard and the rosemary and the garlic have really gotten into the meat it's gonna be wonderful I'm gonna roast it at 450 degrees for about 20 to 25 minutes and it's a rare and succulent and delicious so for the anniversary dinner I'm doing for my friends I thought with a rack of lamb and orzo with roasted vegetables be really nice to do it very simple first course of asparagus roasted with Parmesan cheese you know the myth about vegetables is the smaller they are the better they are but I really think asparagus that are thick or have so much more flavor and oddly when you roast them I think they're tenderer than those pencil-thin asparagus okay that's done I was gonna put them on the ship down just drizzle them with olive oil toss them around make sure they're nicely coated lots of salt cracked pepper okay into the oven 400 degrees for about 20 minutes until they're just tender well this lamb looks just gorgeous but just to be sure I always have an instant thermometer to make sure it's exactly the right temperature so I want it to be 125 20 and 30 degrees for it to be rare and it's perfect so let thing we're going to do is just cover it for the woman who foil for about 15 minutes and it steams and it gets really cooked a little bit more and it comes out really juicy and rare but you don't want to let it sit 150 minutes otherwise it'll overcook all right oh my god this is great good I like this it's such a good idea yeah we're not using an under cloth so we can see the grain of the wood we're gonna crack a little bit on top yeah gonna use all the things to keep it even more simply because I'm gonna use this for the cupcakes and I thought I'll tear them with flowers coming down and some ivy and I thought we really look like a wedding cake but since it's for children to find out the couple yards there's more babies please yeah it's much more playful okay what's next champagne cuts okay I can do that last think about is this something Beckett you cannot have an anniversary dinner without something can't do it this looks so fabulous they're gonna be so shocked I can't wait till they get here hope you like it okay got one last thing to do for dinner this is really my kind of simple food Parmesan cheese on the roasted asparagus into the oven for another 60 seconds and I think okay everybody asparagus with parmesan will you do great this is a perfect setting and it's just the best it really is when they have that huge tent and everybody was singing and dancing it was really fun it was wonderful [Laughter] I'm glad I never quite understood what asparagus were because when my mother made him so everything's ready for the main course for my anniversary dinner its rack of lamb and orzo with roasted vegetables and the good news is already this is going to be just so great I love what everything's prepared in advance and all we have to do is put it on the plate so this is the orzo which is the rice shaped pasta and it's got all the wonderful roasted vegetables and scallions and basil and feta and pine nuts can be really good I thought it'd be really nice to do some fresh basil on the top right on top maybe a few leaves just to give it that look so and now the best part the rack of lamb pretty hot this looks perfect oh it smells so good and smell all the mustard and rosemary and garlic oh it's just perfect pink and juicy that's a bone doesn't go easily all you have to do is just wiggle your knife and it'll come out perfectly yeah it looks so good I think this is finger work and I get nice and rare like this this is definitely more than enough for six people but I love people to feel the pain of seconds all right a little garnish since there's rosemary in it I thought a little fresh rosemary and we're ready for dinner [Laughter] [Music] [Laughter] now I'm going to transform these cupcakes into a wedding cake it's actually looks more complicated than it is so I just take roses and cut them pretty short and then maybe some flowers or leaf something like that and just put it on the top so a little champagne all ready to go and some candles and we've got an anniversary celebration [Music] with your name [Music] [Laughter] [Music]
