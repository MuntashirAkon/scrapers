I'm making golden roasted Cornish hands so the first thing I'm going to do is my cornbread stuffing for the Cornish em now they have to stick of unsalted butter it's four tablespoons and one cup of chopped onion about half of a large yellow onion I'm just going to cook it for a few minutes until the onions are translucent the next thing I need is one stalk of celery I'm going to dice it and add the celery to the onions and butter so they cook just a little bit visibly 1/2 a cup of chicken stock cornbread stuffing is really classic Thanksgiving thing I like really simple ones but you can always add sausage or chestnuts whatever you like the hard part here is scaling it down so that I can make enough for two Corner shams so I'm just guessing I need about two and a half cups of corn bread crumbs okay so the corn breads all crumbled up then add the celery and onions chicken stock right to the bowl okay a little parsley would be good and maybe a little salt and pepper to taste stir it up make sure the cornbread absorbs all the butter and onions and parsley all the flavor okay time to stuff these guys so these are two Cornish hens and I put them on a bed of onion so the onions cook with the Cornish and and fill each one Cornish hens are really like little chickens so they cook the same way but in less time these guys take about 35 to 40 minutes to cook its had their little legs together the whole point of time with things together is to make sure everything is very tight and it cooks evenly and then just tuck the little wings underneath so they stay tight okay and then order for them to Brown you want the outside to be very dry it's a little paper towel and you can put a little bit of butter or olive oil on the outside it really helps it Brown nicely and keeps it moist salt and pepper okay when to roast the 425 for about 35 to 40 minutes until they're brown on the outside and juicy and tender inside not the smell wonderful and nice set of onions I'm just going to test it see if it's done if you cut between the leg and the thigh and the juices run clear it's done and I'm going to cover a little as well for about 15 minutes it retains all the heat and the juices and the flavors right back into the cornerstone keeps it nice and warm for dinner gorgeous little Cornish hen a little bit of onion and you won't believe how delicious they are [Music]
