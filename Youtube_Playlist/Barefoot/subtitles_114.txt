I [Music] [Music] I'll use any excuse to throw party when my friends Michael and gym at bridgehampton floor has told me it was a 20th anniversary at the store I thought that's a great reason for a celebration Michael's going to set the table right in the store and I'm bringing dinner how fun is that to begin I'm making bruschetta is with roasted pepper and gorgonzola to serve with a glass of champagne then a light but delicious chicken salad Veronique with a tarragon sauce and green grapes plus a french-style potato salad with lots of green herbs and for dessert the best chocolate cake in the world from Michael's grandmother's recipe I love a party in a store after hours it's like being kids led into the candy store and this one has great flowers for decorations [Music] chicken salad Veronique it's like chicken salad but elevated to party food I thought Michael and Jim would really like it so the first thing i did was i roasted chicken breasts olive oil salt and pepper for 35 minutes at 350 degrees and it really makes the chicken so much moisture than poaching it let it cool little bit take the skin off so i'm just going to cube this i don't want too small but i want sort of bite-size pieces are perfect oh just right into the bone chicken still a little warm which is a great way to make the salad and then it really absorbs the flavor once it's cold it's firmer and it doesn't absorb the flavor so much so chicken salad Veronique I think comes from probably so Veronique which is classically made with grapes chicken has so much more flavor when it's roasted than it does when it's poached there's something about the water that just takes all the flavor out of it and there's something about the olive oil salt and pepper that gives it flavor so I think for tonight I'm going to do for chicken breasts ok now for the sauce so first have a cup of mayonnaise I'm going to put it right into the bowl and toss it all together okay now some green things so first how are gone which is a really delicate herb want to have tablespoons of fresh tarragon leaves this really is the place for fresh herbs just going to chop it up it's most wonderful I think you've really underused or tarragona okay the next thing is celery in the category of lots of green things gonna run my knife right down the middle leave it attached on the top and just okay right in I'll do two stars or celery it's about 1 cup of salary but the good news is you can do as much as you like okay that should be just about 1 cup and now comes the varunee part green grapes so I need about 1 cup of green grapes cut in half or make sure you see the scrapes nobody wants to be crunching their chicken salad this cell is sit very well too because all the flavors the tarragon will really get into the chicken and the sweetness of the grapes okay that's it for the grapes a little salt and pepper we're gonna have teaspoons of salt I know it sounds odd to have soft and grapes together but really brings out the flavor of them 1 teaspoon of pepper cross it all together and that's chicken salad technique I have been buying incredible flowers from Michael and Jim for 20 years can't wait to see you soon the table and what do I think it end Falls orange roses or orange tulips thank you so much a nice day bye good night perfectly took potato now Americans think of potato salad is being drenched in the mayonnaise dressing French potato salad has a vinaigrette with lots of fresh shirt and love it so cook the potatoes for about 20 to 30 minutes into the perfectly tender whoo and my secret are really perfectly cooked potatoes is drain them and then put a clean kitchen towel right over it and all the steam gets really into the middle of it and they end up perfectly cooked so I'm going to make a vinaigrette for this potato salad first thing I need is some fresh lemon juice 2 tablespoons it's barely half a lemon [Music] two cloves of garlic it is French after all it's got it lots of flavor so when the potatoes are a little cool that we slice them and I'm going to soak them with white wine and chicken stock and all that flavor gets really into the potatoes it's wonderful ok to close the chopped garlic right into it half teaspoon of Dijon mustard two teaspoons of salt three quarters of a teaspoon of pepper and two-thirds of a cup of olive oil which we just drizzle and very slowly while I whisk it it'll make a nice to take vinaigrette okay that's done next time we'll slice the potatoes and mix it with lots of fresh green herbs [Music] you [Music] hmm okay almost done with the potatoes so there's three pounds of potatoes perfectly cooked you can use small white potatoes red potatoes Yukon Gold potatoes if you can find them ok so the potatoes are still a little warm and then put a splash of white wine but two tablespoons on top when they warm the white one really soaks in two tablespoons of chicken stock if all made it's always better mmm I can smell the white wine when it hits the warm potatoes so I need 3 tablespoons of parsley ok ok 3 tablespoons that's about 3 tablespoons right in 3 tablespoons of fresh tarragon leaves seems to be a theme here tarragon is not used very much it's kind of a much more subtle herb than those that's sort of almost like an anise flavor pull them off the stems chop them up ok that's about 3 tablespoons right into the potatoes and then just to give it a little heat got a quarter of a cup of chopped red onion a little spice don't want a to settle and this you want to mince them because you can be really eating raw red onion weren't really sort of finely minced right in about making salad just toss everything in one bowl and mix it up and let the flavors blend it's not like baking where you don't know whether it's good until it's done just go toss this all together see they've completely absorbed this looks pretty good actually okay vinaigrette with mustard and garlic good olive oil just enough so it soaks in see I'm just mix it hmm Michael on come on I'm so used to doing this for other people sending their table during their flowers now I get to do it for myself I hope I'm is pleased with what we're doing it should be a fun evening I thought I'd surprise Michael engine with a cake for their anniversary party so it's one in three-quarters cup of flour let's if all the dry ingredients together two cups of sugar and then sip some right into the bowl mixing bowl this is a chocolate cake with chocolate buttercream it's got three quarters of a cup of cocoa powder dark chocolate cocoa powder I'm smell so good so chocolaty okay one teaspoon of baking powder 2 teaspoons of baking soda it helps it rise one teaspoon of salt I'm just going to sift all these together so the method of this cake is to sift all the dry ingredients together in a cloud of chocolate and then I'm going to slowly mix the wet ingredients into it okay as the dry ingredients just going to mix them on the mixer until their combined okay now for the wet ingredients the first thing is a cup of buttermilk I always shake it it does settle make sure it's well mixed so I'm going to do it in a measuring cup it'll be easier to pour into the cake batter so I mean one cup of buttermilk half a cup of vegetable oil two eggs just beat the eggs a little brands of the wet ingredients I use extra-large eggs once it's pretty good vanilla really important when you're doing chocolate okay just going to combine these and then with the mixer on low i'm just going to put it into the dry mixture and then I have secret ingredient or i should say Michaels grandmother had a secret ingredient this recipe calls for a cup of hot brewed coffee and I always think coffee is really important for chocolate it wants to taste really chocolatey and that's exactly what this does right into the mixture ok let's go scrape down the paddle make sure it's really well mixed okay I'm clear the decks I've got two 8-inch cake pans I live in the parchment paper butter and flour pressures on it has to be good because Michael knows exactly what it is he actually served this cake to me once at dinner and I just begged him for the recipe I didn't have to bake very hard well make sure they're pretty equal size okay into the oven 350 degrees for 35 to 40 minutes and then we're going to cover it with the easiest most delicious butter can ever seen [Music] so since the chocolate cake is really just a delivery system for really good chocolate buttercream this cake has one of the best I've ever had so the topic 6-ounce is a really good semi-sweet chocolate and I'm just going to melt the chocolate in a bowl that I've said over simmering water and the meantime going to start the rest of the buttercream so I need two sticks of butter half a pound at room temperature just going to beat that on medium speed okay the next thing I need is one extra-large egg yolk and a teaspoon of good vanilla extract okay i think the chocolates going to be ready by now let's see take this off the heat and just let the chocolate cool while I turn the cakes out the great way to take cakes as just wrap it on the bottom and a board like that and then very often they just cannot beautifully perfect question comes off just added to the butter and vanilla so I've got two teaspoons of hot water I'm just going to put a tablespoon of instant coffee powder which is a very intense coffee just melt this together and pour it into the buttercream okay and I'm just going to whip it for a minute make sure it's really well blended no turn on low and they're all this gorgeous chocolate the chocolate is actually cooled now a little bit you know want to pour hot chocolate into butter otherwise the whole thing will melt let's know the chocolate and the coffee together little hint of vanilla and that's Michaels grandmother's chocolate butter time I think he's going to be really surprised not look gorgeous mmm and now we're going to put it on the cake in the second layer top side up so it's nice and rounded like an old-fashioned cake second-quarter cream I see a cake just go over it very gently start from the top and work your way down the sides at the parchment give a little piece of parchment paper on the plate to keep the plate Queen ok so now I've got buttercream on all sides of the cake I'm just going to go up and down the sides and good news about an old-fashioned cake is it supposed to be a little messy and then I'm just going to smooth the top just sort of big swirls okay just going to take the parchment paper route just run my knife right along the edge and the paper just comes right out [Music] I can't wait to deserve I always like to serve one small thing with cocktails not ten different things that take forever to make with just one really good tasting thing so for Michael and Jim's I thought I'd make bruschetta and what their sketch of means is grilled bread I'm just going to roast it in the oven is a little olive oil salt and pepper and then I'm gonna make a delicious very Italian tapping okay i need about 18 slices of a sheet pan I just find it with parchment paper because it's easier to clean so okay 18 slices just a new brush with olive oil and then afterwards I'm gonna make a wonderful topping sauteed peppers and creamy gorgonzola so good together salt pepper okay into the oven 375 degrees for about 7 to 10 minutes and then have delicious crisper it but my topping on [Music] so now for the good stuff the topic for the bruschetta so I'm going to make sautéed peppers just going to saute them quickly an olive oil salt and pepper a little bit of sugar actually to caramelize them just to touch you won't even taste it you can do strips of peppers just for color I did one yellow pepper in one red pepper okay so I'm just going to get the olive oil hot and then with the peppers in saute them for about 12 to 15 minutes while those cook them Lee get some other things together for the topping [Music] well these peppers are looking so good nice and brown I'm gonna caramelize them just a little more teaspoon of sugar in I know that sounds unlikely but it really gives them a really nice caramel color flavor and you'll never notice it okay a few more things quarter of a cup of chopped basil that never heard anything two tablespoons of capers drained just cuz it for a minute or two okay time to assemble them the toasts out of the oven and okay each toast a little bit of pepper ok first basil a little bit of cork and so on and then as soon as i'm done i melt the gorgonzola on the up and don't think that's terrific [Music] okay into the oven 375 for two three four minutes just until the gorgonzola starts to melt and then I'm going to pack everything up and take it off to Michael engines this looks amazing doesn't it I kind of surprise for you but you're not allowed to open I can't can't be don't even luck okay buddy stuff from the car grease right back it's amazing this cat's a beautiful person gorgonzola there Santa Thank You years thank you okay chicken Veronique beautiful herb potato salad that's almost beautiful all these different shades of green we'll have a surprise here I know you know it's a cake but I bet you don't know what cake it is person that made me this cake was my grandpa quintessential chocolate cake I wonder if the second size is going to be as good as the first speak the third fortune here's are 20 years of flowers and chocolate cake and orange too [Music] [Music] I'll use any excuse to throw a party when my friends
