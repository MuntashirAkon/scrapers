[Music] everybody hates moving it's really fun to have a new house but then you realize you have to pack and unpack everything you've ever owned in your life my friend Greg Gayle just moved into a new house so his friend Allison and I decided it would be really nice to make him dinner and have a lovely housewarming celebration for him to start we're serving fresh radishes with golden slices of toasted French bread slathered with fresh herb butter then the most comforting dish of all mac and cheese but made really special with lots of good cheddar and Gruyere cheeses and for dessert homemade peach raspberry short cakes piled high with fresh fruit and whipped cream it's gonna be a casual night with comforting food and knowing Greg the first of many wonderful parties of his house first I'm gonna make us mac and cheese which is traditional mac and cheese with the volume turned up so to make real mac and cheese as opposed to the stuff in the box first thing I want to do is make a bechamel sauce which is really a fancy word for white sauce so I'm going to heat one quart of milk and then in another pan I'm gonna melt 6 tablespoons of butter and add half a cup of flour and cook them together for about 2 minutes while I'm whisking it you don't want the butter to burn this piccata sauce using a gret time it sounds fancy and French but it's perfect for mac and cheese okay now I just want to slowly add the hot milk and you'll see the whole thing becomes a really nice little white sauce add it whisking thank you I bet forget so we just dump it all in okay there that's fast and now off the heat it's gonna add some flavorings tablespoon of salt it seems like a lot but remember we're putting a lot of pasta in this half a teaspoon of pepper and half a teaspoon of nutmeg just sort of a classic Breton seasoning I thought would be really good with mac and cheese just whisk it together I actually think nutmeg brings out the flavour and the cheese which brings me to the next thing cheese lots of good cheese the first thing I'm going to do is put in 12 ounces of good swiss curry air it's a really nutty cheese and it's wonderful and mac and cheese and just going to take off the rind and then I'll show you a really fat me you can do this by hand with a grater if you want to but if you have a food processor it's really fast so take the grating disc just like this and then there's a post that goes on it that goes in your food processor then the top goes on it's a little bit of a process but when you see how fast it is you'll know why now isn't that amazing one more piece okay well if he's left over for the cook the second cheese I use is cheddar and I'm gonna use 8 ounces of good cheddar so I'm just gonna cut this in half and left your cheddar let's just sharp and got lots of flavor and do the same thing last piece then that would have taken a lot of time if I'd done it by hand lots of cheese okay then I'm gonna put the cheese into the sauce she isn't a song but that's why it tastes so good now okay just stir it in you don't want the heat on in this process cuz you want the cheese to melt when it's mixed with a macaroni you don't want to burn the cheese burnt cheese but so I'm going to combine this now with macaroni which I cooked actually I use cup of toffee you can certainly use macaroni but covet Happy's like that and I just thought it's a little more special for a party so put that in the bowl add the sauce [Music] it's got a pound of macaroni or cava toffee okay mix that all together but this looks like enough for crowd my experience everybody loves it so they eat a lot so import this into a dish and I'm gonna do sliced tomatoes and bread crumbs on the top here's a nice little crunch and delicious flavor with them so it really is macaroni and cheese but for a party okay into the dish how bad could that be so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take two probably two tomatoes I'll see how they take the little cores out he's a good Israeli tomatoes and they're on the vine and I cut them with a bread knife it really helps when this all bakes together the tomatoes get baked into the mac and cheese it's just wonderful so just right on top really simple and one trick is you never want the tomatoes in the refrigerator it really destroys the flavor perfect okay never break crumbs so maybe about five slices of bread just cut the crusts off cut these in pieces and then put them in the food processor with a steel blade and just were it up I just do it enough so the little crumbs but not so it's all stuck together two tablespoons of butter okay just love that one of the breadcrumbs just mix them together the butter really helps the breadcrumbs brown our nice Brown top okay right on top of the tomatoes and the mac and cheese I'm gonna bake it at 375 for 30 minutes and it's gonna be bubbly and delicious and next I'm gonna make Shortcake's real old-fashioned food and I think Greg's going to love it [Music] continuing with the theme of comfort food Alison I thought it'd be fun to make peach raspberry short cakes for Greg so I'm gonna put the short cakes and Alison is gonna buy the fruit so to make the short cakes you need 2 cups of flour 1 tablespoon of sugar a little sweetness tablespoon of baking powder make it rise and a teaspoon of salt to give them lots of flavor I'm putting this in a sifter just to combine them ok so this goes into the mixer fitted with a paddle attachment you can also do this by hand but it's great if you have a stand mixer one and a half sticks of butter unsalted butter you want to be really cold because you want to see bits of butter through the dough and just turn the mixer on very low and just mix it in the butter until it's like the size of large peas you don't want to totally blend it it's really important when you roll with a dough out like making scones that you can see the butter because when the heat of the oven hits the butter the moisture evaporates and it makes them light and flaky otherwise you end up with hockey pucks nobody needs hockey pucks with peaches and raspberries and while that's happening I'm gonna watch it carefully better than a mix of eggs and heavy cream 2 eggs and a half a cup of heavy cream and that's gonna be the liquid in the short cakes just beat these together a little bit half a cup of heavy cream two eggs yep perfect mix these together and then she's very quickly pour this in and you'll see it'll pull together to be a dough it's very wet and sticky it's ready okay now flour the board marbles really good for any kind of stone because it stays cold you want to use lots of flour with this because it's really sticky I usually get this all over myself and the kitchen now one good thing is you can actually make these early and bake them off before you're going to use them okay just pet it after three quarters of an inch make sure you can always get the dough to move around otherwise when you cut them you won't be able to get them off the board so three crows of an inch it's easy to tell because that's usually about an inch so have an instant measure and I use a fluted cutter if you have a plain one it's just fine dip it in flour and just cut it out these look like they're gonna be light and flaky I can see butter throughout them one good thing about this is you can make the dough early and bake them before you're gonna serve them after you've cut them out you can pile up the scraps really carefully and Pat them out again and cut more so I'm gonna bake these and then when they're cool we're gonna split them in half and fill them with lots of whipped cream and fresh peaches and raspberries thousands buying the fruits so we'll assemble them together okay last one cut it out this recipe makes six to eight depending on how thick the shortbreads are okay little egg wash so they Brown nicely it's one egg beaten with tablespoons of water or milk or cream whatever you have I've tested lots of different ways and it doesn't really make any difference a little bit of sugar give it a nice finish okay 400 degrees for 20 to 25 minutes and they will be puffed and brown and gorgeous [Music] [Music] so last but not least the fruit we need raspberries and pitches I know once told me that's the best way to choose a good peach is to get a little smell and squeeze it just gently to make sure that it's right great I set a theme of comfort food but now we're jumping from the United States to France classic children's sandwich when they get home from school is radishes and butter on bread and I just thought it'd be fun to make that into an order so what I'm going to do is I'm taking slices of baguette french baguette and they kind of forget that you can find it's fine I'm gonna toast them but I'm gonna make an herb butter and then serve it with fresh radishes it's surprisingly delicious and just light enough for cocktails so just nice places of french bread and they bake a little better if you do it on a baking rack I'm gonna bake them 350 for 10 minutes until they're just a little crisp and golden brown and then I'm going to take them to rags and serve them with radishes and butter okay into the oven 350 degrees for it 10 minutes I'm gonna be nice and crisp and golden enough of the earth but so with the radishes and toast for udders I'm gonna make an herb butter that I'll give it extra special flavor so the first thing I need is a quarter of a pound of butter at room temperature and I'm gonna add all kinds of fresh green herbs scallions just about wanting to have teaspoons of fresh scallions and if you have different kinds of herbs like basil it's fine use your imagination it's a very simple recipe I'm using the green of the white part of this guy but I think the green looks really nice in this it's a little milder it doesn't have to be exact just the way you like it to taste I use unsalted butter because I like to control how much salt it is different kinds of salted butter have different amounts of salt and I can never tell whether it's too salty or too sweet or what a little bit of dill mmm that smells great right in a little bit of fresh parsley never you have in the garden or the refrigerator I use flat parsley here but you can use curly parsley whatever you have around this is hardly in the exact recipe okay why don't I have teaspoons of fresh parsley half a teaspoon of salt give it lots of flavor pinch of pepper and a little squeeze of fresh lemon juice give it a little freshness try and keep the seeds in and extra flavor with seeds and just mix it together how easy is that I think when I serve it I want to take a big platter and put the radishes with salt which is a classic French thing and then maybe I'll put the herb butter on the toast and everybody can help themselves Alison is up to right now [Music] so when ina and i divided up the jobs she took all of the cooking so I told her I could at least make the cream for the short cakes one cup of heavy cream 2 tablespoons of sugar now all I have to do is get this into the fridge so the last thing I have to do before I head off to Gregg's is a ranch a nice platter of the radishes and toast with our butter so wash the radishes you want to leave the tops on they look great and just take those little roots off you can always use red radishes like these which is just delicious but if you can find white ones Icicle radishes they're candy striper radishes they're even better really delicate flavor and then because it's great to have salt with radishes I'm gonna put french sea salt it's actually a really special one called fleur de sel on the platter but few radishes around it and so people can dip them in the salt that they like to they can use kosher salt the sea salt is a very soft flavor be wonderful with this and then I'm gonna take the herb butter and just butter the toast I love appetizers like this where it's really just assembled more than anything else I wouldn't exactly call making herb butter cooking I'm so happy to do this for Greg he's just been such an incredible inspiration for me and he's fun too last one now I'm off to Greg's and Allison and I are gonna make this scrumptious peach raspberry shortcakes [Music] i slaved over these I hope you enjoy them it's their herb futons or toasts and just it's the radish in salt okay Greg Allison I have to finish dinner we'll be right back don't have any fun until we get back okay I'm gonna miss y'all good that's good okay I'll say two more things to do before dinner first one is that peach respiration shortcake I mean if I show you how to do one of them and then I'll put you in charge you're doing all of them all right so I made this short case you just cut them in half a dollop of cream and then fresh peaches with a smell so put these peaches and you got me a Rugel for Sarah yeah that's great Oliver Oh fantastic some raspberries [Music] and put that good is that look it's really easy how's that you're on your own thank you I'm gonna go make the arugula salad okay okay Alison got me gorgeous babe you look fabulous this is lesson temporary perfect so I'm just gonna put in a big bowl maybe mix-up push you got great olive oil vinaigrette in the world [Music] this is splash of vinegar [Music] [Music] I'm gonna do is put it in the bottom of the ball okay but with pasta oh my gosh I can really taste the green really tested this is really good well it's really pasta with cheese does that customer to cheese's you ready for dessert the guest of honor Alison makes a mean whipped cream you basically did the hard work great where you have one raspberry shortcake these like biscuits they are they're biscuits whipped cream and peaches and raspberries Alison the Baker we do yeah it really makes a difference is it that sort of layered flavor yeah Greg Greg Marinovich so many houses and moves into so many houses I just hope I'm invited to all of them I'll be bringing dessert how's that
