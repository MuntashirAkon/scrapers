coconut cupcakes are one of Stephens favorite desserts I'm gonna make them for his birthday so 3/4 a pound of butter and 2 cups of sugar the next step is the eggs and this recipe calls for 5 eggs so one and a half teaspoons of pure vanilla extract and one and a half teaspoons of pure on the Dex tract and now I'm going to put together my dry mixture and a wet mixture that are gonna go in alternately I'll show you so I need about 3 cups of all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon of baking powder 1/2 a teaspoon of baking soda and 1/2 a teaspoon of kosher salt and the next thing is buttermilk so I've 1 cup of buttermilk I want to turn the mixer on very low speed and I want to add the quarter of the flour until it's just mixed in remember when start doing the flour you don't want to over mix it a third of the liquid ingredients another portion of flour until it's just mixed in another portion of liquid ingredients this is going to make a really moist delicious coconut cupcake and then the last ingredient is coconut so it's 7 ounces of coconut that goes right in you can actually do it on the mixer I like to do it by hand and it's just perfect and then we're going to add more coconut to the top with the icing this is my secret for making coconut cupcakes every single one is exactly the same size ice cream scoop just a regular a standard ice cream scoop and you fill it up so it's sort of overflowing like that and then you plop one in each and that they're gonna rise a little bit but not so much so that's exactly the size you want them so they're gonna go in the oven 325 for about 25 minutes until they're done and then I'm gonna ice them so that's a pound of cream cheese and 3/4 of a pound of butter 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract the good kind and 1/2 a teaspoon of almond extract these are the two flavorings in the coconut cupcakes so really has the same kind of flavoring just combine it like that and now the last ingredient how easy is this is one and a half pounds of confectioner sugar on a very low speed I'm going to very slowly I had the confectioner sugar to the cream cheese butter and flavorings and that's it so you want lots of icing on top because it's the yummy part of this and then the final touch is coconut so I'm gonna start then you're gonna keep going lots of coconut right on the top how we understand from eating them before the party more coconut never too much coconut [Music]
