[Music] I love Italian food simple its earthy and it's so delicious my friend Rolando is coming to visit he has a company that imports the most amazing Italian products pasta wine olive oil I thought I'd make him a nice Italian dinner in the garden and I know he's going to bring some new products for us to taste we was have such a good time together my friend where London better Monday is coming for dinner since he's obviously Italian I want to make a really Italian dinner for him so we're gonna start out with a white bean soup that's pureed it's really good and then a leg of lamb with rosemary and garlic on the top and it's cooked over potato so it absorbs all that great flavor and then for dessert I thought it'd be very Italian to have fresh fruit with a mascarpone cream on the top so for the soup first thing I did was I soaked the beans overnight there are a lot of reasons why you do it but the best one is that the beans actually cook better if you do that so I'm going to drain them it's a pound of white beans okay now I have some onions cooking it's about 4 cups of onions that have been cooked in olive oil for about 10 to 15 minutes until they're sort of translucent and that's when I have the most flavor for soup and then because everything Italian that's garlic in it I'm gonna put two garlic cloves in this is the way to peel garlic really easily just / tuning up on it and hit it and the peel comes right off and you know since we're pureeing the soup I'm just gonna throw it in home and it just cook it for about 2 minutes until it gets a little softened it's beginning to smell good it doesn't even have white beans in it yet okay so next I'm going to do is just put the white jeans in just put them right in and then two quarts of chicken stock via KHOU many chicken stock it's always better but if you need it in hurry good canned chicken stocks just fine and then lots of seasoning two teaspoons of salt a lot depends on how salty the chicken stock is and 1/2 teaspoon of pepper and then fresh rosemary and this is secret when you're doing soup just put the whole stock in and then at the end I'm just gonna fish the stem out and the rosemary will be right in the soup and Bailey's if you can get good fresh bay leaves they're wonderful so then I'm just going to raise the heat bring it to a simmer and I'm gonna let it cook for about 30 minutes until the beans are really tender and everything's very flavorful and then I'm going to put it through a food mill which will make it a puree but not like baby food it gives it lots of great tech certain can be delicious and I think Rolando is bringing some good olive oil so we're going to drizzle it on top before we serve it I'm very good but now I need more rosemary [Music] fresh rosemary love it it's gonna be great with the lamb rosemary actually doesn't last the winter in East Hampton so I always plant one plant and then what I like to do is dig it up in the winter and bring it into the house so it makes the kitchen smell great old winter this is actually very cool dish because what you do is you marinate the lamb with rosemary and garlic and then you roast it over a bed of potatoes so all those juices from the lamb and the rosemary and the garlic get into the potatoes it's so good so first thing I'm gonna do is get my lamb big lamb so what I did was I asked the butcher to bone a leg of lamb but just to leave the end of the sort of the shank end in and it just gives it a little better form this is one big like lamb really and it's trimmed and tied okay now for the marinade so the first thing I'm going to do is have a better tablespoon of fresh rosemary and again you just want to slide your fingers right down the stalk and just take any tough stems out that should be that that should be bad enough remember rosemary is really strong with flavored you don't want too much and about six cloves of garlic that's gonna go into it so usually I do this in a food processor I'm not big on specialized equipment but this little mini food processor is so useful for tasks like this so I'm going to put the rosemary and the garlic and tablespoon of salt teaspoon of pepper and about two tablespoons of melted butter right into this little processor this is gonna puree it it's gonna make a lot of noise too how's that pretty easy okay now I'm just going to put this rub it right onto the lamb and it's just going to infuse the lamb with great flavor and then when it's roasted over the potatoes the flavor the potatoes - Oh smell that garlic and rosemary I know it seems like a lot of salt and pepper but it has to season the entire lamb and the potatoes so that's just gonna rest on the meat for about 30 minutes while the flavors really get into the lamb I'm really good I'm gonna let that sit while I wash my hands [Music] and after the potatoes the herb roast is like a pound this is going to be so good all the juices from the lamb and the rosemary and garlic cook right into the potatoes they just absorb all that gorgeous flavor okay best potatoes and Italy is a little unusual I'm going to put in six cloves of unpeeled garlic so right in with potatoes the olive oil make sure the potatoes brown nicely and then right on top this gorgeous leg of lamb with rosemary and garlic now I'm going to roast it at 450 degrees which is really hot it's gonna be great and it'll be about an hour and a quarter to an hour and a half and then I'll take the lamb at later and let it rest for about 20 minutes it's gonna be really good for dinner so well that's cooking that's gonna be good understand sinister rosemary white bean soup I do have a rosemary thing going here don't I that's okay we like rosemary so the soups been cooking away for about 30 minutes and I think the beans look like they're just done just pick up one bean and squeeze it and if it's soft its soft and hot it's done I take out the stem from the rosemary that's all that's left and the bay leaf nobody needs to eat that and then I'm gonna put it all through a food mill and it's gonna come out really coarse and delicious and a lot of texture that way right from the pan if you don't have a food mill you can always use a food processor or even a blender but they end up much more pureed and unlike the texture of this and a food Mills not really very expensive so this is really a low-tech food processor okay the last you have to do this in a few batches with a food mill the handle always goes in one direction and then you turn it the other way to clean the blade and then start again and you don't have to go to the gym that day okay I think that's it so when I do is I'm gonna heat it up later and when I serve it a little bit of drizzle of olive oil always helps so this is actually pretty thick almost sort of like a vegetable puree so when I heat it up I'm gonna add a little chicken stock before I serve it okay I'm gonna let that sit while I go get the table ready it's really not a party until the table set I bet I can find something in the garden to put the middle the table what about choice [Music] that's pretty cool [Music] now is plenty honey I made dinner in the kitchen but you know I looked outside and the orchard was in bloom I thought why not just drag the table outside so here I am I'm always dragging this table everywhere wherever it's pretty that's where I want to be simple country plates simple glasses everyday silverware what to mix it up and it's my trick about how to put a napkin in a basket so at the end stay up so you take the napkin and then fold it in the middle and in the middle of the other way and then you have the really pretty edges to standing up for the bread oh and the flowers [Music] cuz I'm [Music] so I thought it's a leg of lamb and be nice have an unusual vegetable roasted fennel roast doors actually carry this now and it's an anise flavored vegetable which I'm not that crazy about when it's raw but when it's cooked it's really delicious it's one of those vegetables that I'd like to cook it a really high heat so it gets sort of brown and caramelized on the outside and it's just moist and really tender on the inside and then after I've roasted it I'm just gonna hit it with some Parmesan cheese and it gives it really good spiciness just be sure you cut it right through the course of the wedges stay together okay that looks good just going to olive oil salt pepper put it in the oven it's going to roast about 400 degrees for about an hour until it's really crusty and brown strip meant great flavor salt and pepper toss it together clean hands most useful kitchen tools how fast is that and into the evidence would be really good for the lamb [Music] so since we're having an Italian dinner I thought it'd be very Italian to have fresh fruit for dessert but of course you know I have to make it a little richer than math so I'm going to make a little sauce for it with mascarpone which is like an Italian cream cheese it's very thick and very rich I'm gonna flavor it maybe a little honey to give it a little sweetness just a bit of tablespoon tablespoon and a half oh it's good and messy I'm about quarter teaspoon of vanilla just a little drop of it and then since I love when something looks like what it is and a little bit of vanilla seed in it so you take a vanilla bean a great flavor and just run your knife right down the middle of it and you'll see there are these black seeds inside and if you just take the tip of your knife and just run it right along the middle of it those little black seeds come out I'm just going to put it right into the honey vanilla mascarpone I'm just smashing around so a little too thick I think I'm gonna need a little heavy cream for it I think a few tablespoons of heavy cream will make it thin enough so it's a thick sauce okay it's really sick mmm this looks really good and you can really see the vanilla staging that's gonna be perfect for dessert with fresh fruit so I think the land might be done so what I'm going to do is take it out put it on a platter and just let it rest for about 20 minutes some big way we're just going to cover it with foil to keep it warm and this allows the juices to get back into the land it's gonna be good [Music] I think the fennel might be ready to turn also yeah that's a little brown on one side and I think my friend Rolando is bring some really good parmesan so we put it on top okay back of the oven until it's nicely from [Music] yeah Rolando perfect timing nice sweetie I'm so so happy to see you listen I always come with incredible gifts do you think that's enough bread spread for the two of us I don't know it's a cheap barter about that okay tobacco your three different types of olive oil that hopefully you can use three different ways in your kitchen oh I think I have an olive oil tasting what do you think right okay cool now the reason why were you three different types of olive oil is because I thought that you could use them in three different ways in your kitchen one is for cooking yeah it would be nice cooking this one might be a lighter one but it would be not too powerful and too spicy so that you could taste your food when you're cooking it and the other one it would be a much more delicate one for like cooking or making pesto or making you know a roasted fish yeah the other one the last one is an unfiltered olive oil which would be really good for you to use only as a condiment as what we call in Tuscany attest a Tuscan ketchup is like we only use it like on the table oh so you would like to present your bread or use it in your salads all right I'm gonna pour a little bit in each one this is the one that you can use and every sort of like in when you make one nice hearty tomato sauce or you know something then which the olive oil will be just an emulsifier okay and this other one is a little bit more flavorful as well that comes from Liguria where near the Italian Riviera so there the olives are harvested in January so it's a little bit milder okay and this one and this one as we will see it alert green almost and this one is another filter olive oil so it's a very rich flavorful way to taste this now when you taste olive oil you always wanted one of the things that always you know we can talk about in Italy is that the most important thing is color is a very sign of quality and it's very important that when you have olive oil you should have them in dark green bottles light is a very bad enemy of olive oil really taste the olives in that it should be like an olive oil McClarty and all just being negative olives it's intense it's incredible and that's lighter one that's amazing okay now this one is a very nice flavor for you know grilled fish or making pesto this is the one day it's actually a little rounder in a funny way isn't it it's a little sort of softer more aggressive yeah so good so this is the really good one and this is the last one that I value that it's an unfiltered olive oil and because it's unfiltered you will taste more of a network's type of more the olives so we'll be tasting more like artichokes or just like artichoke it's wonderful it's a really good flavor and it's sort of um it's actually a little bit earthy err mm-hmm it's wonderful you know we have I'm making a white bean soup for you and I don't think a drizzle of this olive oil motherfucker I can't wait ha when we [Music] limbs been resting for about 20 minutes so it's perfect and I've taken the strings off and now all I need to do is carve it nice thing about this is it's boneless so you can really slice it anyway and be really good I'm just going to serve our big platter with all the vegetables together so it's a little bit of fennel so don't we need some parmesan on this Sun fennel fantastic okay so how much can white bean soup [Music] and maybe a drizzle of olive oil on the top I'd say well apartment so I'm gonna take this out you want to take the soup you like my chive plan what a perfect so what do you say in Italian buon appetito one uppity no you say much better than I do though so how long have we known each other I think it's already 10 years at least 10 years right please no Rolando has this incredible company manicotti that imports fabulous Italian products like pasta and all the olive oils in parmesan and just incredible and we had an incredible time it took us on a tour of Sicily that was way too much fun so much fun hmm I hope you like the suit it's really good the combination of the earthiness of the beans for the grassiness of the olive oil well I used olive oil on the potatoes and the garlic and the fennel a little bit on the lamb it's a very olive oil night so what did you use as a rap well it's absolutely garlic and rosemary it's a very simple thing but it really seasons it she looks delicious and really tastes great okay so you can make some ribs I mean tomorrow yeah I think we're gonna have lamb for a long time are you ready for a nice Italian dessert whatever nice I've made fresh fruit with a mascarpone sauce well that sounds perfect stay right here and I'll be right back okay into the bowls big dollop of mascarpone cream which has honey and vanilla in it and dessert is ready the most important thing to me about fruit salad is that each fruit tastes really good and the mascarpone is really delicious because sort of like bites and all together yeah well I mean it's kind of like olive oil anything with mascarpone others better right for next to tell you an adventure it's gonna really good let that sit well I wash my hands [Music] and after the potatoes the herb roast is like a pound this is going to be so good all the juices from the lamb and the rosemary and garlic cook right into the potatoes they just absorb all that gorgeous flavor okay that's the potatoes the next things a little unusual I'm going to name six cloves of unpeeled garlic so right in with the potatoes the olive oil make sure the potatoes brown glynn nicely and then right on top this gorgeous leg of lamb with rosemary and garlic I'm going to roast it at 450 degrees which is really hot it's gonna be great and it'll be hour and a quarter to an hour and a half and then I'll take the lamb at later and let it rest for about 20 minutes and be really good for doing so well that's cooking that's gonna be good I'm taking the rosemary white bean soup I do have a rosemary thing going here don't I that's okay we like rosemary so the soups been cooking away for it's gonna roast about 400 degrees for about an hour until it's really crusty and brown it's got that great flavor salt and pepper toss it together clean hands most useful kitchen tools how fast is that and into the oven it's gonna be really good with the lamb [Music] so since we're having an Italian dinner I thought it'd be very Italian to have fresh fruit for dessert but of course you know I have to make it a little richer than math so I'm gonna

tip of your knife and just run it right along it's gonna be great with the lamb rosemary actually doesn't last the winter in Easthampton so I always plant one plant and then what I like to do is dig it up in the winter and bring it into the house so it makes the kitchen smell great all winter [Music] this is actually very cool dish because what you do is you marinate the lamb with rosemary and garlic and then you roast it over a bed of potatoes so all those juices from the lamb and the rosemary and the garlic get into the potatoes so good so first thing I'm gonna do is get my lamb big lamb

years at least 10 years right please no Rolando has this incredible company manicotti that imports fabulous Italian products like pasta and all the olive oils in parmesan and just incredible and we had an incredible time it took us on a tour of Sicily that was way too much fun so much fun hmm well I hope you like the suit it's really good the combination of the earthiness of the beans for the grassiness of the olive oil I bet I can find something in the garden to put the middle of the table worth a shot [Music] that's pretty cool [Music] I was planning on having dinner in the kitchen but you know I looked outside and the orchard was in bloom I thought why not just drag the table outside so here I am I'm always dragging this table everywhere wherever it's pretty that's where I want to be simple types of plates simple glasses everyday silverware let them mix it up and it's my trick about how to put a napkin in a basket so at the end stay up so you take the napkin and then fold it in the middle and in the middle of the other way and then you have the really pretty edges too standing up for the bread oh and the flowers [Music] how's Emma [Music] so I thought with a leg of lamb and be nice have an unusual vegetable roasted fennel most stores actually carry this now and it's an anise flavored vegetable which I'm not that crazy that one it's raw but when it's cooked it's really delicious it's one of those vegetables that I'd like to cook it a really high heat so it gets sort of brown and caramelized on the outside and it's just moist and really tender on the inside and then after I've roasted it I'm just gonna hit it with some Parmesan cheese and it gives it really good spiciness just be sure you cut it right through the course of the wedges stay together okay that looks good she's gonna olive oil salt pepper put it in the oven it's gonna roast about 400 degrees for about an hour until it's really crusty and brown it's got great flavor salt and pepper toss it together clean hands most useful kitchen tools how fast is that and into the oven s can be really good for the lamb [Music] so since we're having an Italian dinner I thought it'd be very Italian to have fresh fruit for dessert but of course you know I have to make it a little richer than math so I'm gonna make a little sauce for it with mascarpone which is like an Italian cream cheese it's very thick and very rich then I'm gonna flavor it maybe a little honey to give a little sweetness just a bit of tablespoon tablespoon and a half oh it's good and messy I'm about quarter teaspoon of vanilla just a little drop of it and then since I love when something looks like what it is and then put a little bit of vanilla seed in it so you take a vanilla bean like a great flavor and just run your knife right down the middle of it and you'll see there are these black seeds inside and if you just take the tip of your knife and just run it right along the middle of it those little black seeds coming out I'm just going to put it right into the honey vanilla mascarpone I'm just smoosh it around so a little too thick I think I'm a little heavy cream for it I think a few tablespoons of heavy cream will make it thin enough so it's a thick sauce okay it's really sick mmm this looks really good and you can really see the vanilla safety that's gonna be perfect for dessert with a fresh fruit so I think the land might be down so what I'm gonna do is take it out put it on a platter and just let it rest for about 20 minutes some big wing we're just going to cover it with foil to keep it warm and this allows the juices to get back into the land there's gonna be good I think the fennel might be [Music] I love Italian food simple it's earthy and it's so delicious my friend Rolando is coming to visit he has a company that imports the most amazing Italian products pasta wine olive oil I thought I'd make him a nice Italian dinner in the garden and I know he's going to bring some new products for us to taste it wasn't such a good time together my friend where London better Monday is coming for dinner since he's obviously Italian I want to make a really Italian dinner for him so we're gonna start out with a white bean soup that's pureed it's really good and then a leg of lamb with rosemary and garlic on the top and it's cooked over potato so it absorbs all that great flavor and then for dessert I thought it'd be very Italian to have fresh fruit with a mascarpone cream on the top so for the soup first thing I did was I soaked the beans overnight there are a lot of reasons why you do it but the best one is that the beans actually cook better if you do that so I'm gonna drain them it's a pound of white beans okay now I have some onions cooking it's about four cups of onions that have been cooked in olive oil for about 10 to 15 minutes until they're sort of translucent and that's when they have the most flavor for soup and then because everything Italian that's garlic in it I'm gonna put two garlic cloves in this is the way to peel garlic really easily just Petunia leaf on it and hit it and the peel comes right off and you know since we're pureeing the soup I'm just gonna throw it in home and it just cook it for about two minutes until it gets a little softened it's beginning to smell good it doesn't even have white beans in it yet okay so next I'm going to do is just put the white jeans in just put them right in and then two quarts of chicken stock get homemade chicken stock it's always better but if you need it very good canned chicken stocks just fine and then lots of seasoning two teaspoons of salt a lot depends on how salty the chicken stock is and 1/2 teaspoon of pepper and then fresh rosemary and this is a secret when you're doing soup just put the whole stock in and then at the end I'm just gonna fish the stem out in the rosemary oh be right in the soup and Bailey's if you can get good fresh bay leaves they're wonderful so then I'm just going to raise the heat bring it to a simmer and I'm gonna let it cook for about 30 minutes until the beans are really tender and everything's very flavorful and then I'm going to put it through a food mill which will make it a puree but not like baby food it gives it lots of great textures could be delicious and I think Rolando is bringing some good olive oil so we're going to drizzle it on top before we serve it it's very good but now I need more rosemary [Music] fresh rosemary love it it's gonna be great with the lamb rosemary actually doesn't last the winter in East Hampton so I always plant one plant and then what I like to do is dig it up in the winter and bring it into the house so it makes the kitchen smell great all winter this is actually very cool dish because what you do is you marinate the lamb with rosemary and garlic and then you roast it over a bed of potatoes so all those juices from the lamb and the rosemary and the garlic get into the potatoes it's so good so first thing I'm gonna do is get my lamb big lamb so what I did was I asked the butcher to bone a leg of lamb but just to leave the end of the sword of the shank end in and it just gives it a little better form this is one big like lamb really and it's trimmed and tied okay now for the marinade so the first thing I'm going to do is have a better tablespoon of fresh rosemary and again you just want to slide your fingers right before I used olive oil on the potatoes and the garlic and the fennel a little bit on the lamb it's a very olive oil night so what did you use as a rub well it's actually garlic and rosemary it's a very simple thing but it really seasons it looks delicious really tastes great okay so you can make some British anaemia tomorrow yeah I think we're gonna have lamb for a long time are you ready for a nice Italian dessert whatever night I've made fresh fruit with a mascarpone sauce well that sounds perfect stay right here and I'll be right back okay and to the boys big dollop of mascarpone cream which has honey and vanilla in it and dessert is ready the most important thing to me about fruit salmon is that each fruit tastes really good and the mascarpone is really delicious because sort of like binds them all together yeah well I mean it's kind of like olive oil anything with mascarpone honors better right we're next to tallien adventure it's gonna really good let that sit while I wash my hands [Music] and after the potatoes the herb-roasted like a pound this is going to be so good all the juices from the lamb and the rosemary and garlic cook right into the potatoes they just absorb all that gorgeous flavor okay that's the potatoes and it seems a little unusual I'm going to put in six cloves of unpeeled garlic so right in with the potatoes the olive oil make sure the potatoes brown glynn iceland and then right on top this gorgeous leg of lamb with rosemary and garlic now I'm going to roast it at 450 degrees which is really hot it's gonna be great and it'll be about hour and a quarter to an hour and a half and then I'll take the land met later and let it rest for about 20 minutes it's gonna be really good for dinner so well that's cooking that's gonna be good I'm taking the rosemary white bean soup I do have a rosemary thing going here don't I that's okay we like rosemary so the soups been cooking away for it's gonna roast about 400 degrees for about an hour until it's really crusty and brown it's got that great flavor salt and pepper toss it together clean hands most useful kitchen tools how fast is that and into the oven s can be really good with the lamb [Music] so since we're having an Italian dinner I thought it'd be very Italian to have fresh fruit for dessert but of course you know I have to make it a little richer than that so I'm gonna make a little sauce for it with mascarpone which is like an Italian cream cheese it's very thick and very rich I'm gonna flavor it maybe a little honey to give her a little sweetness just a bit of tablespoon tablespoon and a half oh it's good and messy I'm about quarter teaspoon of vanilla just a little drop of it and then since I love when something looks like what it is and then put a little bit of vanilla seed in it so you take a vanilla bean a great flavor and just run your knife right down the middle of it and you'll see there are these black seeds inside and if you just take the tip of your knife and just run it right along it's gonna be great with the lamb rosemary actually doesn't last the winter in Easthampton so I always plant one plan and then what I like to do is dig it up in the winter and bring it into the house so it makes a kitchen smell great all winter [Music] this is actually very cool dish because what you do is you marinate the lamb with rosemary and garlic and then you roast it over a bed of potato
