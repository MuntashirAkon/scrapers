[Music] cocktail party 450 sounds done one thing doesn't it I wanted to do a book party for my friend Edwina fun girl but it really didn't want it to cost a fortune so we've asked a friend to bartend Edwina is ordering the rentals and I'm gonna do very easy orders that I can make all by myself wait you see it we this house it's so beautiful and I'm hoping for really gorgeous day [Music] so when I'm doing a really big party of a few rules for myself the first one is I make really easy orders the second one is they make things that I can do in advance and the third one is I don't make too many things so for doing this party I'm gonna make cheddar and chutney sandwiches I'm gonna make some tuna tartare some smoked salmon tea sandwiches and then as everybody leaves they're gonna get a wonderful cupcake with a flower on the top so the first thing I'm gonna make is the smoked salmon tea sandwiches and I have to make herb butter for it so if you need to make our butter you need a lots of butter this is two and a half pounds of butter but it's gonna make probably more than 100 tea sandwiches you want room-temperature butter because I'm gonna mix this with lots of herbs and seasonings and if it's cold you'll never be able to mix it so two and a half pounds of butter yikes I'm gonna put in about a tablespoon of garlic want this to have lots of flavor quarter of a cup of chopped scallions I use the white and the green parts because not only do they both have flavor but I love that the green you can see the green scallion in the butter about a quarter of a cup of fresh dill so just run your knife along the stems like this you learn to pick up every leaf and just chop it up roughly you love the smell of fresh dill and then I'm gonna make cupcakes with a fresh flower on each one since Edwina's book is called fresh cuts about flowers I thought it was totally appropriate and then a quarter of a cup of fresh parsley so this has lots of green herbs and I just think it gives the butter really fresh sort of spicy kind of flavor and it complements the salmon beautifully okay about a quarter of a cup of fresh parsley and we just need some salt and pepper about one and a half tablespoons of salt remember it's a lot of herb butter makes a lot of sandwiches one teaspoon of freshly ground pepper and then the last thing is unusual in butter but I think it really gives it a great flavor is the juice of one lemon I'm just gonna do it through a strainer so I don't end up with any seeds in the butter if I'm doing a lot of lemons I'll use a legit but just for one this is perfect okay get all the lemon juice now I'm just gonna put in the mixer and just compile it until it's next that looks great hey nice sharp bread knife Saturday night really works [Music] [Music] nice big tray I'm just gonna put it on the tray and when the butter is chilled it's gonna be very firm cut off the crust and cut in half two tea sandwiches I'm just gonna keep going and I think edweena's at the rental company now love doing a party with her let's see could we start with the silver platters sure I'm going to need 14 of them right here typical tray that I'm I usually loves so you also need some glasses yes we do glass it all the time glass beautiful we gave you 150 okay thank you you're very welcome and that's the last one okay I'm gonna show you my trick about storing them so you can make them before the party and they'll stay really fresh so I'm gonna take damp paper towels and cover the bread and then wrap the tray really tightly and it keeps the sandwiches really fresh you don't want to wake this don't want the bread wet you just want it damn just enough so you can't wring it out and then unfold it neatly and put it right on top of the top row of bread just like that make sure it's all covered just like yeah okay and I'm gonna wrap it in plastic wrap really tightly to make sure it's completely covered the best way to do that is to have the plastic wrap go completely around the bottom otherwise it really won't stick very well just pull it up on the edges make sure it's completely surrounded plastic wrap sticks to itself better than anything else so this is the way to do it okay and into the fridge and then at the party I'm gonna cut them in triangles and put them on beautiful silver trays they're gonna be really good and now we're gonna make cupcakes [Music] except for the cupcakes I've already got tuna quarter sticks of butter three cups of sugar and three eggs I need three more eggs I always crack eggs into a separate bowl just in case you get shell or bad egg don't ruin the whole batter just add them one at a time so this is gonna make 24 cupcakes and I'm gonna make two batches make sure it's all really well mixed butter the eggs the sugar this is why these cupcakes are so good one cup of sour cream sour cream really makes it moist yes again one and a half teaspoons of good vanilla extract and my favorite smells mix the vanilla in okay now for the dry ingredients the first thing is three cups of flour let's regular all-purpose flour two three third of a cup of cornstarch cornstarch actually lightens the batter it's a little like having cake flour but I find cake flour really hard to find so cornstarch is good teaspoon of salt and a teaspoon of baking soda this is what's gonna make it rise and then just sift it all together perfect that's the dry ingredients I just run my hands through it make sure it's really well mixed before I put it into the butter and sugar and eggs okay then I'm just gonna put the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients this is the point where you don't want to over mix it so the flour doesn't get tough on low speed just very slowly add all the dry ingredients to the butter and sugar and eggs no lumps okay crash take the beater out I'm just gonna stir it by hand with a spatula and they sure it's really well mixed these are just muffin pans you can buy in the hardware store and I just put paper liners and they're so easy to get out ice cream scoop is great for making cupcakes everyone comes out exactly the same size [Music] so into the oven 350 degrees for 20-30 minutes and then later I'm gonna ice them with cream cheese frosting to find some flowers for the cupcakes and pansies seem like a good idea the icing is white so we have cupcakes you gotta have icing so I'm gonna make a cream cheese frosting for these cupcakes something nice and light so I'm gonna do a pound of butter remember it's a lot of cupcakes found in half of cream cheese you want all the butter and the cream cheese at room temperature I actually leave it out overnight just to make sure it's really room temperature otherwise it's gonna be lumpy nobody need to add the icing this can be enough icing for my first batch of cupcakes 24 then I'm gonna make it again okay pound of confectioner's sugar I actually love to sift the confession of sugar because I don't want little sort of lumps of sugar and the icing it just takes a minute but it really ensures that the icing smooth and creamy okay so while the mixer is on low just putting on the sugar okay and some vanilla got one and a half teaspoons just make sure it's smooth and creamy and it's done ready to ice how do those look just smooth it around with a regular knife [Music] you this is so easy it doesn't even need a recipe hey there's a little brioche Ross that my friend Eli Zabar makes I love them I'm gonna fill them with chutney and a slice of cheddar and that's it and they're so good so I'm gonna put a dollop of chutney on each one and a slice of cheddar put its a little hat back on that's ready for the party this is a mango chutney but any kind of sweet and sour chutney is good how easy is that a love party de brie our sandwiches are done and the last thing to make is fresh tuna tartare what you see this it's great when you go to the fish store to ask for fresh tuna ask for sushi grade tuna you want a center cut piece and it shouldn't have any fishy smell at all so I've sliced the tuna in quarter inch slices and now I'm gonna make quarter inch dice so it's very small pieces but it's not really minced after I've marinated this in the lime juice marinade I'm going to add all kinds of flavorings and seasonings like scallions and chili peppers did a little heat and then I'm going to add diced avocados which gives it great flavor and texture so that's four and a half pounds of fresh tuna so now for the marinade do you want to have cups of good olive oil okay one more in one cup of lime juice don't even think about using the bottle kind is that's of six fresh limes a lot of zest but it's gonna give a lot of flavor a tablespoon of wasabi powder which is really really really hot Japanese horseradish generally don't use the tablespoons this is a lot of marinade next is soy sauce 3 tablespoons of soy sauce which is really the salt in it wanting to have tablespoons of Tabasco which is more heat but remember it's a lot of tuna now okay that's good salt and pepper that's two tablespoons of freshly ground pepper okay I'm just gonna whisk that together it's really just like making a very spicy vinaigrette just gonna pour it over the tuna just mix it together mmm that's pretty good already okay now I'm gonna add some other great things why don't have cups of chopped scallions lots of scallions a quarter of a cup of chili peppers they're really hot but they're good mix those in now I need about six diced avocados right into the tuna just mix it in a little bit just make sure the lime just gets to the avocado to keep it from turning brown about two tablespoons of sesame seeds on top so it's really lots of Asian flavorings and seasonings a little California avocado thrown in and then later after it's marinated at the party I'm gonna serve it on the cracker I'll let it marinate for about an hour in the refrigerator [Music] oK we've got lots of stuff okay what do you have the perfect cheddar and chutney sandwiches smoked salmon sandwiches and how about if you and I come back and get the rest okay Leon's house is so perfect today and these are the pan oh these are gonna be so wonderful on our cupcakes oh I can't wait okay more thing Stan's in the car and since it's your party you get to get dressed okay okay the last thing I have to do is just put everything on trays so my little chutney sandwiches I get a whole stack of silver trays from the rental company just make big trays of things this is a little brioche sandwiches with chutney and cheddar they're gonna be really good no don't think I'm gonna stack them I think they look perfect just like that so those are the four your sandwiches and then we're gonna do the smoked salmon tea sandwiches okay let's see how these guys look it's gonna be wonderful so now what I want to do is just take the crusts off they're nice and cold so they're really firm and easy to cut it's easy to do and I think it really looks nicer and then each squares just gonna be cutting a triangle I just put right down the track so these are vanilla cupcakes with cream cheese icing so I kinda told me and I'm going to put these little panties on that we bought yesterday to look like a meadow so I thought maybe if they appear to sit they have just kind of blown in not too many so these adorable little things are just for decoration they're not to be eaten and then just before everybody gets here and we make the tuna tartare it's amazing how the lime juice keeps the avocado food turning brown and it also cooks the tuna and a few trays outside so people come out enjoy this incredible view a little cheddar and well it's gonna refill some plates we've got friends handing out orders everybody chips friend even Venus is doing the bar I'd say the great things are going to penalties enjoying themselves and that's ready to go out thank you I'm so glad you came Edwin I think we did a great part
