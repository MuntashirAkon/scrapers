today food is brought to you by Walmart find gifts groceries and more this season 841 we're back with today food and christmas has come early around here because the Barefoot Contessa herself Ina Garten is back her new cookbook cooking for Jeffrey is already a best-seller it's filled with her husband's favorite recipes and this morning we're making one of the ones at the top of his list ina nice to see you can I say something and I mean this and we've got tasters downstairs already we love all the chefs who come on this show yeah but you make us like Pavlov's dogs we hear your name we start salivating oh really you're just fantastic I'm always looking for remembered flavors but they taste better than you think so I think they're familiar it's not like octopus eyeballs with with a sauce or something why we're gonna get to the ingredients in a second why does Jeffrey like this dish so much it's chicken but it's got great flavor it's got lemon and onion and that becomes the sauce so it's just it's just a very simple dish and it's so easy to make it home what kind of herbs we talking about fennel thyme lemon onion garlic that's it that's it yeah but it's so good let's set the star thing I'm gonna do is make an urn herb oil I've got fresh thyme in here and I've got um fennel seeds a little salt and pepper lots of salt and pepper actually because you want to see isn't it and then I'm just gonna grind them together and put them into how does this little grinder work I know it I think that's the other way the other way when you know how to do this right okay go just brine them together and then just put them into this oil and we're gonna season the chicken with it so you're really not using the oil with yeah with great flavor and then that goes into the chicken okay are we marinating this chicken and we let it sit in this no we're good cooking in it okay absolutely so next thing is I have a skillet a black skillet which is great cast-iron and what I'm going to do is I'm going to cut up a lemon and put it right in the bottom just thin slice lemon like that so you can cook the chicken on top of the line top of this so we've got it's already done we've got the lemon the next thing I have is onion I'm just gonna put the limit onion right on top this is like so easy and garlic are you putting the garlic I know that's right let your finger smell like garlic and then I'm just gonna put the chicken on top so I'm get a whole chicken I've got a whole chicken and when I did was I had the butt butcher butterfly it so it's very easy to cook when it's like this so I'm looking at something are you gonna be able to get some kind of a crust on this chicken because all this is going to create steam isn't it it's well actually what's going to happen it's gonna create the sauce with the juices from the chicken and then it's gonna cook in a high temperature so it's gonna get really browned on top guys that's the key what do we think it's just like you said it's extra special it's so good and the broccoli rabe roasted broccoli crazy way to get to that okay I'm gonna make this herb oil and just brush it on the chicken okay butterfly side up yeah the bottom up and then I'm gonna turn it over I'm gonna show you what I'm gonna do so then turn it over like this just right on top of the onions and the garlic do you need more of this on that side yeah are you in charge okay Pat it dry because that's the way you get browned if it's wet it'll just steam it's exactly what you said that's it just just brush it right on top and then this pan goes in the oven 450 degrees we're just really hot for 30 minutes and then I'm going to take it out and pour a little bit of wine I'm not going to do it now we're going to do it after 30 minutes around the pan put it back in the oven for 15 minutes and voila this is what it comes out look how does a pebble and it's way faster and it's like so easy to do so and the lemon and the onions become the sauce so except for the little blender here yeah we've done everything in one hand in one pan okay I think I'll mention the broccoli is just broccolini or broccoli rabe but I love and Brocklin I love to roast vegetables it's so simple all you do is olive oil salt and pepper into the oven high temperature just like that pepper I do squash like this I do tomatoes like this everything and how long's our smacking see under the heat how long for the last longer 20 minutes 30 minutes something like that until it's really brand and this is the way it comes out the chicken comes out like that right and the broccolini comes out like that all right you need a little nama know that you're tasting out so tender I can do it with my fork coated just in case I end up with a mouthful here will you read the tease I will but by the way this broccolini tastes like potato chips crunching brain it's delicious it's tender and that was a whole nail right yeah delicious meat a little testy yeah good all right part is going to be by the way with Kathy lien and myself a little bit later so we can't wait to see that not wait to see what I'm gonna make what are you making what is it King fresh fig preserve
