[Music] I think this any dish I've made more than Parmesan chicken so for a mystery guest I have no idea what they like I'm going to try something really safe everybody loves this so the first thing I want to do is make the crust for the chicken I'm going to do a cup of flour teaspoon of pepper and teaspoon of salt so mix that all together totally flour egg and bread crumbs I need two eggs a tablespoon of water beat this together and then the bread crumbs I need a cup of bread crumbs I use seasoned bread crumbs you don't have to make your home make sure they fresh though that they haven't been sitting in the pantry for a long time and Parmesan cheese which is why it's Parmesan chicken so for the parmesan I'm just going to use actually ground Parmesan and for this it has to be very finely ground so that it distributes itself really well on the crust so I'm just going to chop this up put it in the food processor and I just grind it up [Music] half-assed attack I just need a half a cup right into the breadcrumbs I'm just going to miss out together now for the chicken and they pound it so it's tenderized and it's actually very even so it's time for rolling pin simply pepper really fit okay that's done time to cook the chicken tablespoon of butter tablespoon of olive oil and I'm going to take each chicken breast first dip it in the flour make sure it's completely coated shake it off dip it in the egg and water and then dip it in the breadcrumbs and Parmesan cheese okay right into the pan let's cook it for bit two to three minutes on each side [Music] okay this is nice and brown on this side just going to turn it over that looks good okay perfect browned on that side you can tell if the chicken bounces back it's perfectly done on to the sheet pan [Music] okay into the oven very low oven 200 degrees and they'll just stay warm until we're ready for dinner well that's a crowd I don't want to leave for too long so I'm glad I did the Parmesan chicken in advance so the first thing I do is make lemon vinaigrette I need a quarter of a cup of fresh lemon juice half a cup of olive oil just salt half a teaspoon of pepper just whiz it nicely watch letters that I washed it in advance take for the vinaigrette on and that's going to go on the chicken so the hot chicken and the cold salad the great combination all I have to do is plate up the chicken cold salad on the top shaving a parmesan and I'm back to the fun
