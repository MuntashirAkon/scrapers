[Music] when my husband Jeffrey comes on for the weekend I try and make lots of things in advance so I can spend time with him instead of spending time in the kitchen but I hate to cook for two so I'm gonna call my friend TR pest gun and tell them I'm cooking for four and he'll have dinner for the weekend - hey what are friends for I'm making individual chicken pot pies that are perfect for a simple dinner but good enough for company plus a healthy wheat berry salad that can sit in the refrigerator to be served any time and split pea soup that can be an appetizer with dinner or Sunday lunch in front of the fireplace plus I'm gonna give TR a list of things to buy for the weekend otherwise you know how men are you'll end up with four chocolate cakes and nothing else to eat well the most popular south we ever made up there for Contessa is wheat berry salad so the first thing I did was cook wheat berries it's the kernel of the wheat and I cooked it for 45 minutes until it was just tender I'm just gonna drain them this salad was actually first made for me by Brent Newsome was a wonderful caterer in East Hampton and an absolute doll too so put these in the bowl and then I'm gonna add lots of things that have lots of flavor first thing is gonna saute some red onions use red onions cuz it's a little sweeter than white onions 2 tablespoons of olive oil heat up the olive oil a little bit and I had 1 cup of finely chopped onion red onion we're gonna cook these for a few minutes until they're tender not until they Brown in the meantime we'll do a little dressing for the wheat berry salad so I need 4 tablespoons of olive oil which is also a quarter of a cup it's great to do the dressing while they're warm because it really absorbs into the wheat berries and 2 tablespoons or half 1/4 of a cup of good balsamic vinegar salt and pepper check my onions what am I'm like a medium-low flame really smelling I'm gonna be great in the wheat berries and then three scallions all kinds of good chopped vegetables whatever you want to do I mean this is really salads are great because you can just make it up as you go along three scallions I use the white and the green parts they both have lots of flavor the Greens perfectly delicious and it gives it a lot of color too I love making this for a weekend because you can just sit in the refrigerator and whenever I need a quick salad or a lunch it's ready the flavors just get better and better as the vegetables and the scallions and the onions all sit together perfect okay I need to go right into the wheat berries toss it together you can see how one that weak berries and the onions are warm really absorbs into the middle of the wheat berry okay three chopped scallions right into the salad get your eyes but it's good half a red pepper I mean if you have a yellow pepper run you can use that too but half a red peppers classic this is one of those great salads you're gonna anything you like if you find something in the refrigerator that looks like it would be good and it just chop it up and try it it's nice to dice this neatly so you get really nice squares of pepper keep your fingers out of the way okay red pepper and some carrot it's not just a healthy salad it's a really satisfying one all the crunchiness and the wheat berries have sort of a nutty flavor and vegetables and the balsamic vinegar is sweet and tart okay in goes the carrot I'm just going to let this sit and marinate let the balsamic vinaigrette get into the wheat berries and the vegetables let's see if this got everything it needs I'm it's just delicious I know why it was one of our most popular salads okay I'm just gonna sit here and I think I'll check in with TR see what he's up to hello hey are you ready for your assignment ready and good to go shopping I do first you're gonna need all kinds of slice cold meats you know like some salami some Italian prosciutto you can pick something else too like a hammer sliced turkey okay cool and then a really decadent dessert because at the end of the day that's all anybody ever remembers well you know me I'm all for decadence and then you'll need some salads I'm not like some heirloom tomatoes or some critters on the vine maybe some salad greens little baby salad greens great thanks for the shopping list mom very funny okay you've got your assignment good luck great I'll see you later bye I love to make chicken pot pies on the weekend because I can assemble them and then bake them off whenever I feel like having them I think we might have a Saturday night but depends on the other weekend goes so the best way to cook chicken for chicken pot pie is to roast it I've tried many different ways but I find if you do it with the bone in and with the skin on it stays really moist and it's the most flavorful so a six chicken breast chicken breast a really good butcher [Music] just rub it with good olive oil just rub the top of the skin keeps it moist [Music] sprinkle the salt this should make probably four pot pies to for TRS party two for Jeffrey and me so into the oven 375 for about 35 or 40 minutes she's gonna be really succulent and delicious next I'm gonna make the filling [Music] potpies I've made lots of them lobster potpie vegetable pot pie I think chicken pot pies the classic except for the sauce what I've done is I've cooked two onions and 1/2 sticks of butter and just for about 10 minutes until they're translucent and then I'm gonna thicken it with 3/4 of a cup of flour just stir it in and cook it for a few minutes just to get rid of that raw flour taste this is really like making a white sauce that actually is making a white sauce and after this cook for a minute or yourself gonna add 5 cups of chicken stock I actually have a little trick for chicken stock even if it's really flavorful you want the entire dish to be flavorful so I'm getting 2 bullion cubes and then slowly pour this into the the white sauce of the room and what that's going to do is really just thinking it I need two teaspoons of salt and one teaspoon of pepper remember this has to be really well-seasoned because it's gonna flavor all the chicken and vegetables and then cuz I wanted to have a little bit of richness I'm gonna add a quarter of a cup of heavy cream just to give it a little extra flavor and to this sauce I'm gonna start by adding lots of great vegetables and the secret is some of them can be frozen vegetables one and a half cups of frozen onions just think I've hard it would be to peel these onions ten ounces of frozen peas not those tiny little seeds one good big size peas and I've pledged some carrots two cups and some fresh parsley and the last thing is chicken so five cups of cubed chicken that have been roasted on the bone with the skin on to keep them really nice and succulent didn't just mix it all up oh this looks great so that's the chicken pot pie filling done and all I have to do is roll out the crust I think TR is out shopping is a very good shopper so I'm gonna get wonderful ingredients [Music] what's this salami here the large one supersonic sopressata yeah that's great like it's uh kind of that that looks delicious that looks I couldn't go well with the shoot there I hope have you tried that before is it good yeah okay and it's just it's what just sun-dried tomatoes on the top marinated with olive oil or something at herbs great now I need the desserts flourless chocolate souffle cake that sounds pretty different excuse me could I get two of these one for me one for yummy okay last part of chicken potpie putting the pastry on I actually made pastry for something else and just froze this pastry so be ready whenever I needed it and they defrost it in the refrigerator you don't want to defrost at room temperature because he needs to stay really cold so I'm just gonna leave dough there for a minute so I'm doing individual pot pies so I'm gonna put them in oven proof ramekins it's filling looks gorgeous big chunks of juicy chicken carrots whole onions now we'll need a crust top so I'm still roll out the dough I'll cut it into fourths now if you don't even have time to do the dough what you can do is get some frozen puff pastry and defrost it in the refrigerator and use that instead it's light it's wonderful and it's really easy so we're just gonna roll each one of these out into a room maybe about an 8 inch round flour everything including yourself move this over a little bit when you rolling out dough to make a round you want to keep turning it roll it from the center out to the edge this is a nice dough you just want to keep it moving make sure it never sticks to the board you can roll it on wood but if you have stone it's even better right on a counter okay now the secret to the dough sticking to the dish it's just a little bit of an egg wash that you're gonna use on the top any way around the edge it makes a little rat so just put the dough on top this obvious little too big and you just want to trim the dough so that it's about half an inch bigger than the bowl doesn't have to be perfect nice country homey rough edge is nice just like that okay and then just stick it to the edge of the bowl and it'll stick because of the egg wash that you put on it now just wash the top so the dough puffs up and it's nicely browned it's gonna be wonderful so when these bake the steam and the chicken pot pie filling will puff up the dough and it's going to turn out gorgeous and then I like to season the top with flaked sea salt so you see it it's just wonderful it's like the sea salt watch out lots of flavor cracked pepper okay that one's done just three more I've been bought the crimping I just press it right down [Music] I'm gonna bake them for an hour at 375 and they're gonna be puffed and succulent chicken tough pies I think we're all gonna have a good time [Music] Wow this actually look like chicken pot pies sometimes I even surprise myself so while those cool I think I'm gonna make some split pea soup okay two tablespoons of olive oil and a cup of onions about one yellow onion let's put the onions in first cuz they don't burn as easily the garlic just mince the garlic finely you know there's no real secret to mincing the only thing you want to do is hold the tip down with one finger and then move the handle up and down otherwise the knife jumps all over the board and it's hard to control now okay girl looks ready okay now some flavors definitely need salt and pepper why don't have teaspoons of salt I use kosher salt one teaspoon of pepper and half a teaspoon of dried oregano can't get that and just stir that around let that cook with the onions I wonder how TR is getting along with his assignment sounds like a secret mission I need a few more ingredients [Music] tomatoes I need some really great tomatoes heirloom tomatoes okay I think gonna pay and I think the onions and garlic are done look here I like this too nice to have something that's actually delicious and I'm good for you I'm gonna add two cups of carrots chopped like big chunks I want this to be really good a hearty chunky soup okay and a cup of diced potatoes nice thing about the potatoes is you don't have to peel them you don't have to bother peel taste is fine let's go cook for a long time and you want to peel anything that small anyway okay right into the pot a cups of good chicken stock this is homemade if you can make it homemade it's really worth it but if not you can find a good chicken stock in the grocery store okay and then we're gonna put in split peas so you can use about a pound of split peas which is about two cups of sweet peas total but I'm gonna only put in about one and a half cups to start with so it makes a really thick soup and they put the rest in right it got halfway through the cooking so you get very chunky just the bite of split peas also so I'm just gonna let this simmer for about 40 minutes it's gonna be a really nice sick to come home to okay I think I've wasted enough time here to miss the worst traffic we've got a couple more things to pick up and then I'm headed out to the heavens so split pea soup is half done looking pretty good so at this point halfway through the cooking I'm gonna add another half a cup of split cheese and what that does is then the split peas they're already in there get really soft and make the soup really rich and thick and then these split peas will cook a little less so they'll have a little bit of bite to them which is really good I like both textures continue to let this soup simmer and just cook it for another 40 minutes it's gonna be rich and delicious it's so good for you and TR wonderfully is bringing me from this city [Music] [Music] I would love to but I have my guests coming dude don't you which is why I cooked all this deathly I made you looking soon hmm and chicken pot pies and we carousel fantastic and I have for you a decadent dessert is there and your favorite since Tiaras brought me heirloom tomatoes I didn't make one of my favorite things for myself for dinner tonight sounds really simple it's tomato sandwich so the first thing I'm gonna do is make a little basil mayonnaise so I'm gonna start with some good mayonnaise got a cup it's gonna make a latke it'll stay stay in the refrigerator and I'm gonna fit it a little bit with some good lemon juice lots of fresh basil maybe one clove of garlic garlic goes right in need some salt pepper just whisk this all together okay next some good bread when they're just a few ingredients want to make sure they're the best ones this is the time for bakery white bread actually okay two slices of bread there's a mayonnaise on both slices redneck is always good for slicing Tomatoes oh so true so cut gorgeous it's inside it's red and yellow fantastic maybe extra basil leaves on top extra flame and I would say that's my kind of dinner without cupcake everything's ready for Jeffrey for the weekend and I'm gonna have a delicious tomato sandwich
