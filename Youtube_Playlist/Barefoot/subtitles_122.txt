years ago my husband and I were having a camping trip in the South of France and I remember seeing this lovely French family having a wonderful meal at a big long table overlooking the Mediterranean and so today I'm gonna try and recreate that well maybe without the Mediterranean well it's not a Mediterranean feast without grilled lamb my friend Miguel is outside doing this incredible table I'm sure it's gonna be gorgeous and totally over-the-top so I'm gonna keep it really simple in here I've asked the butcher to butterfly this lamb and what it is is they take about a whole leg of lamb with a bone in the middle and take the bone out and the whole key is to make the lamb one even thickness so when it gets on the grill it cooks at the same temperature so let's make the marinade I use an organic one but any kind of whole milk or if you want to be good even low-fat yogurt it's two pounds or two pints this one it is just good plain yogurt the first thing I'm gonna do is s this lemon what I use is a microplane which is wonderful it came from the hardware store but it's fabulous possessing lemons it's wonderful for Parmesan cheese the key to this is that you just get the lemon zest which is that bright yellow part and not the white part which is called the pith how's that for a weird word so I love the way this smells you can really smell the lemon so much in the zest I want to put in half a cup of olive oil and I always try and use extra virgin olive oil I'll whisk this in so two teaspoons of salt I like to use kosher so I think it's really softer and pepper and now for the key ingredient which is rosemary I love the way it smells it's really spicy but it can also very easily overwhelm whatever you're cooking pull the leaves right off the Rosemere I'm not going to chop them up because that really releases a lot of the oil from the rosemary and it'll see isn't it much too strongly but this will give a wonderful hint of rosemary in the meat and this just looks wonderful it's all the yogurt and the olive oil and fresh rosemary lemon zest salt and pepper and now the last thing I'm going to put the lamb in this is a really gooey messy part cook's best tools are clean hands and that's what I'm using so you take all the lamb and you put it right into this marinade and yesh mut sit around uh so oh it's good and messy oh it's just wonderful the reason why I'm marinating this is so that wonderful essence of rosemary and lemon get all the way into the meat of the lamb and the longer you marinated the better it'll taste and that's grilled it's gonna be so delicious oh this looks fabulous you like it I love it I think I know your great style but who knew you're an electrician the recipe is so nice and sort of dappled light under here exactly not it'll be gorgeous yeah because you're gonna get all this little color light you know reds and oranges and yellows it's gonna be nice cool okay I'm leaving it to this gorgeous setting and I'm off to the kitchen I'm looking forward to your food a terrific thing to serve with grilled lamb is tabbouleh it's this wonderful salad made from bulgur wheat and then I add all kinds of vegetables to it so this is my kind of cooking I've soaked this in boiling water that's all I had to do and then I added lemon juice salt pepper and a little bit of olive oil and that just the bulgur just absorbs all that wonderful flavor and now I'm just going to add in vegetables okay it got about a cup of scallions the next thing is these cucumbers I like these hothouse cucumbers or English cucumbers much better than traditional ones they're sweeter those traditional cucumbers the rhein can be really sort of bitter so I'm just going to take out the seeds and let's chop it up with the rind and all I love when the salad is really chunky and then you have the flavor of all the vegetables with a little bit of bulgur wheat in it rather than lots of bulgur wheat with just some seasonings okay the next thing is the cherry tomatoes and what I've done is cut them in half so that they're really easy to eat and it sweetens the dish it's they're really good in tabbouleh what I like to do is the classic ingredients but turn up the volume it's about two cups of tomatoes the next ingredient is parsley and this gives it so much flavor okay fabulous looks and I'm going to show you the easiest way to cut up parsley so all you have to do is just take your knife and run it along the edge forget pulling all those little leaves off those stems I need a better cup of chopped parsley and we're going to do this really rough chop so it still looks like parsley and just you can smell it the best way to do this is keep your knife right on the board at the tip and just go back and forth and that way you'll keep your hand out of it although I've got in my hand a few times okay add about a cup right on top of the tomatoes and then the last thing is mint got a big bunch of mint here and the same thing with a min I'm just going to slice the leaves off the stem and again a really rough chop oh god it smells so good mint is one of those things you want to buy because if you grow it in your garden before you know you'll let nothing but mint in your garden now comes the mixing part the more this two boys sits the more the flavors get really blended together salt and pepper and then we taste it and now comes the best part mmm it's almost right to think these a little bit of lemon so I'm gonna just squeeze some more lemon into it big squeeze of fresh lemon mmm and that was C perfect it's gonna be so good with the lamb only the hummus and roasted fruit left to go can't wait for the party and I went to the hummus it's a dip made with the chickpeas it requires no cooking at all and I have most of the ingredients in my pantry first thing I'm gonna do is chop the garlic and there's a terrific way in the food processor to chop them up really fine and through the feet to just drop them in and it minces them perfectly I put four garlic cloves in to start and I'm just gonna put everything else in the food processor the main thing is chickpeas which is the base of this I've drained about two cups which is about a can and none of these ingredients are exact you really want to do them so that they're to your taste just dump them right in and then the tahini TV is great it's a sesame seed paste usually comes the oil is a little collects on the top so I like to mix it up a little bit and it's sort of like peanut butter but it's made with sesame seeds and I'm gonna get a better third of a cup make a nice mess when I cook this recipe so simple because the ingredients all just go right in a lot of Houmas recipes can be really bland I like to just give an enormous flavor by adding lots of lemon juice and garlic and actually salt is an important ingredient so I'm going to put in maybe the juice of about two lemons and we'll save a little bit we can add it later we've got salt I'm gonna start with about one and a half teaspoons of salt and the last thing to just give it some heat is eight dashes of Tabasco it's so important to trust your own tastebuds I mean really just taste it see what you like just because I like it doesn't mean you're gonna like it so it's really important to to do that for yourself it's important to me that it has a lot of texture so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna pulse it until it looks like it's smooth but still has the kind of texture I want I'd say it's a liquid from the chickpeas because I think it's a little too thick and I'm gonna add about two tablespoons of the liquid so we put it into a big bowl the good news about hummus is the earlier make of the better so just before I serve it I'm going to drizzle it with olive oil toss something Yoli nuts on it gonna be so good with pita bread no I think's going it looks great I love it yeah you know I always like to use white plates because then if I don't have enough of one set you can mix them all together but you do right okay fantastic you know we're gonna use this sort of known African glasses for wine right I do these are gorgeous rubbing you bring your West my party so these are the lemonade glasses yes Oh can't wait lots of lemonade untasted and lots of wine exact all right I'm off to do the grill otherwise we're not having dinner a friend brought me this really cool thing you can get in the hardware store mine's obviously been well used it's called a charcoal chimney and you put paper in the bottom charcoal on the top and you light the whole thing and it never needs charcoal lighter fluid so I'll show you how it works two pieces of paper right in the bottom turn it upside down charcoal on the top just go right up to the top and then just like newspaper the bottom why is it the window we supposed to smoke in your face it's guaranteed and now I'm off that's it roasted fruit is really my kind of cooking I'd love to take the intrinsic value of a particular ingredient and cook just to enhance it so that you get the deliciousness of the peaches that I'm going to roast and I'm going to put plums in you get the essence of the plums so I want to cut all these peaches up you can use really any kind of stone fruit for this peaches plums when they're in season apricots are fabulous I'm just gonna cut them all up and this one's delicious I can smell the peaches so I'm gonna cut up about five or six peaches here and put them in my dish I love to bake it in a dish I can serve it and so I don't even have to transfer it one of the great things about this dish is you can make it early in the day it can be served room-temperature it doesn't have to be hot out of the oven so I'm gonna put all the peaches just in one layer next go the plums you can really use any kind of soft fruit with it's mostly the things that have pits like plums peaches apricots but I think it's also delicious with papaya mango anything that will sort of when it cooks it'll get a little juicier I like to put the cut side up so that when it bakes and then when it boils later you'll see it gets nice and brown and caramelize on the top okay we're ready to go I'm gonna put about 1/2 a cup of sugar on the top but it's really your personal preference a lot depends on how sweet the fruit is if it's the height of summer and the peaches are really ripe you don't need quite so much sugar fruits so delicious now I'm not even gonna put all the sugar on and I've done it all in one layer so when the heat hits it it bakes evenly so I'm just gonna get the raspberries to finish you know one of the things about raspberries is don't wash them because they've already been washed they're just perfect the way they are and you don't want to get too much water into it and they've it just takes away some of that flavor okay into the oven 450 degrees a preheated oven for about 20 to 25 minutes until the fruit is just juicy and tender the lamb looks like it's been marinating long enough so it's got all those wonderful flavors the rosemary and the lemon zest and yogurt oh this is the squishy part try and brush up as much as I can because the marinade will catch on fire on the grill see paper towels I have to get it all off but I want to need the rosemary too to burn okay few utensils for the grill and we're ready to go ready to put this on the grill I love the flavor of charcoal it gives really simple food wonderful flavor in fact I'm usually out here in the middle of the winter with my hat and gloves on try to get something charcoal broiled so one of the things I do when I'm char calling is I brush the grill with oil and then it what it does is see it allows that meat to come off and not stick on the grill so that's all nicely oil so it won't stick just slide that right onto the grill love it sizzle so that 20 minutes and I'll be back to check don't you just love fresh lemonade and not that stuff your mother used to bring home from the grocery store but the real thing was made with freshly squeezed lemons it's just really tart and sweet and it's just so delicious one of the other things you can do is roll the lemon on the board and it really just releases a lot of the juice so when you slice it you get more juice out of it I'm gonna juice about 6 lemons it's a better cup of lemon juice that's perfect I just don't lemonade be great with a Mediterranean feast and for those of you I like a little something special you can mix it with vodka and now I need some sugar you know you might think this is crazy but when I go shopping I'd buy two of everything two pastas and two oatmeal's two coffees and that way I only have to shop half as many times so I've got my superfine sugar I think traditionally it's used for drinks like Manhattan's but it's great in lemonade if you don't have it don't worry about it just use regular sugar so that's about three quarters of a cup of sugar and now a cup of ice and four cups of water how easy is that this would be perfect but first we have to taste it oh it's fabulous a perfect balance of lemon and sugar and it's nice and chilled so it's all ready for the party I'm definitely putting back getting mine so let's take a look at this ah it's all bubbly and the peaches look gorgeous just gonna make sure they're perfectly done they're nice and tender now I'm gonna put it on broil for about five to eight minutes until it's nice and brown and caramelized and then I'm going to put some orange juice right on the top the orange juice is going to give a little sweetness but a little acidity so I think it should be done oh that's perfect doesn't look fabulous little orange juice on actually cools it off nicely and it's absorbed into the sauce that the raspberries make and now I have to taste just make sure it's the right balance of all the fruit and then it's sweet and tart at the same time mmm there's all those juices of peaches and raspberries a little bit of sugar it's just perfect let's see how this is doing perfectly grilled on one side flip it over oh that looks incredible really smell the lamb the rosemary and the charcoal well the outside looks fabulous but now comes the really hard part is it done is it not done it's really hard for me to tell and I'm sure it is for everybody this whole restaurant school of testing and does it spring back doesn't it I think unless you're on a restaurant grill all day long it's really hard to tell that way and I'm gonna cheat if the internal temperature is about 120 degrees if you know how to use a meat thermometer it'll help but I wanted to actually come off the grill when it's still a little too rare because it's going to sit and it's going to be covered and it'll continue to cook a little bit but if you cut a little slit right into the meat you can look inside Oh perfect it's gonna be really fun because everybody's gonna be able to put together their own penis sandwiches it's fun for my guess but the secret is I don't have to do it myself good Greek feta is perfect spicy creamy wonderful olives the party's gonna be great tonight all my good friends great food what could go wrong drizzle some olive oil of the hummus and then some toasted formulas on top that was delicious and while the lamps rusting I'm gonna get ready for the party so everybody's outside I slipped away to slice the lamb but I loved about this meal cuz everything's done before the guests arrive all I have to do is slice the meat and we're ready to rock and roll can smell the rosemary and the lemon I took it off a little before it was done it was a little too rare but it keeps cooking when it's sitting under the foil it's just perfect I'm so pleased and should be nice and tender because of the marinade one of the things I feel strongly about is the platter is garnished with the ingredients of whatever the dish is so I'm just gonna take a big chunk of lemon and put it on the platter big sprig of rosemary and that everybody knows it's rosemary lemon what I love about it is that everything's room temperature so it's not like hot it's not cold just is all out it's really easy it's great somebody have Julia tell what should I do if I don't want to use butter she said well you don't like butter just use cream
