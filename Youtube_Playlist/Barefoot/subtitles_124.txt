[Music] we're going to make a main course for the holidays that was festive enough but it would feel like the holidays but also that was simple enough that I could make before my guests arrived so I thought seafood grad Tam it'll be just perfectly a little lobster shrimp fish it's going to be wonderful so first I'm going to make a stock I'm going to cook everything in I have two cups of fish stock two cups of cream white wine okay that should be better Cup okay third of a cup of tomato puree it's actually right on the grocery store shelf in between tomato paste and crushed tomatoes and now saffron to get a little bit of heat so one teaspoon of crushed saffron so I have three things shrimp halibut and lobster the shrimp aren't cooked I bought them already peeled and deveined so they just come just like that and I just think for this grant and it's better if they're cut in half crosswise so you're not eating this huge shrimp so that's what I'm going to do kind of like I'd have really big scallops you don't want one big scallop you want the smaller ones [Music] and this way they still look like shrimp to cut them across they wouldn't look like shrimp okay that's one time two shrimp I'm going to put the shrimp right in just give it a little stir I'm going to cook it just until the shrimp are done and it's really fast like three minutes while they're cooking I'm going to get the next thing ready to halibut so we take the skin off the skin you could actually buy this in a fillet but I didn't I bought one steak so just run your knife right along the bone to remove the bone from the middle of it perfect okay what just great simple 1-inch cubes it doesn't have to be perfect just like that okay by now this shrimp should be done you can tell when they're done when they're really firm and they're just turning pink don't want to overcook them because they get tough I'm going to make sauce out of the stock so we'll use everything okay next the halibut panda pal but right in it's going to cook also for about three minutes one pound of cooked lobster these are beautiful comes in one big piece so I'm just going to cut this in chunks and of course if you don't want to do lobster you can always do it with scallops or just two shrimp in hell of it okay that's the lobster and since it's already cooked it's going to bypass the cooking pot and go right into the bowl with the shrimp and I think the halibut should be done so it's firm and just barely cooked so that's going to go right into the bowl okay so I've got all the seafood together and we'll keep cooking the stock until it's reduced by half about ten minutes now go saute the vegetables we're tablespoons of butter leeks and carrots for about five minutes just until they're tender okay in the meantime I'm going to stick in the stock a little bit two tablespoons of butter and two tablespoons of flour so you just mash them together and I can add it to the stock just stir it in and then I'm going to cook it and it's going to thicken nicely and cream the vegetables look like they're doing really well and another half a cup of wine it's all about getting as much flavor as possible into them in the meantime I'm going to make a topping six tablespoons or butter I use these Japanese flake breadcrumbs which are great you can buy them in the grocery store now and I need two cups they're called panko you can use dry breadcrumbs you really have so much more flavor and texture two thirds of a cup of grated Parmesan - tapping has so much flavor two tablespoons of freshly chopped parsley two tablespoons of chopped fresh tarragon second it's a really delicate flavor it's the kind of thing that goes really well with fish and chicken so about a tablespoon of chopped garlic that's three or four cloves perfect I'm just going to stir it all together for on that melted butter it's going to make a nice crumb topping and so that's the butter and this is really important it not only gives the flavor but it's also going to make sure that it Browns and gets nice and crunchy in the oven so the first thing is the seafood just make sure it's nicely distributed to everybody get some halibut lobster and shrimp the next thing is a vegetable beautiful they are they just starting to caramelize a little bit I'm just going to put those right over the seafood one nice layer looks pretty good doesn't it okay and I'm going to ladle over the sauce just pour it right over I'm just going to pour on enough sauce so it comes up to the sides of the dish and now I'm going to put the crumbs put them right over the top well can't wait till dinner good friends great dinner what more does anybody need you know that looks pretty good just before the party and we bake it at 375 for 20 minutes it's going to be hot and bubbly and crumbly on the top and really good [Music]
