[Music] when I bought their freaking Tesla in 1978 I had no idea how much chicken salad I'd be making but this is the one that Diana taught me with grapes and walnut chicken salad contesta but kind of like chicken salad with a Waldorf salad and the first thing I'm going to do with it because half a cup of pecans half a cup of walnuts just to crisp them up a little bit 350 degrees for about 70 minutes and this just tastes better that way i reversed of the chicken and let it cool a little bit I'm just going to take the skin off i roast it on the bone with a skin on it keeps it really moist so just take this skin off and then cut it right off the bone just cut right around a sharp knife the chicken salad recipes at the store we started with something like 200 pounds of chicken so it's always funny for me to be making chickens out from two chicken breasts but it's just good okay now for the dressing I need to have a cup of mayonnaise half a cup of sour cream it's a very creamy dressing but it's great balance two teaspoons of salt half a teaspoon of pepper whisk it up now I'm going to add tarragon it's a really mild flavored herb just big rough chop okay now most of its going to go in the sauce I'm gonna save a little bit of garnish whisk it up add the chicken big spoon just toss it together chickens really moist the sauce is great okay the person that should be done perfectly comes from the Choson right in so if they have a cup of pecans and 1/2 cup of walnuts and now I need grapes but a cup of grapes cut them right in half just toss them in chickens all it's great for entertaining because you can make an advance to serve it at room temperature okay just toss that all together that's pretty good doesn't like just use a nice butter lettuce it's really delicate just really sets it off I've had big scoop of chicken salad
