it's Friday Geoffrey's coming home tonight just when it's expecting yet another birth chicken I always like to shake it up a little bit so making an old-fashioned Jewish dinner with brisket carrots onions to be really good well that's a big piece of me for two people but it's like making a beef stew it lasts forever and you can reheat it they're making brisket for do big booklet I'll show you how easy it is I'm going to make a rub for the top two tablespoons of salt I know it seems like a lot of salt it's a big piece of brisket 20 tablespoon of garlic chopped up garlic 2 teaspoons of dried oregano and two teaspoons of freshly ground pepper smoosh that all together and then rub it on top of the brisket okay that's appropriately smushed together I'm just going to sprinkle it on the top and then rub it in briskets a great cut of stewing meat to buy when you go to the store make sure you don't buy a corned beef brisket which is the same cut that's already been processed with spices and salt okay that's done I'm going to put on a pound of carrots just chop them up in chunks it's going to stew a long with these would be really good these are big carrot chips how to carrots can be anything from two big carrots to five small ones okay and then eight stalks of celery let's cut off the ends a little bit the brown ends and then just cut it and Chuck remember this goes to four three and a half hours so okay and onions I've got six onions sliced all over the top this already looks like it has a lot of flavor doesn't it and some bay leaves for flavor these are beautiful babies six how's that okay and then I'm going to pour good tomato juice all over the top of it just enough to come up about three-quarters of the way up the beef so just pour it right on top and this is going to make the sauce after it cooks okay now we're just going to cover it and bake it so I'm going to cover it with aluminum foil but first because I don't want the foil to touch the tomato juice it reacts really badly I'll either cover it with plastic wrap or parchment paper into the oven 350 degrees for about three and a half hours it's fork-tender so that was pretty fast for dinner that could see probably ten people but for tonight insist everything [Music] briskets vegetables the whole meal in one
