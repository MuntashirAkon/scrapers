[Music] my friend jack is a fabulous realtor but kind of an inexperienced cook he has some dear friends that he's going to take on a food tour at the Hamptons so we made a plan together I owe him a huge favor so I've offered to make them sandwiches for the beach and a light supper for after the tour I think I'm gonna use a lot of local ingredients from my cooking for lunch I'm making them filet of beef sandwiches with a mustard horseradish sauce that has a real kick for dinner a seafood salad made from shellfish from Montauk and a zesty lemon vinaigrette and for dessert a plum raspberry crumble with local fruit and a crisp oatmeal and almond topping after their tour of the Hamptons and some delicious meals I hope they'll love this place as much as I do [Music] so the first thing I'm going to do for Jack and his friends is make filet beef sandwich with horseradish sauce so I have a half a fillet of beef and we sleep great seasoning on the outside the first thing I want to do is make a a butter you need to use room-temperature butter and mix it with about a teaspoon of Dijon mustard so I'm just going to mash this together a little bit the whole thing about beef is just make sure you get lots of flavor in it thinking about making sandwiches is you can make it with anything that you use as a main course loin of pork with chutney filet beef with horseradish sauce so I'm going to take that have a filet of beef and Pat it dry with paper towels which ensures that the butter is going to stick to it and then all the butter and mustard on the outside this is time to use your hands if you don't mind having messy hands just rub the outside make sure the filet abuse stays really moist when you roast it could have roasted a very high temperature so I want to make sure it's really sort of crusty on the outside and moist on the inside and this ensures that that happens I always like to use the seasonings in the coating that I'm using in the sauce oh there's mustard in the horseradish sauce and it's nice on the filet beef to have two tablespoon of kosher salt just do it really evenly it seems like a lot of salt but remember it's the only flavoring it's really important 1/2 a tablespoon of cracked pepper really evenly over it okay I'm going to roast it at 500 degrees for 25 to 30 minutes so into the oven it's going to be just brown and crusty on the outside and succulent and juicy inside and then I'm going to make sandwiches with horseradish and mustard sauce so the first thing I need is 3/4 of a cup of mayonnaise I just want this to be really flavorful cells for because of a cup of mayonnaise 1/2 tablespoons of Dijon mustard because I like something to look like what it tastes like half a tablespoon of coarse grain mustard and then for a little heat have a tablespoon of horseradish prepared horseradish I should do it two tablespoons of sour cream and just a pinch of salt I'll just mix it together so that's a really easy sauce for filet beef and I smell it I think it's done wow that's perfectly cooked alright let's just test it with Ali thermometer you want to be 120 degrees with an instant meat thermometer it's really easy to do I nailed it okay now I'm going to cover it with aluminum foil so I'm just going to let it rest for about 15 minutes and all the juices get back into the meat that's gonna make a delicious sandwich so Jack and his friends are on their trip I hope they made it can be Cox dairy and what kind of cheeses is hard this one is called macaques sunrise yes I named it because of the color beautiful it's so good we should bring some to Hina yeah so this via connect that thank you are good to see you good to see you enjoy the cheese country symbols with sandwiches Blasi horseradish sauce love this bread cuz it's just filled with all kinds of grains and you can see oatmeal in it and wonderful that's so much flavor I always put a little bit of room temperature butter on the bottom it really creates a little bit of a barrier so it keeps the bread moist okay the next thing is mustard horseradish sauce don't neglect the corners I'm gonna make sure every bite has must leave horseradish sauce in it okay now I've got a Rugel I just think it's a really nice peppery flavor with with beef so it's gonna be that's great good at rubella so I'm gonna put a little bit of a bed of arugula on it don't was nice to have something crunchy in a sandwich it can be basil leaves it can be really tender lettuce okay and now the filet beef perfectly done because it's been resting well the resting really makes a huge difference it just cooks all the way through without getting overcooked on the outside and okay and then just a tiny bit of butter on the last slice for the same reason just keep the moisture in that's a really nice hearty sandwich they're gonna love it [Music] well you got the perfect date [Applause] hi Lois so you're going on a grand tour of the Hamptons set the day what do you do we're gonna go to the beach oh oh I've got sandwiches for you filleting before--the radish oh that's okay for the beach and we have something for you and you did we've got your cheesy text a dairy right down the street I love our vanilla isn't that great credible I know cows have a great time we're not gonna come listen somebody's got to work oh come back I'm gonna do a whole dinner with Long Island ingredients for you boy okay oh yeah you're a good guy no that's the dirty secret have a wonderful time with you hurry back oh nice cheese I found some gorgeous plums at the farm since I've got to be nice to make a plum raspberry crumble it's like two pounds of plums I've just pitted them and I'm gonna slice them into 1 inch wedges I actually love making crumbles I really prefer to cake I just love good cooked fruit desserts in a big bowl there's a cup of sugar and 1/4 of a cup of flour that's what makes the goo so delicious about two tablespoons of fresh orange juice and the last thing is a half-pint of fresh raspberries I'm just gonna toss that all together just toss it carefully you don't want to bruise the raspberries too much and a lot depends on how much juice there isn't the fruit if it's very very juicy fruit and I want to add a little bit more flour okay you know the dish it's great in the winter I make apple and pear crumbles in the summer peach raspberry this time of the year the plums are really good so they're perfect okay now I'm gonna make an oatmeal crumble topping with almonds it's delicious so start with a cup of flour third a cup of sugar white sugar and I use 1/3 of a cup of light brown sugar two things gives a nice sort of rich flavor lightly packed quarter teaspoon of salt really brings out the flavor I need a quarter stick of butter and I've actually already cut it up so it's stayed nice and cold just put it right into the food processor and then I'm just going to process it until the butter is like the size of peas okay the butters done just going to put this in a bowl with half a cup of oatmeal you want to use good old-fashioned oats not quick cooking or instant and have a cup of almonds I like the blanched sliced almonds it's a really good flavor with the plums I'm just going to take my hands and just we're up this together until it makes big crumbles sometimes these are called crisps but I'm calling it a crumble okay right on the top spread it out evenly so the fruit is all covered it's going to bake 350 degrees for about 40 minutes and so the food is all bubbly and delicious and tender into the up okay that's it for dessert I hope the guys are enjoying that lunch at the beach we have a deeply wonderful how's the sandwich it's a vicious really delicious and we're only halfway through the tour it's a good thing we have some nourishment what else do I plan Jack it's a big secret but it'll be fun I'm not quite sure why I call this Montauk seafood salad except Montag is known for its seafood and a lot of the seafood here comes from Montauk that's where the fishing boats are this is salad we've been making for a long time at Barefoot Contessa it's got shrimp and mussels and scallops in it and it's just fresh and delicious so the first thing I'm doing is peeling and deveining the shrimp so I take off the tail I leave the tail on only if we're going to pick up the shrimp individually with your fingers but for salad you want you can see there's this little vein that goes right down the back of the shrimp that's really its intestinal tract how's that for pretty but you really don't want to eat it so just make sure you take it out perfect the key to cooking shrimp is to undercook it everybody over cooks it it cooks in one and a half to two minutes tops last one okay that's one and a half pounds of shrimp I've got boiling water I want to put about 1/2 a cup of white wine vinegar in it this just flavors the shrimp while it's cooking so the tablespoon of salt bring you to a boil just put the shrimp in and time it really carefully one and a half minutes two tops depending on how big the shrimp are these are pretty big shrimp I just stand here and stare at it because I know the minute I walk away I'll forget about it you can just try one and just feel if it's really firm and it's not translucent it's white it's done so that wasn't even a minute and a half right into Bowl just drain it [Music] so that's the shrimp done now I'm going to make the scallops and the mussels and a delicious lemon vinaigrette so the next part of my Montauk seafood salad is the scallops these are actually sea scallops and they're particularly big ones if you have sea scallops they're really too big to sort of bite into an ax salad so I'm going to cut them in half before I cook them and what I'm going to do is I'm going to just poach them in the same water that I pushed the shrimp so it's got a little bit of wine vinegar in it and salt okay now just come back to a boil I'm just going to add the scallops and depending on the size they'll cook in a minute if there's bay scallops and maybe four to five minutes of their sea scallops I'm just until they're just cooked and firm while that's cooking then we prepare the mussels what I want to do when the mussels is first make sure it's alive and if it's closed it's alive sometimes if they stay open and you touch them and they don't close you want to toss it out because it's not alive the next thing I want to do is take this little what's called the beard off just a little thing just grab it if you can take it up it's a little tug-of-war I do with the mussel just comes off like that so what I've done with these mussels as I've scrubbed them and they suck them in water with a little bit of flour and what happens is the mussels drink in the water and flour and disgorge any sand that's in them okay so I think the scallops are done and you can tell they're firm perfect drain them [Music] whoa hi vinegar looks quite an infusion okay right into the bowl with the shrimp okay that's the scallops and after the mussels just dump the mussels in the pan got a half a cup of boiling water here we hear them talking to me okay lid on I'm just going to shake them a little make sure that the bottom ones in the top ones cook evenly about three to five minutes and they're all going to be open I'm gonna be great I think I smell that crumble [Music] that's gorgeous fun raspberry crumble with almonds and oatmeal on the top who's not going to let that visit so I think the muscles are done yeah good great I'm just gonna drain them and then I'm gonna take them out of the shell and it smell great smells like the sea well wow they look great you just want to take the mussels right out of their little shells then I'm gonna make a nice lemon vinaigrette for them this week you tell it might be nice with some local wine I hope they bring some back so this is our 2004 Pinot Grigio really beautiful characterful Pinot Grigio great with fresh goat cheeses and sheep's milk cheeses I'm just gonna smell it because someone has to be the designated driver you all taste it smells great I'm waiting for the red the red wine fan yeah absolutely - thank you so much for someone buying the Barefoot Contessa and our gradient Cheers I'm gonna make a lemon vinaigrette for the Montauk seafood salad it's a little unusual because I'm going to heat the oil I'm going to infuse lots of flavor into it one cup of oil I'm just going to heat it up I'm gonna use the zest of two lemons and then I'm going to use the juice tomato vinaigrette I can see the oil is just getting hot so it's just time to put all these flavors in okay so teaspoon of chopped garlic right into the oil you want it warm not sizzling hot about a half a teaspoon of fresh thyme leaves and the zest of two lemons right into the oil I'm just going to turn off the heat and let all those flavors infuse into the oil while I get the rest of the ingredients for the vinaigrette I better hurry I think Jax might be back soon now for the rest of the lemon vinaigrette I need a quarter of a cup of fresh lemon juice perfect just pour it right into the flavored oil next thing is one teaspoon of good Dijon mustard it's really like magnet vinaigrette you just starting with heated oil two tablespoons of good white wine or champagne vinegar two teaspoons of salt and 1/2 a teaspoon of pepper just need to whisk this all together we'll pour it all over the sutures pour underneath them its flavor so save some for later you might want to add some later big thrown toss it all together and now I'm going to add celery on some fresh parsley two stalks of celery right into the salad and then just some fresh parsley okay that looks great shrimp and scallops and mussels fresh lemon juice crunch of celery that's gonna be good and actually just so they'll know that it's a lemon vinaigrette you wanna take some lemon and put it right in so just slice the lemon in half

sure every bite has muscle roars radish sauce in it okay now I've got a Rugel I just think it's a really nice peppery flavor with was beef so it's gonna be mmmm that's great good a true Beulah so I'm gonna put a little bit of a bed of arugula on it don't ice to have something crunchy in a sandwich it can be basil leaves it can be really tender lettuce okay and now the filet beef perfectly done because it's been resting well the resting really makes a huge difference it just cooks all the way through without getting overcooked on the outside okay and then just a tiny bit of butter on the

some gorgeous plums at the farm since I thought it'd be nice to make a plum raspberry crumble so I have two pounds of plums I've just pitted them and I'm going to slice them into 1 inch wedges I actually love making crumbles I really prefer to cake I just I love good cooked fruit desserts I'm gonna big bowl there cup of sugar and 1/4 of a cup of flour that's what makes the goo so delicious about two tablespoons of fresh orange juice and the last thing is a half-pint of fresh raspberries I'm just gonna toss that all together just toss it carefully you don't want to bruise the raspberries too much and a lot depends on how much juice there isn't the fruit if it's very very juicy fruit and I want to add a little bit more flour okay the dish it's great in the winter I make apple and pear crumbles in the summer peach raspberry this time of the year the plums are really good so they're perfect okay now I'm gonna make an oatmeal crumble topping with almonds it's delicious so start with a cup of flour [Music] 30 cup sugar white sugar and I use 1/3 of a cup of light brown sugar 2 things gives a nice sort of rich flavor lightly packed quarter of a teaspoon of salt really brings out the flavor I need a quarter of a stick of butter and I've actually already cut it up so it stay nice and cold just put it right into the food processor and then I'm just going to process it until the butter is like the size of peas you
