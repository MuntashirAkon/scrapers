[Music] and I used to love to have clambakes at the beach but by the time I got everything down there it was dark it was cold and it was probably fan of the food so I figured out a great way to have a clambake at home all in one pot my friends are coming tonight for clambake in the kitchen and for dessert I'm going to make an apple crostata which is this wonderful sort of rustic apple tart I'll show you how to make it there are two things about making pastry that are really important to remember first ones ice-cold butter and the second ones ice cold water we've all made really bad pastry at one point or not that I'm going to show you how to make sure it's delicious everytime light and flaky so the first thing is a cup of flour and I use all-purpose flour two tablespoons of sugar so salt I'm going to mix it up in the food processor make sure it's blended so the reason why the butter has to be cold is when the heat in the oven hits the pastry dough you want the water on the butter to start to evaporate and it's the steam that makes it light and flaky and it gets totally incorporated in the dough and it doesn't happen so we're going to cut it up in chunks and then put it in the food processor I'll show you how it works really cold butter just ice it like that and put it in and very carefully coat the butter in a little bit of the flour and now I'm just going to pulse it about ten times until it makes the butter about the size of T and now when take the ice cold water two to three tablespoons of water while the processor is going down the feed tube and that's going to make it into a pastry just like that perfect I'm going to Pat it out on a board I'm going to form this new ball I'll leave it in the fridge for about an hour until it's really cold and then we're going to roll it out and fill it with absolutely delicious apple with a little orange it's going to wrap it up in a little parchment paper but if you have plastic wrap that's trying to go into the fridge but meanwhile I'm having clam bake so I better go buy some clam [Music] the first clamps from my kitchen clambake I just want to pick ones that are closed and that they're not too big so we really sweet and last of them [Applause] [Music] great hi Colin so I need three one and a half pound lobsters for my family I'll dress you happen yes I do fantastic they are beautiful kappa if I hold the bag with the best oh this guy doesn't want to go in and can you blame him oh sure oh there's another beauty all right Oh wonderful thank you so much can't wait are there guys [Music] got lots of different kinds of clamps steamers and little next clamp and what do we do now is just wash everything so it's ready for later now put together lobsters and shrimp and kielbasa it's so good so when you're cleaning clams what I want to do is just really brush the outside I actually use a nail brush but you can use a vegetable brush firstly outside and make sure there's no sand on it to brush them well and you want to make sure they're all closed nobody's smiling at you it's nice and tight so these are the clams they're all nice and clean it's a massage that's about two dozen clams and then I have two dozen steamer clams I'm going to do the same thing with these make sure they're closed tight I just scrub them to make sure there's no sand on them it's actually a really easy meal I'm just gonna make a big tomato mozzarella basil salad to start a big clambake and fresh bread to dip into the juice empty corn and a wonderful apple crostata for dessert and then the next thing is muscle the way you clean mussels is you want to get the stand out from the middle so that's two pounds of mussels we put them in water and the trick to taking the sand out I'll show you and what the flour does is they drink the water in the flour and they give off any sand that's inside and you'll see at the end I see the bottom of the bowl so let those sit in the flour and water for a few minutes and we'll get them nice and clean the other thing with mussels do you want to take off what's called the beard which is this little piece that sort of lets them cling to rocks take that off so just keep those guys after I'm going to let that sit for a minute and the last thing is shrimp and it's one and a half pounds of whole shrimp I like to use a large shrimp and it's in the shell don't even have to feel that so it's going to go right in my bowl ready for later take out these muscles let's give it all nice and clean it's such a great thing to do for a party because everybody started connect while there it's real family-style food and everybody connects while they're digging into the lobsters and the clamp from the monthly great and you can see there's a little sand in the water so that's all come out of the nut rope so my seafoods all ready for later I can't wait to make the clambake I've never known a party that wasn't improved with really good cocktails so I'm going to make margaritas to go with my clan big it's really traditional but I make it with a twist I do it with lime and lemon and I think it's really good so the first thing I need to tap a cup of fresh lime juice lime it's really important it's first one to half a cup perfect and that goes in the blender and this is the secret to my margaritas is a lemon the juice of one lemon and for some reason you just isn't much more depth of flavor I love it into the blender and now the good stuff the tequila the curious thing about margaritas I found is they don't come out very good if you use really good tequila you know that dark golden tequila you have to use inexpensive tequila and then they can that great so I'm gonna have a cup of tequila a whole cup in the blender cup of triple sec which is orange flavored liqueur no wonder this over and one or two cups of ice let's go to blend it all together [Applause] [Music] how good is that going to be I think I could take to make sure it's okay dangerous how good it's going to be really wonderful it's got great flavor and it's got a great tequila tape taste I'm gonna put in two big pitches so into the pitcher and when my friends get here I'm going to solve some martini glasses I think this looks great new martini glass and I'm going to shake it with ice and serve it it's going to be really fun and now after the gardens are tomatoes from my tomato mozzarella basil South could be great my special twist is I'm going to use all kinds of really interesting heirloom tomatoes like this wonderful green zebra striped tomato it's actually right but it's green and it's a great stripes on it I love the way it looks and it's totally delicious [Music] these are going to be so great with my other red and yellow tomato [Music] tomato and basil salad can be really good but it can be really boring so I'm going to do it in a totally different way I'm going to make all different kinds of tomatoes these are all called heirloom tomatoes and if you can find them at some kind of produce market it's really fabulous this is sort of a traditional red tomato but then I have yellow tomatoes this is regular cow's milk mozzarella but you can also find buffalo mozzarella which is richer and softer since this recipe only basically has three ingredients tomatoes mozzarella basil you want to make sure they're all really good so don't buy the stuff that tastes like plastic buy this stuff that is like good mozzarella so I'll just slice these guys now they look wonderful and you really want to make this one the tomatoes are ripe this is not a winter salad particularly so I'm just going to serve lay them out very casually and I like a salad wanted to wind up like ducks very sort of casual kind of arrangement they smell so good the yellow tomatoes are actually a little less acidic so I like to combine them with the red tomatoes and then mozzarella very casually and then I'm going to take these little ones and just cut them in the wedges put them right on top and the zebra striped tomatoes some people great they're ripe when they're green that fabulous lime green inside love and they're so sweet and maybe some of these big cherry tomatoes are wonderful don't this look fabulous and fresh basil I'm just going to do big leaks whole leaves on it more leaves tucked in here and then maybe I'll take one big bunch and just put it in the end when you have a platter that have lots of different colors nice have one sort of focus at the end like that and that's a good olive oil drizzle on the top lots of salt it's really important use kosher salt and freshly ground pepper that's not a boring tomato much melon basil salad it's gorgeous I'm just going to leave it right here at room temperature until I'm ready for my clambake so I'm back to my apple crostata Roland's do is peel one and a half pounds of apples about three to four apples depending on how big they are I like to combine one tart and one sweet Apple is nice the key is that you don't want apples that are too soft you want them to have a little firmness to them and I like this tart kind of chunky so I'm going to cut it in big chunks like that okay so that's the apples and I'm going to flavor a little orange if I just think orange sort of brings out that apple flavor and then I'm going to add some other apple pie slices in the topping like cinnamon and allspice so that's the apples and now I'm going to get the crust so remember this has been sitting in the fridge for about an hour so it gets nice and firm and I can roll it out it was beautiful a little bit of flour I'm going to flour the board so doesn't stick this is a beautiful crust I can tell it's really good because they're little bits of butter all the way through the crust when you roll it out so it rolls it that into a circle and then pile the apples into the middle it should be just about right let's put it on a baking sheet just in line with parchment just take your rolling pin and roll it up on that and move it right to the parchment perfect and then we'll pour the apples on top I want to leave like an inch and a half crust around the outside because I'm going to fold the whole thing up okay now I'm going to do the topping course so to make something like a crumble topping that we used to put on an apple pie holers cup of flour quarter of a cup of sugar some salt ground allspice that's really just to give it the serve apple pie flavor and cinnamon I'm going to take a half a stick of butter and dice it up and that's what's going to make it crumbly okay right in here set up a Sonia it's all broken up like that and now I'm going to put it in this bowl and run it in my finger so what makes sort of really crumbly kind of topping putting on top of the apples like that does not look fabulous I'm going to take the edges and fold them right up over the apples to enclose them that look great wonderful in the oven 450 degrees for about 20 to 25 minutes and it's going to be just scored and when it comes out the crust is going to be nice and brown and the apples will be bubbly it's going to be so delicious [Music] so this is a big spot I'm gonna put my clambake into what I started with three types of onions and 2 cups of leeks that I've cooked in olive oil for about 10 minutes until they're nice and translucent the next thing I'm going to do is put in 1 and 1/2 pounds of red potatoes right in the bottom so they cook first just so they taste really good 1 tablespoon of soul it sounds like a lot but it's a big clambake and half a tablespoon of cracked pepper and then to flavor at all one and a half pounds of kielbasa this is so good any kind of sausage is really good the kielbasa is already cooked so you don't have to worry about cooking it before and it's got great flavor for the potatoes with cabassa the onions and leeks this is my idea of a Greek lambic it's not outside it's not hot it's not sandy and at the end of the day it's not dark so you can really find your dinner not hunting around like all those parties they use to cable on the beach and then all the seafood so these are all my clean clam and the mussel goes right on top and then shrimp on top of that and then laughters go right on the top in the pan one lobster - lobster three laster's add 2 cups of white wine good white wine you want to taste great right on the top and that's it it could have cook on medium heat for about 15 minutes until you see steam coming out between the top and the lid and then I'm going to turn it down for another 15 minutes and cook it and it will be perfectly done the potatoes on the bottom the kielbasa though all the flavors will go together this shellfish will be cooked and the lobsters on the top it's amazing but it really works okay who wants a margarita we know okay we everybody get a glass right on the table take a piece of blonde yeah and run around the room the glass and then this isn't called margarita all right whoa serious oh yeah this can be really good with a clambake cheers everybody lots of salt perfect rate everything you ever wanted in a margarita have a okay after the margaritas beer choice for take a little beer for spending the night right okay you're going to have to uh say it like that tomorrow my shirt is from your car oh they are some of them actually are they air the green favorite gather all heirloom tomatoes beautiful holy that I guess then I heat it up in the other again actually heats them up a little bit of water so they get nice and crisp okay again for everybody men she would I guess Oh terrific sis and now the main event the clambake lobsters and mussels and clams or they're close to a lot of a lot more I would be rocks elastic people getting foster gets a little claws off and
