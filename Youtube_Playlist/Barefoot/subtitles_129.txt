[Music] my friend Michael the florist is invited me for lunch but now some of his clients have called with last-minute flower emergencies how annoying so instead of canceling I've offered to bring lunch to a shop and we can eat while he works we're going to start with juicy pink roasted shrimp with fasten Island dressing dip followed by delicious salmon on a bed of spicy lentils and for dessert pecan squares dipped in warm chocolate you've heard of store-bought food well there's a store-bought food and we can eat lunch at the counter among all the beautiful flowers so the first thing I thought I'd make for Michael is pecan bars it's really a pecan pie but in bars so we can pick them up and it starts with about 20 pounds of butter no no no really it's a pound and a quarter of butter see how light it is what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna make like a shortbread crust on the bottom of the pan and then do that wonderful sweet caramel and pecans on the top so the first thing I do is one of the quarter pounds of butter 3/4 of a cup of sugar it's really just like making shortbread I'm just gonna cream that for about three minutes until it's light and fluffy okay turn it on low just enough to mix it we really want to start with room-temperature butter otherwise it really won't cream well okay the next thing is three eggs they're also room-temperature I think you'd be surprised how much your baking changes once you start using room-temperature butter mine did put in the eggs one at a time [Music] just let them get incorporated before you put the next one in otherwise you end up with a mess and now recursive teaspoon of vanilla and then while that's mixing I want to combine the flour baking powder and salt so I need four and a half cups of flour 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder and a quarter teaspoon of salt and just sift it all together Parsippany really just make sure there are no lumps in the flour and it combines everything and now very slowly with a mixer on low speed just put the flour mixture into the butter mixture these are great for a party or for a picnic because you can make them in advance and they transport really well I'm gonna dip them in chocolate it's gonna make them even better okay that's the crust I don't have a sheet pan and then Pat it out with my hands that looks like a lot of dough and it's just the crust okay I'm gonna flour my hands a little bit just to check this out it'll help much better but it's a lot of dough this is sort of the same kind of crust that used for lemon bars all kinds of bars it's really good with pecan bars just make a little bit of an edge so that the filling stays inside I love anything that doesn't require rolling it out with a rolling pin or greasing the pan you know one thing I really believe about being a good friend is being really flexible and when Michael said he was crazy busy I thought I'm not just bring a picnic to the store a lot of lunch well he works good 350 degrees for 15 minutes until the crust is set but not brown [Music] [Music] so the shortbread base is cooled and set and the next thing I have to do for my pecan bars is the filling needs just a little more butter one pound remember it makes a lot of pecan bars so what I'm gonna do is cook a few ingredients together to make the topping and then add lots and lots of pecans I'm just gonna turn that on if I want to melt it next thing is brown sugar brown sugar is granulated sugar and molasses mixed together and one pound is two and a quarter cups I need three cups all together and then this is about 3/4 of a cup and the last thing is 1 cup of honey this is really just the filling for the pecans to hold them all together perfect so we're gonna do is just stir it all together and melt it and then I'm gonna turn the heat up a high and boil it for about three minutes so it really caramelize does it it gets nice and thick mmm it smells pretty good already don't even have the pecans in yet okay while that's heating I'm gonna add to zest so about a teaspoon of lemon zest we love you as exists I actually think most of the flavor of the lemons in the zest so that's about a teaspoon put that right in at a teaspoon of our excess okay when that comes to a boil just boil away for about three minutes and it'll get really syrupy and thick do 1/4 cup of heavy cream and two pounds of pecans is delicious and I actually buy chopped pecans instead of cold one why I've chopped them when you can buy them already chopped okay I'm going to mix that all together it's not some gorgeous mmm be careful this is really hot you don't want to get anywhere near it and certainly don't put your fingers in it to taste it shortbread crust then pour this whole thing right on top one thing I learned is sometimes this bubbles over a little in the oven so I put a piece of aluminum foil on the bottom of the oven to floor that's certainly easier to throw away the aluminum foil than it is to clean the oven and just spread it all out it's not like delicious okay all done so into the oven 350 degrees for about 20 to 30 minutes until they've set and when they're cool I'm gonna dip them in chocolate those are good [Music] I'm gonna make some chocolate for the pecan bars so I'm gonna melt 1/2 pound of chocolate chips and 1/2 a cup of heavy cream it's a ganache I'm gonna dip the pecan bars in chocolate you don't really have to but I mean why not and one teaspoon of coffee it's instant coffee granules truly boosts the flavor of the chocolate you don't really taste the coffee chocolate tastes better big spoon for stirring so put this in a heatproof bowl over a pan of simmering water just want to make sure that water really just simmers and while that melts i'm gonna cut the pecan bars just for this really carefully because the knife can slip that's just like brownies the first one's always hard to get out that doesn't that look fabulous I actually think I'm gonna make these a little smaller I think they're really too big so I'm gonna cut them in half and then we'll dip them in chocolate [Music] nice fella great okay got four of them no they're the rest later it looks like the chocolates just melted perfect so I'm going to turn it off actually a little bit before it melts because the heat from the pot just keep melting that look good what wouldn't be better different chocolate okay I'm just gonna get it all set up now so what I use is the white paper muffin cups just to flatten it out and then put the pecan bar on top and then flatten it out this allow the chocolate to dry a little bit it's never gonna get really hard but it'll just allow it to dry a little bit and they won't all smush together okay first one dip it right here just the edge you know what the whole thing just enough so you get a sense of the chocolate right back on them Michaels originally from Pennsylvania Dutch country what makes me think this is kind of deserved how's that this is quite a production making two for Michael and me an enormous number for customers a lot of pecan bars [Music] I'd love to make things that are traditional but with the twist and so instead of making boiled shrimp with cocktail sauce what I'm going to do is I'm gonna make roasted shrimp has lots of flavor and but the shrimp already peeled and deveined a little bit of olive oil just a drizzle salt some pepper I like a little lemon juice in this it's so much easier than all that boiling water perfect okay I'm just gonna mix it up turn on a sheet pan this is just for two so it's about a half a pound I like when the tails are still on you can use them to pick them up 400 degrees for about 5 to 6 minutes and they're gonna have so much more flavor than boiled shrimp I like cocktail sauce as well as anybody but I just thought with shrimp let's shake it up a little bit so I'm gonna make Thousand Island dip which is basically Russian dressing with pickles in it doesn't that sound like it'll be good together so 3/4 of a cup of mayonnaise 1/4 of a cup of ketchup but try and get it in the bowl okay now all different kinds of things in it tablespoon of pickle relish teaspoon of capers I actually drained them first just like that doesn't have to be perfect and then I put some of these little girl cans in they should have like cornichon but little American gherkins not French once this is a very American dish just chop them up roughly you could probably just use one kind of pickles but I like to give it more flavor okay it's a little too much but it's just gonna be better okay a little bit of lemon juice add a teaspoon salt and pepper and that's Thousand Island dip for roasted shrimp put in the silver ball that looks good [Music] oh they look great you can tell when they're done they start to get pink and when you press them they don't really give any resilience they're firm those gonna be great just put them right around doesn't have to be perfect it's a nice arrangement this is perfect for Michael and me okay this needs a little green maybe some parsley it's a few sprigs Wow so that's the first course the main course I'm making salmon with lentils I'd say that's really delicious take out [Music] Samuel Flynn tells it's a great party dish because you can make it in huge quantities but for two it's also perfect so I'm gonna make it for Michael and me but first I'm gonna make the lentils I'm gonna pour boiling water over the top and just let them soak for about ten minutes so they soften so I'm gonna put the lentils aside I'm gonna saute all kinds of vegetables cook the lentils with it and then so to have the salmon separately and put it together a little bit of olive oil I have two cups of onions it's gonna saute them together and two cups of weeks they're both pretty much in the same family the leeks are a little more delicate than the onions they're great together and some fresh thyme that a teaspoon none of this has to be exact because saute this for about ten minutes until the onions translucent booboo sauce pepper and while that's cooking I'm gonna cut up some carrot and celery put in a tablespoon of chopped garlic [Music] and then we're gonna have cups of chopped celery one and a half cups of chopped carrots since it's really chunky it's got lots of flavor and the lentils are just part of it it's gonna saute that for a second 1/2 cups of chicken stock and who to have a spoons of tomato paste stir it in we're gonna add the lentils I'm gonna cook these together for about 20 minutes the lentils and the vegetables then I'm gonna sear the salmon and then I'm off to Michael's second mission done boy am I ready for I'm gonna take out lunch the key to the salmon is to just sear the outside so you make a really crisp crust and then it seals in all that flavor drizzle this with a little bit of oil okay that's it salt and pepper this is really the only season we so you want to make sure you season it really well okay really hot pan just make sure you can really feel it and then take the salmon and put it in seasoned side down and just leave it I know it's really tempting to move it around but you want to really create a really great crust so I'm just gonna cook it on this side for about two minutes and then flip it over and roast it in the oven and it'll be perfect it's sort of crusty on the outside and tender inside okay two minutes let's turn it over okay into the oven for about five to seven minutes at 450 degrees this is how they cook it in restaurants and it comes out perfectly let's go finish the lentils and them off to Michael [Music] well the Salmons perfectly cooked that's gonna be wonderful so a little bit left to do on the lentils so I'm gonna add about two tablespoons of red wine vinegar just really sort of perks up the flavor a lot I don't see how this is mmm I can smell it I love when it hits the heat mmm that's delicious one more salt always needs a little more mmm the sweetness of the red wine vinegar and the carrots and lentils gonna be great with the salmon so I'm something a platter and just fill it up mmm the good news is it's good hot but it's also good room-temperature salmon on top then the leftovers I'm gonna put in the refrigerator love leftovers don't have to cook tomorrow night I'm gonna pack all this up pick up the pecan bars and the shrimp a Thousand Island dip and I'm off to Michael's so I brought lunch for it has that fabulous I had to make this rumor wellactually roasted them it's amazing big sheet pan salt and pepper olive oil in the oven it's really fast and I just think it has so much more flavor yeah I'm ready for salmon yes salmon and lentils one of my favorite this couldn't have been better I think you're gonna like what's more picky and bars dipped in chocolate help yourself huh we're gonna need a nap after lunch it's really unfair I'm so glad you brought lots oh very happy something as a thank you you don't have to do that but I love surprises [Music] thank you Feeny's they really are my favorite boys are fabulous they're so beautiful thing I can bring you lunch anytime that's a deal
