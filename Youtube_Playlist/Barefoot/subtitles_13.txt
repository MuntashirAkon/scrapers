[Music] Breton's are terrific potato gratin like to make zucchini gratin but for this dinner my cauliflower Gretchen so I've got a three pound cauliflower I'm just going to cut it up into florets now okay big pot of boiling salted water that's sort of boil for about five or six minutes until the cauliflower is just tender in the meantime I'm going to make a delicious white sauce first thing we do and heat up two cups of milk the meantime grate some cheese I need about 3/4 of a cup of gray air that half of the cup it's going to go into the sauce and then I'm going to put some on top its own brown and delicious okay so I've got two tablespoons of butter okay three tablespoons of flour all at once so I'm going to cook the flour and the butter together it actually becomes like a pain so we pour the milk right in whoa really hot and then just go they can see it really sickens up so it's a really good white sauce it's really nice and smooth now and so you can see really coats the back of a spoon nicely okay it's thick enough just going to turn off the heat and add some great flavor first it's off and these tin can of course or so on a particular September the next place is really classic French spice so quarter teaspoon of ground nutmeg and then relaunch delicious Greer cheese that 1/2 a cup and I had parmesan it's not so classic for French bread channels but it gives it a nice nutty flavor that half a cup of grated Parmesan and then just stir it together also good to really smell but the nuttiness of the gray air and the spicy parmesan and even nutmeg okay that's done cauliflower is ready my steam bath i synthesis the Gretchen dish I'm going to use eight by eleven but doesn't have to be exact so the first thing I do is put about a third of the sauce in the bottom it even looks like it has a lot of flavor doesn't and then the call sounds and then the rest of the song [Music] that actually looks good already but I'm going to make a nice crumb topping so it gets brown and crusty so good okay so I need a little bit of butter so it's a quarter cup of breadcrumbs sort of a cup of green mint just to get in there I'm just going to pour it over the top and [Music] then just drizzle it with a little bit of brother never heard anything as we leave that to room temperature and refrigerate it and make it just before the party falls I've had this smells so good it's a party
