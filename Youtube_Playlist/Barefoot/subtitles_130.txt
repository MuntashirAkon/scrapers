I have dear friends coming for breakfast tomorrow and unlike a disastrous breakfast party I had many years ago this time I'm gonna have everything done today so I can have fun tomorrow when I was first married my husband and I decided to give a party and we invited everybody for breakfast and I decided I would make an omelette for everyone what a bad idea that was I spent the entire time in the kitchen like Cinderella though fast-forward 35 years and I've invited some friends for breakfast and I'm gonna have everything made the day before and I'm gonna have a really good time at my own party I like to be a guest so the first thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna make scones I'm gonna make the dough today and then tomorrow I'm just gonna take them out of the fridge and bake them off and we'll have hot scones fresh in the morning and I didn't have to get up at 4:00 a.m. to do it so I take three quarters of a pound of butter I know it's a lot of butter but you have to use it to make good scones so the first thing I needs 4 cups of flour 2 tablespoons of sugar 2 tablespoons of baking powder which is gonna make them nice and light and 2 teaspoons of salt I'm just gonna mix up the dry ingredients first so it's really well blended so I've got the flour sugar baking powder and salt and now I'm going to take the really cold butter and just put it in I'm going to mix it a little bit until the butter is about the size of peas it's going to mix it for a little bit we'll need about a cup of heavy cream and it has to be cold because you don't want the butter to get soft when you put the heavy cream in and then for eggs who just made it okay so this is just gonna go right in to the dough it's gonna make a very very wet dough but it's gonna mean that the scones are gonna be really moist and just mix it just enough cuz you don't want to over mix the butter so I need about three quizzes of a cup of raisins and I'm just gonna flour them a little bit this prevents the raisins from sticking together when you put them in the scones I'm just gonna put them right in okay there we are it's a really sticky dough so I'm gonna flour the board really well so making the dough tonight and then I'm gonna put them in the refrigerator all cut out and tomorrow morning all I have to do is pop them in the oven and we'll have hot scones first thing in the morning this is gonna be so good I'm gonna make raspberry butter which will be really good on the scones but the main course is a frittata a potato basil frittata and it's gonna be wonderful so this this looks great the dough is nice and cold I'm gonna flour a little more and you want to be sure the raisins are evenly distributed okay so I'm just going to Pat this out or I'll roll it out to about 3/4 of an inch thick that was perfect gorgeous so when a flower the cutter and I do it in squares and then I cut the squares in half and we have triangles okay so we've cut squares and then I'm gonna cut them in half diagonally and we'll have gorgeous triangles so tomorrow morning when I take them out of the fridge I'm gonna brush them with egg wash and sprinkle them with sugar the egg wash is gonna make them nice and brown and the sugar is gonna make them Sparkle well so now these are gonna go on the fridge and then I'm gonna show you how to make my favorite homemade granola so in a big bowl I'm gonna mix together four cups of oats and just use regular oats that you can buy at the grocery store Oh - great two cups of coconut two cups of almonds and I'm gonna toss this all together and now I'm gonna take 3/4 of a cup of oil and half a cup of honey good honey mmm I'm just gonna toss this with my oats almonds and coconut toss it all together you'll believe how brown and delicious and crisp this comes out and whatever's left over will just sit on the pantry okay great you put it on a sheet pan I'm gonna bake this at 350 for about 45 minutes until it's nice and brown and crisp so tomorrow morning I'm going to add lots of dried foods and it's so delicious where my favorite recipes of all time is orange yogurt the idea of this is that I drain the yogurt a lot of the liquid comes out and then I replace it with things that taste much better like fresh orange juice generally when you drain things people recommend that use cheesecloth but you always have paper towels at home so why not a paper towel so I'm gonna put it right in this strainer take a quart of yogurt and just put it in the strainer you can use whole milk yogurt low-fat yogurt whatever you want to use just plain yogurt I'm just gonna let this drain overnight and you'll be surprised how much liquid comes out and then tomorrow I'm gonna replace the liquid with fresh orange juice honey and wonderful flavorings like vanilla and raisins and nuts it'll be so good so the last thing I have to do before I hit the sack let's check my granola yeah it looks great smells warned if I can smell the almonds and them coconut and all the oats just gonna leave it to sit overnight until it's cool time to hit the sack tomorrow so I need some rolls for a bread basket for breakfast so you want to give me like a assorted rolls my favorite cinnamon coffee like preserves that are hold fruit not too sweet my friends coming for breakfast and rather than getting up at six o'clock in the morning to get everything ready I've gotten most of it done last night and I just have a few things left to do I've raisin scones and I'm just gonna brush them with egg wash and a little sugar to give them a glaze a glistening look egg wash can really be anything it can be an egg and a little bit of water egg and milk half-and-half whatever you have around just to make gorgeous on the top and a little bit of sugar to make them look good and into the oven at 400 degrees for about 20 to 25 minutes until they're big and gorgeous and golden so while that's happening I'm gonna make the easiest thing you've ever seen made it's raspberry butter it's basically two ingredients raspberry jam and butter so I take room-temperature butter I'm just gonna use a quarter of a pound of butter and about 1/2 a cup of raspberry jam and mix them together how easy is that because I use unsalted butter I'm just gonna take a pinch of salt into Don this is the best part making sure it's okay mmm it's sweet and it's creamy and it's gonna be so good on the scones yeah put it aside and now I'm gonna show you how to make a perfect cup of coffee I don't know why people find this daunting it starts with really one thing good coffee if you buy inexpensive bitter coffee beans you're gonna end up with bitter coffee hello so this is what I'm gonna do I'm pouring 8 cups of water into the back of the coffee maker and then use a filter of course my favorite coffee the secret is for every 2 cups of water one heaping tablespoon of coffee I mean really heaping like that so I have 8 cups of water I'm gonna put in four heaping tablespoons of coffee and you'll have delicious coffee every time but be sure you buy really good coffee I'm gonna turn that on and just because I hate emptying a coffee maker to make decaf I have two coffee makers it's a small investment and it makes it so much easier so I'm gonna make a whole pot of decaf also I think more and more people are drinking decaf so it's great to be prepared so again I've got eight cups of coffee I'm going to do four heaping tablespoons of decaf so the next thing when it finishes Micra know what this is so good this is all the baked oats and almonds and coconut with a little bit of honey and and it's absolutely delicious the way it is it's like crisp and sweet and good for you but I'm gonna make it even better I let it sit overnight so that we'd get cool and now I'm gonna add all kinds of dried fruit to it to make it over-the-top granola so I've got figs you know the thing about granola it's so good is that you can its really good for you you can make a huge batch and leave it for a long time in a sealed container on the shelf it doesn't go bad so just chop figs and then chopped apricots lots of good chopped apricots it gives it lots of color and texture I think I'm just gonna do big chunks of that so it looks great the reason why I use dried fruit is so that there's not so much moisture in the fruit and if you use fresh fruit like fresh strawberries while it's great to serve over fresh strawberries you don't want to store them together because the Cronulla will get really soggy so we've got apricots and figs and these are wonderful mmm or dried cranberries in their tart and they're sweet and they're just delicious I dried cherries I'm just gonna mix all of these together I'm gonna have the most gorgeous granola for breakfast that's gonna be great my friends are coming for breakfast I love to do breakfast because it's not the traditional Saturday night dinner which is such a major deal most of the things I've done the night before which is great but the main centerpiece of the meal is a potato basil for Tata so in the pan here I've cooked about two cups of boiling potatoes they're the firm round ones rather than the baking potatoes and I peeled them and just cooking a little better for about 10 or 15 minutes until they're really just tender and browned and that should be perfect right now now I'm gonna make the basis of it which is this gorgeous omelet all mixed together I'm gonna start with just like an omelet eight eggs and I actually find that you can use whatever's left over from dinner if you have chicken and broccoli the night before it makes a delicious frittata counting one more I just scramble them a little bit and then I'm gonna add lots of great flavorings but 15 ounces of ricotta which is one whole small container and then 3/4 of a pound of green cheese Greer's it's wonderful like Swiss cheese I know it's eggs cheese and butter it's delicious how bad can that be and then a little bit of butter the last major food group I'm not suggesting you eat this every day but once in a while for a treat it's wonderful and then basil I think basil is just such a great flavoring so we'll just take the leaves off the stems and chop them very roughly mmm I love the smell of fresh basil and then the last two ingredients our third of a cup of flour to give a little substance and 3/4 of teaspoon of baking powder to make it rise what you see this when it comes out of the oven it's all puffed and golden and brown it's really a showstopper and it's this easy to make so I'm gonna stir this all together make sure it's nicely blended cheeses and the basil and eggs and that's it I'm just gonna pour this right over the potato and then this whole thing goes in the oven so instead of making individual almost for everybody I have one big omelet we're all gonna share it so it goes in the oven at 350 degrees for about 15 minutes to an hour and it's gonna be puffed and golden and delicious excellent so one of the treats about this breakfast most of the table decoration is gonna be totally edible and I'm gonna cut up all kinds of gorgeous fruit and put it down the middle of the table I'll show you how easy it is I have this thing about fruit that it needs to be all one color I hate when things are mixed up and they look like a bowl of M&amp;Ms so first thing I'm gonna do is papaya look how great they are with the black seeds and I actually like to just leave it this way cuz it's so beautiful whom people can scoop the seeds out and I can smell the pie it smells wonderful one of the things I find is I have these hydrangea leaves in my bush but you can also get lemon leaves from the florist and just look what a difference it makes in the papaya I'm gonna do a plate of strawberries so one big platter of strawberries it's just so much prettier than a plate of a million different kinds of fruit and maybe one little leaf tucked under there so that's the strawberries how easy is this and let's say the last one is it's a glia melon it's an it's an Israeli no this is really when you're going shopping for melons don't squeeze it because you'll just bruise it all you want to do is just smell it and it smells like the mill and it's ripe and this one smells incredible it's sweet and fragrant and it's like a honeydew inside but it's incredibly delicious and I've been able to get them quite quite often now just go scoop the little seeds out put down some of my hydrangea leaves any kind of a broad flat leaf like this really works well and then just do wedges and people can help themselves I can't wait to eat this melon it's just gorgeous so just like that and that should be it so I'm going to take these out to the table it'll be part of the gorgeous decoration so all the fruits set and then I'm going to put everything else I'm homemade granola and the yogurt down the middle of the table and we'll all sit have a wonderful time together so my friends are coming for breakfast and I've made delicious things yesterday so I can be relaxed today I made raisin scones and granola and this is orange yogurt which is really wonderful what I've done is drain the yogurt I've drained the liquid out of it and I'm going to throw that out it makes it very thick and I'm going to add the liquid back by adding fresh orange juice to it and lots of delicious things so the first thing to add is raisins and walnuts I'm just gonna chop them roughly I love this yogurt because it's got wonderful flavor it's sweet with a little bit bit of honey and it's tart with the orange juice and it's got great texture with the raisins and walnuts some raisins this is really casual cooking I love to use the zest of oranges because it's got the most flavor of the orange and this is my handy dandy zester I love it okay a little bit of orange zest and then honey which will make a delicious and sweet mmm ain't good vanilla just cuz I love vanilla mmm I love the smell of that betta teaspoon and a half of vanilla so I'm gonna do is add back freshly squeezed orange juice until it's the same consistency as the original yogurt so now you just want to reconstitute it basically so that frittata maybe a little decadent with the granola yogurt oh good for you so I figure they all balance out okay let's see if it's right hmmm it's so sweet from the honey and the orange juice and it's got crunchiness from the walnuts and raisins it's gonna be so delicious with the granola I can't wait for you and I'll get some for your casa just hit you're all still hungry I have a potato patient for town Oh what's in this I know it's potatoes and basil and ricotta this is an idea of a great way to start the day breakfast with my friends the door swung open on a gorgeous day but I mean that the scones are gonna be really moist and just mix it just enough cuz you don't want to over mix the butter so I need about three kinds of a cup of raisins and I'm just gonna flour them a little bit this prevents the raisins from sticking together when you put them in the scones I'm just gonna put them right in okay there we are it's a really sticky dough so I'm gonna flour the board really well I have dear friends coming for breakfast tomorrow and unlike a disastrous breakfast party I had many years ago this time I'm gonna have everything done today so I can have fun tomorrow you when I was first married my husband and I decided to give a party and we invited everybody for breakfast and I decided I would make an omelette for everyone what a bad idea that was I spent the entire time
