[Music] I'm building a barn in my garden with a working kitchen and I love my architect I wanted to say thank you to his whole team and I thought what better way than to make them a wonderful lunch Miguel is doing the table for me it's gonna be amazing I think we have the blueprint for a perfect lunch for place cards and making short bread cookies in the shape of hammers with everyone's name on it and they're going to do double duty as dessert and a big lobster paella that's so easy to make I'm serving it with a refreshing grapefruit and avocado salad and to drink a lemony California iced tea I love when a good plan comes together [Music] so I've got a terrific blueprint for this meal I'm gonna have the entire lunch on the table when we sit down including dessert and dessert is gonna do double duty as place cards for the guests so what I'm gonna make first is I'm gonna make shortbread cookies in the shape of a hammer they're really cool and then I will write everybody's name on it so first I have to make the shortbread I need 3/4 of a pound of butter 1 cup of sugar butter has to be at room temperature so it's really soft and that means sometimes leaving it out overnight I'm just gonna put it on very low speed I don't want to whip it a lot I just wanted to mix together I just use the paddle attachment on my mixer you can also use a hand mixer once you spoon a good vanilla and then just mix it together until the butter and the sugar are combined I fainted meantime I'm gonna get the flour ready and it's going to have cups of flour I'm gonna put it in a sifter 1/4 teaspoon of salt just sift them together okay now I'm just gonna add it slowly to the butter and sugar mixture so these are gonna be both desert and the place cards it just starts to come together in a sec I'm gonna kill this for about 30 minutes until gets firm enough to roll out okay now that does just pull together which is perfect I'm gonna clear the jacks a little bit of flour this is really my favorite cookie I make all different kinds of ways can make it with almonds in it or cut toasted coconut this makes a lot of cookies but you can always save the dough I actually like to cut them out and freeze them okay just pull the dough together Pat it out a nice desk it's gonna roll it up in a little plastic wrap put it in the fridge for about 30 minutes that lets the dough relax it's much easier to roll out and it'll chill the butter just a little bit not too much perfect now I think I'm gonna find out when Miguel's up to why do I think it's gonna be just fabulous what a great idea so this Mike a block of wood and yes also voices on a block of wood they're gonna love this which we covered on um canvas I wish like painters drop cloth yeah exactly fantastic then I had some photo book is made of being over your blueprint yeah that's gonna be do I was a placemat skip - classic and what it is your scores those are fabric samples which I'm going to cut out and make them look like fabric sample yeah we're gonna hang there in the pergola that's just amazing cake it'll help your architects like they're gonna love it okay after my California is tea are you wearing your own yep okay go he'll see you later okay California is T is half ice tea and half fresh lemonade so first I'm gonna start with iced tea so I'm going to take four teabags good English tea I like to make a lot of it and then I pour four cups of boiling water on top and just let that steep oke I'm just gonna set that aside okay now for the lemonade fresh lemons got to do it so the first thing I need is freshly squeezed lemon juice I need one cup depending on the size of the lemons about five or six lemons [Music] apparently California is a really popular drink word has it that only Palmer drinks them and so now everybody there drinks it smells delicious these are big lemons so I got one cup of lemon juice out of about four or five lemons next I need 3/4 of a cup of superfine sugar are you super fun because it dissolves better and four cups of water [Music] okay give it a stir I'm going to take the teabags out of the ice tea okay pour that in okay I think I'll slice a few lemon slices and put it in I was like when it looks like exactly what it is perfect I'm gonna chill it I'm gonna serve it over ice that should serve about six to eight people it could be delicious so while this chills I'm gonna cut up my shortbread cookie place-cards and then I'm gonna make easy lobster paella I've been planning to ask the architect for lunch and when I went to a store and saw this cookie cutter in the shape of a hammer I thought that's perfect so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna roll out cookies and cut them in that shape and then put each person's name on it so they have a place card and a cookie to eat I'm just gonna roll the dough out I chilled it for about 30 minutes it just allows the dough to relax it's much easier to roll out I just want to keep the board floured you don't want to roll out the cookies and then you can't get them off the board I'm rolling it out to between a quarter and a half inch thick okay so that should be just about the right thickness so I'm gonna cut out eight cookies seven for everybody in one just in case and how great is there I put them on the parchment paper so they don't stick to the pan [Music] these are great cuz you really let the cut out cookies sitting there frigerator for a week and then bake them before you need them this is too much fun [Music] seven and eight I like to have a little bit of a shine on the cookies a little sprinkle of granulated sugar on the top does that cool okay into the oven 350 degrees for about 25 minutes - they're ever so slightly browned and then later I'm gonna write everybody's name on them and then Miguel will have them for the table setting mmm I love the smell of shortbread cookies those are gonna look great with people's names on them okay for lobster paella I'm gonna turn it up to 425 and I want to show you how I make really easy paella I actually used to avoid this because it was so complicated I thought why am I gonna bother making a big pot of things we have to cook everything individually so I decided I was gonna make it with lots of things I've already cooked and I'll show you how easy it is so first a quarter of a cup of oil and I'm gonna chop up some onions I don't wanted to have cups of onions so the first thing I did was I started on the cooktop but then I do most of the cooking in the oven so I'm not always standing over a hot pot and the second thing is instead of cooking each individual thing differently it has shrimp it has chicken it has sausage I decided I'm gonna use all things that are cooked like cook cabassa cooked lobster I decide to make it really special I imagine pan was the classic Spanish dish where you used up all the leftovers okay no saute those for about five minutes the meantime I'm going to cut up some red peppers so in order to julienne peppers so they're really nice-looking I'm just gonna cut straight down and then save that later for snacks and then just julienne about half inch strips this is a great dish to make when you're serving a crowd it's great to make it more quantities and you don't have to serve it the minute it gets out of the oven okay how the onions doing they're just starting to get a little translucent and put the peppers in and let them cook for about five minutes I just want to get the most flavor out of what you put in this is all gonna flavor the rice and then later I'm gonna add all kinds of delicious things to it put it in the oven okay the next thing is garlic I like lots of garlic so I'm gonna use like four or five cloves of garlic this can actually be a very inexpensive dish to make if you make it with cooked mussels and clams but I'm gonna make a special one today for the architects with lobster okay so about two tablespoons of garlic just put it in cook this for about a minute so the garlic doesn't burn okay next is the rice two cups of rice traditionally the Spanish use a short grain rice or a medium grain rice for this I like basmati rice I think it's really firm it's that great flavor so two cups of basmati rice and five cups of chicken stock you can use canned stock but I really prefer homemade okay now some great spices 1/2 teaspoon of saffron which is actually amazingly the stamens of crocuses keen vision collecting them and it's going to season it and it's gonna give a great yellow color 1/2 a teaspoon of crushed red pepper flakes give it a little heat not too so much that you can't taste the rest of the ingredients 1 teaspoon of salt and 1 teaspoon of pepper okay just give it a big stir let it come to a simmer put the lid on put the whole thing in the oven for 25 for 15 minutes and then I'm gonna make an avocado and grape fruit salad me delicious [Music] you so the players cook for 15 minutes with the lid on and now I'm just gonna take the lid off oh that's a lot of pie just gonna give it a stir okay it's gonna be wonderful and I'm gonna cook it for another 15 minutes with the lid off and that way the stock gets absorbed and the pie a really cooks gets a little dry and then I'm gonna add Lobster and lots of good things so the shortbread cookies have cooled and now I'm gonna make them into place cards I just think it's nice for everybody to have their name on something so we make something that I can write with which is confectioner sugar and a quarter of a cup of freshly squeezed lemon juice so that was a pound of confectioner's sugar a little bit of lemon juice just stir it in I want this to be thick writing consistency this looks like a lot of confectioner sugar but it ends up being very little okay it's slowly getting there it just takes a second for it to dissolve okay and here's the trick I'm gonna add a quarter cup of corn syrup which will make sure that it's free-flowing so it's easy to push through the pastry bag okay just mix that in okay that's it so this pastry bag I know it looks daunting but it's really not and it's got a coupling on it so that you can try different nozzles this is a small one but I think it's big enough to get the icing sugar through so just gonna put some I see in there okay so have to start with Frank Greenwald the architect Frank just do it slowly so you make sure you get it right Laura Joe like my short names and we go so the girls gonna join us like y'all this is amazing that's what you were doing with fabric and that's amazing these are place cards they're cooking in the shape of a hammer so can I leave in with you I'll read miss Alex good to go with the lobster pie I thought it'd be really nice to have something very refreshing like a grapefruit and avocado salad when I'm making something with avocado I always make a lemon vinaigrette because the lemon juice keeps the avocado from turning brown quarter of a cup of freshly squeezed lemon juice tablespoon of mustard 1/2 just goes of salt 1/2 a teaspoon of pepper when you whisk it together I'm gonna have a cup of olive oil so now while I'm whisking it was so much for the hours alone the mustard actually is an emulsifier kind of like an egg yolk so it makes the vinaigrette nice and thick okay so this is a Haas avocado it's brown when it's ripe I prefer them to the big green California avocados I think they have more flavor it's more concentrated they're from California but look how beautiful that is so just take the seed out just run your finger right along the inside of it [Music] and should pop right out just like that okay so I'm just gonna slice these lengthwise I find it's very hard to find ripe ones in the market so what I do is I buy them maybe three days before I'm actually going to use them and then they're perfectly ripe just like this okay and then I'm just going to dip them into the vinaigrette so they don't turn brown so we'll just make sure that avocado has some vinaigrette on all sides so it doesn't turn brown wallets sitting just arrange it nicely doesn't have to be so perfect what's about for house avocados it's good messy so the grapefruit so when it cut the peel off the grapefruit and I want to make sure that I get all of the white pith cuz it's really bitter and then because I don't like completel their membranes in the middle of the grapefruit I just like to cut the segment's out just put them in a big pile right in the middle it smells delicious okay we're just going to squeeze the rest of the grapefruit juice maybe a little cracked pepper on top so it's clear that its savory little drizzle of lemon vinaigrette and we have grapefruit and avocado salad all I have to do now is finish the paella oh my goodness that's a lot of Paia it's all the rice and the saffron and peppers and onions garlic just gonna be fantastic I just have a few things I want to add to it the first thing is some pear know which is anise flavored wine will occur and it's just gonna give it a nice fennel flavor so I need 1/3 of a cup just gonna turn the heat on a little bit mmm so all the liquids absorbed and it can really smell the saffron and garlic fantastic and this is the trick for really easy paella things that are already cooked so the first thing I have is one and a half pounds of cooked lobster meat I'm just going to big chunky pieces if the paella heat [Music] a little more expensive to buy it already cooked but certainly a huge difference in time I'm just gonna turn the heat off so the lobster doesn't cook anymore just steams and then I always like to do some kind of sausage but since Cabasa is already cooked Oh easy is that you can really find Cabasa and any kind of a really traditional Italian or its Polish sausage but any kind of it Adelie I'm gonna put in a pound of kielbasa just nice big slices so you can really see it okay that goes in okay and now another secret is frozen peas so all I'm gonna do really is put them in the hot rice and they're gonna defrost that's one 10 ounce package of frozen peas I'm just gonna mix it all in this looks amazing all the saffron rice and lobster kielbasa peppers mmm just going to fabulous and put the lid on and steam it for about 15 minutes and then I'm gonna serve it with lots of parsley and big chunks of lemon and lunch is ready [Music] all right Frank I have one question one's life aren't gonna be done I think it depends on whether we're gonna have lunch share everything so if I'm making lunch it's gonna take a longer time see all right you're done okay you can have your lunch record cheers huge difference in time I'm just gonna turn the heat off so the lobster doesn't cook anymore just steams and then I always like to do some kind of sausage but since koba's has already cooked always use that you can really find Cabasa and any kind of a really traditional Italian or it's Polish sausage but any kind of it Adelie I'm gonna put in a pound of kielbasa just nice big slices so you can really see it okay that goes in okay and now another secret is frozen peas so all I'm gonna do really is put them in the hot rice and they're gonna defrost that's one 10 ounce package of frozen peas I'm just gonna mix it all in this looks amazing all the saffron rice and lobster kielbasa peppers mmm system into fabulous I'm gonna put the lid on and steam it for about 15 minutes and then I'm gonna serve it with lots of parsley and big chunks of lemon and lunch is ready [Music] all right Frank I have one question one life aren't gonna be done I think it depends on whether we're gonna have lunch every day so if I'm making lunch it's gonna take a longer oops and then because I don't like communal their membranes in the middle of the grapefruit I just like to cut the segment's out just gonna put them in a big pile right in the middle it smells delicious okay I'm just gonna squeeze the rest of the grapefruit juice maybe a little cracked pepper on top so it's clear that it's savory little drizzle of lemon vinaigrette and we have grapefruit and avocado salad all I have to do now is finish the paella oh my goodness that's a lot of paia it's all the rice and the saffron and peppers and onions garlic just gonna be fantastic I just have a few things I want to add to it the first thing is some Perrineau which is anise flavored wine will occur it's just gonna give it a nice fennel flavor so I need 1/3 of a cup just gonna turn the heat on a little bit so all the liquids absorbed and it can really smell the saffron and garlic fantastic and this is the trick for really easy pea things that are already cooked so the first thing I have is one and a half pounds of cooked lobster meat person's name on it so they have a place card and a cookie to eat I'm just gonna roll the dough out I chilled it for about 30 minutes it just allows the dough to relax it's much easier to roll out I just want to keep the board flour I didn't want to roll out the cookies and then you can't get them off the board I'm rolling it out to between a quarter and a half inch thick okay so that should be just about the right thickness so I'm gonna

cutout cookies sitting there refrigerator for a week and then bake them before you need them this is too much fun [Music] at 7 &amp; 8 I like to have a little bit of a shine on the cookies a little sprinkle of granulated sugar on the top does that cool okay into the oven 350 degrees for about 25 minutes into there ever so slightly browned and then later I'm gonna write mmm I love the smell shortbread cookies those are gonna look great with people's names on them okay for lobster paella I'm gonna turn it up to 425 and I want to show you how I make really easy pea I actually used to avoid

Greenwald the architect friend just do it slowly so you make sure you get it right Laura Joe like for my short names and we go so the girls gonna join us like y'all this is amazing that's what you were doing of the fabric and that's amazing these are placed cards there's cookies in the shape of a hammer so can I leave him with you I run the salad good to go with the lobster pie I thought it'd be really nice to have something very refreshing like a grapefruit and avocado salad when I'm making something with avocado I always make a lemon vinaigrette because the lemon juice keeps the avocado from turning brown put of a cup of freshly squeezed lemon juice tablespoon of mustard 1/2 dispose of salt half a teaspoon of pepper when you whisk it together I'm gonna have a cup of olive oil so now

all the saffron rice and lobster kielbasa peppers we just kind of fabulous and put the lid on and steam it for about 15 minutes and then I'm gonna serve it with lots of parsley and big chunks of lemon and lunch is ready [Music] you [Music] all right Frank I have one question one's life aren't gonna be done I think it depends on whether we're gonna have lunch here every day so if I'm making lunch it's gonna take a longer okay all right you're done for you okay you can have your lunch [Music] I'm building a barn in my garden with a working kitchen and I love my architect I wanted to say thank you to his whole team and I thought what better way than to make them a wonderful lunch Miguel is doing the table for me it's gonna be amazing I think we have the blueprint for a perfect lunch for place cards and making shortbread cookies in the shape of hammers with everyone's name on it and they're gonna do double duty as dessert and a big lobster paella that's so easy to make I'm serving it with a refreshing grapefruit and avocado salad and to drink a lemony California iced tea I love when a good plan comes together [Music] so I've got a terrific blueprint for this meal I'm gonna have the entire lunch on the table when we sit down including dessert and dessert is gonna do double duty as place cards for the guests so what I'm gonna make first is I'm gonna make shortbread cookies in the shape of a hammer they're really cool and then we write everybody's name on it so first I have to make the shortbread I need 3/4 of a pound of butter 1 cup of sugar butter has to be at room temperature so it's really soft and that means sometimes leaving it out overnight I'm just gonna put it on very low speed I don't want to whip it a lot I just wanted to mix together I just use the paddle attachment on that mixer you can also use a hand mixer once you spoon a good vanilla and then just mix it together until the butter and the sugar are combined I think the meantime I get that flour ready and it's going to have cups of flour I'm gonna put it in a sifter a quarter teaspoon of salt just sift them together okay now I'm just gonna add it slowly to the butter and sugar mixture so these are going to be both desert and the place cards it just starts to come together in a sec so I'm gonna chill this for about 30 minutes until gets firm enough to roll out okay now that does just pull together which is perfect I'm gonna clear the decks a little bit of flour this is really my favorite cookie and make it all different kinds of ways can make it with almonds in it or cook toasted coconut this makes a lot of cookies but you can always save the dough I actually like to cut them out and freeze them okay just pull the dough together Pat it out a nice disc it's gonna roll it up in a little plastic wrap put it in the fridge for about 30 minutes that lets the dough relax it's much easier to roll out and it'll chill the butter chest a little bit not too much perfect now I think I'm gonna find it when Miguel is up - why do I think it's gonna be just fabulous great what a great idea so this is like a block of wood and yes also horses on a block of wood they're gonna love this which we covered on um canvas oh it's like a painter's drop cloth exactly fantastic then I had some photocopies made of the of your blueprint like that yeah that's gonna do I would get the placemats exact and what it is yours works those are fabric samples which I'm going to cut out and make them look like fabric sample yeah we're gonna the pergola that's just amazing click it I hope you like you take tonight yeah they're gonna love it okay after my California is tea are you reading your own yep okay go see you later okay California is T is half ice tea and half fresh lemonade so first I'm gonna start with iced tea so we'll take 40 bags good English tea I like to make a lot of it and then report four cups of boiling water on top and just let that steep oke I'm just gonna set that aside okay now for the lemonade fresh lemons got to do it so the first thing I need is freshly squeezed lemon juice I need one cup depending on the size of the lemons about five or six lemons apparently at California this is a really popular drink the word has it that all the Palmer drinks them and so now everybody there drinks it [Applause] it smells delicious these are big lemons so I got one cup of lemon juice out of about four or five lemons next I need 3/4 of a cup of superfine sugar are you super fun because it dissolves better and four cups of water [Music] okay give it a stir I'm going to take the teabags out of the ice tea okay pour that in okay I think I'll slice a few lemon slices and put it in I was like when it looks like exactly what it is perfect I'm gonna chill it I'm gonna serve it over ice that should serve about six to eight people it could be delicious so while this chills I'm gonna cut up my shortbread cookie place cards and then I'm gonna make easy lobster paella I've been planning to ask the architects for lunch and when I went to a store and saw this cookie cutter in the shape of a hammer I thought that's perfect so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna roll out cookies and cut them in that shape and then put each person's name on it so they have a place card and a cookie to eat I'm just gonna roll the dough out I chilled it for about 30 minutes it just allows the dough to relax it's much easier to roll out I just want to keep the board flour I didn't want to roll out the cookies and then you can't get them off the board I'm rolling it out to between a quarter and a half inch thick okay so that should be just about the right thickness so I'm gonna cut out eight cookies seven for everybody and one just in case and how great is that I put them on the parchment paper so they don't stick to the pan [Music] you [Music] these are great cuz you really let the cut out cookies sitting there frigerator for a week and then bake them before you need them this is too much fun [Music] at 7 &amp; 8 I like to have a little bit of a shine on the cookies a little sprinkle of granulated sugar on the top does that cool okay into the oven 350 degrees for about 25 minutes into there ever so slightly browned and then later I'm gonna write everybody's name on them and then Miguel will have them for the table setting I love the smell of shortbread cookies those are gonna look great with people's names on them okay for lobster paella I'm gonna turn it up to 425 and I want to show you how I make really easy paella I actually used to avoid this because it was so complicated I thought why am I gonna bother making a big pot of things we have to cook everything individually so I decided I was gonna make it with lots of things I've already cooked and I'll show you how easy it is so first a quarter of a cup of oil and I'm gonna chop up some onions that wanted to have cups of onions so the first thing I did was I started on the cooktop but then I do most of the cooking in the oven so I'm not always standing over a hot pot and the second thing is instead of cooking each individual thing differently it has shrimp it has chicken it has sausage I decided I'm gonna use all things that are cooked like cook kielbasa cooked lobster I decide to make it really special I imagine pan was the classic Spanish dish where you used up all the leftovers okay no saute those for about five minutes meantime I'm gonna cut up some red peppers so in order to julienne peppers so they're really nice-looking I'm just gonna cut straight down and then save that later for snacks and then just julienne about half inch strips this is a great dish to make when you're serving a crowd it's great to make in large quantities and you don't have to serve it the minute it gets out of the oven okay how the onions doing they're just starting to get a little translucent and put the peppers in and let them cook for about five minutes just want to get the most flavor out of what you put in this is all gonna flavor the rice and then later I'm gonna add all competent
