[Music] my husband Jeffrey and I have been married for a really long time and tonight's our anniversary you know ever since I used to have send him boxes of brownies in college I knew that the way to his heart was with really good food so tonight I'm gonna make him one of his favorite meals maybe with a little French twist I hope he loves [Music] Jeffery's really creature of habit she likes really traditional things and even those shrimp love cocktail sauce is a fairly seventies thing I've updated it ever so slightly but it's still the shrimp for cocktail sauce but he loves so the first thing I'm going to do is flavor the water before I throw to the shrimp so 1/2 a lemon just squeeze it right into the boiling water just throw the whole lemon in it's just fine and some salt and then just put the whole shrimp in I actually cook them in the shell I think they're easier to peel and I think they say moister this is the key three minutes that's it they'll be done and if you cook them for too long they're gonna be really tough so with a shrimp and cocktail sauce I'm gonna make steak with Bernays Jeffrey's gonna be very happy and rosemary roasted potatoes I think be a great dinner we've been married for 35 years it seems like it seems like just the era - I made a big mistake once and forgetting our 20th anniversary and I'll never make that mistake again so it's three minutes and you can tell because they're really firm so you know they're done out of the water into ice water to stop the cooking okay that stops the cooking they're nice and cool so take the where these little swimmers are just peel right around they're pretty easy to do and just leave the tail on just like that now the back you want to just run your knife right down the back of it and take out that little sort of intestinal tract not pretty nobody needs to eat that and that's it perfectly cooked shrimp right into the bowl I know it's really old-fashioned but you'd be surprised how much people like it it's the first thing to go at a party whoo Jeffrey's snuck out a while ago I wonder what he's up to they better not be a blonde involved [Music] I thought of a very special gift and it it evokes actually how I'm and I got to know each other when I first met her she was in high school she used to send me shoeboxes filled with brownies like clockwork every every two weeks so I thought that it would be really great to get her a box of brownies because that would bring back the memories of when we first met [Music] they can't have shrimp with that really good cocktail sauce so I've updated it a little bit but it's really fairly traditional I'm gonna start with the other half of lemon so the next thing is ketchup good ketchup you want about a half a cup I'm nice noise as the bottle makes half a cup of chili sauce gives it lots of spice just like that okay that's gonna be really good it's a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce few dashes of Tabasco I don't like it too hot you can make as hot as you like and the last ingredients horseradish I like lots of horseradish so I'm gonna put in three tablespoons to put in as much as you like and that's it and the good news is Jeffrey's gonna think I've been working all day and only you and I along the truth mmm this looks good it should be good and spicy well that's a flavor this one is so good with the shrimp but I like to get some Browning's okay how about can you give me a small box of brownies that would be terrific that would be great it would be terrific [Music] remember the way old-fashioned shrimp used to be served it was like in a margarita glass with the cocktail sauce in the middle and the shrimp hanging over the side you know just like this I think we can be a little more modern than that so I'm just gonna take a pretty white plate silver dish put the cocktail sauce in the middle and then just a ramp to the stripper nicely around the outside kind of like with the tails out just sort of neatly don't want to look like a dog's breakfast and then maybe just for decoration since there's a lemon in it I use the women let's see you know it's pretty old fashioned dessert maybe I'll do an old-fashioned lemon decoration where you can take take your knife and just go back and forth go right through until you get to the center of the lemon look how funny that is that's great okay I can't wait for tonight that's gonna be really good so I thought rosemary roast potatoes will be great with a steak with fern Aires sauce Rosemary's really strong you don't want a lot it's gonna chop it up really fine Rosemary's really sort of a rough kind of leaf and you don't want to eat a whole leaf potatoes olive oil you don't even have to measure just drizzle it on lots of good salt they use kosher salt pepper and all this for just rosemary right on top okay just toss them with your hands spread them out in one layer and I'm gonna roast them at about 400 degrees really hot temperature for about an hour they're gonna be really crisp and brown on the outside and just delicious and tender on the inside [Music] I bought a present yes and I got to jazz it up a little bit okay if you have something you can help me wait I do I have all the time [Music] there you go that's great thanks Michael thanks just saved my life I really appreciate it okay I'll let you know how she does okay I know everybody thinks my recipes start with a pound of butter well this one doesn't it only starts with a half a pound of butter and you need butter to make good Bearnaise sauce which I'm gonna do it's a tarragon flavored butter and it's so delicious with a rib eye steak the first thing is quart of a cup of white wine the next thing is good white wine vinegar or champagne vinegar another quart of a cup save a half a cup total right into the pan and then we're gonna flavor it so the first thing I need is I have lots of chopped shallots that these are so wonderful they're sort of sweeter than onions I'm gonna add two tablespoons of chopped shallots then I'm gonna add fresh tarragon it's a very mild herb it's got an incredibly delicate flavor but very distinctive mmm it's really good and it's really important for been a sauce so I'm gonna add about a tablespoon of freshly chopped tarragon right into the mixture little bit of salt a little bit of pepper love this the smell of the wine and the vinegar and the tarragon it's wonderful so I'm just gonna let that boil froat like five minutes until it's reduced to like two tablespoons total so the next thing is butter so while the butter is melting I'm just go separates mix they want three egg yolks just separate them put the yoke right into the blender what the egg yolks room temperature kind of like making mayonnaise three egg yolks [Music] the vinegars minister is perfectly reduced and the butters hot so everything's going to go into the egg yolks so the first thing is that vinegar mixture that's so much flavor in this [Music] all the shallots and the tarragon vinegar and wet woman this is the trick you put the lid on and then take this little things off and start puree [Music] and then I'm gonna take the hot butter and just pour it slowly through the opening with the blender on and it's gonna emulsify it and it's gonna cook the egg yolks two more tablespoons of tarragon just at the last minute so it's really fresh tasting and who said French food is complicated how easy is that and it's done and I can't wait to taste it it's got lots of flavor it's a really good sauce and it'll be so delicious on the ribeye steak mmm how bad can that be that's just wonderful and the trick here is I'm gonna let it sit awhile and it's gonna solidify a little bit but just before I serve it I'm gonna put in two tablespoons of hot water and it's gonna really cream me again so it'll be ready whenever we're ready for dinner [Music] for an anniversary dinner I thought I'd make Geoffrey steak with Bernays you know when we were first married in 1968 steaks used to be these big thick things they were just so unbelievably huge and I realized that the Europeans really eat much thinner steaks and I think they have so much more flavor they're easier to cook and they're really much more elegant so I thought steak with Bearnaise sauce they should be thin steaks so I've got two ribeye steaks I'm just gonna leave a match take a little bit of the chill off and I've left Geoffrey in charge as a grill [Music] almost there b√©arnaise sauce is done the steaks just need to be seasoned and will be ready for the grill I'm gonna brush the sticks with oil first salt and pepper lots of good pepper okay they turn them you want to season both sides battle boil I think I smell the grill nope it's not Jeffrey on fire lighter fluid oh that stuff that guys like [Music] [Laughter] [Music] perfectly [Music] there's sometimes right under there so I thought string beans and shallots would be just great with steak and Bearnaise sauce always nice to have a green vegetable so I'm gonna do is I'm going to saute the shallots a little bit of butter and olive oil olive oil because it has a higher burning temperature and the butter because of this great flavor just heat that up okay then go the shouts I just large dice them I think it looks great when you can see them rather than missing them meanwhile I'm going to take the string beans and get them ready this is called an Erica ver and it's pretty much widely available everywhere now take off that end so that should be enough beans for Jeffrey and Vinnie okay into a big pot of boiling salted water just for like a minute just until it brings out the green color and it cooks it a little bit because I'm gonna finish the cooking and that's sauteed in the pan with the shallots that looks like about five minutes okay string beans are done shallots cook I'm gonna duck them a nice water just to stop the cooking and you can either let them sit or just put them directly into the shallots which I'm gonna do right now this really sets the green color it makes them really good no eyes [Music] lots of salt and pepper toss them all together [Music] that's great that looks like it's great flavor teens are perfectly cooked really still sort of al dente it's a great party dish because you can make the beans and the showers separately and then just saute them off at the last minute it's gonna be perfect for the two of us a shrimp with some big cocktail sauce watch me get all over my give them a minute okay put them on the plate cover them in foil and they're just gonna rest for about 15 minutes okay okay okay you're in charge I'll take great I'll leave you with the shrimp okay with the shrimp okay so I've left my Bearnaise sauce in room temperature and this is the secret and add a few tablespoons of hot water [Music] and nobody will know that I didn't make it right now [Music] he's great they're really crisp on the outside inside can you smell the spiciness to the rosemary so clear what it is not a sonnet and I'm sad so I still got one anniversary out of 36 come come with me give a surprise are we going [Music] I got a surprise I got a surprise anniversary surprise for mobilization I like that I got you a present reminds me at least of what you used to give me just when I first met and used to send you this press used to sell shares to put it in a shoebox I used to send you Brandis in college right the brownie happy anniversary the symbol and why don't we do this all the time
