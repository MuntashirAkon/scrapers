[Music] what I've done is donate lunch and an auction to raise money to preserve the Hamptons and the people who won the auction are coming for lunch today yikes I'm making Asian grilled salmon for the crust infused with ginger and scallions served with a crunchy noodle salad with a peanut dressing that's packed with flavors and for dessert my classic lemon cake updated with yogurt and fresh blueberry sauce this is gonna be fun so the first thing I'm gonna make for my lunch today was that getting facial is a crunchy noodle salad with lots of Asian spices so I'm going to start with thin pasta actually like thin spaghetti for it it seems to absorb the flavor the best just put that in the bowl so the first thing I do is do some vegetables peppers and scallions then I'm gonna make a great sauce for it so red peppers I'm doing a salad like this I just find it it's nice to have straight pieces of julienned peppers so that just run my knife down the edge the rest of this is for snacking later I'm just cut them right down the middle I like when things are sort of the same size as the pasta these are Hollin peppers I find they're really great year-round but if you have local peppers you can use those too okay the next thing is sugar snap peas about a pound I'm gonna salt the water and then grab them for about three to five minutes just until they're crisp tender while that's happening I'm gonna cut up some scallions just chop their little Enzo off and then I'm just gonna run my knife right down the middle okay just big rough chop okay first sky is going to the salad and the red peppers the next thing is the sugar snap peas but I'm gonna shock them first which means taking them out of the boiling water putting them in ice water to stop the cooking really sets the color and it stops them from getting overcooked it just takes a second perfect just make sure they're really cold and they are right into the salad it's really cold okay now the sauce it's got great flavor okay the first thing is a cup of vegetable oil I don't use olive oil here because I'm not the other Asian flavors to come out so I wanted it clear oil there's no flavor right into the bowl a quarter of a cup of rice wine vinegar you find this in the Asian section new grocery store third of a cup of soy sauce 3 tablespoons of toasted sesame oil this isn't the clear one paste the one that's the dark one it's got lots of flavor one tablespoon of honey give it a little sweetness and two cloves of chopped garlic okay the next things fresh ginger it's a route like this just great and you want to peel it and then I'm gonna grate it this is classic Asian spice fresh ginger I love it it's really woody so the finer you grade it the better especially if it's we're not cooking it bini as it ran just grate it like this this is really tough so you want to be sure that the rasp is really sharp the ginger is not only gonna give it lots of flavor but it's gonna give it some heat which is great so what is the spoon of grated ginger if you want it hotter you can always put more in okay and this is the good stuff half cold peanut butter that's really what gives it sort of an Indonesian flavor and you want to use smooth peanut butter and then just whisk it all together you can make this sauce way in advance and you can make the salad in advance but not too far because actually the soy sauce will break down the noodles so if it's sitting for a day or two it's gonna get really kind of mushy not pretty so that's the dressing it smells great it's gonna be really good on the noodles I think the last thing gonna put in the sauce is some toasted sesame seeds i toasted them in a dry pan just put about two tablespoons in I'm gonna save the rest to decorate the salad okay right on the salad so this is the warm noodles are you spaghetti pin spaghetti and the scallions sugar snap peas red peppers toss it all together I like lots of sauce on it this looks wonderful I'm so good with the Asian salmon mmm looks colorful I've got lots of flavors I think it just needs two things need some chopped parsley three tablespoons I love the look of fresh green herbs on something just makes it look like it has lots of flavor just a rough chop and then some more sesame seeds so it looks like sesame toss it all together mmm smells so good on the peanut sauce of the soy and all the flavors hit the hot pasta can really smell it lots of vegetables it's gonna be delicious and next I'm gonna make a lemon yogurt cake it's not only good but it's good for you I know ever a petition for starting every recipe with a pound of butter but this one's actually a lemon cake that's made with yogurt and vegetable oil so it's it's even good for you and it's delicious so I'm going to start with the dry ingredients one and a half cups of flour two teaspoons of baking powder and a half teaspoon of salt just sift those together okay one cup of yogurt I use whole milk yogurt I think this gives a good flavor okay one cup of sugar you can make it with that butter but not with that sugar okay three extra-large eggs I was break them into another Bowl just in case you get a bad egg I always use room-temperature eggs and I'm baking really makes the cake slider half a teaspoon of vanilla extract two teaspoons of lemon zest that's actually that the zest of one lemon just right into the bowl this is what gives it all its flavor I actually think the zest has more flavor than the juice so whenever I make something with lemon I always put the zest in it smells good already and then later we're gonna use the juice and make a syrup lemon syrup for it that's about two teaspoons okay I'm just gonna whisk it all together the idea for this recipe actually came from a recipe I saw that my friend Dorie Greenspan wrote for yogurt cake and I thought I'm gonna be interesting to see if I can adapt my lemon cake into a lemon yogurt cake worked beautifully okay I'm just gonna take the dry ingredients whisk them in I'm just gonna toss them with my hand make sure they're well mixed and just slowly whisk them in [Music] you want to whisk them just enough until it's stirred but not over mix it I love that you can make this without a mixer okay the next thing I need is a half a cup of vegetable oil just a flavorless oil just stir it in [Music] so what are we so interesting to have two people come for lunch that I've never met before but Doug and Paige Campbell are gonna be like okay into the pan I've greased and floured a loaf pan just pour this right in that was pretty easy k wasn't it perfect into the oven 350 degrees for about 50 minutes and then I'm gonna drizzle it with a lemon glaze [Music] so the lemon yogurt kick is out of the oven and while it cools I'm gonna make a lemon syrup just pour over it make it even better so I need 1/3 of a cup of lemon juice need a little more [Music] [Applause] [Music] we're gonna heat it up with third of a cup of sugar [Music] it's gonna let that come to a boil until it becomes just very clear take a few minutes I'm gonna see if I can get my cake out of the pan so this cake has lemon zest in it there's lemon juice on it and if that's not enough I make blueberry sauce for it came out perfectly just gonna cook this until it becomes clear until the sugar dissolves you know these guys spent a lot of money for this lunch I hope it's good enough for them okay this is perfect sugars dissolved I'm just gonna spoon it right over the cake and then what it does is it just soaks right into the cake keeps it really moist it has lots of great moments over I hope they'll take lemon ever chocolate any day so this good just the way it is but for the fresh blueberry sauce you'd be better [Music] I'm a New Yorker kick on its own it's just fine but since these guests are really special I'm gonna make a blueberry sauce for the cake we'll make it into a whole dessert so the first thing I'm gonna do is take three half pints of fresh blueberries then I'm gonna prove Anila sugar in it and what it is is sugar that I've immersed vanilla beans in you can buy in the store or you can make it yourself after I take the seeds out of the vanilla beans I just put the pods right in here and it smells absolutely amazing I love this I've had this jar I think for 20 years I just keep adding vanilla and sugar to it so I need one and a half cups of vanilla sugar that's one cup and another half try and get it into the cup and on the counter okay that's perfect okay plus a third of a cup of water I'm just gonna cook this together bring you to a simmer for about 15 minutes and then later I'm gonna add some fresh lemon juice while that's cooking though the marinade Asian salmon except for the main course for my lunch I'm gonna make one of my favorite dishes Eli's Asian salmon Eva I say bars were my dearest friends and he makes this in his restaurants in his stores it's so good I'm gonna pour cup of soy sauce a quarter of a cup of rice vinegar it's got a lot of ingredients but it's really worth it in terms of the flavor it's so good the quarter of a cup of freshly squeezed lemon juice but not a lot of fish can really stand up to this kind of flavor but Sam and cam okay the next thing is two tablespoons of oyster sauce it's a very classic Asian sauce it's sweet and spicy that's 2 tablespoons 1 tablespoon of fish sauce which is incredibly salty use it sparingly tablespoon of sesame oil which I also used in the noodles I'm wondering 1/2 teaspoons of chili paste and sometimes there's garlic in it sometimes it doesn't it doesn't matter but it's got lots of heat so use it sparingly okay next thing is choose scallions chopped just sort of a rough chop I think about Eli's food that always amazes me is how simple it is and how incredibly flavorful everything he does is to enhance the basic ingredients and that's what this doesn't make the salmon taste incredibly delicious ok scallion goes in then I have 2 tablespoons of chopped fresh ginger and 2 tablespoons of chopped fresh garlic okay I'm just gonna stir this up I'm gonna pour 1/3 of it right over the salmon just don't let the salmon and then I'm gonna use something unusual it's panko which is Japanese breadcrumbs about a cup and a half if you can't find them and you can really find them in the grocery section now but if you can't find them you can just use dry breadcrumbs I'm just gonna put right over the top of this it makes like a bread crust that's just so delicious and it's gonna absorb all of the marinade so really absorbs a lot of the flavor and it makes a nice top crust on it it's fantastic and the rest of the sauce goes right over it just pour it really carefully over the top don't worry if some of it falls off you can just put it right back on I'm just gonna spoon any sauce right over the top that's of the aluminum foils for to make sure it all stays in good let it marinate for about 15 minutes I'm gonna finish my blueberry sauce and I think the candle should be here just about them [Music] Eli's Asian Salmons been marinating for about 15 minutes and it's really nice it's got a nice breadcrumb and scallion crust when I bake it 500 degrees thread 20 minutes it's gonna be really crisp on the top and so juicy inside be sure your oven is very clean before you turn it on 500 degrees that's gonna be delicious so the sauce is reduced is so nice and thick it's amazing there isn't vanilla sugar can really smell it smells wonderful now what I'm going to do is just strain it and all it is really is blueberries and sugar and vanilla and if you press the berries through the sieve end up with a really nice thick sauce and you get to use all the blueberry let's see you can see some right there I'm gonna add a little bit of lemon juice to it you just think a little bit of acidity sort of cuts the sugar a little bit of lemon juice in it just a touch of lemon juice better half a tablespoon just really gives a saw some more depth of flavor and that's it I'm really small the fresh blueberries and vanilla sugar a little bit of lemon juice just gonna let that cool just to be delicious on the lemon yogurt cake and desserts ready so the fish is done it looks great just like meat it's a good idea to let fish rest so what you want to do is just cover with aluminum foil cover it pretty tightly and all the juices will get back into the fish and to be moist and delicious all ready to go for lunch yeah for you oh they're so gorgeous are you come on pitch like it just miss that and absolutely delicious so what's the secret ingredient in salmon I've got ginger and soy sauce and scallions and all kinds of flavors we might be taking this recipe [Music] thank you if there are glaze on top of the cake definitely fresh lemon juice glaze it's a little bit of sugar and lemon juice cook together and it's what keeps the cake so moist it's nice it's not too overwhelming plum and it's just the right amount well here's to new friends and the Hamptons
