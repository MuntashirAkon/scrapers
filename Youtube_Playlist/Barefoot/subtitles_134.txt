so we're off to the beach of the dogs and since we're having hot dogs or chicken sausages I thought what would be more perfect with its and really good potato salad so the potatoes are done I'm going to drain them so I took them for about 10 minutes and then I let them steam for another 10 minutes so that's three pounds of new potatoes for small ones you can use red ones or white ones whichever you likes and I'm just going to let them steam and the steam really gets into the potatoes and cooks them beautifully so next I'm going to make the sauce so 1 cup of mayonnaise quarter of a cup of buttermilk or white wine or chicken stock whatever you have just let's get together until it's creamy so adding some kind of liquid to mayonnaise take the whip that sort of gloppy flavor and it makes it more like a sauce now I'm going to lots of flavor two tablespoons of Dijon mustard two tablespoons of coarse mustard it's this grainy mustard really has great flavor and it also looks like mustard so you know exactly what's in it and then lots of fresh dill that I have a cup of chopped fresh dill and that should be about a half a cup teaspoon of salt teaspoon of pepper I'm just going to whisk this all together and I've got this off actually in the summer you can make a huge amount of this if you're having potato salad a lot and then just use that you make the potatoes darling leave it in the fridge okay potatoes should be ready so going to clean up a little bit and see how they are perfect and they look beautiful so let me cut up the potatoes and she's going to quarter these guys if they're really big you can cut them in smaller pieces but quarters are just about right I use small round potatoes so you use the skins they're very thin skin and actually the skins have a lot of nutrition in them so that's it for the potatoes and then I let them cool a little bit while I chop up some celery and red onion for it one of the things that's really important for me when I'm making salads it's not just the flavor and the color but also the texture and with this salads really nice to have a little bit of a crunch with the celery and red onions so I need maybe about a half a cup of celery and red onion in this nice rough chop remember this the homemade salad supposed to look like a homemade shell don't obsess about having perfect size pieces that's crazy [Music] when you're cutting red onions leave the back part attached keep your fingers out of the way just do slices like that and then cut straight down really let the blade do the work by moving it rather than pushing it move the blade that's a couple red onion that's going to give a nice flavor okay thank you is it cool enough so we put the dressing on [Music] toss it all together this is great salad because if it's it's a little bit really absorbs into the flavor of the potatoes this looks good and then toss in all the red onion and celery give it lots of crunch and flavor it's really correct I'm actually not going to check it for seasonings right now because it's warm and it's going to be served cold better to check the seasonings when it's the temperature you're going to eat it so I want to put in the refrigerator and pack it up later and take it to the beach
