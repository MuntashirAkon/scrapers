butternut squash is perfect thing for risotto with saffron the staphon's really spicy and the butternut squash is really sweet when you're peeling butternut squash you want to use a nice sharp PLA not those sort of vegetable peelers that you find in the hardware store you want something really good and this one's really sharp this is the quickest way I find to peel it just fill the entire outside and then get a really good big sharp knife major knife cut it in half keep your fingers out of the way just like that at the end like this so stand it up cut it in half you can boil this but instead I'm going to actually roast it I think it really brings out the sweetness sort of caramelize is it a little bit so this parts the easy part just a good dice so that's the top of this and then the bottom just going to cut it in half take out the seeds you can actually roast those I like pumpkin seeds so for the butternut squash and then again just on big cubes they don't have to be perfect square so don't obsess about it [Music] okay that's one butternut squash little olive oil stand temper okay chop it all together into the oven 400 degrees for about 25 to 30 minutes until it's really tender and sweet butternut squash is already in the oven it smells so good I need six cups of chicken stock I really liked any film made chicken stock but if you don't have it use a king [Music] okay now some pancetta pancetta Italian bacon but frankly any kind of good quality bacon would do too so I'm just going to dice it up it gives great flavor to risotto so some butter that six tablespoons into the pot and the pancetta need two large shallots or about a half a cup okay now I need we're going to have cups of arborio rice it's the Italian rice really special for risotto just going to pour it right in okay that's good all the rice is coated with butter so it's perfect I'm going to add a half a cup of white wine now this is a key to good risotto is you want to add chicken stock by the ladleful to ladle to the time if you add it too fast the risotto cooks on the outside and on the inside if you add it too slowly it gets mushy two ladles and then I'm going to add the key ingredient which is saffron I love it's spicy it's the stamens of crocuses which is why it's so expensive that a teaspoon of saffron give it a stir and then probably take about 25 minutes as the stock is absorbed into the rice you just want to add another few ladle full it's just a little more stock butternut squash is perfect I want to do this as soon as the risotto is completely cooked and the rice is done to stir it in and the last thing I need is one cup of grated Parmesan and this is the most delicious lunch all in one pot and the good news is it's ready look risotto updating you it is good butternut squash risotto is thank you
