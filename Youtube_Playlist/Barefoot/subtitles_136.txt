[Music] my friend Victoria Munro has a wonderful art gallery in East Hampton and every month she gives a party for a new exhibition I'm gonna cater the party this time and I'm gonna do a food table that's really easy to cook and consider a couple of hours and still look great so I thought I'd make grilled lemon chicken on sticks and a set a sauce for dipping juicy ripe figs served with thinly sliced prosciutto Greek spinach and feta strudels called spanakopita puff pastry cheese draws fruit and cheese platter and my friend Miguel is making the most amazing food topiaries inspired by the gallery I'm gonna use a nice big white cloth as my canvas and I'll create for Victoria an edible work of art grilled lemon chicken with satay dip is a great thing to make for cocktail party you can do a lot of it in advance I'll show you how so the first thing I want to do is marinate the chicken lemon juice olive oil fresh thyme so it really gets into the chicken the cup of lemon juice fresh lemon juice 3/4 of a cup of good olive oil now I need a tablespoon of fresh thyme 2 teaspoons of kosher salt it's really like making a lemon vinaigrette and 1 teaspoon of pepper and I'm just gonna whisk it all together for boneless chicken breasts with the skin off - I was gonna put them right in the marinade just put them in turn them over make sure they're really covered in the marinade okay now we're Gala big our it and get the table started [Music] it's gonna be really funny love my friend Victoria Monroe she has a fabulous gallery so I just picked a menu that I can make an advance things that consider room temperature really easily and for the bar it's gonna be water and wine really simple and everybody's gonna help them I want to do some topiaries with food what's around exact tomatoes and strawberries oh how fabulous you'll see we could always knocks my socks off and I've got the tablecloth sorry you want to help me put it on okay great so let me show you something I learned in decades of catering how to get rid of all this excess fabric and make the Tim Club really neat so put your finger right here where the excess fabric is and then you take the cloth from the other corner and pull it straight up along the front and everything so that's folded for us takes a few times to figure it out what you do it makes such a difference and now but it's also just take this and put your finger back in that corner and pull this straight across and now give a nice neat top and a perfect corner okay Miguel I'm gonna leave you on your own what I can't wait to see what you do so the next thing we're gonna make is gonna be great for a food table at the gallery our spinach strudels and they're called spanakopita so the first thing I have here is one bunch of scallions chopped and better half a cup of olive oil just saute for about five minutes until the scallions are wilted and then two ten ounce boxes of frozen chopped spinach just squeeze the liquid out not so it's bone-dry just said most of the liquid is out I'm a second box sometimes people do this in a kitchen towel but you just ruin the kitchen towel so I'll just do it with your nose okay I'm just gonna take the sauteed onions and olive oil I'm just gonna mix the cold spinach with the warm scallions some adding eggs next I don't want them to scramble okay three eggs just let's go mix it lightly and then just added to the spinach since scallions okay mix that in so I'm gonna add 8 ounces of feta just Greek cheese goes with spinach strudels that 8 ounces right in okay mix that in now I'm gonna add some fresh dill okay that should be about 2 tablespoons okay now salt and pepper 1/2 a teaspoon of salt 1/2 a teaspoon of pepper and just mix it all up and that's the filling perfect okay so now for the phyllo dough I'll show you what this is so it's in the freezer in the grocery store it's a very very thin dough pastry showing a house in earnest it's like paper thin that's how thin it is I'm gonna take one sheet brush it with melted butter just brush it all over but quickly and then the second sheet right on top you want to place it on top of it because of the butter it won't slide right on top first that with melted butter so I'm piling up ten sheets of phyllo dough brushing with butter in between and sometimes with bread crumbs okay that's ten so I'm going to take a quarter of the filling and just run it right along the edge of this of the strudel and while I'm doing this I'm going to take this damp cloth and put it right on top of the phyllo dough that I haven't used yet to keep it moist so pick up one corner and pull it right up over the filling and take the middle and if it tears don't worry about it you're just gonna keep folding it rolling it up want it to be even perfect okay take this strew don't put it right on the baking sheet okay brush the top with butter so it gets nice and brown when it bakes and then with a sharp knife I'm just going to score the top so after its baked it's very easy to cut I like to do diagonal slices if you'd like them any other way but anyway you like okay then I'm gonna make the other four rolls and later these are going to bake at 400 degrees for about 12 minutes and after that I'm gonna make satay sauce for the chicken and the cheese straws so for the party I'm doing my friend Victoria's art gallery next thing we're gonna make is set a dip for the grilled lemon chicken satay dip is a Indonesian peanut sauce and it's really good with strips of grilled lemon chicken so what I've done here is I've cooked a small red onion and some olive oil and sesame oil I'm gonna add why don't I have teaspoons of chopped garlic fresh garlic and then I'm gonna add some ginger this is what ginger looks like when if you buy it in the store and what you do is take a knife and just peel off the outside and then chop it up I already have some chopped here but it's good to cook it because it's kind of woody and about 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of chopped ginger and 1/4 of a teaspoon of hot pepper flakes she's a red hot peppers you don't want too much just enough for some heat and just cook that for about five minutes just until it's all soft them together okay while that's cooking I'm gonna get the spanakopita out of the [Music] the spinach strudels mmm they've done they're nice and brown and really crisp on the outside and then when they're cool I'm just gonna cut them all the way through and serve them unless big square plate I think it's gonna be great so the onions garlic and ginger are already softened I'm gonna add a lot of ingredients two tablespoons of red wine vinegar few tablespoons of good soy sauce and 2 tablespoons of actually sherry not sure you're gonna grow but after sharing and putting a cup of brown sugar korie's cup of ketchup and a half a cup of [Music] so I'm gonna put in together we're gonna have teaspoons of fresh lime juice I'm just gonna cook this on the low heat until it's all blended I just can't wait to see what the girls during those two fries they sound amazing I'm going to create opre and I'm going to cover them with tomatoes and mozzarella balls [Music] taking the same idea from mr. combs I got this fear next thing fickt aureus gallery albany is cheese straws but cheese straws could be a daunting thing to make but I have a secret weapon frozen puff pastry you can find it in the freezer section of almost any grocery store in the United States and you wanted very cold I defrosted it overnight in the refrigerator so it's still very cold and now I'm gonna roll it out just a little bit until it's about ten inches by 12 inches just a little bit bigger and you want to work really fast so it stays cold the egg wash which I'm gonna brush on it's gonna make the cheese which I'll have later stick puff pastry is layers of flour and butter and when the heat hits it it just puffs up and gets really light and flaky so I'm gonna put on grier about 1/2 a cup I'm just gonna sprinkle it on so evenly I've got a quarter of a cup of parmesan it's finely grated sprinkle it over evenly don't neglect the corners you want to be sure everybody gets a little bit of the cheese's a little bit of fresh thyme I have to say I do use a lot of time I like it it's a nice fresh herb little salt and pepper then take your rolling pin and just very lightly press it in there don't even press just run your rolling pin right along there okay and now what I'm gonna do and the Sheep pen parchment paper and we do long thin strips about about an inch wide just cut strips if it sticks just flour the knife and you won't have any problem these are gonna make big cheese straws but I think they look great on a food table so I'm going to take each of these slices and put it on the sheet right and just twist it was it just like that if they get too warm while you're working with them you can always put them in refrigerator for a few minutes before you bake them okay into the oven 375 degrees for about 10 to 15 minutes and then we turn them and baked it for another 2 minutes to make sure they're nice and crisp all right [Music] time to grill the chicken for the grilled chicken with satay dip so this is the chicken that I marinated in lemon juice olive oil and thyme and this is a grill pan which is great when you don't want to heat a charcoal grill outside you can do it inside just be really careful you want great ventilation and you want to get it really hot I've let it sit on the flame for about four minutes until it got really hot just gonna put the chicken on put an angle and you get crosshatch marks it's gonna cook for about eight to ten minutes on each side so chicken breasts are different thicknesses so make sure it's cooked through now you see why I need good ventilation okay I think my Parmesan cheese straws are done [Music] they look great so if that almost a very good cook now we take it to the gallery and they are I'm going to do the cheese platter and the face of your shooter so just a few last-minute things to do before I go to the gallery the chickens cooled enough so I can handle it I'm just gonna slice it it's life side of the angle and now I'm gonna put it on these bamboo skewers you can find them in the grocery store just run it right up the middle of it what I'm doing but I always like to try and find things that are best when they're served at room temperature and chicken with satay is one of them the chickens great at room temperature and the satay dip is okay onto the tray I'm just gonna cut up the spoon strudels and I scored them so it would be really easy to slice you can see the film it's beautiful spinach and feta and dill it smells so good it's really crisp on the outside [Music] it's a little messy now but when it's on a big white square platter it's gonna look great it's gonna taste terrific [Music] and now I'm ready to go [Music] yeah the whole gallery smells like strawberries and it's great because everybody can just pick one off dose of me and what about this otherwise I'm not gonna be ready Victoria you think this is your office as a caterer you can imagine the places I've had to set up this is pretty elegant so do you mind if I do my cheese platter here let me show you how to do a cheese tray it's actually not very complicated but there are few details that make it look great one is some lemon leaves as a base it's amazing how it sort of sets off the white of the cheese pick cheeses that people know like Brie and when you put it on the tray have it facing out and actually if you have a very big piece of cheese what I like to do is take a little slice and put it right on top and gives it a little height so one big chunk of Stilton right on the platter also facing out so now I've got a creamy cheese a blue cheese and I'm gonna put a goat cheese on so this is a bucheron and I think this one I'm just gonna cut right in half if you have one really big piece of cheese nobody will start it so it's really important to do slices and then people will help themselves the temptation at this point is to put a million different things on as decorated but it'll look like a dog's breakfast you want to take a big bunch of grapes put it right smack in the middle right like that and then I just like to take fresh strawberries and put them on the outside very simple in big big groups not sort of one here and one there but like a whole grouping of strawberries and then to some crackers around the outside really simple English water biscuits are great the key to this is everyone's going to help themselves so Victoria and I can have to get the party done fixing prosciutto next and I'm doing something major like a gallery opening I want really simple things one of the simplest and most delicious is figs in prosciutto so what I'm doing is I'm going to do a big platter with just with fresh figs and you want to pick figs that really smell like figs when they're really ripe they're just gorgeous little overripe is actually even good just cut them in half and you can either wrap the prosciutto around the fig or do what I'm doing which is just put the figs around the outside and the prosciutto on the inside and let everybody help themselves it's a very Italian appetizer I love the sweet fig that really sort of sweet juicy fig and the saltiness of the prosciutto okay that's done hey Miguel we didn't do such a bad job don't we fix them for Judah and actually here you want to hold these actually so there are a few principles about doing a food table that are really important to me one is that you have big platter so it's not lots of little things they have lots of height I would say if you have Miguel doing the topiaries you're in good shape and what I like to do is raise some of these platters so everything is not flat so all I did just take like a white souffle dish and just put a square platter on top of it and these are built up their cheese straws that are built up like Lincoln locks here I'm gonna do some more so just in opposite directions perfect and the spinach strudels that I scored earlier then we cut them all the way through so they're really finger food everything on the table is finger food and the best part is everything can sit out for a few hours during the gallery opening so what do you think Miguel did we do okay looks pretty good thanks so much thank you [Music] [Music] I think that was a success and love the food table it's very casual people wander in help themselves look at the painting go back to the table it's my kind of party of course it always helps San Miguel help out and I think there might be a cheese drawer with my name I'm redrawn
