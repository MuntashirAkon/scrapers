[Music] I'm going to make some time he has to go with coffee Tommy eggs are made with puff pastry and believe me if you had to make it yourself you would never make Tommy eggs but fortunately they can froze in the freezer department of your grocery store I'll show you what it is it's actually layers of dough and butter and it makes really really flaky cookies what you want to do is defrost it in the refrigerator so it stays really cold so I'm going to combine two cups of sugar and I know this is going to sound strange but an eighth of a teaspoon of salt and it really makes a difference in how it tastes so it's just like a big pinch of salt so I'll take a cup of sugar and for them you can do it on a board on a marble whatever you have just like that so you pull these guys apart it's folded in three I'm going to sprinkle the top with sugar stick rolling pin and just lightly roll it out just so the sugar adheres to the pastry okay now animalism just fold it kind of like folding a letter I'm going to fold it like that I'm going to fold it to the middle fold this to the middle and then fold it over itself just like that press it lightly and now I'm just going to slice it what's great is when they bake they're going to puff out and they're going to be all kind of swirled sort of like elephant ears or Tommy ace just like that just slice them about a half an inch thick you can really keep these in the freezer and if you want to bake off one or two with a cup of tea in the afternoon - not half bad and put these in a plastic bag and then they can be in a freezer until I need to bake them off so these guys came right out of the freezer and they can be baked frozen these are all covered in sugar so they'll be beautiful caramelized while they bake so there are only three of us so I don't think you need that many less few extras okay that's great so into the oven 450 degrees for about eight minutes and I'm going to turn them halfway through so they caramelize on both sides I can't thank you okay I'll wipe it on my jeans neck tomorrow darling Thank You incessant nobody is really rarely on the sugar so all my life it hasn't just it's just sweet it doesn't have any serve like a round flavor ever yeah it's good yeah and I help my secret is safe with you as long as were invited back you're invited back
