[Music] I love Thanksgiving it's all the great fun of a holiday meal without all of that gift-giving that goes on later so I've been asked to write a magazine article about Thanksgiving dinner for just two and I thought I'd take the challenge so today I'm gonna test some traditional recipes but with a twist first tomato basil palm --yes which are a light delicious appetizer I can make in advance and bake before dinner then instead of a huge 20-pound turkey golden roasted Cornish hens which are perfect dinner for two stuffed with cornbread stuffing flavored with lots of onions and celery instead of mashed potatoes I'm making my favorite mashed turnips with crispy shallots and tender broccolini sauteed and garlic and butter and for dessert my friend Miguel's come in to do a table decoration entirely made of candy and fruit and he's not the only one helping out with the Thanksgiving for two my husband Jeffrey's agreed to be a taste tester I hope it's good so the first recipe I wanted to test for my Thanksgiving dinner is sun-dried tomato pom yeas now I've always made sweet pot amuse which of those elephant ears with sugar and I thought wouldn't it be great to make savory ones so the first thing is 100 cups of sun-dried tomatoes I'm just gonna chop them up because they're gonna end up being ground up in the food processor so I've got one and a quarter cups of sun-dried tomatoes it's really like making pesto gonna make it with basil Parmesan cheese garlic no I think about nine cloves of garlic I want about three tablespoons of minced garlic you don't have to chop a cellphone because the food processor is going to do all the work just put that in already smell the garlic and then I'm just gonna grind it up okay next thing is basil lots of it these are great flavors together basil and garlic and sun-dried tomatoes I want about five cups of basil leaves just gonna roughly take these off mmm love the way it smells okay right near the food processor get it a teaspoon of salt just a pepper really just like a pesto and then grind it all up [Music] and now I'm gonna slowly add 3/4 of a cup of olive oil and a cup of grated Parmesan cheese [Music] it smells great [Music] tomato and basil and garlic I wonder if it'd be good over pasta Jeffrey's out buying corn bread and broccolini well the comrade I know is gonna get right but the broccolini I wonder let's see she wants broccolini well this is broccoli but I broccoli need two bunches of broccolini I think this is it it looks a little different I'll get two bunches let's see cornbread here we go I'll hold my breath to make sure it's the right stuff puff pastry's this great little secret it's available in the freezer of every grocery store in America and if you've ever made it yourself you never want to do it so I've got one sheet that I've defrosted in the refrigerator this is still cold but if it gets warm and it's hard to work with just chill it for about five minutes just lightly roll it not too much so I'm going to take some of the sun-dried tomato pesto I'll just put it right on top it smells good I can smell the garlic and the tomato and just spread it out I suppose you could probably make savory puff pastry palm yays with all different kinds of things just plain pesto or Gris air and parmesan so just roll this right to the edge I want every Pommier to have the sun-dried tomato pesto on it that's really smooth okay and I'll show you how to roll it up so you can just like that on both sides and then halfway and again so it meets right at the middle so what happens is those layers of butter when the heat from the oven hits the layers of butter the water evaporates and it causes the pastry to really puff up and that's why it's called puff pastry and then you just fold it over just like that okay that's a nice little package so just slice about 3/8 inch slices it's like between a quarter and a half well they don't look like much now but I think they're gonna taste great okay quick egg wash which is an egg beaten with tablespoon of water just so they'd get nice and brown he's gonna make it a really high temperature by 400 degrees for about 10 or 11 minutes I'm gonna flip them halfway through around and crisp on both sides okay that's done these are gonna be really good and next I'm going to test Cornish hands with cornbread stuffing sounds good so the first thing I'm gonna do is make cornbread stuffing for the Cornish ends I've got everything already except the cornbread I've sent Jeffrey off to get it with a broccolini I hope he comes back with the right thing so they have to stick of unsalted butter it's four tablespoons and one cup of chopped onion it's about half of a large yellow onion I'm just gonna cook it for a few minutes until the onions turn translucent the next thing I need is one stalk of celery I'm just gonna dice it just run your knife right down the middle we used to make turkeys of every contestant with all different kinds of stuffing we'd make urban Apple stuffing sausage stuffing but I have to say my favorite was cornbread stuffing and it's really easy because you can buy cornbread from a store you can make it from a mix or you can make it yourself gonna have to celery to the onions and butter so they cook just a little bit 1/2 a cup of chicken stock how'd your shopping trip go good I got some rye bread you got corn bread broccolini thank you sweetie give the best shot so I'm testing a Thanksgiving dinner for two for magazines do you want to be my chief taste tester yeah they're gonna be really tough critic okay I'll meet you later [Music] Jeffrey got a nice cornbread cornbread stuffing is really classic Thanksgiving thing I like really simple ones but you can always add sausage or chestnuts whatever you like the hard part here is scaling it down so that I can make enough for two Cornish hams so I'm just guessing I need about two and a half cups of corn bread crumbs but since I'm recipe testing I never know just crumble it up like this I'm gonna add all that that's it this looks about right Ashley I think cornbread has more flavor than just regular breadcrumbs it's a little sweeter things can be really good okay so the corn breads all crumbled up I'm gonna add the celery and onions chicken stock right to the bone okay let's see okay a little bit parsley would be goodness it's like flat leaf parsley I think there's a little more flavor than curly parsley but whatever you have around is just fine okay it's just chop it up roughly I think about two tablespoons should do it rough chop doesn't have to be perfect okay and maybe a little salt and pepper to taste not too much cuz the corn breads got salt and pepper in it already stir it up make sure the cornbread absorbs all the butter and onions and parsley all the flavor okay time to stuff these guys so these are two Cornish hens if you can find fresh ones they're really good and I put them on a bed of onion so the onions cook with the Cornish hands just stand them on their little ends and fill each one Cornish ants are really like little chickens so they cook the same way but in less time okay that little guy's got that guy's good and then this guy the good news about this instead of cooking a turkey for hours these guys take about 35 to 40 minutes to cook well it looks like I made way too much stuffing for two Cornish hens but I guess that's why i test recipes notes had their little legs together the whole point of tying these things together is to make sure everything's very tight and it cooks evenly and then just tuck the little wings underneath so they stay tight okay more just keep these guys together so it's close to the body tuck their little wings under okay and then in order for them to Brennan you want the outside to be very dry it's a little paper towel I'm just gonna drive it and you can put a little bit of butter or olive oil on the outside I think I'll do olive oils right here just just a little olive oil it really helps it Brown nicely and keeps it moist let's rub it on the outside with a salt and pepper make sure it's really nicely seasoned okay I'm gonna roast these 425 for about 35 to 40 minutes until they're brown on the outside and juicy and tender inside [Music] my friend Miguel I'm so happy to see you dude thank you so much for doing this you know I love it seven so it's all edible things you'd be a bit absolutely every I can't wait to see what you're gonna do I get you all set up by the fireplace and right now I have a Davison turnips everybody thinks about mashed potatoes for Thanksgiving but I wanted to do something different so I thought I'd make mashed turnip no this isn't like the traditional turnip which is white with a little purple on it this is a rutabaga and you've seen it in the store you've never known what to do with it but it's really good it's gorgeous and yellow inside and I'm gonna do it with crispy shallots which I'm already cooking here and I'm just frying the shallots for about 35 minutes until they're nice and crisp and brown and I think they're just about there I'm just gonna drain these on paper towels so they get really crisp so it's a creamy vegetable and crisp shallots on the top I look like two textures together don't they should be done by now so these are the turnips just gonna drain them and what I did was I peeled them dice them and cook them for about 35 or 40 minutes until they're really tender then you put a knife and you can tell it just goes in easily it's really like potato okay we put them in a food processor this is a great vegetable because it lasts a long time and you can reheat it over a double boiler okay and I'm just gonna add some hot butter and milk a cup of milk and three kurz of a stick of butter [Music] right so it's nice and smooth and creamy okay how beautiful that is that's great teaspoon of salt 1/2 teaspoon of pepper mix it up it says great so I'm gonna serve this with crispy shallots on it's hot but right now I'm gonna keep it warm over a pan of simmering water I know what that an edible table setting so I thought candy dry fruit and nuts some ginger we have dates here California figs Thanksgiving colors oranges and yellows and reds I'm going to surround the marzipan jelly bean I'm almost there so one last thing to test for Thanksgiving dinner for two now I'm gonna make a different kind of vegetable Muslim for unusual vegetables this is called broccolini it's unlikely enough cross between broccoli and Chinese kale and it's actually more delicate than broccoli and I like it a lot so it comes with stalks and you just like broccoli but they're thinner I just want to cut off the last third which I've done and if any of them are really thick you just want to peel it a little bit it's got a nice peppery flavor it's a little sweeter than broccoli and it's just delicious so the first thing is I'm gonna blanch it in a big pot of boiling salted water lots of salt and then just throw it right in and that's gonna just boil for about three to five minutes until it's just tender and then I'm gonna shock it by putting in ice water in the meantime I think the corniche hands are done oh they smell wonderful and a nice bed of onions so I'm just gonna test it to see if it's done if you cut between the leg and the thigh and the juices run clear it's done and it's perfect so I'm just gonna cover it with aluminum foil for about 15 minutes it retains all the heat and it brings the juices and the flavors right back into or defense keeps it nice and warm for dinner meanwhile I think the broccolini is boiled and I'm just going to drain it and then shock it in ice water to stop the cooking and then later I'm going to saute it with garlic and lemon and butter to be delicious Oh Miguel your table setting looks fabulous very bountiful for Thanksgiving what do you guys like dates and crystallized ginger and I like in pumpkins and everything else that's wonderful well I don't know if my pom yeas are as successful as you table settings wanna try one they're um they're sun-dried tomatoes and basil and garlic [Music] [Laughter] [Music] let me girls table with two fabulous it's gonna be great in the article so it's time to cook the broccoli me again I'm gonna saute i blanched it first I'm gonna add a little lemon zest give it lots of flavor so a little bit of lemon zest it's good if you put it in a pan and cook it a little bit garlic just about one clove of chopped garlic keep the heat on just cook it for 30 seconds just so it's incorporated in the butter and now we had the blanch broccolini I'm gonna shake it dry as much as possible all you want to do here is just give it lots of flavor and heat it all the way through [Music] pepper lemon juice that's actually what I'd love to bland something first and then saute it before dinner it's so fast the farm ready to serve okay dinner's ready sweetie dinner's ready Jeffrey thinks that day like any other day but down here it's Thanksgiving crispy shallots Jeffrey's a very good taste tester he likes everything crispy shallots on top how bad could that be so right okay gorgeous little Cornish em and a little bit of science [Music] that looks wonderful to Thanksgiving this year the taste tests are in the real Thanksgiving well I'll be your taste tester here anytime you want now am I supposed to say that to this point I don't think anybody feels sorry nobody believed me that you bought I bought personally I want you know I picked out so what's the idea the stuffing is directly related to the cornbread that I so let's put Miguel to this edible table decorations so we've got dried fruit candied ginger I think they're crystallized walnuts they look amazing jelly beans if anybody's up for jelly beans marzipan just in case you're still hungry after that very large Cornish and in about two hours so what do you think things good enough for a magazine article I think it's too good
