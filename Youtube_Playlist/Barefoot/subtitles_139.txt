[Music] I live in East Hampton New York and one of the local treasures is the Sampson Historical Society they oversee five separate museums some of which take back to 1640 which in the United States is really old by friends Frank no bald Valerie Smith and I decided to do a lunch to celebrate the staff and volunteers I hope they love it so I'm grilling some swordfish which is going to be served with a very flavorful tomato caper basil sauce plus zucchini couscous that's flavored with saffron and cumin and for dessert double trouble chocolate pudding with two kinds of chocolate to make the ultimate comfort food really special so while I do the cooking Frank and Valerie is setting the table in one of the historic barns that date back to 1640 right at the end of my street [Music] and love old-fashioned comfort fruit I mean who doesn't and I thought it'd be really nice for the folks at the Historical Society if I made an old-fashioned comfort dessert so I'm going to make chocolate pudding I'm going to start with six egg yolks right into the mixer make sure you get all the good gradients in half a cup of sugar and I'm going to beat this until it's really thick and pale yellow and a ribbon falls back on itself I'll show you what it looks like in the meantime I'm gonna heat some milk two cups of whole milk what I'm gonna do it's like making a custard I'm gonna heat the milk pour it into the egg mixture and then pour it back in stir it for a little while until it's really nice and thick so with era and you'll see there's a long ribbon that falls right back on itself so now I'm going to add some more things cornstarch to make it nice and thick I need a quarter of a cup of cornstarch three tablespoons of ground sweet chocolate he's really good chocolate because it makes a huge difference and then I'm going to add more chocolate later and a pinch of salt because even baked goods need salt and just mix those together on low speed in a cloud of chocolate and then we've checking feed the milks ready and it's perfect and I'm going to pour it very slowly into this mixture just like making a custard [Music] now I'm going to pour the chocolate mixture back into the pan and just cook it for a few minutes it gets really thick put right back in looks pretty child butter you're ready but it's going to get even more when I melt chocolate into it so I'm going to cook it and I'm going to add chocolate and vanilla okay very low heat it's one of those things that you really just have to keep stirring if you leave it you know you'll have chocolate scrambled eggs move I 5 people coming for lunch their staff and volunteers and they do an incredible job keeping Easthampton historically beautiful place so I just thought it'd be nice to see my dear friend Frank new bald has volunteered to organize this full thing and to open the store at Mulford barn for us to and my friend Valerie has agreed to raid her store and do a gorgeous table setting and she always does the farmer who built it was so proud of his barn he put the date in it 1721 carved right in the team Frank Valerie and I are great team I'm sure it's gonna be a great party okay just as this starts to come together it starts to come together a little too much so you just switch to a whisk and just whisk it and turn the heat off and you'll see it's really nice and thick and gorgeous but it still needs more flavor so I'm going to add a few other things more chocolate soy bittersweet chocolate just about 1 ounce I'm just going to chop it up and it'll just melt into the chocolate pudding one ounce of chocolate two tablespoons of butter unsalted butter right and one and a half teaspoons of good vanilla and just a dash of heavy cream 2 tablespoons can't have dessert without a little bit of richness and just stir those in see that wasn't much more effort than making instant pudding mix wasn't and believe me it tastes so much better now all I have to do is put it in dishes this can go into any kind of dish because I'm not baking it but these little ramekins are perfect and I'm going to pour the mixture into a measuring cup because it's so much easier to pour into ramekins from that does that look like good thick chocolate pudding oh my god this makes exactly six we need five for the launch boom I wonder what's going to happen with six I'm just going to cover the top with plastic wrap and let this chill I'm going to most delicious chocolate pudding for dessert next I'm going to make zucchini couscous it's gonna be really good [Music] so the next thing I'll make for the lunch is zucchini couscous for two reasons one is the easiest thing in the world to make and the second is it's best eaten at room temperature so it'll be perfect for the party in the barn so first I'm gonna make a flavored broth with chicken stock that's going to flavor the couscous one and a half cups with good chicken stock if you have homemade chicken stock it really makes a difference but if not good canned chicken stock from the grocery store is fine and then I'm going to flavor it with 1 teaspoon of salt 1/2 a teaspoon of pepper quarter of a teaspoon of cumin sort of Moroccan spices since couscous is most usually associated with Morocco half a teaspoon of saffron triad or if these red filaments it's incredibly expensive but it's really worth it a little bit goes a long way and what they are as stamens of crocuses particular kind of crocus it's very spicy and sweet at the same time and then two tablespoons of butter it's really like making pasta a little bit of butter to make it stick and have lots of flavor I'm just going to heat this right up sometimes couscous is a main course usually with lamb lots of vegetables but today I'm going to make it as a side dish with zucchini it's gonna be wonderful with a swordfish mmm it's just boiling now so we'll turn off the heat and just let it steep for about 15 minutes you can smell the chicken stock and cumin and the spicy saffron it's gonna be really good I wonder have Valerie and Frank are doing so I better get going setting up for our lunch today [Music] [Music] [Music] I'm just going to saute some zucchini so two zucchini good news about zucchini is you can get it all year round and it's just delicious just tap it up roughly in the summer I like to use tomatoes and zucchini and the winter I use roasted butternut squash whatever is good so just dice the zucchini roughly and sometimes even leftover vegetables are great for this so I want to heat up a few tablespoons of olive oil I just want the zucchini cooked remember it's not going to cook once it's in this couscous all it's going to do is steep in the stock until it's a little browned on the outside and cook through and one more zucchini this is salted a little bit this is definitely the category is you salt it as you go along it takes perfectly seasoned as yourself is at the end it just tastes salty just cook it for about five minutes until it's sort of browned on the outside and it's fully cooked inside so it's tender zucchini kind of has a chocolate flavor but it's not cooked not good put right on top the couscous with a stock over it look how gorgeous that stock looks you can really see the saffron and smell cumin I'm just mix it all together and you'll see I'm going to cover it with plastic wrap and it's going to get puffed and gorgeous and be ready whenever I want to serve it it's gonna steep for about 15 minutes and meanwhile when we chop us with fresh herbs the zucchini and basil look great together so I very often use them so just some fresh basil II just take them right off the stem mmm that smells good okay just shut these guys up make sure the leaves are really dry so they don't turn brown and then fresh parsley no parsley is definitely an underrated herb very often it's used as a garnish I can't figure out why but it's really delicious and so just take your knife and run along with stems we're gonna put a lot in at a really season it's very peppery I find flat leaf parsley a little more flavor than curly parsley so when I'm using it as an ingredient I try and find flat leaf but if all you have is curly it's just fine okay now into the couscous so this is the steamed couscous all the liquids been absorbed all the flavours gotten into it I'm just going to add all this parsley and basil what's the trick with couscous you want to fluff it with a fork amazing how it puffs up and it makes a lot of couscous zucchini couscous gonna be so good with the swordfish with tomatoes and capers and I'm gonna make next next thing I want to make for the Historical Society it's actually one of my longest standing dishes it's swordfish with tomatoes and basil and capers the first thing I'm going to do is make the sauce one of the reasons why this is a great dish that used to do it for catering all the time is because you can make the sauce in advance and just grill the swordfish and then the whole thing served at room temperature so whenever you're ready to serve dinner it's ready in this case lunch so the first thing I'm to do is a few tablespoons of olive oil that a cup of chopped fennel and about a cup of chopped onions yellow onion that'll actually had sort of an anise flavor but it gets very sweet when it's cooked and I like it that way okay so about a teaspoon of chopped garlic I was put the garlic in last because you don't want it to burn and just stir it around cook it for about ten minutes maybe a little more oil you can always add a little bit of water if it's starting to burn medium low heat and just let that get really sweet and caramelized the meantime I'm going to work on the tomatoes so you can use fresh tomatoes but it's so easy to use canned tomatoes if you find a good quality one they're really delicious they've plum tomatoes and they're already peeled already which is really a benefit and I'm just going to drain them a little bit okay that's done some scoop for this is with a sauteed onions and fennel tea spoon of salt 3/4 a teaspoon of pepper and to stir it all together so this is just going to simmer for about 15 minutes and later I'm gonna add some wine and some stock and make a gorgeous sauce out of it I know salary has great style I'm sure she's doing something gorgeous for the tables in the barn a little more flavor for the sauce the swordfish and tomatoes and capers can add a little bit of wine that two tablespoons two tablespoons of chicken stock and just turn up the heat and just let the liquid reduce a little bit maybe about ten minutes and then when that's done I'm going to add a little bit of butter capers and basil hello gorgeous sauce the grilled swordfish with tomatoes and capers [Music] there we go I just hope this all lives up to the wonders of Ines food the last three things I want to add to this sauce for the swordfish are capers fresh basil and a little bit of butter first thing I do is drain the capers capers are great flavor of tomato sauce can just be too sweet because the tomatoes are sweet you want a little something vinegary so two tablespoons of capers right into the sauce about a 1/2 a cup of chopped basil you need a chop it or julienne it which is long thin strips I think maybe I'll julienne it there's a lot of flavors going on in this sauce tomatoes fennel onions garlic capers fresh basil so just stack the leaves up neatly roll them up like in a cigar and then just do thin strips of it that's about a half a cup and just put right in and then just add a little bit of richness right at the end I'm going to put in a tablespoon of butter and that's the sauce for grilled swordfish with tomatoes and capers you know it's really just a good basic tomato sauce and I can imagine maybe with a little tomato paste putting it on pasta or serve it with any kind of fish that has enough flavor to stand up to it which the swordfish really does I'm just going to simmer that for a minute and then just turn it off and it's ready whenever I want to serve it then I'm going to grill the swordfish I think I'll grill it inside you can do it outside too but I'll show you know doing inside and then serve it later the party atmosphere farm feel be perfect [Music] grilled swordfish for swordfish with tomatoes and capers I love swordfish I had the fish store cut these about 1 inch thick I'm just going to brush it with a little bit of olive oil it'll make a nice sear for it salt want to make sure you see isn't it really well pepper and we put them on a grill pan I've left it on high heat really high heat for about 3 to 4 minutes until it got really hot it's just you can see it's just starting to smoke I'm just going to put the fish we want to put it on and just leave it otherwise you want to end up with grill marks if you keep moving it around excuse me side down then cook for about three minutes the meantime I'm going to oil the other side more salt and pepper you know we stood this on the charcoal grill so it's delicious little pepper I'm just going to let that cook on the grill for about three or four minutes while I get everything else ready for Frank time to turn the swordfish Oh perfect how great that look sometimes a you can surprise myself so the sauce is ready sit right in the bottom of the platter I just put the swordfish right on top of the stall or just this book I say these are going to be very happy people at the Historical Society and it's going to be great room temperature that's absolutely perfect they'd be fresh basil on top

this is definitely the category if you salt it as you go along it takes perfectly seasoned if you salted at the end it just tastes salty just cook it for about five minutes until it's sort of browned on the outside and it's fully cooked inside so it's tender zucchini kind of has a chalky flavor it's not cooked not good but right on top the couscous with a stock over it look how gorgeous that stock looks you can really see the saffron and smell cumin I'm just mix it all together and you'll see I'm going to cover it with plastic wrap and it's going to get puffed and gorgeous and it be ready whenever I want to serve it that's gonna state for about 15 minutes and meanwhile I'm gonna chop up some fresh herbs the zucchini and basil look great together so I very often and then just do thin strips of it that's about a half a cup and just put right in and then just add a little bit of richness right at the end I'm going to put in a tablespoon of butter and that's the sauce for grilled swordfish with tomatoes and capers you know it's really just a good basic tomato sauce and I can imagine maybe with a little tomato paste putting it on pasta or serve it with any kind of fish that has enough flavor to stand up to it which the swordfish really does I'm just going to simmer that for a minute and then just turn it off it's ready whenever I want a server then I'm going to grill the swordfish I think I'll grill it inside you can do it outside too but I'll show you how to do it inside and then serve it later the party at Mulford farm you look perfect [Music] grilled swordfish with swordfish with tomatoes and capers I love swordfish I had the fish store cut these about 1 inch thick I'm just going to brush it with a little bit of olive oil it'll make a nice sear for it salt want to make sure you season it really well pepper and we put them on a grill pan I've left it on high heat really high heat for about three to four minutes until it got really hot it's just you can see it's just starting to smoke I'm just going to put the fish we want to put it on and just leave it otherwise you want to end up with grill marks if you keep moving it around seasoning side down then cook for about three minutes the meantime I'm going to oil the other side more salt and pepper you know we stood this on the charcoal grill - it's delicious little pepper I'm just going to let that cook on the grill for about three or four minutes while I get everything else ready for Frank time to turn the swordfish Oh perfect how great that look because they used to surprise myself so the sauce is ready put it right in the bottom of the platter [Music] I'm just put the swordfish right on top of the stall gorgeous this looks I say these are going to be very happy people at the
