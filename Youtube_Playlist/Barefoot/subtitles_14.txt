[Music] the daughter of some friends of ours is a medical student in New York City and she's just finished exams I figure she's been living on snacks while she was studying so I thought wouldn't it be nice to send a home-cooked meal for her and some of her friends I understand Genevieve is a fabulous cook so the pressure is on for the main course beef bourguignon made with filet of beef it's simple and elegant at the same time cooked in a delicious red wine sauce with lots of vegetables and a zucchini gratin that's packed with onions and tender zucchini and with a crunchy cheesy topping and for dessert plum tart with a walnut crust and lots of juicy plums baked inside just what you need after weeks of exams good friends and good food I'm packing it all up and sending it to New York it's like a long-distance takeout so the first thing I want to make for Genevieve is a really old-fashioned homemade dessert called plum tart first I'm gonna make the crust 2 cups of flour I think when you're studying for exams you need something really satisfying 3/4 cup of chopped walnuts these come chopped already but I'm gonna chop them a little more this is a very easy crust you'll see it doesn't have to be rolled out with a rolling pin I'm just gonna press it into the pan this is delicious the combination of walnuts and plums it just wonderful okay into the flour 3/4 of a cup of brown sugar I use light brown sugar I just think brown sugar has a little more flavor serve more of a molasses flavor and I'm gonna mix that together just to combine it then I'm adding one and a half sticks a very cold chopped butter so instead of pastry this is actually more like a crumble you'll see it's gonna be pressed into the pan last ingredient is one egg yolk and that's it gonna bind it together I'll just separate the egg save the whites for meringue and just put it right into the dough just let the mixer go until it starts to come together it looks like a crumble topping for an apple crumble okay done so I'm gonna show you why this is such an easy crust just dump it right out into the tart tin I'm gonna put one and a half cups of the crumb mixture in and then I'm gonna save some for later on top of the fruit so it's a crumble topping on the top it's great so now just press this whole thing right into this tart pan it's a 9 inch tart pan that has a false bottom so it's very easy to get out when you're ready to serve it so this is a trick you take a metal measuring cup and just press it in lightly I'll just run it right around the edge and if it sticks a little bit of flour will help it's also a great thing to do when you're making it like a cookie crust or a graham cracker crust okay then take the cup measure and just smooth out the bottom you can do it with your hands or if you want to make sure it's flat don't press too hard because you want to be sure you can get the tart out of the pan just lightly okay and now for the plums so sometimes when they're in season in August and September I use those Italian prune plums but these are just regular plums and they're perfectly delicious so I'm going to cut these in thirds just make a really beautiful sort of lotus flower pattern in August and September when they're in season I use those wonderful Italian prune plums they're like dark blue and I cut them in quarters because they're smaller but you can really use any plums that are in season these are delicious and since they're bigger I'm cutting them in sixths just make a nice lotus flower pattern and the Thar will be beautiful when it's baked you just these last ones right in the middle it's very earthy it's very simple I think Genevieve and our friends are going to love it okay now the last part is just for the rest of the crumbs right on top just reserved them that great that I love it the crust and the topping are the same thing just put them right around the top plums walnuts brown sugar and bad can that be okay into the oven 400 degrees for about 40 to 50 minutes and it's going to just bake together and be absolutely delicious tonight got some great friends coming over for dinner oh it's wonderful leave all the food to me great well I need some ina advice because now I've got ina dinner flowers no my rule is one color one type of flower and lot and what about the wine burgundy one in the dish I'm making for dinner you probably want to drink the same thing or at least something very similar okay I've got it so I'm really excited about tonight and you're so kind to do this and now I'm gonna go shopping and I'd better get started on making the beef bourguignon the zucchini bread town or you're not gonna have a dinner party tonight if identity by gret ants are a great way to make vegetables particularly because they can be made in advance and then reheated later so I'm gonna make a zucchini gratin to go with the filet before in the olan that I'm gonna make later the first thing I did was saute some onions about a pound of onions and some butter cook them a really low temperature so they're gonna cook really slowly and caramelize delicious and just leave that for a minute now I'm gonna cut up two pounds of zucchini traditionally the French make potato grams but you can make it everything from butternut squash to tomato gratins so I'm just gonna cook this with a lid on for about 10 minutes so the zucchini gets a little bit cooked one teaspoon of pepper I news freshly ground pepper if you can [Music] it's really a classic rundown device for about five minutes I need about 3/4 of a cup of breadcrumbs 3/4 cup of grated Gruyere I'm not gonna become the topping I'm going to add two tablespoons of flour let's make a little bit of a thick sauce [Music] [Music] topping the Gruyere and breadcrumbs it's the cheese and the crumbs that's gonna make this nice and brown and crusty on top it's a great contrast to the creamy zucchini okay now to add a little extra richness a little bit of butter dotted on the top makes it nice and brown just a little and now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna bake at 400 degrees for about 20 minutes then I'm gonna take it out and cool and Genovese to reheat it just before dinner [Music] I'm hosting a dinner party tonight and my friend ina told me that I should get one type of flower in one color I like the sunflowers but I'm afraid they might be a little too tall for conversation I think what might be easier for you or these hyacinth and they're flown in from Holland okay and one bunch costs $15 and probably two bunches will be enough for your boss and you won't have to cut it or anything you can just put it straight in your ball great that's my sort of arranging can we just get them wrapped up sure thank thank you so much enjoy your dinner party I will thank you bye blade beef bourguignon it's a very fancy version of the classic beef bourguignon but for a special party it's really wonderful so I'm going to start with filet of beef three pounds beautiful I'm gonna slice it each slice maybe about one inch thick I should make about eight pieces I actually developed this recipe very early on when I was doing catering and I found it was a nice way to make a traditional flavor but make it really special this is all the traditional flavors of beef bourguignon burgundy bacon carrots fresh thyme now what I'm going to do is I'm going to sear them in a pan a little bit of olive oil and then put them aside make the sauce in the pan that I've seared them get all the flavor of the beef and the best thing about this is I can prepare it in advance and then Genevieve can just heat it up before serving it for dinner I'm gonna get that nice and hot season the beef okay salt season it really well you want the beef to have lots of flavor pepper and then turn it and season on the other side so about two minutes on each side okay now I'm just gonna turn it and sear it on the other side really keeps in the juices and the flavor and it also makes us saw the flavor of the sauce gonna be wonderful okay done someone put this aside on a plate let me see the rest of the needs and then they're making wonderful sauce for them [Music] I'm making fillet of before him y'all it's a classic beef bourguignon but was made with filet of beef so in the same pot that I cooked the beef I've cooked about a quarter of a pound of bacon until it's nice and crisp get all the flavor in there I'm just gonna put it aside and then add it later just leave all the fat that's in the pan so I can cook the vegetables in it two cloves of garlic mince you never want to over cook garlic is burnt really quickly now I'm gonna deglaze the pan with one and a half cups of tea glazing is a process of scraping off all those bits at the bottom of the pan and you can do it with anything that's a little bit acid any kind of vinegar or wine I'm not suggesting you use a really expensive wine but only use something at cooking that you would want to drink okay now I'm gonna add beef stock two cups just just a little more than one of these cans don't have to make these stock yourself unless you really love to do that perfect that's two cups and a tablespoon of tomato paste to give it richness great flavor sometimes I buy this in tubes and it's a great way to keep it in the refrigerator because every recipe seems to recommend one tablespoon and what do you do with the rest okay now let's bring a fresh thyme and just throw the whole thing in or you can strip it whichever you prefer teaspoon of salt half a teaspoon of pepper I'm gonna cook this for about ten minutes on a high heat so it reduces and gets really delicious and thick I mean well I'm gonna get carrots ready I like to do them at diagonal but it doesn't really matter I just think it looks nice so it's eight carrots probably about two cups frozen small whole onions they're already peeled they're just great in this so right into the sauce and all the carrots these are all gonna cook together for about 30 minutes until the vegetables are just tender you can really smell the wine what kind of wine Genovese gonna get em having a dinner party tonight and I was supposed to pick up a couple bottles of wine to go with our meal Oh what we'd be serving we're having a beef bourguignon a zucchini Greta and a plum tart the white I'm gonna recommend it's actually the shooting star aligote a The Forgotten grape of Burgundy it's similar to a Chardonnay in body and in style but less oaky less buttery a little bit more stealing sounds great and for red the 2002 Perrin Pinot Noir from California he get a fabulous example of the Pinot Noir grape without the crazy price tag attached [Music] thank you very much thank you so much I'm a wonderful evening I will so the next step for the beef bourguignon is to thicken the sauce so I need three tablespoons of butter about three tablespoons is what's called a beurre manié a which is a thickener butter and flour together two tablespoons of flour I'm just gonna add to the stock of the sauce I know this looks like a lot of steps but each one's really simple and the before you know so delicious it's really worth it it's actually a great way to thicken gravies because it doesn't get bumpy so just add into the stock and while that cooks away I'm just gonna saute some mushrooms so a little bit of olive oil a little bit of butter into a slice up half a pound of mushrooms you never want to wash mushrooms they absorb water too much what you want to do to clean them is just take a kitchen towel and rub it over the top take off any dirt so into the warm butter and olive oil mushrooms for a few minutes until they're nice and brown finished the beef bourguignon and pack of Genevieve's dinner so it's a long trip to the city so for the beef bourguignon the next step is to put everything back together again so I'm gonna put the beef right back in the pan so now we're going to serve it right now I was just heated through for about ten minutes but I'm gonna send it to Genevieve and she's gonna heat it through it's one of the joys of this dish gonna add the mushrooms on top and the bacon that I cooked in the beginning he's gonna shit all together the carrots and onions the sauce looks delicious that wall Genevieve s to do was heated up and she's got a party [Music] there's really no secret to transporting food it just needs to stay below 40 degrees and the food's really cold just get out of the refrigerator let's go step around ice packs [Music] the last one was an ice-cold Sookie nigra tan to be heated up there my friends here to take everything to Manhattan so I've got everything all together for this really kind if you know I'm not doing in any way to get you into a new time we pour some wine for me sure all right this is our first dish we've got zucchini bread time smells so good [Music] and the big one what is that this is a beef bourguignon so this beef bourguignon has burgundy wine and it has carrots and mushrooms we have a pinot noir that we're drinking with it it's all been sent here for us so I didn't have to do too much work we'll send her a photo of us eating later she wants to see us enjoying this party [Music] oh this is much better don't say my dinner party so good see how it goes with this wine and our last masterpiece is a plum tart forgive this serving dish I don't have anything so you'll just have to deal with it it's nothing tastes great and I have a wine for it the alley goat a it is plum and walnut and pull em up plum especially when they're more like this so I think we need to send ina a photo of us now that we're done enjoying have a little toast to her okay toaster ina okay let's see it's loading [Music] that's Genevieve don't you sent me a picture of her good friends I'd say they're having a
