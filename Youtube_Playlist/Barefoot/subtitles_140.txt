my husband Jeffrey works in Connecticut which know about four hours away from East Hampton I want to make sure no one else is making him dinner during the week so when he leaves on Monday morning I'm gonna send him off with some really good things to eat so this morning I'm gonna surprise Jeffrey with banana sour cream pancakes they're so good but first I thought it'd be really nice to send him off to school with some dinners he can have during the week so I'm gonna make butternut squash with apple soup and Chinese chicken salad so I've got four cups of chopped onions two tablespoons of butter and two tablespoons of olive oil then I'm going to add two tablespoons of curry powder curry powder can really be spicy or mild I like the mild kind so two tablespoons added to the onions great I'm just gonna let that saute with the onions and the heat really brings out the flavor so while that's cooking away when you get the butternut squash and apples ready it smells so good a sort of spicy sweetness so butternut squash them I've peeled it I'm just gonna chunk it up coarsely it doesn't have to be any particular dice cuz it's all gonna go into the soup so this is about five pounds of butternut squash I'm just gonna dump it right into the pot and then the next one was the apples so this is my handy dandy vegetable peeler all comes off in one big strip look at that so I need about four peeled apples done mm hm you can really use any kind of sweet apple and I'm just gonna cut them quarters take the cores out chop them up put them right in so these are all going to sit on the stove for about 35 or 40 minutes until the apples and the butternut squash get really soft and then I'm gonna puree it and show you how to do it so it has great texture okay that's four apples and now I just need two cups of water and that's all going to cook together and stove until everything's really tender and flavorful and then I'm going to puree it in a food mill last thing is to test ins of salt went a great flavor I'm just a better half a teaspoon of black pepper curry powders really spicy I wanted to get too hot so this looks great it smells wonderful you can smell the apples in the curry powder so I'm just just a lid on put the temperature on low and it's gonna cook for about 30 to 40 minutes until the butternut squash is really tender and the apples are cooked it's gonna be wonderful so the next thing is Chinese chicken salad my husband really likes chicken so I have to find a million ways to make it and this is a great thing that you can have during the week so what I've done is i roasted chicken breast on the bone and actually for this salad I'm gonna shred the chicken I find instead of cubing it it really holds the sauce Jeff is gonna be really pleased I can't say they do this all the time but once in a while it's a real treat no kidney so next I'm gonna put in about a half a pound of asparagus it's left over from dinner last night but who knows and then I thought for some color a nice red pepper well you just cut right down on the edge rather than cutting in half where you end up with curved red pepper you end up with straight red pepper and then you can save that for a snack this is what's called julienning just cut it in big strips okay right into the salad that's some scallions to give it a little spice so I think to Scotland should do it looking good already and the last thing is toasted sesame seeds then put half the sesame seeds in the salad and half of the dressing so just a little bit oh that's good okay I'm gonna toss that a lot so into the container this goes into the fridge and then I'm gonna make the dressing first I'm gonna start with oil and vinegar as a base just like any other vinaigrette so I'm gonna use vegetable oil which is sort of flavorless but it'll give it really wonderful texture and vinegar decided I'd use apple cider vinegar cuz it's really sort of sweet it's vinegary but a little sweeter got a quarter of a cup so that's the base that three tablespoons of soy sauce and sesame oil but it's not the clear sesame oil it's the con that's made with roasted sesame seeds so it has great flavor and it's very dark so about a tablespoon and a half of sesame oil and to make it a little sweet is very complex but I think it's really interesting a little bit of honey give it a little sweetness so this is ginger it's very strange-looking I know it's a root just peel the outside you don't want to eat the outside it's really sort of bitter okay and then a box grater is the best thing to use for this and you want sort of a fine grading side for it so it really sort of grinds it up okay you'll see on the inside of the box grater it's just like that it's really sort of wet and delicious and then I think I'm going to put some garlic in give it a little spice the chicken and the sauce are gonna last for a week so Jeffrey can just put them together whenever he wants dinner okay that just goes in like that whisk it up a little bit in toasted sesame seeds so I toasted them in a dry pan just so they have that sort of really nutty flavor and now the secret ingredient peanut butter who knew but where is the peanut butter oh there it is it's always hiding in my pantry okay someone put some peanut butter into this it'll make it really thick and delicious it's kind of like Indonesian satay maybe I should have called this Asian chicken salad rather than Chinese I'm not sure that they use peanut butter I'm gonna whisk that in that's it into the container and then Jeffrey can have Chinese chicken salad all week super smells ready it's wonderful butternut squash and the sweet apples and curry that's gonna be so good but before I puree it I'm gonna make a little treat for the top for Jeffrey he's gonna be very happy I'm gonna make brioche croutons you know I think about making a recipe I think about the complexity of the flavors but I also like to think about the complexity of the texture I wanted to be really interesting to eat so I thought with a creamy source sweet butternut squash and Apple soup be nice to have crunchy croutons so I'm going to take a loaf of my friend Eli Zabar's wonderful brioche bread but you can get any kind of an egg bread or something like that and just cut it in three quarter-inch slices and then I like to take the crusts off but you don't have to brioche is an egg bread it has a little bit of richness I think is really good in the soup but if you have leftover bread you can make it with sourdough bread or white bread or even whole wheat these sort of big croutons French croutons are little fine ones but these are big and chunky and they're great in salads too or for snacks so that looks good I'm just gonna put a little olive oil maybe about two tablespoons lots of salt and pepper you want them to taste great okay into the oven 350 degrees for about 10 to 15 minutes and they're gonna be crisp and sweet and delicious come on to the soup oh this looks so good butternut squash and apples and curry and onions it's gonna be really good soup so I'm going to show you one of my favorite contraptions it's called a food mill and it has a thicker blade and a thinner but or a coarse blade and a fine blade I'm gonna use a coarse blade so you just put it right into the food now have a like a prehistoric food processing I'll put it over a bowl and then it has a a handle like that just pop it in place and then you just use it like that so I'm going to put the soup right through this you probably get a food meal in the hardware store but if you don't have one a food processor or even a blender it's just fine it just ends up being a little more like baby food and you'll see this has a texture to it that I really love okay so what you do it's just process it and goes right through and you have to have the blade go in the opposite direction sort of clean the blade and then it keep going and it just pushes it through that horse blade and you end up with really thick delicious soup and then you just keep going put more soup in one really good thing about this soup is that it's made with water and apple juice which sweetens it most super made with chicken stock so it's vegetarian it's low-fat and it's delicious okay that should do it and the last thing I'm going to put in apple juice until it's exactly the right texture good apple juice you wouldn't really thick but not too thick that it's not like a vegetable puree it's really like soup this looks just about right but just a smooch more the apple juice really adds a great sweetness to this make sure it's good enough for Jeffrey mmm great really good balance of flavors gonna love it they'll think about you all week okay one quart into the fridge and the students are ready for the week you just going to cut a few flowers to the breakfast-table I know it's just breakfast but I still wanted to be special I'm sure it's not true but I have this image of Jeffrey during the week on his own with a bowl of soup over the kitchen sink so the weekends have to be great there years ago I remember reading in a certain old fashion women's magazine if you spend the entire day making dinner for your husband he can't possibly appreciate it enough and it's really not his fault it's your fault and I think it's really good entertaining advice so I try and keep things really simple like this breakfast banana sour cream pancakes just a few little flowers out and he's gonna really appreciate it table settings I love to mix things serve very fancy things like I got these plates in Paris and I love them with very simple things these are dish towels and they make great napkins or I'll use a very nice white damask cloth and very inexpensive like milk bottles that I get at flea markets or yard sales things like that and just simple zinnias they're not fancy flowers but they're perfect and just when Jeffrey thinks it's a morning like any other morning he's gonna have a really nice breakfast except for breakfast with bananas sour cream pancakes I thought it'd be great to have chocolate almond iced coffee who wouldn't like that so I've gotten chocolate almond coffee it smells great and when you make it into iced coffee it's kind of like having ice cream soda for breakfast without the calories so I just made the coffee I'm stunned dripping I'm just going to take the whole pot and put it in the refrigerator and chill it so when you pour it over ice it doesn't get diluted it's really good just like that in the fridge as long as you can so first I'm gonna make some bacon it's a really easy way to do it I just pick something he's really good flavor this is applewood smoked bacon it's really thick cut and this is so easy you won't believe it instead of standing over the stove it in the oven I think your baking sheet this already smells good and what's ever left over can become bacon lettuce and tomato sandwiches hmm I think that's what I'm having for lunch into the oven 400 degrees for about 15 to 20 minutes and you can forget about it so now for the best part of the breakfast banana sour cream pancakes mmm so I'm gonna mix the dry ingredients and the wet ingredients separately and then combine them all together a cup and a half of flour just want to lighten the flour a little bit and then measure it like 1 and 1/2 cups that looks pretty good and 3 tablespoons of sugar this has lots of ingredients but it's really worth it 2 teaspoons of baking powder that's one I combined this in a sifter and then if there's anything in the flour that you don't want the pancakes it just sits out 1/2 teaspoons of salt you just sift that all together so it combines it and see that there's a little bit of sugar in the bottom so I'm glad I sifted it okay that's the dry ingredients and now the wet ingredients so the first thing is sour cream is the secret ingredient makes them really moist and flavorful need about 1/2 a cup 3/4 of a cup of milk plus a little extra maybe another tablespoon that's the difference don't ask why I don't know okay next is two eggs I always crack eggs into another ball just in case there's a bad egg or you get a little shell you haven't ruined your pancakes okay now the two best ingredients in this vanilla set one teaspoon teaspoon of lemon zest it's probably my favorite tool in the kitchen it's a microplane probably the least expensive tool in the kitchen I love it but it makes really great lemon zest okay that should do it that teaspoon of lemon zest right on they are then whisk it up so now I'm just gonna mix these two together pour the wet ingredients into the dry ones so they're just combined you don't want to develop the gluten in the flour so just enough and then one last ingredient is the bananas for sharp knife okay I'm gonna chop it up want to make sure the bananas are ripe they don't have to be really really right but just sums in that green a couple of bananas I need take it from the butter in the frying pan and I use a cup measure to measure the pancake spent a quarter of a cup depends on how big you like them we like big pancakes so when I cook these over medium to medium-high heat just until they cook through and you see bubbles on the top so once you see the bubbles on the top you want to put the banana on top got a heaping tablespoon of banana on each pancake this is gushy but good okay now I need my spatula Jeffrey's gonna be a happy camper I'm gonna serve these with hot maple syrup that's great another three minutes and breakfast is ready these are gonna be awesome pancakes I love to heat up the maple syrup it's really good grade-a dark amber syrup as long as you're gonna do it make it good and you heat it up a little bit and I think that bacon smells ready a nice crisp bacon very hot little ice for the glasses for the iced coffee and I think we're ready to put it together it smells so good it makes these having cold cereal for breakfast little bacon looks gorgeous think I made too much bacon now this on top and a little maple syrup all nice and warm and a little confection sugar too much is never enough sweetie breakfast is ready Hey hi babe will you get the coffee I made iced coffee this looks great it's a surprise you somehow right so it's banana sour cream pancakes Wow an applewood smoked bacon lest you think I've been asleep at

Dwight it's get really wonderful so now I have to do is pack up everything for jeopardy taken Connecticut butternut squash with Apple soup Chinese chicken salad and dressing gonna be very happy camper okay and get it all in and croutons for the suit why do I think he's gonna eat this before he even gets to Connecticut I was dressing for the Chinese chicken salad and his two favorite movies are

got my whole life with you go until Friday onions great I'm just gonna let that saute with the onions and the heat really brings out the flavor so while that's cooking away when you get the butternut
