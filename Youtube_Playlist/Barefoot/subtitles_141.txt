[Music] when I used to cater parties the client once asked me to do a really fancy dinner and have ice cream sandwiches for dessert and I thought that's kind of an odd idea but she was the client well the party was a great success everybody had a really good time my friends are coming tonight and I thought maybe I'll borrow her idea it's really really fun [Music] who doesn't love ice cream I think it used to be considered just for children but then the grown-ups caught on so I'm gonna make this wonderful ice cream it's Philadelphia ice cream which is three cups of heavy cream 2/3 of a cup of sugar you not gonna believe how easy this is a teaspoon of vanilla we love vanilla and then vanilla bean I have this wonderful brew that I make it's vanilla beans and it's vodka and they just sit in the bucket and it makes a vanilla extract but it also makes this wonderful softened vanilla bean where I'll show you you can cut off the end and they just put the seeds right into the ice cream they just squeeze right out and it's just wonderful but if you don't have this brew you can also buy vanilla bean in a store usually comes 1/2 a package and slice it right down the middle and then with your knife just scrape it out and you can see the seeds just goes right into the it's like good vanilla ice cream when you can see the seeds and then you mix this up what I'm gonna make is ice cream sandwiches and they're gonna be chocolate white chocolate chunk cookies and in between we're gonna put the vanilla Armagnac ice cream it's gonna be so good so all I'm gonna do is just strain the cream and the vanilla make sure everything is dissolved beautifully and it is this looks great so I'm gonna chill it get it nice and cold and then put it in the ice cream freezer and now I'm gonna go do some shopping [Music] the ice-cream sandwiches are really messy we're gonna need lots of white napkins now this be a great bowl to put in the freezer and then I can serve the ice cream from it these ice cream scoops are so good for everything from muffins to cookies but if I make cookies with this when they do that big another time so I think I'll use this one for ice cream and this smaller one for cookies can't wait [Music] so I'm going to start the cookies with half a pound of room-temperature butter it's really great when it's room temperature I just think it's an important part of baking I actually leave it out overnight and then you know it's really room temperature and then a cup of white sugar a cup of brown sugar butter and sugar how bad can that be I'm cream it on medium speed and then I'm gonna add two eggs and they also it's great when they're room temperature crack it on the table rather than the edge of the bowl then you don't get any egg shell in the bowl I'm gonna pour these in to the mixture sort of one at a time so they incorporate just scrape the bowl down to make sure everything is really well incorporated so I'm just going to stir that a little bit okay the next thing is vanilla two teaspoons of good vanilla and 2/3 of a cup of cocoa powder this is the unsweetened cocoa powder it's not like the cocoa that you make hot cocoa front that has sugar added to it and sometimes flavorings oh nice cocoa everywhere they're two-thirds of a cup of unsweetened cocoa powder and that's what gives it its really good chocolate flavor mix that around the next thing is flour and the leavening so I have two cups of flour a teaspoon of baking soda teaspoon of baking powder and a teaspoon of salt just really make sure there aren't any little hard particles in the flour the baking powder perfect and then this goes into the cookies turn on low speed this is the point where you don't want to over mix the flour because then it'll develop the gluten and make it taste more like bread than cookies one of them really really delicate and tender and that's the dough I'm just gonna mix it a little bit I mean remember clean hands are a cook's best tools so I'm just gonna take all the batter off the beater make sure we make it into cookies this looks great okay put the white chocolate in this saw the white chocolate that I cut up and I just cut it off this block and sort of nice big chunks and let's pour in two cups of white chocolate into this this makes a huge batter but you can actually make this really early and you can save it and refrigerator or even freeze it for later so it's a great recipe and now just to scoop them there's a little bit of a decadent dessert you know how girls are when boys aren't around so I use an ice cream scoop for this and it makes exactly the right size each time just one level ice-cream scoop it's a small one and these guys are gonna spread out too I'm gonna make eight cookies two for each of the ice cream sandwiches so everybody's gonna make their own Ice Cream Sandwich gonna have the cookies and the vanilla Armagnac ice cream and then everybody make their own which is great because it's fun to make them but it's also then I don't have to do them myself so just with a little bit of water just i wet my hand just a smidge and just press it down ever so slightly and you'll see the all spread out so they're really sort of soft and chewy on the inside and crisp on the outside okay into the oven 350 degrees for exactly 15 minutes they're gonna be so good with the ice cream I've girlfriend's coming for dinner and I'm making ice cream sandwiches with chocolate white chocolate chunk cookies ice snow I get done great so since we're having really bad ice cream sandwiches for dessert I'm gonna make a really good tuna salad nicoise for dinner and I'm gonna start with all kinds of proven√ßale ingredients like these wonderful potatoes so I'm gonna make it to a French potato salad they're everywhere so I bought 10 pounds of potatoes I like to mix the white and the red potatoes and what I'm gonna do is just slice these really thickly and then put them in a bowl with a vinaigrette you know usually we're used to an American potato salad which is all that gloppy man is which I actually think sort of you lose the flavor of the potatoes when you do that this is a salad where I'm gonna slice the potatoes and infuse them with a vinaigrette and fresh herbs and I think it really brings out that gorgeous sort of earthy potato flavor it's gonna be just delicious absolutely fabulous the Sal is actually sort of an homage to my favorite cook of all times - Leah child and her wonderful book mastering the Art of French Cooking she has a French potato salad that I think I've been making for decades since I first got married and I just love it so this is very similar to to eat on its original salad okay these are almost done and then what I'm going to do while it's still warm this gives it so much flavor it's about two tablespoons but a nice splash of white wine you can use leftover one from dinner last night and a splash of chicken stock and while the potatoes are still warm it really gets into the potatoes big spoon just toss it all together some salt and pepper what the potatoes just have as much flavor as possible before you start when that fits a little bit just for a few minutes all the chicken stock and the wine gets into the potatoes and so delicious so that's the potatoes and the next thing I'm gonna make is gonna grab so the key ingredients for a good vinaigrette are good vinegar and good olive oil them too this is champagne vinegar but if you have good cider vinegar or white wine vinegar it's great I just wouldn't use red wine vinegar for this and then I'm gonna add that I have a teaspoon of Dijon mustard and salt and pepper for some reason I think Americans are really sort of daunted by vinaigrette it's the easiest thing in the world and so much better than that bottled stuff you get and then slowly pour good olive oil into this and you make an emulsion but muster it seems to emulsify the vinaigrette so it stays together cuz I can't make no mayonnaise just do the olive oil slowly and then this vinaigrette it's gonna be wonderful both on the potatoes but also we're gonna use it later to pour over the other ingredients like the auricle there and the salad just was there's only one way to tell if it's right it's actually perfect maybe a drop more olive oil but it's just right great so this is just gonna go on the potatoes just to flavor them and that's all gonna soak into those warm potatoes and the rest I'm gonna save for later and now the last thing is lots of fresh herbs and that's what gives the potato such a fresh flavor so we have chopped scallions chopped them already give them another rough cut I really like when they're roughly cut unlikely to be so precision like that you don't actually see what it is gives you a sense that there's scallions in it what kind of or justice lips and fresh basil just take the leaves off you can either do this with a rough chop or you can do it julienne but I think I'm just gonna do it roughly chopped okay lots of fresh basil and then fresh dill it's a great way to take the leaves off the deal it's just run your knife along and takes all those leaves off without pulling them off one by one just think how much flavor these potatoes have when you're done with a warm vinaigrette and the fresh basil and dill czar the pungent herbs and it just looks so fresh and it's so much better than all that mayonnaise and then the longer just soaks in the fridge and the longer it sits the better it tastes so mmm there's a really tender but they're still firm enough so they have flavor you could use a little more salt that's my motto it always needs more salt a little more pepper bring out the flavors and it's gonna be just delicious and that big platter with our salad nicoise done into the fridge [Music] and after my homemade ice cream this is a sweetened cream flavored with incredible vanilla the only thing I'm gonna add to give it a little kick at some Armagnac oh it's gonna be wonderful Armagnac has cognac from the Gascony region of France and it's gonna get my vanilla ice cream incredible flavor into the ice cream machine turn it on and in 15 minutes and Anila Armagnac ice cream it'll be so good and I'm gonna go set the table it's got to be really simple but gorgeous and since we're having ice cream for dessert I thought it'd be really fun dat ice cream colors so we've got like raspberry sorbet and orange is like orange sherbert just wonderful so very simple and there are four of us glasses I love to mix fancy things and simple things so we have fancy glasses and really simple plates so since the cloth is raspberry I've got white place I'm big on white plates I think food looks best on a white plate but it creates a little contrast which is nice white napkins and it's fun to mix old things and new things so I have really good old glasses and then my everyday silver so it's no reason why it has to be fancy or simple it can be both okay and finally for the flowers now if you think I always have these flowers around a friend sent me this incredible gift of roses and they have the most incredible scent so right in the middle and everything's done and now I can finish the dinner so my girlfriends are coming for dinner I'm making a tuna SWA's for dinner and these incredible ice cream sandwiches for dessert and I'm doing it with my vanilla army of ice cream oh this looks just perfect it's perfectly churned and so what I'm gonna do is freeze it a little more because of the Armagnac it's a little bit soft and then we're gonna put it out in a big bowl and everybody's gonna make their own ice cream sandwiches with chocolate white chocolate chunk cookies how wonderful is that sound I think I'd taste this and make sure it's okay mmm it's wonderful you taste all the good vanilla and the Armagnac it's gonna be great so I'm gonna put it in a container and freeze it for a little while get nice and firm the good news about this is I can make it the day before the party or even the month before the party so I don't have a thing to do when my guests arrive so that's it for the vanilla Armagnac ice cream it's gonna be so delicious with a chocolate white chocolate chunk cookies I'm gonna freeze it for a little while until it gets a little harder and I want to freeze the ball so we have something nice to serve it in so the next thing is a Tuna Nicoise platter and the first thing I'm going to do is get this pan incredibly hot so I can sear the tuna and it's gonna be really good and that's gonna sit there for like five minutes this is a kind of platter you can put anything in the like that has sort of Provencal feel about it this is watercress you can use arugula anything that's really beautiful and fresh and then after I assemble this whole thing I'm gonna serve a vinaigrette and everybody can help themselves so that's the watercress and the next thing is I've got some string beans that have boiled for about three minutes gonna drain them and then put them in ice water and that really shocks them so not chalk like up there shock like that they're shocked so they're staying really green and they get really cold fast so that's perfect so after that when I put them on the platter like this and we've got potato salad the Provencal potato salad which is made with vinaigrette and fresh herbs rather that's sort of gloppy American manners put that in the middle of this platter that looks so good and the next thing is hard-boiled eggs its traditional for a salad nicoise and then I've got gorgeous white and the yellow yolks I like to undercook the egg so that the yolks are bright yellow if you cook them too long you get a little dark circle over their yolks not pretty okay eggs and then of course you have it olives what protocell dish doesn't have olives on it and group things it's really important not to have it sort of look like a bowl of M&amp;M so I group things together so colors are similar now I like anchovies I don't know about you few people think they taste like hairy fish so I'm gonna put them in one place so you can either include them or not include them if you like them and the last thing is the tuna so the two for just two mistakes I'll show you how we do this who's gonna slather with a little bit of olive oil both sides and seasoned with lots of salt and then just put it right in the pan and the good news is this whole thing is going to cook one and a half minutes on each side and it's done Wow I think I might even put a little pepper on it now so this is gonna cook for about a minute and a half on one side I'm going to flip it over for a minute and a half on the other side and it will be perfectly cooked you want to make sure that the inside is actually still raw because if tuna is overcooked it just gets dry and tasteless and this way it's wonderful okay flip it over to the other side another minute and a half and it's going to be absolutely perfect for killing your wife clatter so the last thing before the guests arrive is I'm gonna get the ice cream ready in a bowl so I have nothing to do when they're here except to have fun this is the vanilla Armagnac ice cream and it's gonna be sandwiched between two chocolate white chocolate chunk cookies how decadent is that it's gonna be so delicious and I'd love to have it in a frozen ball so it's all ready to go to the table and I have nothing else to do except to have fun okay into the freezer for our ice cream sandwiches [Music] how's this for dinner a child thanks probably the only things to ever hit doesn't have butter in it I'm gonna try to be polite thank you what's really that undercooking isn't it it's almost like sushi so good the best part of this is all prepared in advance it's circling temperature so whenever your friends arrive it's ready we will all be going home and maejima so since we were really good for dinner we can be really bad for dessert with an ice cream soon so I'm taking my scoop of ice cream is it chocolate white chocolate chunk cookie a scoop of vanilla Armagnac eyes and another cookie for you this looks pretty good actually [Music] allora that looks good and terrific Jessa batiks you see two large cookies at the same time [Laughter] [Music]
