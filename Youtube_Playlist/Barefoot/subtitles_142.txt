so I've got two and a half pounds of ground chuck it's very important that it's not too dry you can ask the butcher boy and then I've got sauteed onions and lots of flavorings to give it lots of flavor I'll show you how I made the onions I heated a tablespoon of olive oil in a medium saute pan and then added three cups chopped yellow onions then I added a teaspoon of chopped fresh thyme leaves 2 teaspoons of kosher salt and a teaspoon of freshly ground black pepper and just cooked it over medium-low heat stirring it occasionally for about 10 minutes just until the onions are translucent but not Brown then off the heat I added three tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce 1/3 of a cup of chicken stock 1 tablespoon of tomato paste then I mixed everything together and set it aside to cool slightly so now I'm just gonna add the onions and all that great flavoring to the meat everything's right in there it's gonna be delicious meatloaf next thing is bread crumbs I use about a half a cup of dried breadcrumbs I use dry once coz it really holds the meatloaf together and why make fresh bread crumbs when you don't have to to eggs which also holds the meatloaf together and then pour it on top that's the key to making meatloaf you want it to sort of aerate it you don't want it to be dense so just toss it all together and make sure you're not compacting it just have it lightly wanted to have an even shape so it cooks evenly if it's thicker one part than the other part of a little over cooking I'm gonna put a half a cup of ketchup right on the top this work and the hands come in just smooth it over you can really do it with a knife if you want to okay now I'm gonna put it into the oven fridge and fifty degrees about an hour an hour and 10 minutes this would be the most delicious kilo get a pan fill it with very very hot tap water and put it underneath you'll have moist delicious meatloaf every time and the way I can tell whether it's done or not it needs to be about 155 to 160 degrees instant-read thermometer and just put it right through the end it's the best way to make sure you get the center of it a little garnish make it look better and a little taste to make sure it tastes good at what beginner wouldn't want to make meatloaf mmm it's so delicious
