[Music] why don't we leave turkey on Thanksgiving and Christmas the order an eight pound bird it's really not any more difficult than roasting a chicken I've invited my entire office for dinner tonight three incredible women I'm sure they're expecting takeout pizza so first I'm gonna roast a turkey for the lemon and herb butter to go with it I'll make a vegetable tea on Ed with zucchini tomatoes and potatoes and some light as a art I'm popovers who would love that and to finish it off a creme brulee with a really creamy custard and a crispy caramel topping [Music] we always think of Turkey as this monster 25 pound bird that we have for Thanksgiving when I'm having a few friends over I'd love to get maybe an 8 to 10 pound turkey it's really just like roasting a big chicken and then you can have it all year round so I've got fresh thyme from my garden it's just wonderful and I'm gonna make an herb butter with it and it's gonna keep the turkey really moist and flavorful so 1/4 cup butter so here's what you do with time you take a stem hold the end of it and then run your fingers backwards along the stem and the leaves will just come right off I'm just gonna roughly chop it doesn't have to be perfect just a rough chop and that should be about a tablespoon of fresh thyme whoo smells so good we thought maybe a little lemon so I've got butter thyme lemon a little bit of salt to give it more flavor because we use unsalted butter and I'm just gonna mash it all together okay that's all done so I've got my fresh turkey try and get a fresh turkey if you can rather than a frozen one I think they're really much better this one's organic which is even better I'm just gonna run my fingers right underneath the skin it's a messy job but it's really worth doing just be sure you don't break the skin okay great one side and then the other side okay ready for the butter so I'll show you I'm gonna do I'm gonna take the butter and just take a glob of it and put it right under the skin and then because it's room temperature you can sort of smush it around it's a cold wet job now okay one more big blob on the other side and just push it around underneath the skin you can actually see the lemon and you can see the time underneath the skin and then I'm just going to take the rest of it and just base the outside so when the turkey cooks the skins gonna get nice and brown and the herb butter flavors the skin it flavors the turkey it's gonna be so good okay I'm just gonna wash up before I finish it [Music] so now I'm gonna give the turkey even more flavor when they do is take the rest of this lemon cut it in quarters and just put it right in the middle of the turkey that's gonna make them meat even more flavorful let's see I think I'll do an onion just cut the ends off cut it in quarters and just put it in the middle anything to give it more flavor and then I have some garlic I'm just gonna take the garlic watch this just cut it straight across be careful keep your fingers out of the way and just mmm that's gonna be good in the turkey right there okay so now I'm gonna trust it up the thing about trusting is just to make sure that everything's tight together if there's a leg flapping out there it's gonna burn so you want to make sure that it's everything's all tight to the body of the bird so I'm going to tie up the legs and then pull its little tail so it'll took us it just want to tie the wing so it's tight to the body of the turkey the simpler it is the easier it's gonna be to get the string off when you're done so I know everybody thinks the turkey cooks all day but eight to ten pound bird 350 degrees don't cook in two hours I mean a chicken cooks in an hour and a half so this is gonna be really good creme brulee is the ultimate guide dessert make it and I'll follow you anywhere but tonight I'm making it for my girlfriend's creme brulee is this incredible creamy custard with a hard caramelized top absolutely delicious so three cups of cream I can't make creme brulee with that crap and I'm gonna scald it which means it's not gonna boil but they're gonna be little bubbles all the way around the outside and it's just under boiling so I need one whole egg into the mixer fitted with a paddle attachment which is what this is and I need four egg yolks [Music] half a cup of sugar I'm just going to turn the mixer on low and mix them just until they're combined you don't want to need frothy whippy stuff just until they're combined just like that and then I'm gonna add the scalded milk so I'm just gonna pour it really slowly into the eggs don't want scrambled eggs beginning to look like creme really just looks like a great custard so I'm just gonna flavor it with two things vanilla 1 teaspoon my love good vanilla my favorite and one tablespoon of Grand Marnier she's really orange flavored liqueur but would ever kind of look her you have around the house don't buy a whole bottle just for one tablespoon perfect then I put it into five ramekins or for my friends and I one extra for Jeffrey when he comes home it's the guy dessert thing [Music] a water bath will ensure that the custards cook evenly pitcher really helps so just bet halfway up the sides of the dishes so into the oven 300 degrees for 35 to 40 minutes and then I'm gonna chill the custard and my friends and I are going to blowtorch the caramelized sugar together that's gonna be fun I'm off to get vegetables for the vegetable T on to go with the roast turkey love Jim pikes the best box down man [Music] [Music] vegetable TM I need three vegetables zucchini tomatoes and potatoes and the key is I need them all the same circumference so when I slice them they'll line up perfectly [Music] this punch mate is a perfect just the right circumference we need blossom [Music] potatoes these the red ones and I think I like the white ones and I want potatoes that have same diameter is the zucchini like this I have this vegetable tea on the first time and a friend's house in Provence first I'm gonna start with some onions I'm just gonna cook them for about 8 to 10 minutes until they're sort of starting to brown they're really soft and then I'm gonna add some garlic to it cook it for one more minute mmm I can already smell the garlic then I'm gonna turn off the heat and put the onions right into the bottom of the pan so it's gonna flavor all the vegetables on the top and now I'm gonna layer three vegetables on top so tomato potato zucchini and they can sort of stand up a little bit so it's got some thickness but only one layer so tomato potato zucchini and just keep going all the way around tomato potato zucchini see how important it is that the diameter of each of the vegetables is the same so it really looks gorgeous so that's it so I'm just gonna flavor it with some fresh thyme on the top just sort of sprinkle it around the top got a tablespoon and just so you know there's time on the top I love a few sprigs on the top salt and pepper generously because there are a lot of vegetables in here okay just a drizzle of olive oil and it helps the vegetables cook and the potatoes and the tomatoes and the zucchini all cook together which is just great crank this up to 375 together so I'm gonna bake it for 35 to 40 minutes gonna be tender and delicious I never feel like I'm ready for a party until I have the table set I kind of like having the dress ready pick some hydrangeas would be gorgeous so the place you want to actually cut the hydrangea it's right above where the smooth growth forms cut it just like that and then the new buds will form next year I think this one might be nice too right above that bud that's a good stock so there's three secrets to hydrangeas lasting a long time very hot water I cut right down the middle of the stem so it can drink as much water as possible and then take a knife and just run it down the outside of the edge and that'll help the hydrangea drink lots of water right into the water [Music] just a shock of color always makes it a little special and we're having turkey and vegetable tea on and pop over so pretty simple place setting of a fork a knife a spoon for dessert make sure everything's straight I think that's done oh I'm nice and hot okay half cups now take these sprigs of thyme off nobody needs to eat a stem put some grated Gruyere on the top and this is gonna hold it all together the starch and the potatoes is gonna hold it together but also that a little bit of Gruyere melted into it back into the oven uncovered for about 30 minutes until it all cooks together and it's perfectly tender and it's going to be really delicious little browned on the top with the cheese okay let's see how these creme brulees are I wanted to take them out when they're just set and they're perfect right now I just take them out really carefully [Music] perfect so it's gonna be the cold creamy custard and that hard crust of burnt sugar to be really good [Music] turkey smells like it's done two hours it's amazing isn't it smells looks fabulous so there's all kinds of ways to test whether the turkeys done the first one is to sort of shake its leg like shaking hands and if it moves a little bit it should be done everybody uses a thermometer but with the turkey I never know where to put it it's like 170 in one place 1:30 and another I think the easiest thing is just a little knife right between the leg and the thigh and if the juices run clear and they do it's done you actually want to put it under aluminum foil for about 20 minutes and let it rest really makes a difference in terms of how moist and juicy the turkey is I mean really good that's gonna be great with the tea on which I think I'll serve at room temperature okay the next thing is time popovers and what I've done is grease these popover parents are specifically used for popovers and I'm gonna preheat them for about two minutes in 425 degree oven okay popovers it's really like a pancake batter it's really easy to make and I've wanted to have cups of flour remember fluff it up and then just level it off and a half okay next is a little bit of salt 3/4 teaspoon of salt 3 eggs 1 everything room temperature make that a popovers always crack eggs into another Bowl just in case you get a bad egg you don't have to start all over again okay right in the middle make a little well three eggs why don't have cups of milk and just whisk this all together and then one and a half tablespoons of melted butter seems to be butter and everything doesn't it you don't want to too hot so you don't cook the eggs just a little bit perfect and I did this in a picture so it's easy to pour into the pans and then it's a little bit of fresh thyme like a tablespoon I've tried lots of different flavorings for popovers because I love them parmesan a little rosemary but the time is the one I like the best here okay right in last whisk really hot pans don't fill them more than half-full okay into the oven 425 degrees for exactly 30 minutes and remember no peeking [Music] so the trick is the resting for about 20 minutes and time to cargo [Music] [Music] [Music] that's pretty good so shall I have you have it a little turkey the herb and lemon and thyme butter [Music] little TM I love so which is might have a little career zucchini the only place okay I'm a little T on darling definitely cheesy and now the best part love a time pop over thank you Susannah loving Thank You Ashley so what was the last time you had Turkey what wasn't Thanksgiving it's really I think it's great yeah it's like making a big roast chicken know what's for dessert hmm it's a surprise and you have to make it yourself come with me [Music] boy have I got a treat for you they're vanilla custard but they might have a little Grand Marnier in it how about if we brulee the top so burnt sugar I'll show you how all right so I'm going to take a tablespoon of sugar and just put it right on the top of a cold custard and actually if you take your finger and run it along the top like that just to smooth it out so you get it all the way and this is the fun part so this is a little kitchen torch so you turn it on watch that that's tan am i that dangerous okay one nice and high to keep your hand away and you just hold it right down on the sugar and it'll burn it you don't have to put a blowtorch you can actually do it in the boiler but I just think it comes out much better this way and it's so much more fun and then you just let it chill for a minute and it hardens color like a hard caramel so that's what's it per second is gonna get really hard all right Shanae you're next good job is Ryan she's a pro if you think this looks like fun it is okay that's dessert excellent well done everybody cheers everyone Oh I love the contrast in texture who's the extra one Brian all I thought I might run for charity if it lasted [Music] bet that creme brulee Jeffrey will never know
