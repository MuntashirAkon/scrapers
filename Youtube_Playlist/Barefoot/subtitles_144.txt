[Music] my friends Billy Finkelstein and his wife Barbara coming to dinner tonight he's an LA screenwriter and she's a fabulous architect you know I know those guys in LA only have frozen yogurt and water for dinner I don't think so instead I'm making it over-the-top three-course meal for them and making pomegranate cosmos that are a delicious twist on an old favorite and to go with them salty fingerling potatoes to dip in the garlicky French aioli and then for dinner not one but two blue cheese souffl√©s I have a foolproof recipe and for dessert spicy apple turnovers that look fancy but they're really easy to make these guys are actually serious foodie so I've got my work cut out everybody always says they don't want to have to serve but I don't remember anybody turning it down in my house one of the reasons I think is because I really make traditional desserts sometimes I'll make them in a different way like this time I'm gonna make apple turnovers which are apple tarts when I'm doing them in puff pastry so the first thing I'm going to start with us three apples so I usually pick a fairly tart apple this granny smith apples but if you want to mix them sometimes that's nice during apple season you can get something like a mccune or a Empire Apple so three granny smith apples chopped up and then right away I want to put something acidic on there so they don't turn brown so I'm going to use some orange that a teaspoon of grated orange zest and three tablespoons of freshly squeezed orange juice that's about half an orange three tablespoons of sugar these are chart apples over a little sweetness one tablespoon of flour Creve teaspoon of cinnamon 1/8 teaspoon of nutmeg okay toss that together and then I'm gonna use dried cherries should be really good so the tartness of the cherries and the apples a really good balance for each other about three tablespoons okay just a pinch of salt I know it's surprising but it makes a big difference it's actually a good idea at this point to just taste it and just make sure it tastes right mmm just just like apple pie okay that's the filling I know I'm gonna make the pastry if times I feel like make my own pie crust and times I just don't this is one of those times and the good news is it doesn't make any difference it's gonna be really delicious so I'm gonna use a frozen puff pastry this is the layers and layers of layers of dough and butter and when you put it in the oven it puffs up and it's really nice and light so just gonna roll it lightly until it's 12 by 12 just make sure it's well floured just don't want it to stick to the board you won't be sure it stays really cold [Music] this sure beats making pie crust doesn't it okay 12 by 12 we're there [Music] so I'm going to cut this in quarters little bit of filling in each one so I'm just gonna put a little egg wash on all the edges and then when I crimp it it'll seal it should I have this works just fold it right over take the fork you just crimp the edges the way you would with the pie crust these are gonna get nice and brown sort of a golden-brown color and they're gonna be just gorgeous right on the pan just like that okay I'm just gonna finish the rest best thing is I can make this early in the day and just bake them before from serving them so we have nice hot apple turnovers these are pretty good [Music] and a little sprinkling of sugar and a little split to win it the steam when they bake okay into the fridge I'm gonna bake them off when my guests are here the whole house is gonna smell like apple pie i Michael arranger for dinner party of very chic friends coming so will you look in the fridge with me I need some inspiration got a problem okay not orange orange I had this idea that I want to do like a deconstructed French bouquet so maybe like white there's so many white and lime-green flowers but to do like a Vaz of each one individually and then I can just move them around on the table does that sound like it's not beautiful that does okay great so I know I need alchemy 'la maybe 20 steps perfect okay so how about a white half speed white lilac they're so beautiful white leather and wipe the lisianthus that would be pretty okay cool those two bubbles these okay that looks good that looks good an elysian yes oh this would be really pretty these the one in green and white parrot is a little touch of pink yeah beautiful I'll take these right too low it's gonna be gorgeous it's gonna be absolutely gorgeous we're gonna Mack a man whoa I think we have enough flowers one table [Music] my friends are coming for dinner and you gotta have cocktails I'm gonna make pomegranate Cosmopolitan's and the first thing I'm doing is getting those glasses ice-cold so this is really a traditional recipe very la Cosmopolitan's but with a twist and instead of doing it with cranberry juice I'm making them with pomegranate juice which is really good so the first thing I need is two cups of vodka I'm gonna make a lot at one time I hate making cocktails one at a time I'm just gonna pour them in a pitcher and then when my friends come we'll just shake them up with ice one cup of orange liqueur one cup of pomegranate juice I know it sounds unusual but you really can't find it and it's actually good for you can you imagine causing problems that are good for you and the last ingredient is half a cup of freshly squeezed lime juice it's a really important use fresh lime juice not a bottle to the variety just has that sort of very fresh kind of flavor [Applause] I remember the first time I had a cousin problem I thought wow that's serious I'm very used to them have a cup of freshly squeezed lime juice and that's it it's a nice big pitcher and then later when my friends come I'm gonna shake it up with ice and we're in a really good cosmopolitan I'm going to serve it with fingerling potatoes and dipped in aisle 8 how good is that [Music] well potatoes with eyerly are sort of a classic Provencal side dish but I thought wouldn't it be nice to have them for hors d'oeuvres a little bit of I only as a dip so what I have is fingerling potatoes to these wonderful incredibly hot Wow potatoes and I just like to cut them in half I'm gonna make an aioli dip I boil them for about 10 minutes and then I find it they cook so much better if I take them out before they're totally done and let them steam under a covered cloth for about 15 minutes so now for the I Olli I love this it's got so much flavor so what I'm gonna do is I've got one piece of bread this is used as a thickener for the i-league I'm just gonna tear it up into a bowl and add about two tablespoons of champagne or white wine vinegar and just let it soak for a few minutes and in the meantime I'll make the rest of it so garlic lots of it six big cloves of garlic and just chop it up it seems like every dish in Provence has lots of garlic in it it's so good okay into the food processor two egg yolks okay next thing is lemon juice and lemon zest I think it really adds a nice freshness to the aisle a half teaspoon of grated lemon zest okay got a half a teaspoon three tablespoons of freshly squeezed lemon juice it's a little less than one large lemon what okay perfect half a teaspoon of saffron the stamens of crocuses and it's just so wonderful and okay one teaspoon of salt quarter of teaspoon of pepper and then we're going to do is take the bread that I've soaked it's gooey but it's gonna be good in the eye Olie just squeeze as much of the liquid out as you can perfect and I'm gonna puree the whole thing together and then just like with mayonnaise I'm gonna pour olive oil and slowly so it gets very thick I need one and a half cups of olive oil this is actually not the time for really strongly flavored olive oil I'm using pure olive oil rather than extra-virgin so I'm a little bit of olive flavor but not overwhelming and then just like with manna it's just pour it in really slowly and you see it gets very thick smell all the garlic and [Music] that looks good it's wonderful and really good a hit of garlic and lemon and the saffron should be really good with potatoes okay I'm just gonna clean up a bit I can really make a mess we're the aioli and to the ball this look gorgeous I love the color or to the egg yolks and that saffron and then I'm just gonna do potatoes right around the outside now that could this be hasn't pollens fingerling potatoes and I only needs dinner [Music] I'm gonna spray it with a little salt no pepper see how much more flavorful it looks and I was like to do a little chopped chive on it just think the green really has something to it and it is a little flavor too so chopped chive it looks great and it's delicious I think I might have to try one just to make sure it's okay it's so good the potato and the eye all the way together they're gonna really enjoy this with this and a blue cheese souffle and we'll have dinner ready [Music] so for the main course I'm gonna make blue cheese souffle not one but two I have to say I used to think it was a really scary thing to do but I tested it over and over again it's really foolproof okay so I have ten egg whites and eight egg yolks and these I'm just gonna stay for another time and lots of blue cheese I actually love to use good work for for this he's gonna chop it up if you like blue cheese you will love this souffle I just adore it okay blue cheese is ready I need two cups of milk heated should be that right what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna make a roux which is like a white sauce and then add the blue cheese and then just before serving I'm gonna whip up the egg whites put them in the oven people go crazy so I've got 6 tablespoons of butter melted and then need 6 tablespoons of flour so just sprinkle it on the butter I just want to cook the butter and flour for a minute or two it just really gets rid of that raw flour taste okay that's ready now and then Memphis hot butter pour hot milk into the so it combines pretty quickly I'm just gonna cook this for a minute until it's really thick it's the time whisk really helps pull it together well that's thick and I'm gonna add some seasonings so a pinch of nutmeg pinch of cayenne pepper teaspoon of salt half a teaspoon of pepper okay that looks great now off the heat you're gonna add 8 egg yolks just one at a time just whisk the limb this really makes a nice lunch or really like dinner just a wonderful thing he makes souffles all kinds of things on the chicken crab needs but I have to admit my favorite is blue cheese okay then the blue cheese I'm just gonna put it in and it's gonna just melt into the base and I have a cup of Parmesan cheese [Music] just stir that in and the cheese's will melt into the base okay I'm gonna pour this into two bowls and make two souffles out okay now for the egg whites so I have ten egg whites at room temperature it's really important for this quarter of a teaspoon of cream of tartar which helps them really hold their shape I think you saw and just turn it on high and listen as high as you can [Music] because otherwise they never get the volume might even clean up while they listen this is perfect I want the egg whites so they're really firm but not over whip so they're dry and I'm going to take the egg whites and do half in each Bowl there's a nice and light from the key to this is to fold it in without deflating the egg whites as much as possible so a sort of classic folding method is to cut down the middle of it and then fold your spatula and that and just keep turning it and turning it until you get a homogeneous mixture without deflating the egg whites too much I think this is the part that used to make me nervous but now that I've done them so many times it really is fairly foolproof so what I have is two souffle dishes and I've greased the inside and dusted it with Parmesan cheese okay that's one I'm gonna make the other one I don't know why I used to think it was so scary it's really not please go into a 400-degree oven I'm gonna turn it down immediately to 375 30 to 35 minutes and we will have to core just souffles wait till they come out they're gonna be amazing I'm setting a timer I don't want to forget these can't wait [Music] my friends are coming to dinner and I always feel like I've got a handle on the food but the table setting I'm never quite sure about so what I've done is I've gotten lime green and white flowers I'm gonna do table setting in just those colors so I'm going to do five roses with five different lime and green flowers so that's I'll Camilla I've got the gorgeous tulips I think the white lilacs are next gorgeous that is okay the next one I have is lisianthus I haven't won wacky pink one okay so the lisianthus i'm gonna put on this side so now I've got a huge bouquet of flowers in the middle and it was so much easier than doing a big bouquet so this looks really good put these away oh I think I heard they're kinda dry but just in time okay who wants a pomegranate cousin palm don't have any fun so get back [Applause] okay who wants a cosmopolitan and the pomegranate juice is so good for you two counteracts the effects of the vodka how's that okay guys I'm gonna go check on the souffle okay 400 degrees 20 minutes we're gonna have hot apple turnovers to dessert but I think this if lays are just about done oh there it goes good the moment of truth oh my god no isn't that a wow they look great no pizza tonight okay guys I think I did it blue cheese souffl√©s who would leave I knew this crowd would enjoy something more interesting so okay so what do you think well and I'm going to be brutal delicious okay who's ready for dessert is it a desire to play you never know I'll be right back mmm thank you and this one cream if anybody would like some farm I have a suggestion okay what about if we move in with you that way we could do this each and every day and I could cook for you because great now we're trying
