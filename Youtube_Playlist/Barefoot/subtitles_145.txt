[Music] in 1966 truman capote was the literary toast of america when he decided to give a black and white ball at the Plaza Hotel everybody who was anybody wanted to be invited my friend Deborah Davis has written a fabulous book about that party called party of the century she and her husband are coming for dinner tonight I thought wouldn't it be fun to serve a dinner that was inspired by that party Truman Capote looked chicken hash and he surprised everyone by serving it for dinner so I'm doing the same thing then in keeping with a down-home theme I'm making pan perdu which is french toast for dessert and with coffee melt in the mouth white truffles place with Irish Cream Liqueur everyone came dressed to the nines for Truman Capote's party we're dressing down but I hope it's gonna be just as much fun a Truman Capote's party everybody were these fabulous black and white outfits and they actually even had black and white masks with feathers and all kinds of things that must have been amazing the food wasn't black and white but I thought I'd be fun to make black and white truffles for dessert so I'm gonna start with quarter cup of heavy cream and then pour it into a BAM array which is a heatproof bowl set over boiling water want to make sure the water doesn't touch the bottom of the bowl it keeps it from getting too hot I'm just gonna heat that up meanwhile I'm gonna chop seven ounces of white chocolate it's really a vanilla flavored chocolate and I think it's delicious I put the chocolate in and let that melt with a heavy cream actually want to keep the water simmering you don't want it boiling so it doesn't get too hot and burn the chocolate I'm just gonna let that melt and then I'm gonna add some other flavorings actually I take it off just before it's all melted and the heat just continues to melt the chocolate okay I'd say that's good see that's pretty quick and just let the chocolate continue to melt until it's totally smooth truffles are actually surprisingly easy to make and they're so special people think you've worked for days and I'm gonna add two things I'm gonna add Irish Cream Liqueur two tablespoons both look at wonderful balance you can really flavor it with whatever you like but you wanted something delicate so that it doesn't overpower the chocolate and a half a teaspoon of vanilla just whisk that in I'm just gonna chill this in the refrigerator it'll take about an hour until the white chocolate is really firm and I can roll it into round balls and then we'll have black and white truffles for our black and white party [Music] so in keeping with a black and white theme I thought I'd get black and white tablecloth but of course I couldn't find one so I just went to the fabric store and bought yards of fabric and made my own simple white roses and since it was a masked ball and a black and white feathered mask for Deborah so while I was setting the table the chocolate got nicely chilled for the white truffles and I'm just I like to use a little scoop like this a tiny ice-cream scoop and it's just perfect for making round balls and they all come out even just roll them around a little bit they shouldn't be perfect they should look like those truffles that the pigs find the real mushroom truffles so I'm gonna drizzle some with dark chocolate and roll some in hazelnuts [Music] just be great for coffee but not so good as gifts if you want to do a little hostess guess they're a wonderful thing they keep really well keep them in the refrigerator and you always want to serve them at room temperature so they just melt in your mouth okay [Music] into the fridge to set for a few minutes while I get the toppings ready [Music] [Music] I'm just going to slowly let this chocolate melt these six ounces of bittersweet chocolate I thought it'd be nice because the white chocolates so sweet I thought the bittersweet chocolate would be really nice you want to really smooth and not so hot that it breaks [Music] it's after everything ready to decorate my black and white truffles now comes the tricky part drizzling the chocolate I think I'll do half in chocolate and half on the toasted hazelnuts just drizzle it with a little spoon just like that looks like French truffles will go both ways if you like be creative okay so that's half them with chocolate and the other half I'm gonna do and tested has lots came out of the oven they're cool now I'm just gonna take each one and just roll it in toasted hazelnuts I mean I'm doing a black and white party but you can actually do these truffles than anything cocoa powder toasted coconut it's wonderful or do dark chocolate truffles with white chocolate drizzle on them these look really good I'm gonna refrigerate them and then serve them at room temperature and next I'm gonna make a very down-home French sir I Truman Capote's ball he not only served dinner but after hours of dancing Elsa serve breakfast so I thought it'd be really fun to do a breakfast dish for dessert which is pampered ooh it's french toast and it served as a sweet dessert a little Grand Marnier and fresh strawberries so the first thing I'm going to do is marinate some fresh strawberries and then I'm going to serve it later after I make the pan perdu it's one of the few things that I do they have to make it the last minute it's really worth it it's so good so you better have to find a fresh strawberry just slice them you really want to have good strawberries so when you slice them make you smell fresh strawberry want apples for the sugar and 1 tablespoon of orange summer and those are just gonna macerate together and the triggers gonna bring some of the juices of the strawberries out and make a wonderful like a syrup it was so good with an amp hairdo and now I'm off to I econo to get chicken for my chicken hash you know a lot of people think of East Hampton is big mansions on the beach and while that's true my East Hampton really is about the farmers and the fisherman people who grow things on the land and it's a very earthy place it's been that way since 1640 when it was founded and it's just wonderful [Music] mr. icon how are you is that for me that's for you oh that was gorgeous oh that's so nice thank you that's perfect great special just love it here I've actually asked mr. okona for two chickens quarter we're gonna use the light meat for the chicken hash I'm gonna save the dark meat for another time thank you thank you [Music] chicken legs in the freezer for another day so Truman Capote's all-time favorite dish was chicken hash so that's what he decided he was gonna serve his black and white ball and love the idea of it something very very lowbrow for some very fancy people so I don't know what his is like but I'm gonna make my version of chicken hash so just pull up the skin and take the fresh basil leaves whole and just put them right under the skin it's gonna give the chicken really good flavor of course you can do this with a roast chicken from the grocery store but I think this will have much more flavor not the sheet pan with olive oil let's try to put the salt pepper okay into the oven 350 degrees for about 35 to 40 minutes and this is gorgeous basil chicken - the chicken - okay cannot chicken hatch without potatoes it's the base Brown crusty wonderful potatoes so you want to choose boiling potatoes not baking potatoes because they have better texture I'm just going to kill them I think if you wanted it to be very earthy you could do them without peeling them but I think for this it's a special dinner I'm gonna make him perfect so I have about one and a half or two pounds of potatoes okay that's our peeled so now what I really do is I'm gonna dice them about half inch dice so I want them big enough so they're distinctive but not so big that they won't cook quickly that should do it like that it's particularly appropriate because truman capote and his later years used to live here he was quite the local character okay that's the potatoes now I'm gonna do the onions you can use either red onion or white onion I find that red onions a little sweeter so I'm gonna saute these potatoes and onions and big pan with lots of butter until they're nice and crispy and brown I wonder how different this is from Truman Capote's - probably not a lot it's so much easier to chop onions if you leave the root intact it doesn't go flying all over the board or the kitchen okay so I'm gonna put some butter in the pan and saute the onions and potatoes into the really brown and crusty and then add chicken and peppers it's going to be so delicious it's time to cook the chicken hash okay my names into the pan want a really big pan for this because you want a lot of surface for the potatoes and onions get really brown and crusty okay big spoon just all the potatoes coated with a little bit of butter okay I'm gonna put that on medium heat and just let that really get gorgeous the meantime and then do the peppers and garlic a little bit of butter in this case I'm not mixing butter and oil because the butter really Browns better and two red peppers I'm actually doing these separately because I don't want the moisture in the peppers to stop the potatoes from browning and some fresh thyme I have like this is an exact recipe just sort of throwing everything in that you think would be good okay lots of garlic it's gonna give it good flavor and lots of salt and pepper both the potatoes and the peppers if you've seasoned things while you're cooking it gets really well-seasoned into the middle of it if you season at the end it just tastes salty similar things so the pre-k for the flavor answer the peppers I bet tablespoon of tomato paste with a lot of flavor that's why I like to cook the potatoes and the peppers separately the peppers are done way before the potatoes this way you can make sure that they both cook perfectly okay go turn this off so next with a chicken so this is the roasted basil chicken behind the head it's gorgeous but I just cube it up remove the wings snacks for Jeffrey and then just take the chicken off the bone I might actually leave the skin on cuz it's got a lot of the flavor and the basil I'm just cutting the chicken in one-inch chunks so that they're big pieces you really have a sense that the chicken is in it [Music] okay let me see how that potatoes are doing really browning beautifully look how good those look smell great [Music] see if one of them is done perfect it's done but firm I'm going to turn it off I'm just going to put the chicken in so good no wonder Truman Capote served this to his guests they must be delighted the chicken in and the peppers [Music] move how good does this look okay we're gonna pass some scallions and parsley okay Scott Ian's into the dish lots of fresh parsley turn it on and heat it through [Music] and may not be breakfast at tiffany's but it's definitely dinner at - big platter and a new surprise and make the dinner inspired by the dinner the Truman head at the black and white wall so it's chicken hash let me see you in your mouth oh that's so [Music] I just love is that just what everybody thought that they were gonna have a really fancy food you need very earthy food that appeals to be enormous I'm not sure Capote my literary skills are lacking what you see what I have for dessert it's a treat for breakfast something sweet yeah bye Newell sweet [Music] okay I'm breaking all my rules I always said never make something while the guests are here but these are really good friends and this is really good pintor do now we're gonna make the mixture 6 eggs 1/2 cups of milk and because it's dessert put a little sweetness in it 1 tablespoon of sugar 2 tablespoons of original occur it's the same one I used in the strawberries 2 tablespoons of honey one minute teaspoons of good vanilla with half the tablespoon one tablespoon of orange zest and a teaspoon of salt really brings out the flavor the orange is in the honey whisk it all together now I'm gonna pour it in here so I can soak the bread I don't use a hollow which is a wonderful egg bread all these guys are so if you want to get a nice hot pan with some butter for sauteing well this looks great you can see the orange in it good messy okay these bright slices isn't so beautifully they're just wonderful I'm going to dip them in almonds and then place them in the pan almond side down so the toasted almonds get even more Brown let's mess up right here on the pan [Music] okay you might be ready to turn perfect oh no a three [Music] one slice per person lots of fresh strawberries marinated Grand Marnier okay perfect little dusting of confectioner's sugar and u-turn breakfast into dessert pan perdu or french toast for dessert would be so so fantastic fantastic this has been a wonderful meal thank you just when you think you which one should I go for first well they're both white chocolate and these have dark chocolate on them and those have [Laughter] [Music]
