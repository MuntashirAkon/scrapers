so what I have in this pot is I've saut√©ed some onions and garlic and then broken up some sausage that I got at the store this is turkey sausage you can get hot you can get sweet but I actually like to combine the two so it's half and half done pound and a half of sausage and it's all cooked in a little bit of olive oil then I'm going to add tomatoes a 28 ounce can of crushed tomatoes in puree if you use whole Tomatoes you can just put it in the food processor and crush them up yourself and a six ounce can of tomato paste the whole can I'm going to add laughs the flavoring some fresh basil just pick up some leaves and chop it up of course they still going to clip together anyway a love base I want to taste so good with tomato some turkey sausage doesn't have to be perfect okay so right into the tomato and turkey sausage and then I think some fresh parsley you can use flat leaf parsley like this or you can use curly parsley I think this has a little more flavor but really depends on the parsley right into the pot I think we need salt and pepper and 1/2 teaspoons of salt a lot of this depends on how salty and peppery the sausage is so you want to taste it 1/2 a teaspoon of pepper and then just stir it up I'm just gonna let it simmer for about 15 to 20 minutes over low heat until all the flavors blend together in the tomato and the basil and the turkey sausage all taste like one okay now I'm going to get the cheese is ready I need 15 ounces of ricotta cheese which is usually 1 package and then put lots of flavours in it first thing is goat cheese I know it's unusual in a lasagna but I think it really gives a great flavor so this is a 4 ounce package we have a four and a half ounce packet or 5 ounce package keeps you casual about it just fine just crumble it right up into the ricotta sort of a little more punch and kind of flavor it's good 1 cup of grated Parmesan just mix that in and then one egg you know when you're putting an egg into a mixture I always put it into another glass bowl because you never know when you get a bad egg so one egg extra large egg just mix that in and then just going to add a little bit of flavor with some chopped parsley that 2 tablespoons of coarse salt and pepper you don't need too much because the parmesan is pretty salty quarter of a teaspoon of pepper just spread it out along the bottom of the dish mush it around just want to do one layer of pasta [Music] they don't have to be perfect just cutting the fit would take about half the mozzarella and layer it on top and then the next layer is this cheese the ricotta got half the cheese with the ricotta and goat cheese and Parmesan more sausage now kind of layer noodles normal Sorella Rikyu cheese amazing a fascist build-up and with nothing more strenuous to do than grate some parmesan over it and put it in the oven at 400 degrees for 30 minutes
