[Music] my husband Jeffrey is so amazing he's working full-time on his new business and now he has a new book contract - I think that's worth celebrating so making him an old-fashioned bistro dinner and an old-fashioned cocktail to go with it we're going to start with real whiskey sours the kind our parents used to drink then filet of beef au poivre juicy steaks seared with spicy cracked pepper and a sauce made with brandy and shallots on the side crispy matchstick potatoes and for dessert delicious strawberry tarts with sweet pastry vanilla cream and luscious berries Jeffrey works so hard all week there's nothing like a home-cooked meal to make him feel really glad he's home [Music] when Jeffrey and I go to Paris all we want to do immediately is have French bread and French pastries French bread it's really hard to make the same here but fruit tarts that can be really good so I'm gonna treat Jeffrey with strawberry tarts I'm gonna make the pastry first and you want to start with really really cold ingredients it makes a really flaky pastry so I froze this it's one and a quarter cups of flour 3 tablespoons of sugar a little sweetness and 1/2 a teaspoon of salt and then I'm gonna have lots of good butter so 3/4 of a stick of butter and I'm gonna combine that with 2 tablespoons of vegetable shortening that way you get the flavor of the butter but the flakiness of the vegetable shortening 1 and 2 I actually keep the vegetable shortening the refrigerator keep it nice and cold okay I'm just gonna process it until the butter is the size of peas you want to be able to see the butter in the pastry okay now I need a quarter of a cup of ice water just like the rest of the ingredients you want the water really really cold that's good and cold just gonna pour it right through the food too [Music] and then just pulse it until it becomes a bowl of dough perfect I don't know about you but I always think pastry is terrifying it's not that hard though okay just dump it on a board really careful this is incredibly sharp I can't tell you how many times I've cut myself on it and just roll this into a ball so this dough is gonna make about four fruit tarts individual ones but since I only need two for Jeffrey and me I'm gonna cut it in half and half a rest in the refrigerator and half we're gonna freeze for later so while the dough's chillin in a pastry cream pastry cream is a lot like creme anglaise vanilla cream but it's got a little extra cornstarch so instead of worrying about boiling and ending up with scrambled eggs you can cook it until it's really thick so I'm gonna start with one and a half cups of scalded milk you don't want to boil it okay I'm gonna get all the other ingredients ready so I've got five egg yolks and the 3/4 of a cup of sugar and then beat these together until they're really really thick [Music] okay this is done I'm gonna show you what it looks like when you get a really thick sort of ribbon just like that really thick okay so next thing I'm gonna do is turn the mixer on low and add three tablespoons of cornstarch ports are just really like flour like adding flour to a gravy or something allows you to boil it without having it curdle mix that in but I'm gonna get the scalded milk good that's perfect not boiling just slowly add this in okay now I'm gonna put the bowl thing back in the pan and just cook it I [Music] really just want to stir this you don't wanna burn the bottom but the good news is you can make it in advance and keep it in the refrigerator well it gets really thinking on a whisk this is the point where it who is creme anglaise it would become scrambled eggs but because of the cornstarch you can cook it until it's really thick perfect look how gorgeous that is okay and then I'm gonna add some flavor so first vanilla and cognac why don't have teaspoons of vanilla use pure vanilla extract it really makes a difference one teaspoon of cognac maybe more than a teaspoon no pay no tablespoon of butter I'm just gonna melt into it and a tablespoon of heavy cream to stir it all together and now just think if there are a few lumps I'm gonna sieve it someone's just pour it right through the sieve so the butter melted and all the flavors are combined it's another gorgeous no it's nice and smooth and then I'm gonna chill it until it's nice and cold and no lumps okay I'm gonna take a little plastic wrap and just put it in sit it on the ball right directly on the pastry cream I'm gonna make sure that a skin doesn't form so I'm going to chill this and I think the Pistor should be cold enough to roll at man [Music] so the pastry for my strawberry tarts is really cold the only way to make it really flaky pastry so little flour on the board I'm gonna cut this into because it makes two fruit tarts you just roll each one out keep it nice and round so in your only pastry you want the world from the center out I keep it as even as possible just make sure it keeps moving there's no point in having gorgeous pastry that sticks to the board okay now this is a really key moment when you put the pastry in you don't want to stretch it at all all of us including me I've done pastry that shrinks after you bake it and that's because you've stretched it when you put it into the pan I learned that the hard way and then really easy just take the rolling pin run along the top take off the excess I cut one track challenge okay then I have little pieces of butter aluminum foil and it's just buttered on the inside state doesn't stick to the pastry you want to fill these with beans and that'll keep it from puffing up okay when we bake the tart shells 375 for about 10 minutes then take the beans in the foil out with forklift little holes in the bottom put them back in the oven for about 15 to 20 minutes until they're nice and brown and when they're cool I'm gonna fill them pastry cream and fresh strawberry jell-o [Music] so I'm making a really special dinner for Jeffrey and for dessert I'm making fruit tarts strawberry tarts I'm starting with hulling the strawberries I actually like to do half strawberries really depends on how big they are if they're gigantic they can be quarters so I've got the tart shells that I've already baked off and they're cool I'm gonna fill them with pastry cream it's a lot of pastry cream but it lasts really well in the refrigerator so I can use it for all kinds of things just fill that tart shell the good news you can make all these elements in advance paste your cream the tart shells and then just fill them my pastry cream is nice and smooth and it's beautifully flavored with vanilla in connieyc okay strawberries I started from the outside for the points going out you want to layer it because it's really all about the strawberries you can really use grapes raspberries what I'm making fruit tart so I always try and pick fruit that's in season so it tasted really good it's strawberry don't okay I'm gonna grow some of that percussion through the surprise on the top so what are you some kind of jelly like apricot jelly or if you have raspberry jelly that's good too but I like a nice apricot jelly just a little drop of water to make it thin heat it up and it makes the outside of the tart so shiny and just delicious looking but it also keeps the moisture in the tart okay that's it then I'm gonna just brush on the top of the tart see what it does so it makes it really pretty I actually glaze the pastry cream to the whole thing and that just keeps it really moist and now you can't really just add something a little contrast to it it can be a sprig of mint that you having a garden or in the fridge but I love to do something special I love shelled pistachios you're gonna do it just sort of sprinkle some on top and then with fresh strawberries the sweetness you get a little the crunch of pistachios and that's all ready for dessert that who wouldn't love please I'm just gonna let them sit at room temperature until I'm ready to serve them for dessert when I was a little girl my father used to drink whiskey sours and of course he would give me the cherry so I developed a taste for whiskey sours it's a classic drink that's back in fashion again first I'm gonna make them mix I need 3/4 of a cup of whiskey pour it into a beaker or a pitcher most whiskey sours when you get them at restaurants are actually made with sour mix which I hate that this is made with fresh lemon juice of fresh lime juice and a simple sugar syrup so I need 1/2 a cup of freshly squeezed lemon juice it already smells good [Music] pick up freshly squeezed lime juice you really have to use fresh lime just don't even think about using the bottled once [Music] picture the last thing I need is simple syrup and what it is is a cup of sugar and a cup of water that I cooked and chilled and it just makes it very simple syrup that I can sweeten this with so 2/3 of a cup of simple syrup so that's the mix later I'm going to shake it with ice maraschino cherry martini glass that's gonna be really good and now we're gonna go to the butcher for some steaks [Music] for years they used to come to the butcher counter and go there's so many options I don't know which one I want so for a while I made a study of steaks and I found it really depends on two things your taste and exactly what you're doing so for grilling I found I really like a ribeye steak it's particularly wonderful or New York strip steak which is also called the shell steak for roasting I like a nice fillet of beef and today I'm gonna make Jeffrey something special so I need steaks that are filet I feel how are you were you nice to see you today nice to see you I need some filet mignon please no problem Oh that'd be great to station that would be wonderful thanks Bill so I'm gonna do recipe what would I tell people to look for Nate the marbling is is one of the things to texture the meat the color that not necessarily a bright red piece of meat something is bright in the case and then there's a nice dark one I'd go for the dark one you can set more flavor thank you so much bill it's always wonderful you will [Music] nothing says French Bistro food like matchstick potatoes so I'm going to show you how to make them once I peel the potato I'm gonna take a little slice off the end so it lies flat on the board it's easier to slice and now I'm just gonna slice it really thin like an eighth of an inch thick and then I'm gonna slice it in the other direction so we'll end up with matchsticks that's how great this looks okay I'm just gonna soak them in cold water it's actually amazing how much you get out of one potato actually if you want to do them in advance you can just leave them in the cold water but I'm gonna make them right now and then drain them paper towels want them really dry before they go in the hot oil otherwise it just splatter all over the place okay they're ready to go into the oil so the oil is getting hot I needed it 350 degrees kandi tomorrow is great for them right in the Bob okay 350 exactly and go the potatoes nice and dry stand back and they're gonna cook for about three to five minutes I actually leave the thermometer in so I can just check temperatures gonna drop crazy-like to 200 or something so I'm just gonna turn off the heat to get it back to 350 back nothing like the smell of french fries I'm just gonna move this around a little bit so they don't stick together boys it's gonna be good with steak au poivre Jeffrey's not gonna know what hit him okay so when they're nice and golden-brown just take them out of the hot oil drain them don't this look great I'm gonna salt them and then I'm gonna keep them warm in a 350 degree oven while I make the steak this is a great time for good sea salt or fleur de sel well I think I have to try one mmm so onto a sheet pan went to the oven and they'll stay warm until I'm ready to serve dinner [Music] staple problems really easy to make this crack pepper is wonderful and it just press it right into the steaks actually crack the pepper and a little coffee grinder which is great then you get really fresh pepper okay I've got half a tablespoon of butter have a tablespoon of oil I'm just gonna put the steaks right in sizzle I'm gonna cook them for about four minutes on one side until they're really Brown and then flip them over and cook them for three to four minutes on the other side till they're medium-rare who can resist that I think they're just perfect and they are I'm gonna put them on a plate and let them rest for a bit it really brings the juices back and then I'm gonna make a sauce cover it with foil keep them nice and warm okay I'm just gonna pour some of the fat off just leave maybe one tablespoon and I've got one big shallot saute that for a minute until they get nice and tender and then a third of a cup of beef broth don't make your own unless you have some around good canned beef broth is just fine [Music] okay I'm just gonna let this reduce by half it'll take about five or six minutes nothing like some ice-cold whiskey sours to get Jeffrey in a party mood [Music] hey have a celebratory whiskey sour to your new book may one day be completed you almost ready for dinner I'm done right now dinner's ready okay I'll be there well the cocktail didn't get his undivided attention but something tells me steak au poivre will oh this looks beautiful it's reduced I'm gonna add cognac and butter some screaming - of cognac reduce it a little bit and then add the butter I'm so good I love it I can really smell the shallots and the cognac it's gonna be really good on the steaks okay I'm gonna get everything else ready [Music] a little bit of butter in this sauce just sort of wanted to melt not dissolve [Music] why do I think this is gonna get another to study in a hurry Oh sweetie dinner's ready [Music] just stay free anymore too many more stick free so I thought I'm making a classic strawberry tart with pastry cream fresh strawberries but have it if I make you steak au poivre when you start every book and when you finish every book I'm up with that and what about in the middle oh well I guess it's roast chicken [Music]
