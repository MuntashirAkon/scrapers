[Music] roast chicken I can do this in my sleep so I want to just check the chicken for any leftover pinfeathers and I'm going to Pat it dry on the outside and I do that so that when brush it with butter and salt and pepper it will stick to it all the giblets have been taken out and say for another time so I'm just going to stand it up like this and just salt and pepper the inside chicken can sometimes be a little bland and so as much as I can do to give it lots of flavor I'm going to do so salt and pepper inside and then I'll show you my secrets and all you need to do is just take this whole lemon cut it in quarters and just stuff it in the middle I'm going to take this entire head of garlic cut it right in half so you can see all that little clove when it's inside the chicken it's going to be just like the hint of garlic and it gets into the juices in the vegetables in the pan it's so delicious and then I some fresh thyme and just stuff it right inside this great chicken now all I have to do is brush of butter on the top salt and pepper and it's ready to go want to melt the butter but not let it burn but it's actually better for this in olive oil the butter has some milk solids in it that burn a little bit so it makes the chicken nice and brown okay that's good so I'm going to brush the entire outside of this chicken gorgeous little chicken and then season it with salt and pepper I know it seems like a lot of salt but it's really important for the chicken to have lots of flavor and that will do it and pepper okay this is gorgeous now the next thing I do is trust it which is sort of to tie it up so that it cooks evenly one point of trust saying is if it's little legs are out like this the legs can very easily get burnt and the meat can get overcooked so what I want to do is pull it into its body so it cooks really well and I'll just all I have to do is title together and we'll do that you'll see they're all these very complicated ways to trust a chicken but this is about as easy as it gets so when to take a length of kitchen twine and just tie these little legs together and they leave long in so it's easy to take the twine off nobody wants to eat wine for dinner so just like that and then it's little wings just go under here just tuck them under the whole bird doesn't have to be wrapped in twine I've seen some birds that look like they're in bondage roast chickens just the best kind of comfort food and the good news is can be a really simple meal or can be really elegant one okay that's ready to go all right egg is ready I love when they are vegetable to the bottom of the chicken and they just soak up all this delicious chicken juices so I'm going to put carrots fennel and onions in the pan next thing is a drizzle of olive oil doesn't have to be exact just so that they get a little brown on the gross little salt little pepper and now I'm going to take the chickens so all the juices from the chicken are going to get into the vegetables and we'll all cook together it'll be so delicious so into the oven 425 degrees for about an hour and a half can't wait [Music] you
