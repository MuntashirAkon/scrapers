every Wednesday my friends come for bridge and just when they think they're gonna get chips and dip I'm gonna Surprise them with a fabulous finger food meal served with delicious content so what I thought would be fun is to do a dinner menu but in bite-size pieces so we can play cards and have dinner at the same time so I'm making vegetable sushi it's the vegetable course and then lobster salad and Eve leaves that's the fish course sausage and puff pastry is the meat course and then for dessert because you always have to have dessert I'm going to do mini Linzer cookies that'll be really good so watch how great this is first thing is a sushi rolling mat which is a little bamboo mat you can buy in any kind of a grocery or specialty store and the next thing is these nori rolls which is seaweed I'll show you what these guys look like it's a very thin sheet of seaweed and it has one shiny side and one dull side and it's the shiny side that goes down on the bamboo roller and then I'm gonna moisten it with a little bit of rice wine vinegar just to soften it up a little bit I know this seems like a lot of unusual ingredients but they usually all together on the grocery shelf okay that's it now the next thing I have cooked sushi rice what you really just steamed until it's cooked and then I'm going to put about a cup and a quarter on each roll okay so I'm gonna wet my fingers the best way to do it okay watch this so Pat it out in a thin layer to the end of the edges but you want to leave this edge at the top and the bottom free because that's going to keep it stuck together when we roll it up okay now some flavorings this is the key thing this is wasabi it's really hot all by itself it's like horseradish but what you do is mix it with water it's still really hot but it flavors this and you just want to put a little bit of wasabi down the middle of this just to flavor it you want to put just a tiny bit on otherwise you blow your friends out of their seats okay that's that and then I'm going to put some red onions right down the middle like this I'm going to put all the vegetables in one line and then you'll see how they all roll up together look gorgeous okay so the first thing I put on is some cucumber right straight across and red pepper just run it right down the middle of this you'll see this all going to be in a bundle and it's a little gorgeous when it's done and yellow pepper and scallion that I've julienned for flavor and color and then very long thin piece of carrot and then for flavor pickled ginger which I'll show you what this is it's really good they're very thin slices of fresh ginger that have been pickled and it really gives it lots of flavor now comes the fun part I'm going to roll this whole thing up so you take the bamboo mat and just pull the nori the black nori right up over this bundle and then just keep pulling the mat and allowing it to roll through this pressing really hard so it sticks and you want to make sure that there's an edge here and then you just press it so it's nice and tight and voila we have sushi so what I'm going to do is chill this and then I'll slice the ends off and then serve it with sushi dipping sauce it's going to be really good with the party so that's the first one I'm going to make a few more you know you really shouldn't be scared of trying this I was terrified the first time I could eat roll into thin slices of sushi so they'll make about nine each okay those are ready so now I just need a little sushi dipping sauce I'm going to slice the sushi and then we'll have a little sauce to dip it in so first thing is half a teaspoon of this incredibly hot wasabi powder so be careful not to put more than half a teaspoon in and a half a teaspoon of water and that's really just to make a paste out of it you just mix these together it's gonna turn green sort of a great sage green color and then to give it more heat 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes as though it's not hot enough a teaspoon of chopped pickled ginger teaspoon of chopped scallions this is not just gonna give it flavor but it's gonna make it look good too 1/4 cup of wine vinegar 3 tablespoons of soy sauce use good soy sauce cuz it really makes a difference it has lots of flavor and I have a teaspoon of sesame oil you want to use the toasted sesame oil that really smells like sesame oil some of them are just clear I'm just gonna whisk that together and that's it so I'm gonna put this in the fridge and then I'm going shopping do these gorgeous little clams would be great for clam chowder but today I'm here for lobster meat and in the life's too short category I'm never gonna cook a lobster if the seafood shop is gonna do it for me so Cullen I need about a pound of fresh lobster meat oh this is gorgeous beautiful we cook the precious more let's go get fresh in the morning we do if I were gonna make cook a lobster myself how many lobsters what I need for a pound of meat believe it or not you need about four Lobster really for lobsters the other don't so glad you're cooking it for me that might be about enough okay perfect that's great so my friends are coming for bridge and I'm sure they're expecting pretzels potato chips I'm gonna Surprise them with a full meal and it's all gonna be finger food so we can play bridge and eat at the same time so what I'm gonna make now is lobster salad in and Eve leaves it's a little luxurious but they deserve it so I've got a pound of lobster that I've gotten actually already cooked it's a particular lecture to be able to do that but I'd have to cook four lobsters in order to get a pound of lobster meat so so much trouble so I just have to chop this up into bite-sized pieces okay into the ball then I'm gonna get about 1/2 a cup of mayonnaise use good mayonnaise it's really worth it 1/2 a cup of chopped celery a tablespoon of capers drain the liquid out because you don't want it too vinegary lots of fresh dill so I'm just going to run my knife on the head don't pick all those a little leaves off it's too time-consuming and just roughly chopped it doesn't have to be so finely chopped that you can't see the dill in the salad I think it's good one you know exactly what you're eating love dill with seafood okay fresh dill and salt and pepper just to season it lightly some freshly ground black pepper and then toss it together how easy is that let's make sure this tastes perfect I'm so good could you really taste the lobster so for dessert for my card friends I'm gonna make Linzer cookies well then a really traditional Linzer cookies they're shortbread cookies with raspberry jam in the middle so in here I have 3/4 of a pound of butter cup of sugar and a teaspoon of vanilla and I'm just going to add the flour and salt need three half cups of flour that's one three and then just a half that's pretty close a quarter teaspoon of kosher salt then I sift it all together not only combines the salt in the flour but it makes sure if there any little hard pieces in the flour it gets sifted out great then with the mixer on low just add the flour into the butter and sugar mixture okay one good mix of the spatula am i wearing it not yet and then mix on low speed until it just really pulls together as a dough and that's it so clear the decks a little bit of flour on the board dump it out on the board clunk we're just going to pull it together with my hands don't worry about using too much flour in the board just make sure it doesn't stick it's gonna Pat this out into a nice round disc chill it for 15 minutes and then roll it out into cookies with playing card motifs it's gonna be really good and into the fridge for party I think we're all so set on having cocktails in the living room dinner in the dining room breakfast in the kitchen it's just really boring I love to shake it up a little bit so what it does I brought my kitchen table into the living room and the kitchen chairs nice and comfy for bridge and I brought a table from the entryway I'm gonna set up all the food and the drinks right here gives me an opportunity to walk around see everybody's cards no I really don't do that then I have these great napkins a friend gave me they've got cards on them they're a little Kitsch but I think they're really fun so the rooms all set and we're gonna have a good time now for the fun part of the winds are cooking blowing the mouth always feels like play-doh to me so I have my chilled just want to make sure it keeps moving on the board so what I'm gonna do is cut out small rounds as the bottom of the cookie and then I'm gonna put the top on with a cutout and you can see the raspberry jam that's in the middle it's gonna look good it's gonna taste good so a little bit of flour on the board just make sure the colors well floured I'm going to put it on a baking sheet with parchment paper so it doesn't stick I'm going to cut it about 12 rounds the good thing about this dough is after you cut out the rounds you can roll the rest of it up in a ball and keep cutting them out I okay last one so now what I'm going to do is I have this little Club cutout that I'm going to cut the top of the cookie with just like a playing card I have hearts spades diamonds and clubs so each of the tops of these cookie is going to have a cutout so the bottom of the cookie is going to have raspberry jam and then when we put the top on you'll see the raspberry jam in the cutout it's going to be great and then I'll put a little bit of powdered sugar on the top of the cookie hearts and finally spades so I'm going to chill these for about 15 minutes and then bake them at 350 for about 10 to 15 minutes and then fill them with raspberry jam they're gonna be so good so my card chart friends are coming to play bridge with me and I'm making an entire meal all in finger food a vegetable sushi lobster salad on deep leaves and I'm making sausage and puff pastry so I've got one sheet of puff pastry and then I'm going to brush it with some Dijon mustard give it lots of flavor leave the edge free so when you wrap it up it'll stick put mustard on both sheets so the next thing I'm going to do is take a piece of lamb sausage that I've already cooked and just put it right down on top of the puff pastry and then roll the pastry up around the sausage this is so easy when you have puff pastry already made I'm going to take a little bit of this egg wash which is egg mixed with water and milk whatever you have just to seal the edge and right onto a baking sheet on the second one the good thing about this is you can really make it in advance and leave it unbaked in the refrigerator and just bake it off just before the party little bit of egg wash on the top make sure it comes out nice and brown then I'm just going to score it into individual pieces so when it comes out hot I'll know where to cut it so seven pieces perfect into the oven 400 degrees for about 20 to 25 minutes and then I'll slice it and serve it with mustard it's gonna be good we're having dinner we have to have cocktails I'm gonna make a really easy drink for my card party it's called a lemon drop first ingredient is vodka that's the key two cups of vodka I find a much more successful at Bridge at the opponents drink a lot of vodka two cups of vodka half a cup of freshly squeezed lemon juice quarter of a cup of superfine sugar let's get together and I'm gonna add some lemon to it and then I'm gonna serve them in martini glasses and that's it and I'm ready for a party so I've done all the cooking and now I'm going to do the assembling these are the Linzer cookies I'm gonna put a little bit of raspberry jam on the bottoms and then put the tops on with powdered sugar see it looks great okay now we're going to take a little bit of powdered sugar so we'll just dust powdered sugar on the top of these cutouts you'll see when it goes on the raspberry jam it looks great diamonds clubs and a diamond and a heart I'm the last ones for me make sure they're good mmm so good cookies buttery and the raspberry jam sweet my friends are gonna love them Club diamond heart it was babe it's all there it's party time my bridge friends are coming in about 15 minutes and I just have a few things to get ready before they get here so the first thing is lamb sausage and puff pastry and all I have to do is to slice this how gorgeous it is it's nice and hot it's a great thing to make early because it can really sit in the refrigerator and then just bake it off before the party I'm gonna serve this with a little dish of Dijon mustard it's gonna be great okay the next thing is vegetable sushi these sushi rolls that I've done and also these are great to do in advance with sushi rice and vegetables inside okay this goes right on the dish and then I'm gonna serve it with this dipping sauce which is like a soy and ginger marinade with all kinds of good flavors in it now that's all done now finish off the lobster salad so the last thing to assemble is the lobster salad on deep leaves so the Antibes is great it's actually like this little cup I just cut off each leaf from the stem I love when my friends come they come every week and we have a really good time so we'll just put a little bit of lobster salad in each of these little on deed cups and then it's finger food can actually do this with crab meat and shrimp salad I think lobster sounds special and just a little fresh dill for garnish I'm ready for bridge party if you've had as many lemon drops as I have you're in trouble goodies
