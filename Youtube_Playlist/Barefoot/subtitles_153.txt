[Music] I'm making linguini with shrimp scampi it's a great summer dish I add oil the pasta pot so that the pasta doesn't stick together and salt for flavor okay that's going to cook for seven to ten minutes according to the directions on the package okay that's three tablespoons of olive oil and about three tablespoons of butter I do the olive oil because if it's a high burning temperature and the butter because it has lots of flavor I know this looks like a lot but it's the sauce of the entire dish and about one and a half tablespoons of garlic with garlic you really don't want to cook it too long for just about a minute nothing worse than the flavor of garlic so one minute while I get everything else ready so the first thing is shrimp and what I buy is a peeled and deveined shrimp from the dish store if you can't buy it you can always peel and devein it yourself I'm going to add a pound of shrimp and just cook it for a very short time like three to five minutes and all that flavor but garlic is going to give it to the shrimp so first I'm going to do a salt and pepper the shrimp or give lots of flavor because when you add the pasta the sauce has to flavor the pasta also really strongly flavors just turn the shrimp so they cook evenly on both sides so good all that garlic and butter and oil how bad can that be Michael's so great with flowers I can't wait to see what he's doing at the table [Music] like hoping like this so just raining from draining the water from it and then it's going to go right into that pan with the shrimp and the garlic and butter and oil you can absorb all that great flavor okay just like that two spoons just toughed it all together it's actually a great way to make any pasta Italians do it even when you're making pasta with tomato sauce as you cook the pasta and themselves together for the last few minutes and it really absorbs the flavor okay and then the last ingredients of lemon zest lemon juice I like a little bit of heat just sprinkling of red pepper flakes okay just toss that together and then two more things to put in parsley okay right on top and then because I want you to can't really see the lemon but I want you to know it's lemon what I do is a few thin slices of lemon people are going to eat them but they'll they'll see that it's lemon so I'm going to add a few slices of lemon to the whole thing for our finished off thing this is really great summer lunch
