[Music] so what I did was I asked the butcher to bone a leg of lamb but just to leave the end of the sort of the shank end in and it just gives it a little better form this is one big leg of lamb really nice and it's trimmed and tied okay now for the marinade so the first thing I'm going to do is have a better tablespoon of fresh rosemary and again you just want to slide your fingers right down the stalk and just take any tough stems out that should be that that should be bad enough remember rosemary is really strongly flavored you don't want too much and that six cloves of garlic that's going to go into it so usually I do this in a food processor I'm not big on specialized equipment but this little mini food processor is so useful for tasks like this so I'm going to put the rosemary and the garlic and tablespoon of salt [Music] teaspoon of pepper and buy two tablespoons of melted butter right into this little processor this is going to puree it can I make a lot of noise too how's that pretty easy okay now we're just going to put this rub it right onto the lamb and it's infuse the land with great flavor and then when it's roasted over the potatoes the flavor the potatoes to that garlic and rosemary I know it seems like a lot of salt and pepper but it has been seasoned the entire lamb and the potato so that's just going to rest on the meat for about thirty minutes while the flavors really get into the lamb this is going to be so good and all the juices from the lamb and the rosemary and garlic cook right into the potatoes they just absorb all that gorgeous flavor okay that's potatoes and this brings a little unusual I'm going to put in six cloves unpeeled garlic so right in with potatoes the olive oil make sure the potatoes Brown and when I said and then right on top the gorgeous leg of lamb with rosemary and garlic now I'm going to roast it at 450 degrees which is really hot and be great and it'll be about now and a quarter to an hour and a half I think the land might be done so what I'm going to do is take it out put it on a platter and just let it rest for about 20 minutes some big way we're just going to cover it with foil to keep it warm and this allows the juices to get back into the land lambs been resting for about 20 minutes so it's perfect and if taking the strings off and now only need to do it Garvin nice thing about that is it's boneless so we can really slice it anyway and to be very good I'm just going to serve on a big platter with all the vegetables together [Music]
