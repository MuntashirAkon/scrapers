[Music] chicken salad Veronique it's like chicken salad but elevated to party food I thought Michael and Jim would really like it so the first thing I did was I roasted chicken breasts olive oil salt and pepper for 35 minutes at 350 degrees and it really makes the chicken so much moisture than poaching it let it cool a little bit take the skin off I'm just going to cube this kind of one or two small but I want sort of bite-sized pieces imperfect I'm going to just right into the bowl chicken still a little warm which is a great way to make the salad and then it really absorbs the flavor once it's cold it's firmer and it doesn't absorb the flavor so much so chicken salad Veronique I think comes from probably so Veronique which is classically made with grapes chicken there's so much more flavor when it's roasted than it does when it's poached there's something about the water that just takes all the flavor out of it and there's so many about the olive oil salt and pepper that gives it flavor so I think for tonight I'm going to do four chicken breasts okay now for the sauce so first have a cup of mayonnaise put it right into the bowl and toss it all together okay now some green things so first our gun which is a really delicate herb when I have tablespoons of fresh tarragon leaves this really is a place for fresh herbs just going to chop it up it smells wonderful I think you've really under used herb tarragon okay the next thing is celery in the category of lots of green things I'm going to run my knife right down the middle leave it attached on the top and just shut up okay right in shelter two stalks of celery it's about one cup of celery [Music] but the good news is you can do as much as you like okay that should be just about one cup and now comes the veronique part green grapes so I need about one cup of green grapes cut in half or make sure use in this grapes nobody wants to be crunching their chickens oh and the salads it farewell to because all the flavors the tarragon will really get into the chicken and the sweetness of the grapes okay that's it for the grade a little salt and pepper just where and a half teaspoons of salt and it sounds odd to have salt and grapes together but really brings out the flavor of them one teaspoon pepper toss it all together and that's chicken salad any
