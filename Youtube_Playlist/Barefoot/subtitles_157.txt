[Music] my husband Jeffrey is so generous with me he's always buying me the most extravagant gifts for my birthday but when it comes to his birthday he likes things very low-key so I'm combining three of his favorite things for dinner tonight in his honor rose chicken great friends and the beach first I'm marinating a boneless butterfly chicken to cook on the grill plus skewers of savory cherry tomatoes and on the side crisp broccolini with balsamic vinaigrette and for dessert Jeffrey's favorite mixed berry pavlova a cloud of meringue whipped cream and berries my friends Frank and Susan are helping at the beach and if I'm lucky I can keep it all a secret from the birthday boy [Music] so for Geoffrey's surprise party I thought I'd make something different chicken well the surprise is a different kind of chicken I'm gonna make a butterfly chicken I'm gonna do it with lots of herbs and then grill it it's gonna be so good so what I have is a butterfly chicken that I asked the butcher to take all the bones out the wings the legs so it's completely flat and now I'm gonna make a rosemary and lemon marinade for it it's gonna be nice cuz it marinates for a while in the refrigerator and then when it goes on the grill it has all those wonderful flavors of rosemary and lemon but also the charcoal so the first thing I need is a quarter of a cup of fresh rosemary leaves I'm just gonna chop them up the key to this recipe is that I'm gonna make it an herb marinade that goes underneath the skin so it's gonna flavor the chicken the skin and they're gonna roll it up around fresh rosemary leaves and lemons and so the skin and the chicken meat is really flavored chickens pretty bland as it becomes so I love to do something really special to make it taste great they gonna chop up rosemary leaves pretty finely cuz they're pretty tough they're not it's not a tender leaf like a basil leaf really small mints okay so it's a quarter of a cup of rosemary leaves chopped so to measure the whole leaves and then chop them perfect seven into the bowl and then garlic's rosemary and garlic classic combination three cloves of garlic garlic gives it a little heat which is good and the best part of the butterfly chicken you can just put it on a board when it's cooked and just slice it you don't have to deal with all those bones into the bowl the zest of half a lemon I love these combination of flavors lemon garlic rosemary about a teaspoon of grated lemon zest and the juice of half a lemon [Music] [Applause] one and a half tablespoons okay want to have tablespoons of olive oil two teaspoons of salt and 1/2 teaspoon of pepper okay I'm just gonna mix it all together okay so that's the marinade pull the chicken right up here so when I do this marinade is put it underneath the skin that's really where it has the most flavor so just take your fingers and just run it right between the skin and the meat there's a few connective tissues you want to just get rid of just like that perfect someone's gonna it with my fingers just put some of this marinade underneath the skin and then rub a little bit on the top okay and then just tick whatever's left over and just pour it right on top I scrub the whole thing in okay now want to make sure that have lots of flavor on the underside too so I'm gonna take the lemon that I've already got cut and just slice it and just put two slices of lemon inside a couple of sprigs of rosemary now I'm gonna do this at the beach on a grill but you can certainly do it at home in the oven I'd say probably 350 about 35 to 40 minutes will do it so easy okay second one flip it over these are two and a half to three pound chickens and I think that'd just be perfect two sprigs of rosemary salt and pepper flip it over okay that's when the marinade really messy job okay into the fridge for a few hours overnight even better it's going to be absolutely delicious on the grill [Music] broccolini with balsamic vinegar it's such an easy vegetable and the good news so transportable so I can take it to the beach so broccolini is actually like a Chinese vegetable and it's a little more delicate and I just think it has better flavor than regular broccoli it's gonna make a great side dish so that's about three or four bunches of broccolini okay and I put it in a boiling salted water to blanch it about two tablespoons of salt in the water and just in it goes okay that's gonna cook about two to three minutes in the meantime I'm gonna make vinaigrette so quarter cup of olive oil my friend Frank newbold claims not to be a good cook but I know better than that he actually gave me this recipe one and a half tablespoons of balsamic vinegar 1 teaspoon of garlic fat one clove seems like a lot of garlic and vinaigrette but you really wanted to be strongly flavored half a teaspoon of Dijon mustard okay why don't have teaspoons of salt half a teaspoon of pepper just whisk it all together and that's the vinaigrette you can actually make the vinaigrette in advance and the broccolini and then put them together just before serving I think broccoli we should be done perfect I'm just gonna put it in ice water to stop the cooking this is a really fast vegetable dish okay let that cool I'm gonna drain it so the broccoli is crisp tender from the blanching and when I put it in ice water shocks it sets is it really bright green okay make sure all the water's out into a bowl pour on the vinaigrette it's a little bit warrent really absorbs the vinaigrette and the juice of half a lemon just adds a real fresh sort of zesty flavor to it toss it up and that's broccolini with balsamic vinaigrette and how easy is that this is gonna be great served at room temperature at the beach and next making one of my favorite desserts of all times have lova it's Geoffrey's birthday and something tells me a birthday cake just isn't gonna make it with candles on it so I decided I'm gonna make a pavlova which is a disc of meringue piled high with whipped cream and I do it with fresh berries it's really just delicious just feels very special what I need is for egg whites at room temperature really important that they're room temperature otherwise you won't get the volume okay into the mixer put a pinch of salt on high speed for about a minute and I'm going to put in a cup of sugar put the sugar in slowly is going to get very sick and shiny [Music] looks like it's nice and thick and shiny now so see what happens it'll just stand up on its own just the way you want just like that I had 50 spoons of corn starch and was sift it right in just makes it nice and thick wait you see this is an amazing dessert and it was named after Anna Pavlova who was a famous ballerina and I think it probably because the meringue looks like her tutu I'm going to add teaspoon of white wine vinegar that actually stabilizes the egg whites and half a teaspoon of good vanilla extract just flavor it's gonna fold that in with a rubber spatula just cut it right down the middle and then pull it up on the side just folded in careful you don't want to deflate the egg whites that's exactly the kind of party I like I love parties at the beach cuz they're sort of very casual and I love when everybody helps out I think everybody has a better time when they're involved in it okay now I'm gonna put it on a sheet pin so what if God is a piece of parchment paper and something that's 9 inches it can be played or a cake band and I'm just gonna draw a line right around the cake pan I want this disc to be exactly 9 inches and the key here is turn the parchment over otherwise you'll end up with the pencil on them right not a good idea just gonna dump all of this right in the middle [Music] to me this is a real sort of New Year's Eve or birthday kind of dessert I'm just really special and nobody knows how easy this just spread this out just to 9 inches it doesn't have to be perfect it's gonna be covered with whipped cream okay this looks pretty good into the oven 180 degrees for an hour and a half and then going to turn the oven off and let it sit for another hour and it's gonna be crisp on the outside and just gooey on the inside it'll be so good piled a tie with cream and berries YUM [Music] how's it going friends perfect great one of the things I like best about pavlova is the combination of textures so there's a crisp meringue and then there's the whipped cream creamy whipped cream fresh berries which has a different texture that I'm gonna make a raspberry sauce that's gonna make the whole thing so gooey and delicious so the first thing I need have kind of fresh raspberries right into the pan half a cup of sugar a quarter of a cup of water so we bring this to a simmer let it simmer for about four minutes until it gets a little syrupy I'm gonna add some friend Oise raspberry jam it's gonna be delicious sauce my gorgeous pet lover I would like to turn up the volume why make regular raspberry sauce when you can make triple raspberry sauce I'm gonna add Framboise I'm gonna add seedless raspberry jam so this is the fastest raspberry sauce on earth take the cooked raspberries one jar of seedless raspberry jam which is about a cup of jam and because I like extra raspberry flavor got a tablespoon of friend wasps it's the raspberry liqueur it's raspberry flavor and color just puree it together that's a raspberry sauce [Music] I'm gonna chill it to be nice and thick I'm gonna mix it with a fresh fruit and use it as a sauce this looks gorgeous really raspberry okay into the fridge [Music] this is the good part I'm going to finish the pavlova so I have one pint of strawberries and I'm going to mix it with half pint of blueberries and half pint of raspberries and port raspberry sauce are all room so I finish everything up because my friend Susan is going to come pick everything up Jeffers thanks for taking a quiet stroll on the beach but instead this little party going on okay that's the strawberries so next thing I need to do is whip some cream so a cup of heavy cream tablespoon sugar he's gonna good vanilla [Music] okay well that whips up I'm gonna get the meringue [Music] I'm just gonna put them around right on [Music] and the work creams just ready I just wanted firm but not too hard just like that yeah okay big slather of whipped cream on top of this and running high bacon that you don't want to assemble this too far in advance they don't just make it to the beach okay that for the gorgeous part strawberries have a kind of blueberries epic cut of raspberries I'm just gonna put that half the sauce or enough sauce over it to mix all the berries it just makes it not dry berries but a whole thing mmm Oh who wouldn't want to have this for dessert and right on top I mean is that gorgeous or what and just let the sauce drizzle down the sides and maybe a little extra sauce to drizzle down Wow I mean if Jeffrey's not happy with that it looks pretty good okay

purse every thank you so much okay Jeffery's gonna be home in 10 minutes I've got to do these really fast so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna obscure these tomatoes and throw them right on the grill with a butterflied chicken they can be really good together so I think maybe four on a skewer two skewers per person that works for me they should cook and know five minutes on the grill just until they sort of start to pop and they're really soft this might be the last time Jeffrey's ever home for his birthday sometimes actually thread these with other vegetables like red onion would be good in between the tomatoes but there's so many flavors going on in the butterfly chicken I thought just plain tomatoes olive oil salt and pepper good and simple okay clojure's a little olive oil little bit of pepper and I think I'll use like to see salt for this [Music] roll them around [Music] and I'm never gonna be able to sneak a sheet pan for the beach so I thought I'd just put them in plastic bags

completely flat and now I'm gonna make a rosemary and lemon marinade for it it's gonna be nice cuz it marinates for a while in the refrigerator and then when it goes on the grill it has all those wonderful flavors of rosemary and lemon but also the charcoal so the first thing I need is a quarter of a cup of fresh rosemary leaves I'm just gonna chop them up the key to this recipe is that I'm gonna make it an herb marinade that goes underneath the skin so it's gonna flavor the chicken the skin and they're gonna roll it up around fresh rosemary leaves and lemons and so the skin and the chicken meat is really flavored chickens pretty bland as it cone so I love to do something really special to make it taste great they gonna chop up rosemary leaves pretty finely cuz they're pretty

the bowl and then garlic's rosemary and garlic classic combination three cloves of garlic garlic gives it a little heat which is good and the best part of butterfly chicken you can just put it on a board when it's cooked and just slice it you don't have to deal with all those bones into the bowl the zest of half a lemon I love these combination of flavors lemon garlic rosemary about a teaspoon of grated lemon zest and the juice of half a lemon that should be about one and a half tablespoons okay one half tablespoons of olive oil two teaspoons of salt and a half teaspoon of pepper okay I'm just gonna back that all together okay so that's the marinade pull the chicken right up here so when I do this marinade is put it underneath the skin that's really where it has the most flavor so just take your fingers and just run it right between the skin and the meat there's a few connective tissues you want to just get rid of just like that perfect someone's gonna with my fingers just put some of this marinade underneath the skin and then rub a little bit on the top okay and then just take whatever is left over I just pour it right on top I scrub the whole thing in okay now want to make sure that have lots of flavor on the underside too so I'm gonna take the lemon that I've already got cut and just slice it and just put two slices of lemon inside a couple of sprigs of rosemary now I'm gonna do this at the beach on a grill but you can certainly do it at home in the oven I'd say probably 350 about 35 to 40 minutes will do it so easy okay second one flip it over is it when I have two three pound chickens and I think that'd just be perfect strawberries so next thing I need to do is whip some cream so a cup of heavy cream tablespoon sugar he's gonna good vanilla [Music] okay

them right on the grill with a butterfly chicken they can be really good together so I think maybe four on a skewer two skewers per person that works for me this should cookin no five minutes on the grill just until they sort of start to pop and they're really soft this may be the last time Jeffrey's ever home for his birthday sometimes actually thread these with other vegetables like red onion would be good in between the tomatoes but there's so many flavors going on in the butterfly chicken I thought just plain tomatoes olive oil salt and pepper good and simple okay clojure's a little
