[Music] my life's gotten so busy that sometimes it's hard to find a day to just test recipes but today's the day I've got some ideas I've two classic recipes that I want to update and a soup I've always loved this is definitely my kind of day first I'm taking my classic strawberry scones and seeing if there are other flavors that would make it even better next a wild mushroom lasagna using local mushrooms and finally a shrimp bisque that's as delicious as the classic one it's so much easier to make this is gonna be really fun a couple of classic Barefoot Contessa recipes that I'm always trying to improve on and one of them is scones I'm gonna start with four cups of flour all-purpose flour need 2 tablespoons of sugar you want them a little sweet but not really sweet two tablespoons of baking powder make them light and fluffy and two teaspoons of salt they have lots of flavor so let's combine that in the mixer okay now I need some butter the key to really light flaky scones is the butter it's really important that it's very cold when the heat of the oven hits the butter in the scones the water evaporates and the steam puffs them up okay into the flour mixture just turn on the mixer on low I'm just gonna mix it until the butter isn't like pea-sized pieces okay in the meantime I'm gonna get the eggs and the cream ready so I need four extra-large eggs it's best if they're cold so they don't make the butter warm and my cup of cold heavy cream it's gonna mix the eggs and put them right into the cream so I'm just gonna pour that creaming the eggs right in it's gonna be a really wet dough but the wetter it is the more moist that scones are perfect don't over mix it so I need 3/4 of a cup of dried strawberries the classic is raisins but I barefoot we used to do them with dried strawberries I'm gonna start with that and then see if I can make variations of it if you can't find them you can always use raisins or cranberries some kind of dried fruit is really good okay let's go put this right in okay I'm gonna mix it with a tablespoon of flour so it stays well distributed in the mix okay into the mix now I wonder what else I can add to this [Applause] can't tell you how many times I find myself in the pantry looking for inspiration so I want something that would go really well with scones salted peanuts yeah roasted cashews Geoffrey already ate them what else honey I make them too sweet currants already did that one no I think we'll nuts chocolates too sweet I think walnuts is it Oh Marge that might be good to actually walnuts and oranges that says breakfast right so I'm gonna chop up some walnuts I'm gonna Bowl maybe some orange zest just do it right over the bowl and then I'll flour these and I think I'll make two kinds of scones I'll make the plain strawberry ones and then I'll make the ones with strawberries orange and we all nuts then I can see which one I like the best so I'd say this is about third of a cup of walnuts and a tablespoon of orange zest I need a little bit of flour maybe a bad another tablespoon I'm gonna roll out half of them playing see give lots of flour it's really stinky I'm going to Pat it out that's 3/4 of an inch thick and I like to use a square cutter and it can really be any size cutter it can be around when it can be square one I like to make triangles out of a big square okay so those are plain ones and I'm gonna add the walnuts and orange zest see that's even better actually see the butter and I can see the car exists looks good roll it out to about 3/4 of an inch [Music] I think I'll bring into the office and see what everybody here thinks okay that's enough we're tests these are the new ones let's go cut these in triangles that's the experimental wall not an orange tray and now for the traditional ones with just strawberries so we can use that as a control test okay egg wash just a little beaten egg white with a little milk or water just makes it nice and brown on the top sprinkle of sugar to make it look good [Music] into the oven 400 degrees for 20 to 25 minutes I think I know which one I'm gonna like best I'm curious which one they like okay Susanna and Shinae there that's it I think I like the one with the walnuts better definitely I really are yeah better okay I think it's the orange scones with walnuts right I'm fantastic okay my next challenge is I'm going to take classic lasagna recipe make wild mushroom lasagna what do you think what sounds delicious okay hey you guys want to come for lunch yeah those make lasagna with turkey sausage which is perfectly fine but I thought wouldn't it be nice to make it with wild mushrooms and I heard about a wild mushroom farm somewhere around here I think that sounds delicious [Music] look at these mushrooms they're amazing nice shiitakes I just bet he's awful logs in the back oh they're gorgeous actually I need one and a half pounds of mushrooms I usually make a turkey lasagna and I want to make it with wild mushrooms well so I since you're the wild mushroom ma'am so what are these guys what I have here are some some blue oyster mushrooms named blue for the color but uh waster mushrooms because of their shape just like a moister oh yeah then what are these guys these are the King oyster 's they call him a king because it's kind of the king of the oyster mushrooms got a nice firm texture and nutty flavor and you know a nice calico cream-colored cat are they different in flavor they're gonna be a little more rich a little stronger like nutty flavor almost if mushrooms can be nutty and these will be a little more mild and tender I think that's perfect to do a banana perfect okay great he's often thank you please look amazing I can't wait to make the lasagna [Music] I guess so much day my voter I did it would be doing well no matter what kind of lasagna I'm testing you have to start out with a lasagna noodles so I have a big pot of boiling water olive oil make sure they don't stick together salt that's 3/4 of a pound of lasagna noodles gonna boil them for bet at 8 to 10 minutes just until they're done so the first thing I'm gonna do for the mushroom lasagna is a bechamel or white sauce it's really kind of a classic for lasagna so the first thing is I need butter I won't stick of butter just melt that over medium heat and what I've got is I've got a quart of milk that I'm heating up I need to have a cup of flour it's gonna put it right into the butter just dump the whole thing in just gonna cook it for just a bit a minute okay just gonna pour the milk in all at once it's gonna make a really thick white sauce so needs some seasonings tablespoon of salt teaspoon of pepper and nutmeg quarter of a teaspoon of fresh nutmeg I'm just gonna keep stirring this so just thickened it happened so fast I only want to keep an eye on it its thickens too fast you can just whisk it until it's smooth I'd say that's perfect okay next to the mushrooms big saute pan okay time to slice the mushrooms so I'm gonna do this in two batches cuz you don't want if there are too many mushrooms in the pan without steam instead of saute and they won't have as much flavor so just gonna slice these big slices if you can't find these mushrooms which are hard to find actually because they're really special you can use portobello mushrooms or porcini mushrooms or shiitakes are delicious it's amazing how many kinds of varieties there are okay salmon here two tablespoons of butter and two tablespoons of oil it'll just help them Brown a little bit and just has so much more flavor when they're sauteed into the pan on the cookies for five minutes and then another batch for five minutes nothing written to assemble the lasagna [Music] so the first thing to do is pour some white sauce on the bottom of the dish they're about three or four layers of this I'm gonna put the sauce and zhonya noodles and the mushrooms with lots of Parmesan cheese in the middle okay so the next thing is lasagna noodles just fit them in loosely doesn't have to be perfect they're hot they're really hot and if you have to cut them to fit that's fine okay more sauce just enough to bind it all together it's a really elegant kind of lasagna looks great as a main course for a vegetarian but it's also nice if you want to do a roast and a little bit of lasagna to go with it so about a third of the mushrooms and this is a good part Parmesan cheese about a quarter of a cup of Parmesan cheese this is really gonna flavor it okay I'm gonna do it again more lasagna more sauce one of the great things about lasagna always is that you can make it in advance and then just bake it before dinner okay more mushrooms what parmesan one of the Sonia noodles [Music] spring them okay into the oven 375 degrees 45 minutes it smells delicious the proofs gonna be in the tasting [Music] perfect timing I do it here I had it I know it was lasagna you'd show up all right this is the test all right I mean you know you never know it's a mushroom lasagna how's this is that a big enough taste what do you think got the mushrooms from that wonderful guy in Bridgehampton who has mushroom farm oh it smells pretty good actually delish you never know you never know though okay go for it so creamy puppet mmm this is delicious thank you mmm good what's the spice ina oh it's nutmeg Jase yeah just a burnt hand - okay I'm the worst critic I love us mmm well he tastes fantastic - Lohan food one of the things I've learned when I'm recipe testing is write it down immediately because by tomorrow I've totally forgotten what I've done so I would say the strawberries comes for a success everybody like them including me with orange zest and walnuts so just when we thought something was perfect the way it was it can be even better and the wild mushroom lasagna that was a surprise I actually really like lasagna with meat in it but the mushrooms are so meaty who needs me it was just wonderful [Music] sure bisque I love it but every recipe I've seen is really complicated I decide I'm gonna see if I can make a really simple version that's just delicious I bought fish stock and I've added the shrimp shells to it to give it even more flavor I'm gonna strain the fish stock I need 3 and 3/4 cups so if I have a little less I'm just gonna have some water yep just a little water okay so first thing I've done here is sauteed two cups of leeks and three tablespoons of olive oil just make sure the leeks are really really clean before you cook them okay I'm gonna add some garlic got a tablespoon of garlic just saute it for about a minute actually love shrimp bisque I like that rich shrimp flavor and a little bit of sherry so the next thing I need is a little bit of cayenne pepper just a pinch not too much you don't want to overpower the shrimp and just cook that together okay and then a pound of shrimp this is where the shells came from and just cook the shrimp for about three minutes until they're just perfectly pink and just tender and the shrimp's cooked I'm gonna add the rest of the ingredients and have a really rich delicious shrimp [Music] well I can't make good shrimp bisque with that sherry but I've actually decided little cognac would help the two so I want to start with a quarter of a cup of cognac it's gonna pour it right into the shrimp and leeks better cook from it and that smells good and a quarter of a cup of dry sherry and all that's just gonna really get into the shrimp and flavor the soup now that smells like shrimp bisque shrimp and sherry so classic look I'm gonna puree this now just put it right into the food processor and now I'm just gonna puree until it's really chunky I don't like it when it's too smooth [Music] okay that's perfect and now I'm gonna make a white sauce that's gonna be the base of the soup this white sauce is really the same kind of white sauce I made for the lasagna I'm starting with half a stick of butter and a quarter of a cup of flour I'm gonna cook it over medium low heat for about a minute just to cook the flour then I'm adding two cups of half-and-half who's gonna stir this until heaven half gets hot and it thickens with the flour so far it's been pretty easy okay the next I'm gonna put in is the pureed shrimp and leeks really smells good can smell the cognac and sherry that's my have so much flavor the fish stock three and three-quarter cups third of a cup of tomato paste two teaspoons of salt and one teaspoon of pepper and that's it just gonna stir it up and just let this simmer all the flavors are gonna go together it's gonna be rich and delicious I hope hmm so good classic taste half the time I'm happy it was a good day now I wonder what else I can add to this can't tell you how many times I find myself in the pantry looking for inspiration so I want something that would go really well with scones salted peanuts yeah roasted cashews Geoffrey already ate them what else honey I'll make them
