[Music] Antonia Bellanca and I have been dear friends for decades she's coming today with her gorgeous daughter Tess who at 14 years old is already a professional Baker Tess and I have actually been baking together since she was five I like to think I had a little influence on her for dinner I'm making fresh crab cakes that are packed with flavor and instead of the usual coleslaw a French celery root remoulade then for dessert I'm getting ingredients ready for a lemon meringue tart so Tess and I can pipe the meringue topping together I'm always in the kitchen cooking on my own I'm so excited to have Test cooking with me and hey I might even send her home with a new baking skill my friends Antonian test live in Cape Cod and I thought it'd be great to make crab cakes for dinner make them feel right at home so I'm gonna saute them in butter and oil the key to crab cakes is lots of flavor I don't like crab cakes that are just like crab and mayonnaise it has to have lots of flavor and I do it by having wonderful vegetables so what I'm going to do is saute all these vegetables the other thing about crab cakes since the crab is quite expensive this really makes it go much further so I'm just gonna put these in the oil and butter I've got about 3/4 of a cup of red onion we're gonna 1/2 cups of celery half a cup of yellow peppers sweet yellow peppers and I got a half a cup of red peppers I'd really prefer red and yellow peppers I think they're sweeter than green peppers I just saute those for about 15 minutes until they're really just tender and be colorful and flavorful okay now I need some parsley 1/4 cup of chopped parsley a rough chop is just fine doesn't have to be the most perfect chopped parsley in the world okay that's about quarter of a cup mmm no more flavors I need tablespoon of capers want drained capers you don't want the liquid in it half a teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce quarter of a teaspoon of Tabasco give it a little heat and why don't have teaspoons of Old Bay seasoning which is a great sort of crabcakes seasoning mixture you can really find anywhere in a grocery store salt and pepper can never forget salt and pepper that half a teaspoon of each I'm just gonna cook this for about 10 minutes until the vegetables are really tender I'm gonna add the crabmeat and lots of other good stuff [Music] [Applause] so with the crabcakes it's really traditional in my coleslaw but I thought it'd be much better to make celery remoulade but summer wood is that big ugly knob is a kind of celery not the kind we usually get it's kind of bitter and you can see the sort of stalks but it's grown just for the root and has a really fresh sort of celery like flavor so it's but it's a tough root as you can see cutting it so what I'm doing is I'm going to shred it so that the course grading yes you see how fast this is when you do it this way much easier than doing by hand just have to cut these so that the fit in the feed tube if you press on the top things maybe that a course are great which is terrific last piece if you have a little piece left over you can always grade it by hand so that was about a two pound celery root I actually love celery where it's great with mashed potatoes and Gretchen's got a really fresh flavor so I'm just gonna add some salt to this about 1 and 1/2 teaspoons and some fresh lemon juice and that'll keep it from turning brown and sort of marinated a little bit which is great 2 tablespoons of fresh lemon juice and just let it sit while I make the sauce so I need mustard and vinegar when I use mustard I often use two of them like Dijon mustard because it's got real punch and I like coarse grain mustard because I like the texture and it looks like mustard and ooh champagne vinegar but any good white wine vinegar will be just fine okay necklace sauce really easy we do a cup of mayonnaise I was like when mayonnaise is thin with lots of other flavorings so just now that sort of thick texture but it also has lots of flavor of Dijon mustard a tablespoon of course mustard about two teaspoons of the vinegar to get a little see how great this looks it looks like it's yellow with mustard but also the coarse mustard really gives it the texture I think a little bit of lemon juice better tablespoon so now the sauce is already okay just pour enough sauce over it I always have extra sauce because sometimes it gets dry as it sits pour enough sauce over salt and pepper mix it together oh this is gonna be delicious I love celery root lemon juice and mustard together a little more sauce okay this is nicely mixed who's gonna refrigerate it nicely delicious with the crab cakes which I want to finish next [Music] time to mix up the crabcakes let's start with a half a pound of crab meat instead of picking the crabs just buy it like this it's really good make sure it's fresh if you can rather than frozen always better fantastic this looks really beautiful lump crabmeat just check and make sure there are no little sort of shells in it crab cakes are so great for kids I know a lot of kids that won't he broiled halibut but they all like crab cakes so I'm gonna put in all the sauteed vegetables that we've made earlier all the celery and red peppers yellow peppers and red onion is going to be so much flavor and then 1/2 a cup of breadcrumbs just plain breadcrumbs or crying mayonnaise which binds it all together two eggs which also have find it together [Music] fit them lightly right now two teaspoons of good Dijon mustard and just mix it up I think what I want to do it'd be fun for tests to make these crab cakes with when you sound school at this chill in the fridge get nice and firm and then testing on saute them together okay that's nicely nice just looks great okay into the fridge chill for 30 minutes but I think I'm gonna go by Tessa gift she's a fabulous Baker [Music] so for dessert Tess and I are gonna make a lemon meringue tart if I'd be really nice to buy our piping set which is an amazing Baker and I bet she doesn't have a set like this so these are large tips I think it looks really great to do large ones and I'm gonna get a piping bag and you can type the meringue together free pie i Cathy [Music] five [Music] I take it down look absolutely I love lemon meringue pie and I thought it'd be really nice to make it a little fancier for my friends Antoni and Tess so I'm gonna make a lemon meringue tart so the first thing I need is one stick of butter one and a half cups of sugar [Music] so I'm going to cream those together and separate four eggs [Music] you scrape it down add the egg yolks and then I'm gonna reserve the egg whites for the meringue later that's on low speed and I'm going to add four whole eggs just get that in until it's incorporated get 3/4 of a cup of fresh lemon juice accord of a cup of the lemon zest that i zested before and that's gonna make it taste so good and a teaspoon of salt just a pinch it's gonna it's gonna look curdled don't get nervous it's the way it's supposed to look okay the lemon zest is what's gonna give it so much flavor [Music] okay I'm just gonna cook it for about eight to ten

any minute to help me with a lemon meringue tart I'm gonna get the meringue ready for room temperature egg whites you don't get the same volume with cold egg whites those are the egg whites that are from the separated eggs quarter of a teaspoon of cream of tartar which is like a vinegar that helps stabilize the meringue and a quarter teaspoon of salt and I'm gonna whisk this on high speed until it gets light and fluffy and then add sugar have a cup of sugar and just add it really slowly [Music] this is gonna get really thick and shiny it's gonna be great on the lemon meringue tart and then
