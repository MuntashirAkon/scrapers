[Music] so so herself I love making you I know they're really fresh Jeffrey and I just got them it's about a pound of scallops and the first thing I do is just salt and pepper them sometimes people salt and pepper the flour but I think it never really gets into the scallop so I'm going to salt and pepper them first and then flour them so three quarters of teaspoon of salt lots of pepper little flour and what the flour is going to do is going to sear the scallops really nicely but it's also going to get into the sauce so it's going to thicken the butter and lemon sauce okay two tablespoons of butter so for the scallops in in one layer I'm going to put them on medium heat for about two minutes and then I'll turn them and add lots of flavor can you tell the chop up some gel so two big shallots [Music] sometimes when I'm making this for dinner party I get all the ingredients all prepped in advance and the whole thing just takes five minutes in the pan so turn the scallops perfect they're nice and brown and see the browning sort of fearsome and lots of flavor [Music] okay that's not for another two minutes understand chop up some garlic so I'm going to chop up these ingredients and then just add them to the pan and make a sauce with butter and white wine could be just delicious and in order for it to be really Provencal parsley so I need about a quarter of a cup of chopped parsley I beg can that be okay just a rough chop okay now for the sauce I've got all my ingredients ready so put two tablespoons of butter in so I'm going to put in a shallot garlic and parsley quarter cup of parsley and just caught a this all together you can smell this the garlic and the shallots and parsley together about two minutes on this saute pan and then it's sort of a cup of white wine and that's going to get all the brown bits in the bottom of pan into the sauce just do the nice dry white wine but something you'd want to drink with a meal and then serve it with a dinner okay that's really it it's just perfect okay it's going to leave that for a minute like it's Merv's with the rice and dinner's ready time to serve everything up [Music]
