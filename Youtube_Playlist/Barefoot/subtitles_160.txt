[Music] who doesn't love fish and chips I do not the saga can you find in most restaurants what really delicious crisp on the outside tender on the inside since my friend TR has a new Shack it's a fishing shack I thought it'd be very appropriate to make fish and chips form so I'm just going to make the batter and then I'm going to cook the fish there so the first thing I need to tap a cup of flour plus one tablespoon at the tablespoon of baking powder half a teaspoon of lemon zest grated a little pinch of cayenne to give it some heat teaspoon of salt 1/2 teaspoon of pepper put a whisk in half a cup of water [Music] sometimes that or sounds like it's really complicated but it's not it's just like making pancakes on Sunday morning to make it ahead and just let it sit in the fridge and add one egg just whisk it in and that's it I'm going to TRS out someone's gets a fish in it and fry it up and then make a baked chips delicious here's doing a fabulous job cutting the fish into one and a half by three inch chunks and I'm going to make a chip which instead of being fried chips are big chips they marinated in an oil with rosemary and garlic the moment keeps him and then roast them at 400 degrees for 30 to 35 minutes until they're nice and brown on one side and I'm going to turn them over and brown them on the other and they can be really crisp on the outside and so I fried them okay I'll do the salt you do the pepper that's perfect so this is only going to take about five minutes to cook on detainers anything about 35 minutes so you want to show me the dot core okay so I've got a half an inch of oil on the pan to fry the fish and it needs to get up to 360 degrees and that way the fish will be really crisp on the outside and tender inside it's going to check it with candy thermometer so let's see if the oils 360 degrees perfect okay now take the fish fillets put them in the batter into this like a pancake batter and then the fish goes right in I'm just going to put enough in so it doesn't get crowded it cook pretty quickly about five minutes total so when it's brown on one side just give it a nice turn it look great so nice and brown that is best fabulous know what you just fixed up there's a crate the big chips of rosemary and garlic and the fish wrap it up and suppose it's a newspaper so the parts in a black paper in the phone and then I'm going to fill it with fish and chips [Music] this looks so great and I'm off to see our with fish and chips tartar sauce and dill pickle
