[Music] somebody really important is coming for dinner and just let me think I'm going to make a fancy meal I'm going to do exactly the opposite turkey meatloaf and mashed potatoes mmm who wouldn't love that so you know that time when somebody really important is coming to dinner maybe it's your boss or Julia Child that would be scary to me and you want to make something really special that's just the time that I make something that's really good comfort food and I serve it in the kitchen and it's relaxed and everybody has a good time so tonight my book editor is coming of course it has to be wonderful so I'm going to make turkey meatloaf parmesan some mashed potatoes and roasted Brussels sprouts and we're gonna have a great time at the kitchen table so for the turkey meatloaf I've already sauteed 2 large onions and some olive oil salt and pepper and some fresh thyme then I got out of my garden I love the smell of fresh thyme I love it in the turkey meatloaf just take it off the stem like that so I cooked it all together for about 10 minutes until the onions are translucent and they're just cooked through but not browned and then I'm going to add some other ingredients to make it a variable I'm actually you can do this off the heat what's your shoe sauce chicken stock and some tomato paste so about 1/3 of a cup of Worcestershire sauce 3/4 of a cup of chicken stock I've homemade chicken stock but you can use a good can chicken stock and these good tomato paste really thick it'll add a lot of flavor that wanted to have two spoons I'm just going to mix that all together this is the kind of meatloaf even your husband won't believe it's not beef it's delicious so this is ground turkey it's actually better for you than ground beef and it's not you can get get it at the butcher he's going to say to you you want white 5 pounds of ground turkey it's a lot you can always cut the recipe in half but I think why not make a large quantity and you can always have it for sandwiches so I want to take all this wonderful flavoring dump it into the turkey meatloaf put in one and a half cups of plain breadcrumbs I just use package breadcrumbs they taste just as good in this recipe as homemade ones and there's so much easier and then 3 eggs and that's going to hold the mixture together this is great in the winter serve top it's also wonderful in the summer serve cold with a green salad and of course when there's lots of turkey meat love my husband's very happy because I make a meatloaf sandwiches for lunch I'm just going to pour this on top and that comes a really squishy part clean hands I'm going to just mix all this together I want to do a really lightly I don't want to pack it down so I'm going to do a really fingertip II just mix it together it Whitely until all the onions and the Worcestershire sauce and the breadcrumbs are mixed in with the turkey okay that's it nicely mixed and now all I'm going to do with really messy hands is dump it out on this pan and shape it into the meatloaf this is a really freeform meatloaf shape so I'm going to make it into a neat loaf so that's it later I'm going to pour ketchup on the top which is going to give it lots of flavor I'm going to put it in the fridge and right now I'm going shopping [Music] [Music] [Music] hi Sandy oh yeah so I think I need six browning need let's see three with nuts and free without that okay how's that yeah great I can make these myself but my friends aren't going to have more fun if I spend the day making outrageous brownie so I'm going to buy them here thanks so much handle whoop we're done so all I have to do is finish the turkey meatloaf I've got everything together here the ground turkey with onions and Worcestershire sauce and just wonderful flavorings and I'm going to put ketchup over the top of it to keep it really moist and delicious how homey is that great okay so this goes in the oven 325 for about an hour and a half and I'll show you a trick to keeping it from cracking I hate when turkey meatloaf cracks on the top and the trick is take a pan of hot water and put it underneath the turkey meatloaf and it'll keep steam in the oven and keep the meat from cracking so some hot water from the tap is perfect and that's going to be delicious if you're like me and you hate those mushy things from Thanksgiving boiled Brussels sprouts you'll love this recipe I cook the Brussels sprouts at a really high temperature 400 degrees with lots of salt and they're crisp on the outside and really tender on the inside and there's sort of more like french fries and they are like Brussels sprouts so I'm just taking off the ends of these Brussels sprouts just a little bit so it's not brown and any outside leaves that aren't gorgeous great so all I'm going to do is drizzle it with olive oil toss it with salt and pepper and into the oven it goes let's people do this in a bowl I just do it right on the baking sheet 400 degree oven for about 40 minutes and these are going to be crisp on the outside and tender on the inside that's one creaky oven when people come to my house I set up the drinks on a bar in the living room and then everybody can help themselves I hate when people are arriving I feel like race to the door race back to the drinks and this way everybody sort of connects while they're making themselves a drink just really what entertaining is about and then I'll have little things for people to eat to pistachio instead of spending the entire day making things are absolutely fine logo I just have a little nibble for people it's totally delicious and some gorgeous potato chips then I've got all the drinks set up just something simple like scotch and Soda everybody can help themselves and one last little detail which I love is when I set up the candles I get clothed whole clothes that are really spicy and wonderful and I step in and the bottom and then when you light the candle you can smell that wonderful Clovis is like having apple pies baking and later I'm going to make house of houses and now I'm going to make Provencal tomato what I'm going to do here is mix herbs breadcrumbs that I'm going to stuff these tomatoes with and then bake them with a little bit of gray air and I'm so good just put them in the food processor and I'll make fresh breadcrumbs fresh breadcrumbs are lighter and when I flavor them it's important to make them yourself as opposed to the dry breadcrumbs it opens into the turkey meatloaf put them in here this is where the Provencal part comes in so I'm going to chop up all these gorgeous herbs and add them to the breadcrumbs before I put them in the tomatoes so I need scallions and I use the white and the green part I think I like the color and the flavor of those okay so two scallions all chopped up right in some fresh basil leaves just chop them up lots of fresh basil how is your monster pesto a little fresh basil and then some parsley just cut it right off the stem that's a great thing to put together you always have some white bread and whatever herbs you have in the fridge okay parsley and fresh thyme and then the last thing is garlic and claw maybe to close the garlic should do it [Applause] this said big one so we're just going to use one clove of garlic okay so that's the breadcrumbs salt and pepper and I'm just going to toss this with my hands look how beautiful it is that's the breadcrumb part now we'll get the tomatoes ready so these are tomatoes I love to buy them on the vine I chose committees that are a little bit smaller not those big ones that you get in the middle of this summer and the one thing that's great about this recipe is it's really good with winter Tomatoes because by the time you roast them they taste delicious just going to take a little bit out of the core and then cut the entire tomato and a half I'm going to take all these seeds and pick the seeds out of the tomato because those are the crevices that I'm going to fill with a breadcrumb mixture let's sprinkle with a little salt and pepper and I want to fill it with those wonderful breadcrumbs take each tomato and just fill the crevices with these wonderful breadcrumbs with garlic and basil thyme parsley that's it look great and the last guy just enough just a little left these are going to bake for about 15 minutes at 400 degrees and then I'm going to sprinkle Gruyere cheese and let it melt for a minute over the top and now I'm going to make parmesan smashed potatoes so my book editor is coming for dinner and it's got to be good so instead of making something fancy I'm making something very earthy turkey meatloaf and to go with it my Provencal Tomatoes I just have to finish them so I've got these wonderful tomato halves that have been filled with breadcrumbs and herbs all those Provencal sort of spices garlic and basil parsley thyme and now what I'm going to do is just put a little bit of gray our cheese right on the top put them back in the oven for a minute I'm going to be even better it's going to grate it so I can put it on top where is like a Swiss cheese but I just think it has a little more flavor so you drizzle it with a little bit of olive oil just so it has great flavor it just puts in grier right on the top and it just goes back into the 400 degree oven for about 60 seconds so Parmesan smashed potatoes you won't believe how good these are I start with cooked new red potatoes so there are two secrets to why these are so good one is that I make it with the new potatoes with the skins on so you don't have to peel them and the second one is that it goes into the mixer instead of all of that potato ricing thing just put it into the mixer with a V Terron and just turned it on and they jump out of the mixer yes it get back in there so much easier and so much messier just mash them up just like that and then I'm going to put butter and cream in first I'm going to check the tomato [Music] no they're just great the cheese is melted and they look just delicious I'm leave them back here for later wonderful so I have here one and a half cups of half-and-half and a quarter of a pound of butter and I'm just going to pour enough in so that they get really creamy [Applause] and then we add half a cup of sour cream I know this is really wicked but it's really good and half a cup of Parmesan cheese oh it's great salt and pepper lots of salt salt pepper and we're looking for us for them to be creamy but sort of chunky I don't like them to be too smooth oh this looks wonderful very hot rather than keeping the potatoes warm in the oven I keep them warm over a double boiler and I find it doesn't dry up as much big bowl and just pour the potatoes in and they'll just stay hot and creamy for about a half an hour just like that and it's really easy and it's really good and the last thing I'm going to do is check my turkey meatloaf oh it looks like it's perfectly cooked it's not fabulous think there's enough and the Brussels sprouts they look great they're all crisp on the outside and I think I'm just going to leave them to warm in the oven with the oven turned off people sometimes don't remember what I make for dinner but they always remember dessert so I'm going to make something really special for my friends I'm going to do if everybody's going to have a brownie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and I'm going to make chocolate sauce for the top how fabulous is that mmm some of these brands have nuts and some don't for those that like it and they'll make the chocolate sauce this is really easy it's twelve ounces of chocolate chips semi-sweet chocolate chips over a double boiler 3/4 of a cup of heavy cream wandering over simmering water so it doesn't get too hot and the last thing is really important I'm going to put about a teaspoon of instant espresso into the chocolate sauce and it's a huge difference in the way it tastes so I'm just going to let this sit over simmering water until it's just milk and then it can just rest there until we're ready to have dessert so my book editors coming for dinner and instead of making something really fancy I'm making something really earthy turkey meatloaf and mashed potatoes I want it to be really fun and to make it even more fun we're going to have cotton poems this is a very Sex in the City drink so the recipe is 1 cup of vodka I'm going to put this beaker and then we'll shake them with ice [Music] good or ready right and half a cup of triple sec or Cointreau whichever you have half cup of cranberry juice how hard is this absolutely that color great and the last ingredient is fresh lime juice 1/4 of a cup of fresh lime juice love the color wonderful but ice in the shaker and then pour the cosmopolitan and shake and then pouring and then drinking do not look great that just looks like a party this one's mine oh we're going to have a good time and since the two girls are teenagers I have special cocktails for them maraschino cherry ginger ale it's going to look like a Manhattan and a little maraschino cherry juice but not look great and you stopping for coming all this way I've cocktail for everyone great son for Stevie and for Maya [Laughter] I said cheers everybody welcome thanks oh my god dinner's ready out of the oven smells good and Parmesan smashed potato maybe for the skins on oh good I am NOT yeah it was really chunky you know what my mother used to make me though it was so dry when I got married at home and ina said she was going to make meatloaf I very politely said I really rather have something else that she couldn't understand it then I realized it was a whole other way to make it so now I'm addicted therefore you're in big trouble of your mother ever use that story and Provencal tomatoes with basil and garlic and all kinds of protists all spices whatever baths or repetition get a bad rap brussel sprouts for jam with meatloaf Akash and jam thank you
