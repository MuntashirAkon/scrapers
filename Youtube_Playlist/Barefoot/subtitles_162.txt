[Music] I live in East Hampton New York and my husband Jeffrey works in Connecticut so every Friday night he has to drive home and I love to have a roast chicken and a tiramisu waiting for him when he gets home the house smells like growth's chicken and hey who wouldn't want to come home to that tara misu incentive 90s wood pasta pesto west of the 80 it was done done and over done and we all stopped making it and in fact it's one of those really delicious and easy things to make someone make it today for my husband Jeffrey so I need six egg yolks if you want to really be squishy and messy about this it's the best way to separate eggs it's just do it in your hand and the whites fall right through your fingers and the yolk goes right into the bowl and it's gone I'm going to add a quarter of a cup of sugar and now I'm going to whisk these for about five minutes until they're really light and you'll see they change completely so while that's going I'm going to put the other ingredients together the first one is I need really good rum dark rum is so wonderful because it's got really great depth of flavor is it not that so I need a quarter of a cup of dark rum and a quarter of a cup of espresso and then the less ingredient I need is mascarpone I'll show you what it is this is a really lovely ingredient it's really Italian cream cheese it's very thick at the triple creme and it's so Restless in the dessert position well the eggs look done so I'll show you this is just the way they want to look it's light and when you hold it up it falls back on itself in a ribbon so now a medium speed I'm just going to add the combination of the espresso and the rung so I can smell the Roman espresso what it hits the egg that's wonderful I'm just going to add the mascarpone I would put it at 16 ounces of mascarpone it's either one large or two small containers so that's the cream mixture and now we're going to go to assembling it this is the secret to making really good cheer masu they're called Sol you already and you get them in the Italian specialty store or possibly even in the grocery store they're ladyfingers but unlike American ladyfingers they're really crisp they're graham they're wrong and what I'm going to do is dip them in a mixture of rum and coffee and then pour the cream over you Steve fantastic the key to the ladyfingers is if you dip them for too long they get very soggy if you dip them for too little time they're going to not absorb enough flavor so we'll just do it like this exactly that amount of time and then put it right into the dish and then the next one on one side on the other side and then lift it out so I'm going to have roast chicken for dinner which is really simple with all the vegetables all in one pan it's a one dish dinner and then I'm going to have the tiramisu as dessert so I've made two things and have the most elegant dinner and now I'm going to take this incredible delicious cream this is the mascarpone and eggs and rum and espresso and pour half of it right over the top of this like that and then we're going to do another layer of espresso rum soaked ladyfingers the good news about this is it's not rocket science all I'm doing basically is assembling this and I didn't have to cook a thing there's no standing the Govan going is it done is it not done and the last layer of cream just smooth it over the top and then just before I serve it I'm going to put shaved chocolate and sometimes a little bit of powdered sugar on the top so it goes in the fridge and it'll sit for about an hour or two but the good news is to consider for two days and you'll see it'll really set up it will be delicious [Music] 31 great saga videos don't bother them just they're also happy only thing you're going to notice triggers the trick thank you mister roast chicken I can do this in my sleep so I want to just check the chicken for any leftover pinfeathers and I'm going to Pat it dry on the outside and I do that so that when brush it with butter and salt and pepper it will stick to it all the giblets have been taken out and safe for another time so I'm just going to stand it up like this and just salt and pepper the inside chicken can sometimes be a little bland and so as much as I can do to give it lots of flavor I'm going to do so salt and pepper inside and then I'll show you my secret and all you need to do is just take this whole lemon cut it in quarters and just stuff it in the middle I'm going to take this entire head of garlic cut it right in half so you can see all that little clove when it's inside the chicken it's going to be just like the hint of garlic and it gets into the juices in the vegetables in the pan it's so delicious and then I some fresh thyme and just stuff it right inside this great chicken now all I have to do is brush of butter on the top salt and pepper and it's ready to go you want to melt the butter but not let it burn but it's actually better for this in olive oil the butter has some milk solids in it that burn a little bit so it makes the chicken nice and brown okay that's good so I'm going to brush the entire outside of this chicken gorgeous little chicken and then season it with salt and pepper I know it seems like a lot of salt but it's really important for the chicken have lots of flavor and that will do it and pepper okay this is gorgeous now the next thing I want to do is trust it which is sort of to tie it up so that it cooks evenly some point of trust saying is if it's little legs are out like this the legs can very easily get burnt the meat can get overcooked so what I want to do is pull it into its body so it cooks really well I'll just all I have to do is tie the legs together and we'll do that you'll see they're all these very complicated ways to trust a chicken but this is a bit as easy as a guess so once you take a length of kitchen twine and just tie these little legs together and I leave long in so it's easy to take the twine off nobody want to eat wine for dinner so just like that and then it's little wings just go under here just tuck them under the whole bird doesn't have to be wrapped in twine I've seen some birds that look like they're in bondage those chickens just the best kind of comfort food and the good news it can be a really simple meal or can be a really elegant one okay that's ready to go and I'm going to make some vegetables all right chicken is ready I love when there are vegetables in the bottom of the chicken and they just soak up all this delicious chicken juices so when I put carrots fennel and onions in the pan when I'm choosing carrots my experience is the top carrots and one of the green tops on them really have more flavor so I was trying to find them when I can so I'm just going to cut these in big chunks like that doesn't really matter how big the chunks are but I don't want them too small because as they cook they sort of shrink a little bit so just make sure they're big chunky because these are cooking for a while it really doesn't matter how how you cut them up you don't want them hugely different but though I'll cook about the same time so you'd be really rough about them I think it gives it a good country look and this is channel I love fennel and I'm going to take all the tops off fennel has this when it's raw not that crazy that it rather it has a very anise kind of flavor it's very sharp but when it's cooked it gets sweet and succulent and delicious so we're going to set this little guy up like this through the middle and sometimes I like to take the core out and then I'm just going to do it big long chunks like that so all these vegetables are going to be seasoned lightly chemically underneath the chicken and I'm going to put onions in later and it'll be just perfect I'm going to skip the bowl the vegetables right in here i season them right in can I just on the roasting pan that's just big enough to hold the chicken and the vegetables loosely but not huge roasting pan so the next thing is a drizzle of olive oil doesn't have to be exact just so that they get a little brown when the ground little salt little pepper I love the way this looks - salt fresh and I'm going to just toss it with olive oil my hands and next is the onions so onions I like to use a some Spanish onions they're much bigger and I figure about one Spanish onions every two regular onions so much as you feel that way there are all kinds of theories about how to stop crying when you peeling onions I haven't found a good one yet just do them quickly I've even tried ski goggles nothing really works let's toss them all together I actually have some time that I picked a few days ago when it's dried it's so much easier to get the leaves off the stems just like that sprinkle it over the top actually you can even just put the whole stem in and then take the stem out afterwards and now I'm going to take my chicken so all the juices from the chicken are going to get into the vegetables and we'll all cook together until be so delicious so into the oven 425 degrees for about an hour and a half of course I could buy herbs at the market but I think it's such a delicious pleasure to come out to the garden and pick fresh parsley when I need it not only don't I have to buy it but I get to go outside in the middle of cooking I come out barefoot in the grass and the Sun and I get to see all my flowers and parsley totally underappreciated and it's got great flavor just good I've lost Josh because I love to use chives and this is my second crop of basil for the summer I've already picked everything and they test don't clear the freezer whose love basil [Music] actually grows several different kinds of time they have little blue flowers in the spring and I just love the way the flowers look but also some of the variety stay green all winter so I can use it all winter and they all have different little lavender flowers so if I have a variety of them also gonna have lavender flowers on them it's all wonderful these are these these potatoes in the world I think I've made more garlic roasted potatoes and every other vegetable combined I start with red potatoes you can really use any kind of thin-skinned potato maybe about 2 pounds if they're big potatoes I'll cut them in quarters if they're small potatoes I'll cut them in half and you can just forget what your mother used to tell you about parboiling and peeling potatoes these work really well it's so much easier ok a little olive oil just drizzle it on coarse salt use kosher salt but you can use sea salt or any kind of stuff that have around lots of fresh pepper give it a little spice jab the secrets of my potatoes really good garlic I was trying to find garlic that's very firm like this doesn't have a big sprout on it you don't want to plant in your potatoes you want a really good garlic and years ago I was I was actually cooking with a very good friend of mine he's a wonderful cook and and I was peeling garlic of the way you would peel an onion and she said no no no what you want to do is hit it with your knife so I just like wound up and said oh no no no she goes you put your knife on the garlic and you go like that and look we have just perfect so I'm going to peel 6 cloves of garlic there's a lot of garlic in this meal but when you cook garlic for a long time it becomes really sweet so it's not going to be too garlicky meal and anyway both of you are eating it anyway I'll have to do is get the garlic in with potatoes into the oven tiramisu Jeffrey's gonna think I've worked all day and it's been really easy ok my chickens in the oven Scholz potatoes are almost ready to go chairman Susan their fridge it's great it's going to mince up the garlic doesn't have to be perfect now the easiest way I find a chopped garlic is to lead the tip of the blade on the board and run that's nice back and forth really let the blade do the work okay lots of garlic smells so good you use my hands I'll mix up the olive oil salt I've already put on at the pepper I'll check into the oven 400 degrees 30 minutes and if you only have one oven just doesn't both in the same temperature doesn't matter once potatoes crisp on the outside and really juicy inside and that worse chickens not so good looks perfectly done it's been in for about an hour and a half and lots of ways to tell the chicken is done and all those delicious juices coming out into the vegetables so the first test just can take this little string off so nobody ends up eating it first technical to shake hands with its leg if it wobbles like that it's perfect the second one is to cut between the leg and the thigh and just make sure the juices are running clear and if they are it's definitely done and so I'm just going to cover it with aluminum foil it's really important when you're roasting meats chicken beef anything to let it rest for about 20 minutes after she's out of the oven just going to keep it covered so it stays nice and warm and all the juices run back into the meat and it makes it so delicious and then I think I'll put those vegetables back in the air gonna let them caramelize a little bit while the chicken wrap [Music] so this looks fabulous all those gooey layers of mascarpone and ROM and espresso and cookies all soaking up the flavor tiramisu is traditionally finished with chocolate and I've got a big block of chocolate this is a bittersweet chocolate but you can really use anything you have in your pantry and I'm going to shave it with a vegetable peeler and what I'm going to do is just heat it up a little bit with my hand and then I'll get longer curls from shaving it this long curls just very relaxed and just sprinkle them on top they look fabulous and they've got two spresso rum and chocolate and the final thing if you have a little confectioners sugar around I like to put a little bit of confectioner sugar around the top I think it just gives it that perfect little finish strainer and just on the side back in the fridge and desserts all ready [Music] we've been resting for that 20 minutes perfect time to carve it so the trick to carving a chicken and I'm going to pull the leg off birth time that easiest so I usually take the legs off first but on my platter and depending on how big the legs of our I'll just carve them a little bit but not too much that's it served and then the wing comes off it's just so juicy inside it's just wonderful a friend of mine said the Chile a child how's that for a teacher showed her how to do this and it's really brilliant I've done it ever since take the entire breasts off in one piece and then slice it directly across like so every serving has a little bit of skin and a little bit of meat and it's frankly I think so much easier whole thing goes on the point when you cook a chicken at high temperature the skin is one of the best parts because it's nice and crisp and now the vegetables going to keep this for later for chicken stock I'm just going to mix it all together all those juices just over and all these carrots and fennel and onions and fresh thyme so I'm going to put it right on the platter with the chicken you can take the stems oh just smell so gorgeous I'm going to take all the juices of the vegetables and the chicken on the bottom and just run them all over the chicken really use everything in that pan just them it's maybe a little sprinkling of good kosher salt over the top who wouldn't want to be home for this do [Music] so leave the garlic roasted potatoes to make our seriously garlic throw crisp on the outside delicious inside it's like a tired kitchen hydrating a little bit good right would you move to my dream is what you've been dreaming up all the way home I loved one and be fabulous and it's sprinkling of parsley on the top how much a week oh it was it was for a celebration that's a better grieving life so I've been cooking away all day and how there is one I need a glass of wine will you feel like your invitation well I'd like to put them over have you never will be and excited some two movies wow that looks wonderful you know usually I put the potatoes into the chicken I don't know but I treat you with that I love those potatoes smells wonderful much fungus smell run up to a window it yeah we have to feel lucky that's just a feel of us to go isn't it is specifc was actually in Pacific ROM and espresso also pony wanted everybody nyla you know obviously breaking the law [Music] everyone has their obsession summer minutes got me and any chicken carcasses [Music]
