[Music] I have some very dear friends coming I'm going to make my favorite roast turkey dinner oh that's a big turkey I don't understand why our mothers used to get up at 5 o'clock in the morning to roast a turkey I can't figure it out I think they have this thing about bacteria a 12 pound turkey should roast in about two and a half hours and it will be moist and delicious that's a beautiful bird so first I'm going to do is take out the giblets like the neck and the hmm cold it's wet and I'm going to save it for stock later and it looks beautiful and then I'm going to Pat it dry I have my friend Barbara's family coming for dinner it's gonna be really fun and she's a new grandson Timothy who's just incredible he's I think he's about six months old so adorable so in my growth Turkey spinach bread tan which is really good and smashley potatoes and for dessert and make my favorite class on bread pudding it's going to be a really good meal so I'm going to put some salt in the middle and some freshly ground pepper make sure it's really well seasoned we're not going to do stuffing you know it's enough of the stuffing I'm going to put all kinds of things in the cavity that are going to give it lots of flavor so I'm going to stuff it with onion forget peeling it forget just chop the whole thing up and just put it right into the inside of the turkey great and then maybe big sprigs of thyme and then we're going to have lemon whose big chunks of lemon in just like that it's going to be so delicious and then maybe the last thing is a big chunk of garlic put a big chunk of it right in the middle of the turkey and then the last thing is I'm going to take these little wings and tuck them under just so they're not flapping around in the pan and that they they burn before the turkeys finish cooking you're basically just doing that because it turkey it doesn't mind so I've got about four tablespoons of butter i melted in here just brush it nicely on the outside of the bird okay good and then salt and pepper remember it's a big bird so salt it really well and some pepper in the pan so by two and a half hours of 350 degrees and we're gonna have a fabulous turkey with spinach gratin and smashed sweet potato the best thing about making things in advance or a party is it allows me plenty of time to relax member Hayes they hate spinach when you're a kid the spinach grant is so delicious that even the children will leave it not that a little bit so we've got the butter melted and about four cups of onions or do this for about 10-15 minutes over medium flame until the onions are really cooked but they're not browned so let that go for a little while and it's ready so this is the secret of this dish frozen spinach is just as good as fresh so much easier so I've got five packages of frozen spinach which is about three pounds just squeeze all the water out of this just really squeeze it so you've got all the liquid out and then put it in a bowl that's done onions are just cooking they're not browning which is to try I'm just off in a quarter of a cup of flour and then she really only just have to cook for about a minute until the flour is cooked in with that sort of raw flour taste added that 1/4 of a teaspoon of nutmeg nutmeg sort of a classic thing with spinach and I think it's got great flavor so now I need a cup of heavy cream and two cups of milk and you know you really can make this with all milk but it's a special occasion someone make it with scream so that's probably going to take about five minutes for to heat up enough so it starts to thicken so it's not really thick it's not gluey it's just thickened great so the next thing is problems on cheese this is a chunk of Reggiano parmesan and it's really the best it's aged so it has great flavor but you can get grana you can get any kind of even Argentinian parmesan it's pretty good if you have a food processor it's a really easy way to do this but you can always do it with a box grater presto grated Parmesan so now I'm going to add half a cup of grated Parmesan it's the quarter cup measure SOPA to it tablespoon of kosher salt and a teaspoon of freshly ground black pepper and the last ingredient is spinach so I'm just going to break up this spinach and put it in and take it off the flame just mix the spinach in which I see how this all comes together much Paul this thin is just and absorb all that wonderful sauce and that's where I take the water out because at this point it would be like soup if you didn't okay into my pan I'm not going to cook this yet because it only takes 20 minutes to cook so I'll just set it aside until I'm ready to put it in the oven why do people only sweet potatoes at Thanksgiving I can't figure it out I think they're delicious so I've roasted these at 375 for about an hour and they're really done when they're nice and squishy and drizzle it with a little butter and salt and pepper they're wonderful but today I'm going to make smashed sweet potatoes because it's a special day these are cooled a little bit so I can handle them and I'm just going to take a spoon and scoop out the wonderful sweet potato flesh I'm going to have my friend Barbara's family who two gorgeous daughters and her new grandson some really fun and one more half and we're there okay now for all the flavorings that's a good part so the first thing is I need 1/2 a cup of orange juice and 1/2 a cup of heavy cream no wonder it tastes good right I'm just going to put in 2 tablespoons of butter teaspoon of nutmeg 1/2 a teaspoon of cinnamon and the last thing is a quarter cup of brown sugar this is one of those recipes that just put some sweet potatoes in a mixer and I started adding things until I like to attest of life so you can turn the mixer on and miss the big homies gorgeous ingredients actually I'm a friend she doesn't recipe like this made bourbon how bad could that be New Orleans el-masri potatoes so what that sector of this to be really course but not not pureed I think baby food I like what it has some texture to it it just takes a minute in the mixer to do that looks so good mmm really brings out the sweet that it the sweetness and the sweet potatoes all the brown sugar and the orange you can taste all with it what's just wonderful nutmeg and cinnamon would be great with the dinner and this too it's a great dish for holiday entertaining or for any kind of entertaining for that matter you can make it in advance keep in the refrigerator I'm not going to cook it now I'm going to set it aside and I'll heat it up with a spinach Gretchen for about half an hour 375 [Music] [Music] so for my turkey dinner I think instead of doing flowers for the table I'm gonna do something more interesting which is all kinds of fresh fruit dried apricots and dried mango things can be really gorgeous [Music] [Music] hey gravy well it's not that I hate gravy I just hate that you make at the minute before you sit down you know here you are the turkeys hot your friends are hungry and I'm usually dressed in my party clothes and then I have to start making gravy I don't think so so I decided to find an easier way to do it the first thing I'm doing is sauteing about a cup and a half of onions in some butter and I like to saute them so they're really nice and translucent and maybe just a little bit brown the butter can brown a little bit it will make a dark gravy and this is my secret I saved the drippings from the last time I made turkey and I'll use that for making gravy this time this is old liked or just delicious steps in the gravy there's a little fat on the top so I'm just going to pour it out and just use the drippings at the bottom and I have here about two cups of chicken stock homemade chicken stock is great if you can't just use a really good can stock and I'm going to pour all of these drippings into that to really enrich it and give it lots of flavor now I need a little flour add a quarter cup of flour goes in with the cooked onions and butter and this is what's going to thicken the gravy okay cook that for about a minute and then I'm going to pour in this hot stock thicken up beautifully this is the way to prevent having 1'p gravy which is everybody's nemesis so that teaspoon of salt I like to use kosher salt and 1/2 teaspoon of pepper when I did will try a quarter and see how it is just taste it as you go along very individual too and next is my secret ingredient I'm yack well cognac is really very good brandy from the cognac region so you can use any kind of brandy or con yet that you have around the house I love the smell of that connect when it hits the hot gravy it's fabulous some leftover white wants a little splash of white wine in that should be good and then the last thing is a little bit of heavy cream you can do this or not but I just think it enriches it enough so it really gives it special okay and then the good part I get to taste it's just gorgeous got all that coming a canned wine and the turkey juice and it just gonna be perfect so now I've got the roast turkey spinach Gretchen smashed sweet potatoes and the last thing I want to make is costs on bread pudding can't wait for dinner I want to ask my friends what their favorite dessert is they always say quad salt bread pudding so that's what we're going to make for dinner tonight and what's amazing is it's so easy so the first thing I to do is make the custard a three whole eggs and five egg yolks and I'm going to add in five cups of half-and-half I know I know it's a lot of half-and-half but I wouldn't recommend you eat this every day it's a special occasion whisk that in and then I need a cup and a half of sugar and 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of vanilla the good news is you're not gonna believe how easy this is to make list on all of you really like a bread pudding except to Ike's turns turn up the volume and made it with cloths off so that's it for the custard so I'm going to get my dish ready I'm going to cut these costs on these are a little stale that came out of the freezer they were leftover you can use fresh cloth on but it's really better interesting would use stale ones because they're drier and they absorb that custard better I actually decided to try it with cross them because I thought their serve lighter and airier than bread and I thought it'd be really nice to see how it works I have about six cross on here but you can really use as many quests ons will fit in the pan you want two layers of cross on this has about a cup of raisins in it and I put the raisins actually between the layers of cross off because if they end up on top shell burn when I de then I'm going to put the second layer on you need to do with a brown side up or the brown side down but just do it consistently so it's the same all right now I put all this fabulous custard on pour over the whole thing now comes the fun part you have to just get the quest felt absorb all that custard by holding it down for a minute you can see the bubbles coming up so just it's absorbing all that gorgeous custard so let that soak for a minute while I get the water bath ready so sometimes a good idea when you're making custard to put it in water bath it actually keeps the temperature down a lot of people say you have to boil the water I just use really hot tap water easier the better I'm going to cover the pan not just the dish but the whole pan with foil put it into a 350 degree oven for about 45 minutes and by then the custards going to start to set and then I'll take the foil off bake it for another 45 minutes and you'll see it's going to get really puffed and brown gorgeous you go carefully because you don't want water and cut you know you don't have to spend a fortune on table decoration you'd be surprised what you can find in the woods attended here love crabapples and now and we look at myself ready for the party expensive table winter when the flowers are expensive sometimes I like to go to the grocery store and get all kinds of decorations for the table I love winter colors purples and reds and oranges and twigs from my garden get some sort of a wintry feeling cornucopia delicious little treats like fresh fit and crystallized ginger dried applica and dried papayas and then everybody's got a little treat at the end of the meal for dessert so the quest on bread puddings been baking for about 45 minutes and 350 and now I'm going to take off the foil I'm going to bake another 45 minutes until it gets puffed and nicely browned will be delicious it was a turkey smells so good oh love not with gorgeous so I'm just going to wrap it up with aluminum foil really makes a difference if you let it rest for about 20 minutes which is perfect because that will give me enough time thinking it's the rest of the vegetables just what the juices get into the meat and the whole thing will taste fabulous my sweet potatoes and the spinach grits am just going to do a topping on the spinach grunta as though it needs extra flavor I'm going to put extra flavor on it so remember the spinach Gretchen has spinach and onions and I'm going to put about half a cup of grated Parmesan well maybe about a quarter of a cup should do it and I'm just going to do a little bit of grated Gruyere on top okay the two of these are gonna go into the oven we've got 375 for about 20 minutes and then they'll be good and hot for dinner [Music] get the question for it putting out of the oven so Gord I don't rest on top of the stone and now to carve the turkey i carve a turkey the same way I carve a chicken I'll show you what I do wanna take a length off relax perfectly cooked cause the dark needle of this okay cause it darkly first on the side okay then I'm going to carve this turkey breath because it would take a full breath off actually once you just what I do with a chicken so perfect should slice it how much easier do this one that works when the slices are so incredibly famous they'd fall apart just like that okay maybe a second pair here that's done so good finished sweet potatoes [Music] that was really fun as far abroad how do I pass the sweet potatoes nervous like I creamed spinach come on you emigrate a little bit right here in the grandeur [Music] good up to five o'clock this morning absolutely my mother to get up assignments with the turkey in the oven I don't understand it yes for dessert quest on bread pudding everybody's favorite assessment very large portion [Laughter] [Music] holiday we don't need like this there play dish [Music]
