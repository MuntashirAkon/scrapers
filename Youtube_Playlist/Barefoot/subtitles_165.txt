[Music] for 20 years I ran a specialty food store so I know how hard the retail business is doriel Turk one's a wonderful store in East Hampton called Calypso and she's asked me to cater a party to thank her employees the owner Cristian is French so I thought wouldn't it be fun to do a very French dinner for them to start I'm making a Provencal vegetable soup that's packed with flavor and topped with a spoonful of garlic tomato and basil piece du which is like a French version of pesto and for the main course spectacular seafood platter piled high with succulent cooked lobsters giant shrimp blue claw crabs fresh clams and raw oysters dessert coconut Medlin's shell shaped pancakes filled with sweet coconut and served with coffee Dorie is sending a table smack in the middle of the store and if I don't start making the soup they'll never have dinner promise all soup au pistou is one of my favorite soups a really hearty vegetable soup I'm gonna make it today as the first course before dinner but it's also great just as a lunch in front of the fireplace on a cold winter day so I'm gonna start with onions as a lot of soups do I've got two yellow onions chopped and two tablespoons of olive oil and I just cooked them for about five to ten minutes until they're translucent and I'm gonna add some potatoes potatoes are great in this because they sort of thicken it the starch and them cooks into it and forget peeling them the outside of the skin is just great it's got lots of nutrients and it's perfectly delicious in the soup this is a really chunky soup so you want to cut the vegetables maybe about a half inch cubes and then you get really the full flavor and texture of each of the vegetables but you can also add other things like zucchini or whatever vegetables you have around okay into the pot with potatoes I'm just gonna saute them a little bit as each of the vegetables it's done chopping put it right in okay next the carrots so with carrots I have a better pound of carrots at the narrow end I just cut it off like that and then when you get to the wider part just cut it in half it's important for the vegetables to all be about the same size so they cook it about the same time and right into the pot so I saw tail the vegetables together first and then and lots of stock and it would be a really thick delicious soup so these are leeks if you've seen them in the grocery store they're really a mild onion flavor and they very often have a lot of sand in them so you want to cut them right down the middle and wash them incredibly carefully pull everything apart there's no point in making a super piece - only to find out that there's sand in it do that so I need about 2 cups of leeks which depending on the size of the leeks is two three four leeks something like that and you want to cut the just the white and the light green parts there should be about two cups I'm just gonna put them right in if you're not sure that all the sand is out what you want to do is just put them in a sieve and then just wash it through the water again one more time but these are good and cleaned just saute all this together okay now I just need salt and pepper why don't I have tablespoons of salt and a lot of this depends on how salty your chicken stock is mine's homemade so it's not too salty and one teaspoon of pepper so there's no saute these for about five minutes until they start to get sort of a little tender on the outside and now I need a really important ingredient for super piece to saffron saffron it's one of my favorite spices it's really elegant because it's got great depth of flavor it's the stamens of a particular crocus that's found in Spain and Turkey mostly and it's gonna be delicious in the soup it gives it a great spice I need about a teaspoon of saffron first I'm gonna pour in three quarts of chicken stock I've heated it a little bit but [Music] just stir that around turn up the heat so it simmers and now teaspoon of saffron so I'm gonna let that simmer for about thirty minutes just below the boiling point after I'm finished making this dinner I'm gonna pack it all up and send it over to the store where Dori is the manager she's a fabulous sense of design and I'm sure she's doing a gorgeous table [Music] joy what do you think about using one of these antiques is honest I think it's still perfect that's great and the light table cloth underneath really stands it out it gives it a little pop [Music] so prevalence elsu pocus do is classically served with a dollop of pea stew on the top which is very similar to pesto but it's a provençal style instead of having pin yoli's and has tomato paste in it but it has all of that sort of garlic and basil fresh taste to it so I need four cloves of chopped garlic and actually since it's going in the food processor I don't have to be chopped that much right in with a steel plate I'm going to add a quarter of a cup of tomato paste if you're really rich tomato flavor lots of fresh basil but the minors are the full you're right and then I need 1/2 a cup of olive oil just going to pour it right in the top just like making that stuff and the last ingredient freshly grated Parmesan cheese stump again post it to mix it you've got these two I'm just gonna save it for later put it in a container so each bowl of soup is gonna have a big dollop he's still on the top the lid on and it's ready to be sent to the store okay I'm gonna finish the soup and then I'm gonna make coconut medlab so just two more quick things to do for my provençal super loose - I'm going to put in string beans and pasta so the string these are these French string beans they're very small you can really find them almost anywhere now just do them in big groups you don't have to do every single one individually we're not looking for perfection here we're looking for delicious I put the string beans in in the last 10 or 15 minutes of making the soup because you don't want them to get overcooked you want mushy string beans so they'll still have a lot of fresh flavor and bright green color this soup au pistou is gonna be just delicious with a seafood main course it's a really rich and hearty and it'll go beautifully with the lightening course so right into the soup and then the last thing is dried pasta I'm gonna use a quarter of pound of spaghetti and again you don't want big long strands so I'm just gonna break it into parts just break it into like thirds or quarters just put it right in the soup and this is all gonna cook together for about 10 or 15 minutes until the pasta is tender the string beans are done and you've got a rich thick vegetable soup I think the guys in the store will love it okay well the tables basically done so we'll use these meatballs with the texture on them to give it a little rough element right and how about these shells for the smooth and they're nice and shiny and then also we have the wood to give it a little natural element as well so we can incorporate all our textures perfect my lens are a classic little French pancake that are made in the shape of a shell they usually plain but I thought I'd do a twist on them and make them with coconut so I'm making coconut neck lens they're often served with tea actually dipped in tea but since I'm making it nice French dinner I thought they'd be delicious for deserved so three eggs and to the mixer 2/3 of a cup of sugar if you want to make a classic Madeleine leave the coconut out and do a little bit of lemon zest and it's delicious and a teaspoon of good vanilla extract vanilla I'm gonna just beat this on medium speed for about three minutes until it gets really light and fluffy and in the meantime I'm gonna mix the dry ingredients so 1 cup of flour put a good cup of cornstarch this makes it more like a cake flour half a teaspoon of baking powder and according to teaspoon of salt and just get those together right okay so this is nice and light and fluffy I'm just gonna lower the speed and add a quarter pound of butter that's been melted not hot because you don't want to cook the eggs there's melted and cooled that's what makes me that one so moist and delicious and then still on low speed just gonna add the mixture of flour and cornstarch and salt mix it together very quickly less than a third of a cup of coconut okay and then the coconut just stir it in with a spatula I've got two pans that I brushed with melted butter and dusted with flour this should make I think about 20 Madeline's the flour and the butter stops the Medlin's from sticking so you want just one rounded tablespoon of batter in each one just do sort of like an oval shape if you take your spoon and just run along the edge you'll end up with a nice oval shape and then each bad level be the same size I have to say I'm really not big on having something where you need a special pin just for that item he's specialized baking equipment and cooking equipment but there's something about Medlin's that I just adore and if you made these in another pan and just be little pound cakes in order to be Medlin's they really have to be the classic shell shape and they're really not very expensive you can find them in almost any bakeware store in America so we bake these at 375 for about 10 to 12 minutes until they're golden on the outside and just moist and delicious inside you could serve this with a glass of sherry but tonight they're gonna be delicious with a cup of coffee so coconut Midlands for dessert hmm next I'm gonna make the seafood platter wait you see this it's wonderful [Music] so for the main course for the store dinner I'm gonna make something so easy and so spectacular you'll be really surprised it's based on a traditional French seafood dish it's all one big platter with crushed ice lobsters shrimp crab meat and fresh oysters so the first thing I wanna make is a mignonette sauce which is the traditional thing served with raw oysters it's really quick I need 3/4 of a cup of white wine or champagne vinegar the shallots 1 tablespoon of sugar and I'm just gonna cook that for together for about a minute over medium heat and then I'm gonna have lots of fresh herbs to it I've asked my friend Ellen to take everything to the store for me so all they have to do is get the table ready okay that's done now for some fresh herbs I have parsley dill and chives for my garden okay rough chop these gives it a really fresh taste so you have a piece of dry Breton one and maybe a little butter and a roll i stir a little tablespoon of mignonette sauce on it in the other hand and you're happening okay one tablespoon of chopped green herbs right into the mignonette sauce and that's done okay the next thing I'm gonna make is a really easy mustard sauce for the rest of the seafood the lobster the shrimp and the crab meat ina sent me a task list so all I have to do now is find a place for the platters and the hot plate Odori what do you think about adding some pillows those chairs I think that's a great idea get a little more comfortable definitely I love the orange one well that's pretty I like the green one too oh yeah that's good you're nice and cozy for our guests they can just mix and match they don't have to be perfect great well it looks really cozy what a good idea to have a dinner party at the shop this looks beautiful I'm so glad that we don't have to cook me too I'm sure a nice meal will be great let me know I'm ready to party fantastic so for the second sauce my seafood platter I'm gonna make a mustard mayonnaise sauce we're just really easy I need one and a half cups of mayonnaise let's see this 16-ounce jar so I need about 3/4 of it perfect I need 3 tablespoons of Dijon mustard and 1 tablespoon of whole-grain mustard because I love the flavor and the texture and a quarter of a teaspoon of salt and how's that for a fast sauce just mix it all together and this would be really good with a lobster and the shrimp give a little sour cream and you want to add that you can but just the way it is perfect so have a classic mignonette sauce for the oysters and a creamy mustard sauce for lobster crab meat and shrimp and then put them both into French porcelain dishes so that can be served at the table and next I'm going to assemble the French seafood platter just because a French seafood platter looks elegant doesn't mean it's hard to make this is what you see in French bistros and the secret is if the seafood shop took everything so I'm filling a big spot you can do a platter or a dish low dish if you have a big white platting just fill it with crushed ice if you can't find crushed ice at this party store is a liquor store then wherever you get sodas you can go to the seafood shop and sometimes they'll still have somewhere on you can buy it so just fill that with crushed ice keep all the seafood nice and cold I got lobsters that are already cooked and I have them split so it's six halves for five people that's great crabs which I cut in half [Music] and lots of really big shrimp peeled and deveined they're cooked and I would like to tell the seafood shop to leave the tails on they have something to hold one of group things put all the shrimp together all the crab together otherwise it tends to look like a dog's breakfast it's a mess and then we have oysters and clams just put them right on tonight they're so fresh and they're so bright and it smell like the sea just pile them up what it really packed the raw clams just on the half-shell okay pack as many as I can in and then I'm gonna do some fresh lemons not too fancy just really casual when I serve these with mustard sauce and the Medianet sauce for the oysters I'm so good and then I bribe bread with butter and some tomatoes that I sliced and I think I may need a little bit of salt and pepper a drizzle of olive oil and I would say that's not a bad French dinner it's wonderful the pasta makes it Hardy Wow [Applause] beautiful oh what's in there looks like lobsters and crabs clams oysters those shrimp oh my goodness delicious not a few much really it is to be amazing does anybody else want some mustard mayonnaise for the seafood this is so wonderful this is the meal I've been waiting for all summer [Music] you know fresh oysters a little rye bread some salted butter and a little of the mignonette sauce to go on anyone want a mandolin thank you they're delicious I love the hint of coconut in them oh great good with the coffee too here's to our team and here's to ina for the great meal I hope they're enjoying their face as much as I'm enjoying mine super
