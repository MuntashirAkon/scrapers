[Music] okay I'll pick you up at 6:30 can't wait to see you bye that was my friend Frank he thinks regarding to dinner at a restaurant but I'm gonna surprise everyone have dinner at the beach I even have a surprise guest I just love surprises my beach party I'm gonna make a spa Cho fillet beef sandwiches marinated grilled shrimp and for dessert my outrageous brownies so first of the filet of beef I'm just gonna roast this by spreading the outside with butter keeps it really moist and then lots of salt and pepper I know it seems like a lot but it really makes a difference I'm gonna roasted at 500 degrees make sure your ovens really clean for about 25 minutes and then I'm gonna make sandwiches with blue cheese sauce and arugula it's so good so next for gazpacho which is a cold soup that's like a liquid salad it's really good I'll show you how easy this is it says all kinds of salad ingredients and I'm just gonna chop them up really fine in the food processor start with 1 hothouse cucumber don't want to puree it cuz I want this to have lots of great texture and I do the most separately because I want them all to be finely chopped enough pureed and then for some Tomatoes yeah okay and it's the ball red onion so nice and chunky not too fine so it has wonderful texture I bear for contestant one time I was behind the counter and somebody came to me and asked Frigga stop Oh sue I was a little confused for a minute nope but I figured out they wanted to kiss Pancho and two peppers okay that's all the vegetables and then I need three cups of good tomato juice and like a salad it has olive oil and vinegar so quarter of a cup of vinegar a cup of olive oil half a tablespoon of salt teaspoon of pepper the last ingredients of chopped garlic three cloves of chopped garlic right in and all I have to do is mix it all together it's delicious it's colorful it's good for you how bad can that be I'm still let it sit in the refrigerator on what the flavors get really melded that's so good [Music] maybe should be done oh that's great I'm just gonna let it rest for about 20 minutes under aluminum foil and it'll finish cooking [Music] knock of a blue cheese sauce [Music] I love blue cheese sauce for filet of beef so why not for sandwiches so I have Bluto there and I need a creamy blue cheese but you can use any other kind you like like gorgonzola or if you'd like Maytag blue cheese from Wisconsin it's really good so I'm just gonna mash this up with a fork this is really easy blue cheese sauce you can throw together and you can use it for hot filet beef if you want to also okay and then I'm gonna add 2/3 of a cup of sour cream 1/3 of a cup of mayonnaise this is a really fast blue cheese sauce why don't have teaspoons of Worcestershire sauce teaspoon of salt and a teaspoon of pepper that's it we're just gonna mash it up together what I like about this is it is sandwiches but it's sort of best of class so that's it so now for the flavor I need to take the strings off first and slice it I'm just gonna slice it as thinly as I can no this is beautiful okay now I'm gonna assemble the sandwiches okay big dollop of blue cheese sauce on one side some beef no these look good some arugula arugula is great cuz it's peppery and it goes really well with the filet of beef Rula and then just a tiny bit of butter on the other side of the bread so it doesn't dry it out just like that yeah it doesn't I'm gonna wrap each sandwich with a little bit of parchment paper so everybody gets their own sandwich at the beach that's a really special sandwich I'm having a beach party with lots of surprises a surprise guest a surprise place and for dessert I'm gonna surprise everybody with my outrageous brownies [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay six eggs and then because chocolate is really enhanced by the flavor of coffee I put in three tablespoons of coffee granules I prepared coffee but instant coffee granules for lots of flavor two tablespoons of good vanilla and two and a quarter cups of sugar this makes a lot of brownies it's gonna whisk that all together one of the good things about these brownies is they really need to be cooled and chilled in the refrigerator so you can make them up to a week in advance so it's a great thing for parties so in here I've melted and cooled six ounces of unsweetened chocolate a pound of butter and a pound of semi-sweet chocolate I'm just gonna pour it into the egg mixture it's a lot of chocolate but it makes a lot of brownies okay just mix that together how chocolate is that okay next the flour this recipe doesn't have a lot of flour which is why they're so fudgy so I need 1 cup of flour 1 tablespoon of baking powder and 1 teaspoon of salt we sift these together it mixes it but it also makes sure there's nothing in the flour that you don't want in your brownies and now this mixture goes into the chocolate mixture just fold it in so my surprise guest is my friend Kathryn Ireland who's an incredible interior designer and she offered to do the table setting who wouldn't say yes so she's at the beach doing this wonderful table setting I'm sure I can't wait to see it and now as though it's not chocolaty enough I'm gonna have chocolate chips and walnuts I've got 12 ounces of chocolate chips and three cups of walnuts and I'm just going to add some flour to it so they don't sink to the bottom of the batter oh right in Oh I'm just gonna follow these in so the Brandis are gonna bake at 350 degrees for about 35 minutes and in the middle of the baking because air builds up between the brownies in the pan and just pick up the pen and wrap it on the baking rack and it just releases all that air so 350 degrees 35 minutes and halfway through wrap it on the baking rack so half sheet pan 13 by 18 by one and a half inches floured and buttered well buttered and floured just smooth [Music] now who wouldn't want those for dessert into the other [Music] not much further I think I think

of mustard and three mince cloves of garlic lots of garlic teaspoon of dry mustard 2 teaspoons of prepared mustard 2 teaspoons of salt this makes a lot of marinade half a teaspoon of cracked pepper

with you that's it just mix it all up let's go boys sit in the refrigerator even overnight the more it sits the more flavor the shrimp pass it'll be so delicious and fun at the beach last thing to do for my beach party is uneven avocado salad the key to this salad is to use Hass avocados they're the ones that are brown on the outside not those bright green ones these have so much more flavor and great texture and this is a quick way to take it out just run your finger around the outside and it just pops right out you can do it with a spoon but this is so much easier and so much Messier so three avocados and then I'm gonna use three heads of and Eve we want to do is just do big cubes of avocados into the bowl and then three heads of and Eve for the on deep I'm just gonna take off the core at the end and then just do big slices like this and when it goes into the bowl just pull the leaves apart and Eve it's really delicious it's a salad green that's a little bit bitter and it's great with the sweetness of the avocado this looks great I love the colors I like the light green and dark green and after the lemon vinaigrette a quarter cup of lemon juice quarter cup of olive oil why don't have tablespoons of mustard good Dijon mustard because it's just full of salt and a half a teaspoon of pepper that's pretty easy just whisk it all together it's actually great vinaigrette for anything even just a non beef salad the avocados make it particularly good okay I'm just gonna pour it over the salad let's toss it all together bet it tastes great the and Eve is a little bit bitter avocado is really sweet and the spicy mustard it's a great combination and that's gonna be delicious no picnics [Music] okay now all I have to do is pack up all my food for the beach that's
