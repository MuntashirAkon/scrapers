you [Music] tradition is really the glue that keeps us together I've invited my friends for an all-american grill and I'm making the classic hamburgers fresh corn salad coleslaw and for dessert an all-american surprise in the summer when the fields here are filled with gorgeous corn I love to make fresh corn salad you're not going to believe how easy this is so I've boiled corn for about three minutes until it's just not starchy and the way you can tell is just to take a little kernel off and taste it so you still have the fresh corn flavor and it's perfect they're crisp but they're cooked all the way through and I'm going to put them in ice water it's called shocking them it's going to be so good with my all-american grill and hamburgers and instead of hotdogs I'm going to do turkey sausages and homemade coleslaw and a surprise for dessert okay so that's nice too so you know putting in an ice water actually stops the cooking but what else it does is it keeps the bright yellow color and we wanted to look for just takes a little hand off right there and just stand it up in a three hour end and then run your knife all the way down the cob and the kernels have come off beautifully like that when the corns fresh in these Campton I feel like I want to eat it every day especially surprising how much corn you get from the kernels of me okay five corn right into the bowl then I'm just going to add a few ingredients that will really give us all of its fresh corn flavor so the first thing on the ad is a little red onion one of the trick for cutting an onion is to lead the end one end on and then it keeps the whole thing together when you're coming up so I'll show you how this works so slice it this way keep your fingers out of the room and this way the whole thing stays together when you're dicing it so I need about half a cup of red onion which is one small red onion okay that's done all right a little bit of cider vinegar and olive oil I think the cider vinegar is really wonderful it's sort of sweet and it enhances the fresh corn flavor three tablespoons of each also Wow good olive oil salt and pepper always good salt and pepper the last ingredient is fresh basil I just think corn and they will go really well together so I put them together so this is a really great little trick how to julienne basil leaves and you just stack them up one on top of the other and then roll them up like a type cigar and then take a knife and just do really change slices and end up with really gorgeous julienned or sometimes called shippin odd okay just like that toss it up it's so fresh tasting perfect now how are you with that [Music] now I need some bread from my own American Grill he's not the place for sun-dried tomato focaccia pickle relish you've gotta have ketchup steak sauce my secret ingredient I put it in the hamburgers instead of on top of them good [Music] you can't have an all-american grill without having hamburgers but of course I want them to be the best hamburgers I can make I'm going to show you how to make really great hamburgers I actually like to combine two kinds of these I do ground chuck for the next day's really moist in the bowl and this is the ground sirloin it's got a little more flavor than the ground chuck it's a little drier and the fun thing about this is all about getting your hands into it next thing I have a two tablespoons of steak sauce how messy is that but it's really good and six egg yolks and one and a half teaspoons of salt actually what like kosher salt just has a little softer flavor than regular table so use it and everything requires a teaspoon of freshly ground black pepper and this is the messy part clean hands really important in cooking and I just find if you use a fork this all gets mashed together but if you use your hand you can keep it really nice and light oh it's so squishy and cold it's the only way to make really good hamburger and now for the real secret inside each hamburger I put a little pot of butter so hamburger and just taking like a half of this bit of butter and put it right in the middle and when it sits on the grill it's going to keep the hamburger so moy just want to make sure it's totally enclosed in hamburger [Music] roll it like that Pat it down flat focus of glory I'm gonna serve this of all kinds of good relish that's really traditional one hamburger relish ketchup mustard nothing unusual no chutney here it's not the time I'm really thinking about making very traditional things make me the best of class so people say hamburgers but then they go at least for the best 10 burgers I've ever had that's what I like like hiding a secret the middle of a hamburger like the Cracker Jack in the Box fabulous hamburgers ready for the grill [Music] my friends are coming for barbecue and it's gonna be gorgeous night we're going to have hamburgers on the grill turkey sausages and I'm going to make vegetable coleslaw to go with it to be delicious I've already sliced cabbage as white cabbage and red cabbage and I also like to slice the green part of the outer leaves I think it really adds a lot to the salad and I'm just going to slice the carrot and it's so easy doing a food processor just put the carrots in actually sideways how fast is that just two more and piece of the cook this is all the vegetables and what I do is in order to keep the colors from running the red cabbage from making everything else pink I just leave it in layers like that and then when I make the sauce I can combine the whole thing together onto the sauce they're really traditional coleslaw ingredient I like it with a volume turned up I don't like a sort of gloppy mayonnaise flavor I like to add something to spin it either chicken stock or and this kids going to do a little bit of cider vinegar now Kevin took up the manage two tablespoons of cider vinegar a tablespoon of sugar to make sure it's really nice enjoyed the cabbage and then some good Dijon mustard quarter of a cup all of this is about getting it laughs with good flavor okay I'm going to put in 2 teaspoons of celery seed just get their really good for the fresh celery flavor 1 teaspoon of celery salt and half a teaspoon of kosher salt half a teaspoon good black pepper you can mix that up now one of the good things about this is I can make it really early in the day and I leave the vegetables and the sauce separate and then just performing a service I can put it all together in fact I can even make it a few days in advance it's great I love things that don't have to be made just before the party and that's it so we go into the refrigerator and I'm ready for the party all I have to do is combine a cola on the sauce and it will be delicious I really hate it when I buy a really gorgeous tablecloth and then somebody inevitably spilled red wine on it so what I've started to do is buy fabric a fabric store I've got this blue and white cloth for my all-american grill I thought it's very appropriate and then I'm going to make a ham with this tape it's sort of sticky tape and what you do is put it underneath the hem and then roll the top over I can't believe how easy to sue and design it so that's the hem and who cares if somebody spilled red wine now enough of a surprise what can be better for an all-american gril than a flag cake this wonderful cake it's a sponge cake and the whole thing is decorated to look like an American flag with fresh blueberries and raspberries and cream cheese frosting how bad can that be so what I started with is two and a quarter stick of butter in the mixer and three cups of sugar and now I'm going to crush six eggs and put them in two at a time this is the stage where you really can't over beat it sugar the butter and the eggs the only time you really want to be careful is when you start adding the flour just make sure it's really well mixed that's great okay the next ingredient of sour cream it's a little unusual for a cake but it really gives it a nice richness so one cup of sour cream and it's let in wanting to have teaspoons of vanilla good vanilla extract now the dry ingredients we're going to do is just mix together three types of flour 1/3 of a cup of corn starch teaspoon of baking soda and teaspoon of kosher salt now unload speed I'm going to put this into the batter very slowly until it's totally incorporated it's the only time to make sure the mixture is not on high could you'll be wearing the flower and that you mix it just until its neck and that's it I'm going to put it in the pan and bake it this is called a half sheet pan and I've lined it with a little parchment paper so it'll come out after I finish baking no point in making a cake if you can't get it out of the pan okay just smooth at the top that's I've got it all over me in the kitchen it's all part of cake baking that's it and then later what I'm going to do is I'm going to decorate this to look like a flag with cream cheese frosting where as berries and blueberries could be green okay that's nice and smooth into the oven 350 degrees for 20 to 30 minutes and I can't wait to decorate it so now you get the barbecue ready set my table for the All American Grill but first cake smells like it's done perfect so now to get the grill hot this is my secret weapon it's a charcoal chimney and it's really great for starting a fire without any lighter fluid so what I do is I take paper - she seemed to work perfectly and put it in the bottom and then turn it over and fill the top with charcoal and then just light it and it works all by itself no pouring lighter fluid on a lift fire just a little bit of paper and charcoal and in 20 minutes you've got a really hot fire so as soon as these coals are hot really hot I'm going to dump it out into the barbecue and we'll have a really hot grill okay and now the table so I thought so my all-american grill would be really fun to have red white and blue but I have to shake it up a little bit so blue stripe cloth and instead of red flowers it wouldn't be great to have Tomatoes they're bright red they're summery and they look great on the table we're going to do two big plates in the middle really colorful tomato it's a crack these are Israeli tomatoes on the vine and they're just wonderful and then we can have tomato salad later and what I know from my retailing experiences green leaves make all the vegetables look so much better so what I'm going to do is I have some lemon leaves because you can really can get in the florist and they're so useful if they were different okay that's the centerpiece nice red tomato the next thing it's a place I'm big on white plates and glasses this is the time for stemware this is the time for just good simple glasses and then napkins I've got a big bowl I'm going to fill it with beer and soda and ice travel clothes I just like to go around and make sure everybody's place setting it's exactly the way you'd want them to find it I'm making a really easy buttercream frosting for my slide cake doesn't get any easier than this it's butter cream cheese confectioner sugar and vanilla amount of the decoration a fun part so this is a sponge that I made in the shape of a flag on a half sheet pan I'm going to do is about three-quarters of the icing on the cake and then decorate it with the rest which you see a parade move it out and now for the fun part I'm going to draw this space where the blue background goes for the stars just like that and then I'm going to fill the whole square in with blueberries it's actually kick that uses really simple ingredients but look so dramatic this takes a little bit of time but you can do it really early in the day okay last row of blueberries okay that's the blue background now the red stripe I want to make two rows of raspberries these are gorgeous big raspberries from California and then two rows of white icing will use a huge pastry bag so to fill it with more buttercream icing if you're not comfortable with typing icing I'll show you what you want to do just try it right on the counter on a board or something like that you can do stripes or if it's easy you can just do stars in a row I'm going to do the stripes let's just keep doing that until it's comfortable for you okay lots of gorgeous striped and okay another row Brassard has this look so far another row strike and the last thing is that stars on the blue field just like that how great does that work and that's an All American flag check so good [Music] so my friends are here on having all American Grill and that requires hamburgers but instead of hotdogs I'm going to do turkey sausages I like really traditional things that I also like to shake it up a little bit that's all set two more things to go and dinner served a few last-minute things while the hamburgers are grilling you make a coleslaw I saw the white cabbage red cabbage carrots and the coleslaw dressing with mustard and so racine celery salt okay that's good it's all ready to go serve it in the glass ball I've corn salad and I get the hot dog rolls and the hamburger rolls ready old-fashioned hot dog rolls for the turkey sausages it can be great just because they're simple rules doesn't mean they can't be beautifully presented and hamburger rolls the hamburger and everybody can put them on the grill if they want to or not now what else I need tomatoes and onions since I've decorated the table with tomatoes thought that would be great to have them in the meal I just want to have all the really traditional things that people like to have ham hamburgers and hotdogs and slice right onions for those who like red onions okay so separate the Rings so somebody doesn't get a big chunk of onion okay onions and tomatoes are done right in my basket and the only thing left of the relishes I've got old-fashioned pickle relish tickles and got to have ketchup nothing fancy here from my all-american grill we have a party okay everybody hamburgers and turkey what do you hold about who would that be who could that possibly be oh oh oh Gorger when I'm in town I found a new place with butter in the middle of the night well the ticket to the sauce is often size size of burgers instead of on top and for the grand finale flag do you think isn't a frosting I know I did I was very carefully got here I said sister okay shall we [Music] thank you for you Geoffrey would you like seconds yeah [Laughter] [Music]
