that's my French is really bad cucumber to go with the salami will cut a would be nice next super cool hunter named Adam let's see this could be a fun party [Music] so here's our secret to making it really easy cocktail party make one thing and assemble the rest so the one thing I've made is tapenade which is an olive paste it's really easy to make and I can make it a few days in advance that's done and all kinds of assembled things and the good news is I can make the same kind of party on both sides of the Atlantic some pate remember the potato Campania whoa okay I'm just going to cucumbers with salami and just spread the top knot right onto French bread okay maybe some black olives I have these gorgeous cherry tomatoes spread on the tray and some green olives okay and then maybe some slices of French bread under the tomatoes can always find space a little of our fresh goat cheese okay and the cashews and I think they have a party only use the guests [Music] everybody to Paris great friends thank you so much for coming Cheers I'd like to say that I spend all day making Pat's head I spent all day at the market and some tapenade Canyon meal some tapenade q cheers everyone thank you so much for Paris make it so much fun so you know what I said about entertaining on both sides of the Atlantic I'm going to give exactly the same cocktail party at given Paris here in East Hampton including the tapenade this is a half a pound of dollars so right into the food processor and you want them drained okay next thing is three tablespoons of capers and I've drained them just right in and show v's I know they taste like hairy fish but when they're in this they're really good so the salt and the flavor of the fish so eight anchovies take good anchovies bad anchovies can be really bad and the next thing is garlic and of anything from Provence about garlic I'm just going to smash it because it's really going to get pureed in the food processor okay so I'm just going to curate that up really rough just like a rough chop and I'm just going to add some other ingredients some lemon a 2 tablespoons handy dandy marina mer at 2 tablespoons you can just do it approximately 2 teaspoons of good Dijon mustard 1/2 a cup of good olive oil it's actually another ingredient that's really important for it to taste good okay now we've got to have some herbs if it's Provence all right it's a little fresh thyme just the leaves in like that and I'm looking some fresh parsley this is flat leaf parsley which I think there's a little more flavor than the curly parsley and for this dish would be perfect just a handful of that that's it you don't want to puree just want roughly chopped so it's a little piece of bread either toasted or plain love it [Music] same party different times and just as much fun cheers here's to East Hampton NPR's [Music] in Paris I take inspiration everywhere when I come to the boulevard rest by market I love to see these rotisserie chickens going around and all those gorgeous juices falling on the potatoes no fabulous and when I went home I thought wouldn't it be great to have break cubes underneath and that's how roast chicken with croutons was born it's so delicious chickens croutons work for town or simple lunch like staying with my friend Anna shows up I'm gonna stuff the inside with lemon just put them right inside it's got a really good flavor so pepper and it's the pan great so I'm going to roast at 425 degrees for about an hour and 15 minutes until it's just perfectly done and then I'm going to sautee bread croutons and when the chicken is roasted I want to slice it over the croutons so it just absorbs all that gorgeous chicken juice with flavors so for the croutons I'm going to use a sourdough bread like this you can get them all over the country but it reminds me so much of this wonderful bread can fall on bakery that I love in Paris [Music] this is Paul on it's probably the most famous bread shop in the world they're famously huge loaves of sourdough bread and they are so delicious you can buy them in lots of places the United States you could also have them shipped overnight to your door which you see the bread ovens downstairs they can put 48 of these incredible loaves in at one time [Music] nextdoor to pull on they make these wonderful open-faced sandwiches called tartines all different kinds of flavors and they're really inspiring to me they're great first course a nice light lunch that looks great [Music] so one of the things we do here is we make sandwiches are like big thick roast beef sandwiches in France as we just saw they make really thin ones and you really taste the ingredients so I want to make my two favorite ones goat cheese with tomatoes and smoked salmon so I've toasted the bread a little bit and then I'm just going to spread some of them with herb goat cheese good thing about tartines is you can go through the fridge read and see what you have left over it could be brie and tomato basil whatever you want okay and then I'm going to put tomatoes on it's going to be a great first course okay under the broiler and then I'll make smoked salmon ones few minutes that's going to be really nice and bubbly hot okay so I've got the toasted bread good smoked salmon Oh sliced and nice long slices okay the next thing is sliced cucumbers just be creative about this like an herb butter on it or a little even guacamole anything like that just make it really delicious I think I'm going to do some lemon and I was like pepper on salmon so going to the black pepper and I love the way the woman call on cut it up on a plate so I think I'm doing something so let me see how this works just like in Paris Oh perfect is grade the heat sort of willfully robo a little bit these tartines are going to be perfect starter my dinner with Hana but right now I have to clear the decks and get ready for caramelized shallots and French string beans [Music] come on shallots they're so good and they're really easy to make 3 tablespoons of butter one of our tablespoons of sugar is to make the cowboy part and then I've got shallots that I've actually already peeled actually feeling relating them with you and onion the fast way is dunfin boiling water it's about 30 seconds and the tips comes right off so with these cook until they get brown on all sides and if they start to caramelize so I'm going to sit in one and a half tablespoons of red wine vinegar okay into the oven 400 degrees for about fifteen to thirty minutes until they're really just tender so I've got some haricots vert and they're great on their own but I'm going to give them more flavor by doing roasted peppers and onions and then heat them all up together at the last minute and it's going to be so good as we great with roasted chicken okay I'm going to roast half a yellow pepper half a red pepper big chunks just cut it in like six pieces big one like that and then one red onion let's cut it in half take the peel off and also in big chunks oh those onions always make me cry okay put them on a roasting pan a little olive oil salt and pepper tossing around clean hands always help where those onions are strong into the oven 425 degrees for about 15 or 20 minutes into this sort of browned and delicious [Music] [Music] nothing like gross checking in at the house smell good so I'm just going to cover this with foil that that's all the juices back into the meat makes it really moist that's what it is it was just enough time to make the croutons so three times slice the bread and big cubes [Music] I think half a loaf is enough for two people and I don't mind it with a crust on if you prefer without the crust just cut it off but I love the earthy way above it's a great way to use up leftover bread just a little film of oil in the pan get it really hot and then just put all the bread cubes I want them in one layer just saute them medium heat just keep turning them until they're nice and browned on all sides and then when I slice the chicken over the bread cubes on the platter all that gorgeous juice from the chicken and the lemon is going to get into the cubes it's gonna be really good and really do this with any kind of bread like a baked add or sourdough bread or a big white bread make sure it's really good [Music] [Music] such an everyday mmm that smells so good that's okay well it's a French inspired meal so I'm making roast chicken on a bed of croutons and it's constantly down shadows a little liner twist on a French meal and for his string beans and it's with you in mind here okay I think that's a little glass of wine and some tripe teen for you I'm gonna go get the chicken radio sounds great okay I'll be right back all right I just love honor I think she's inspired me more than anybody else I know but now I could get lunch ready serious stuff just going to cut this up put it right on top of the croutons and then all the juices from the chicken are going to get into the croutons it's all the lemon the chicken pieces mmm the breasts I'm going to do is I'm going to cut it all off in one piece and then slice it in that way everybody gets a little bit of it neat and a little bit of the skin [Music] I'm just going to put the roasted lemons on the fire show Thank You Blanche for about three minutes and then I have the roast vegetables put them right on top okay well that's it up I'm going to get the shower from the bowl work with the ground caramelize these are they're going to so visit the chicken may contribute to lunch I'm a lunch is ready Please Please Me badd yes okay fabulous would be fine is just a beautiful who would like it Oh yourself it's so wonderful some little chicken pieces and croutons what a surprise that's a family show so wonderful I know you feel exactly the same way I do I can't go to Paris oh they'll be inspired by something food the flowers just the warmth and the style the people and of course the divine cheers to Paris when we come to Paris Jeffrey's always asking me to do a picnic so I'm going to do a totally no cook picnic and we're going to meet up later at the plum Bazaar which is a footbridge over the set it's doing really lovely the first I need some Tomatoes this is not only and about not cooking this is about not arranged and we're just going to open the packages and even as is to be so good that looks like a really good great excellent but everything was french stream market even wine a nice slice of ham is made perfectly the picnic [Music] you know everybody talks about a picnic you think big baskets red check-plus forget it find a really gorgeous spot and somebody you love and you just get a whole bunch of things and make it really casual and somebody who loves somebody and definitely somebody loves picnics and you start with good wine so what else you have I've got some good brie no plates no knives it's all finger food that looks great okay take a bite ya know it's a ticket for you can't eat it it's actually great it's very good French ham oh this looks good very rested evidence of your hands look at that tomato it's not gorgeous look beautiful Cheers that's picnic maker right now I hope I'm the only big menu now I'll have it anywhere it's so good [Music] and love Paris and love French food I'm not talking about fancy food with complicated sauces I'm talking about really simple French food I'm making Geoffrey dinner tonight that's going to take them right back there herb baked eggs on beef with Roquefort salad and for dessert profiteroles you won't believe how easy it is hey I'm already there right in the heart of Paris on the left bank is the most amazing store like Rhonda pizzeria it's one of my favorite food stores in the world you can find everything your heart desires here and a few things you didn't even know you needed aren't these pastries just amazing one of my mottos is my friends don't have more fun if I spent the day making dessert so if it's complicated I'll come here and buy a French tart or if I want to make it easy I'll make profiteroles at home [Music] after admit I used to think of making French pastries really daunting but I found if you can make one simple thing contest choux which is a sweet dough I can make lots of different things and today I'm going to make Federal's so what I have in here is quarter of a pound of butter a cup of milk and a pinch of salt and it's heated until just below the boiling point and now we're going to add a cup of flour so I know this sounds strange but dump the whole thing in at once and just start stirring it and it's going to pull together into a dough just beat it with a wooden spoon over very low heat for about two minutes and you'll see it'll start to coat the bottom of the pan say you get your exercise so about two minutes you see it just starts just coat the pan a little bit okay done now this is going to go right into the food processor just dump it right in now I need four eggs in room temperature just going to dump it right on top of the hot dough and then plus it takes it's now going for the dough into this pastry bag I have a round tip it's maybe half an inch round and show you it's actually very big tip into the pastry bag I'm going to turn down the top exit neater and just take some of the dough put it right into the bag this dough will make 18 small or 12 large profiteroles nothing for jefra nor mike leake ones and just two mounds right in the middle just like that the good news is if you make a mistake just take the dough put it right back in the pastry bag the other good news is you can make them in advance and freeze them okay now a little trick about these little points at the top is dip your finger in water and just press down the top so otherwise the whole point will bake faster or a little burn okay into the oven for twenty five for 20 minutes and they're going to be big and puffed and golden and then I'm going to fill them with ice cream and cover them in chocolate sauce next tray the Paris is not just food ideas I get for entertaining it's flower ideas as well and this is my favorite flower shop Marianne robic Wow a friend of mine says that you don't choose the flowers here they choose you I know what she means I want them all so it turns out with flowers just like food the simplest ideas are the best Mariana's taught me so many secrets about how to do flowers really simply this is one of them is to take one color like this pale pink and mix all different kinds of flowers in the same color this is peonies and roses and sweet peas and it's gorgeous [Music] another thing Marianas taught me is you take one flower and do masses of it like these hydrangeas aren't they amazing of course a huge boss like that doesn't hurt and then some of the best ideas are right in front of you in the grocery store or in your garden this is fresh mint with masses of peonies love the way it smells I love the way it looks it's not great so the one idea I'm going to bring back in Paris is one color lots of different flowers it's not easy but I'm going to try and do it so of course my favorite flower color is orange so I'm going to start with orange tulips and the way they do it in France is they take the lower leaves off so you just hold them together the way you hold a bridal bouquet together and just have all the flowers at the same height the stems are all going to be different but the heights going to be the same and then on Rose just put them all together and then just look at them and see if it what's pretty what some things are small and leafy like this to fill in the spaces so you mix big flowers little flowers things that have green on them so just keep turning the bouquet around and any things as you go and just keep looking at it make sure it's really pretty I've stood for hours French florists watching them do this and it's the only way to learn so I need a little red in here it's a little web vernacular there now I'm going to take some string and wrap it right around the center really it's like a bridal bouquet okay so now what I'm going to do is cut all the stems off at exactly the same height put them in an angle it allows the flowers to drink more water okay let's see how this works I always seem to get the wrong size bajas the first time yep that's the wrong one the mouth is too big so they don't stand up well this one's too small so let me see I think exactly the way this is like it should do it so want to fill it with room temperature water not too hot not too cold flowers drink it best that way okay let's try this that's the right size but I think the flowers are too tall but look better if they sit a little lower that's the good news about flowers you can keep cutting them just don't want to cut them too short [Music] a okay that's right [Music] the French love good cheese and they do it so well my favorite thing is to buy cheese but I also love to just go in and just smell the aroma I'd like to try new things but I also like my old favorites like Roquefort Wow there really is nothing like a French cheese shop but you can still get a lot of good cheese's in the United States no I have a three cheese rule if you've got three really different cheeses hard cheese a soft cheese and a blue cheese you can do anything to make salads you can cook you can set up a cheese platter but right now I'm going to see what kind of great cheese's I can find what do you recommend so we can start by this one okay goat cheese it's the chef oh I know that she's oh yes see hmm but such bright flavor and the texture is amazing yes very milky very milky you enter that great bite with very creamy yes perfect so what else for hard cheese son else it's made like a cheddar this perfect thank you hmm now I know exactly what the third cheese's workforce my favorite it's just wonderful I think I'll just take that piece useful yes and I think we have three different ends with sheep's milk cheese a cow's enough cheese and the goat's milk cheese to work we've got it okay I'll take all three thank you that was fun say fromage good news about French cheeses you can get right here in America I'm going to make one of my favorite salads with French Roquefort cheese its rope repairs on deve and walnuts with a lemon vinaigrette it's so good so I've made it in many variations but this is my favorite so first of the vinaigrette three tablespoons of champagne vinegar one and a half teaspoons of Dijon mustard one egg yolk when a room-temperature egg yolk it's kind of like making mayonnaise if you don't want to use a raw egg yolk you can always just use a tablespoon of mayonnaise works one-and-a-half teaspoons of salt 3/4 of teaspoon of pepper just going to whisk that all together and again like make the mayonnaise I'm going to very slowly add 3/4 of a cup of olive oil and then the egg is going to make it emulsified so a little thicker than a normal vinaigrette just slowly at it just like that so the same process is making a mayonnaise we end up with the vinaigrette that's nice and thick that's gorgeous okay great and then later and slice the pears I'm gonna slice the aund Eve crumble up the blue cheese and the walnuts have been nice and toasted so they're really crisp I'm going to assemble the whole thing for dinner for Jeffrey me [Music] another night like how much you want to sit here and you know when we come back from Paris our friends always ask where'd you go to dinner they're expecting us a four-star restaurant but the truth is we really love the bistros and brasseries really low-key places but I'd say our secret place is coming to café de Flore and having a glass of champagne and an omelette for late supper maybe too much maybe two glasses let's eat new balls let's eat okay - Anya is on let me see so with the order I ordered two sister champagne and two omelets with ham and cheese so lucky right now oh shit mr. Bishop [Music] a yes big so there are two secrets to make really good omelets the first one is cook it over a very low flame so it doesn't get tough which they did and the second one is to undercook it just a little bit so it's really delicious and moist and I'd say they know how to make a good omelet they know how to make it off someone approaches your omelette it's the highest level maybe I'd like something like this at home maybe with baked eggs instead of omelettes oh that sounds delicious what so I'm going to curb bagged eggs for Jeffrey me watch how easy this is Freight so when mixed together a quarter of a teaspoon of first time in this bowl quarter of teaspoon of fresh rosemary there's all kinds of fun trips when you use a judiciously because it's such a stronger up and be sure that you chop it really well into Bowl quarter teaspoon first garlic this has all kinds of Provencal flavors in it one tablespoon of chopped parsley you can either use that leaf or curly parsley I kind of like a rough chop isn't going to be too finely chopped 1 tablespoon of parsley and 1 tablespoon of Parmesan cheese just be sure you use good fresh Parmesan cheese okay so these are the gratin dishes that the eggs are going to go into and I'm going to crack three eggs into each Bowl one do it really carefully see don't break the yolks so now what I'm going to do is I'm going to take a little bit of butter put it in the grate and dish a little bit of cream too strong oops do this on a tray maybe it's a little pieces of toast on the server VX well put these in the broiler for about three minutes until the dish gets really hot and the butter is nice and bubbly and then when the eggs get obstructed [Music] so the cream butter for the eggs probably done perfect it's nice and hot and bubbly I'm going to carefully slide the eggs into each one so don't break the yolks I'll just start to cook immediately the dish is really hot and then when put on my mixture of thyme garlic rosemary parsley and Parmesan / Provence all salt and pepper into the broiler for about five minutes until it's hot and bubbly and delicious okay so I have my vinaigrette which is observed creamy white wine vinaigrette made champagne vinegar and on deva leaves I'm just coffee ends put some leaves right on the plate you can pick them in half lengthwise but I kind of like the way they look with them home okay so that's the Andy and then the next thing I do is crumbled blue cheese and you can really just do this with your hands this is a really good work for cheese for the best that's one of the great cheeses of the world okay so the next thing I'm going to do is pears I like to cut it this way just in wedges you can see it's really juicy so I'm just going to dunk it in the vinaigrette the acidity of the vinaigrette is going to keep it from getting brown the tariffs are artfully on the plate with on D and the bleu cheese so it's pretty good and then one once I run them so they're a little crisper and they have more flavor and just right on top [Music] I'm so starting on friction so now for the profiteroles I'm going to make chocolate sauce anything tastes better with chocolate sauce on it I need 1/2 a cup of heavy cream I'm going to heat it over double boiler and you can use a traditional double boiler you just can take any kind of a heatproof bowl and just set it over simmering water 12 ounces of chopped but semi-sweet chocolate chips are great they use bar chocolate I'm just going to let that sit over simmering water and then later I'm going to flavor it with coffee of honey and give it a really deep flavor so I've got the federal Puffs ice cream inside and chocolate sauce on the top it's actually good all-purpose chocolate sauce good over ice cream for last-minute dessert now can still pull it all together makes it perfect whites affirm and the yolks are still soft salads very fresh Jeff relaxant so very comfortable sitting in that spring a French inspired flower he got this I had baked eggs with premises are lovely and then later the way the French have a salad after the meal I mean I have an on beef salad with blue cheese and that is just delicious it's an undo sell tofu cheese walnuts and pears South Korean make you see what's for dessert I can't imagine how you're going to top this the eggs in this I mean what what what do you what do you have to surprise and you want me to support all snow there's the chocolate sauce so I have the melted chocolate and cream and I'm just gonna add some flavors 2 tablespoons of good honey this is not only good honey but it's slow honey okay two tablespoons of messy honey and two tablespoons of hot prepared coffee if you don't have prepared coffee you can always use instant coffee and just mix it all together so now that chocolate has a really nice depth of flavor as the honey makes a little sweet that's just perfect okay now I'm going to assemble the profiteroles so I'm going take two on each plate I think so these were hot but they've cooled you don't want to put ice cream into a hopper for the roll I let the ice cream out for a little while so it's a little softened actually tastes better when it's not so cold one scoop in each before I put the lid on onto the plate and how adorable these chocolate sauce and they were already profiteroles with the chocolate sauce yeah and profiteroles for this area whoops does this remind you of Paris well with a little a little imagination I could be there right now [Music] I love Paris Jeffrey and I have been coming here for 30 years and it always inspires me I'm always on the lookout for great ideas for new recipes that I can make at home great entertaining ideas and planning lots of fun maybe a little romance I hope you'll love the toppings I've come up with the French Open sandwiches and enjoy the simple meal of lemon chicken with croutons caramelized shallots and wonderful French string beans I'll be having some guests

I can make it a few days in advance that's done and all kinds of assembled things and the good news is I can make the same kind of party on both sides of the Atlantic some pate remember the potato Campania whoa okay I'm just going to cucumbers with salami and just spread the tapenade right onto a French bread okay maybe some black olives I have these gorgeous cherry tomatoes and spread on the

give exactly the same cocktail party at given Paris here in East Hampton including the tapenade this is a half a pound of valleys so right into the food processor and you want them drained okay next thing is three tablespoons of capers and I've drained them just right in and Jovi's I know they take like hairy fish but when they're in this they're really good so the salt and the flavor of the fish so eight anchovies pick good anchovies bad ancho this can be really bad and the next thing is garlic and of anything from Provence with that garlic I'm just going to smash it because it's really going to get pureed in the food processor okay so I'm just going to curate that up really rough just like a rough chop and I'm going to add some other ingredients some lemon about two tablespoons handy-dandy marina mer about two tablespoons you can just do it approximately two teaspoons of Dijon mustard 1/2 a cup of good olive oil essentially another ingredient that's really important for it to taste good okay now we've got to have some herbs if it's Provence all right it's a little fresh thyme just the leaves in like that and lifting some fresh parsley this is flat leaf parsley which I think there's a little more flavor than the curly parsley and for this dish would be perfect just a handful of that and that's it you don't want to puree just roughly chopped so it's a little piece of bread either toasted or plain love it same party different times and just as much fun cheers here's to East Hampton empires [Music] in Paris I take inspiration everywhere when I come to the boulevard rest by market I love to see these rotisserie chickens going around and all those gorgeous juices falling on the potatoes no fabulous and when I went home I thought wouldn't it be great to have break cubes underneath and that's how roast chicken with croutons was born it's so delicious [Music] chickens croutons work for crown or simple lunch like today when my friend Ana shows up I'm going to stuff the inside with lemon just put them right inside it's kind of really good flavor salt pepper and into the pan great so I'm gonna roast at 425 degrees for about an hour and 15 minutes until it's just perfectly done and then I'm going to saute bread croutons and when the chicken is roasted want to slice it over the croutons so it just absorbs all that gorgeous chicken juice with flavors so for the croutons I'm going to use the sourdough bread like this you can get them all over the country but it reminds me so much of those wonderful bread can fall on bakery that I love in Paris [Music] this is Paul on it's probably the most famous bread shop in the world they're famously huge loaves of sourdough bread and they are so delicious you can buy them in lots of places the United States you could also have them shipped overnight to your door wait to see the bread ovens downstairs they can put 48 of these incredible loaves in at one time [Music] next door to Paul on they met these wonderful open-faced sandwiches called sartenes all different kinds of flavors and they're really inspiring to make their great first course a nice light lunch that looks great [Music] so one of the things we do here is we make sandwiches are like big thick roast beef sandwiches in France as we just saw they make really thin ones and you really taste the ingredients so I want to make my two favorite ones goat cheese with tomatoes and smoked salmon so I've toasted the bread a little bit and then I'm just going to spread some of them with herb goat cheese good thing about tartines is you can go through the fridge read and see what you have left over it can be brie and tomato basil whatever you want okay and then I'm going to put tomatoes on it's going to be a great first course okay under the broiler and then I'll make smoked salmon ones a few minutes that's going to be really nice and bubbly hot okay so I've got the toasted bread good smoked salmon Oh sliced in nice long slices okay next thing the sliced cucumbers just be creative about this like an herb butter on it or a little even guacamole anything like that just make it really delicious I think I'm going to do some lemon and I was like pepper on salmon so going to the black pepper and I love the way the woman who call on cut it up on a plate so I think we did something so you see how this works just like in Paris Oh perfect because great the heat sort of will through a little bit these tartines are going to be perfect starter for my dinner with Donna but right now I've to clear the decks and get ready for caramelized shallots and French string beans [Music] come on shallots they're so good and they're really easy to make 3 tablespoons of butter starting out tablespoons of sugar this is to make the caramel part and then I've got shallots that I've actually already peeled - you're feeling the way you normally feel an onion the best way is dunfin boiling water for 30 seconds and the Pips comes right off so with these cook until they get brown on all sides and if they start to caramelize so I'm going to spin 1/2 tablespoons of red wine vinegar okay into the oven 400 degrees for about 15 to 30 minutes until they're really just tender [Music] so I've got some haricots ver and they're great on their own but I'm going to give them more flavor by doing roasted pepper
