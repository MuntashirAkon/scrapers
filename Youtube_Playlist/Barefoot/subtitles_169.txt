[Music] when I finished my first cookbook I thought I'll never have another idea for a cookbook and I'll never be able to write another recipe well I just finished my fifth cookbook and I feel like celebrating so I've invited some of my dear friends over and I'm making them dinner from recipes in the new book I'm making grilled marinated lamb kabobs with a lemon rosemary sauce I think I'll have my friends help with the grill with an easy Mediterranean tomato and feta salad plus lots of treats from the store home is drizzled with olive oil and toasted pignoli Plus mixed olives and grilled pita bread and for dessert a lighter than air but decadent black and white angel food cake my friend Miguel is coming to help me with the food table this is gonna be a real celebration so it's such a gorgeous day today I thought it'd be really fun to do things that we can cook outside then I'll actually get my friends to do the grilling so for the lamb kebabs I actually chose very interesting cut of meat for the lamb kebabs it's a lamb shoulder I always find that a leg of lamb is kind of odd pieces and of course rack of lamb was too fancy so it's a lamb shoulder and you can cut it in cubes very easily so I want one and a half inch cubes and what I'm going to do is I'm going to marinate this in olive oil red wine fresh herbs it's gonna be just delicious okay so that's the lamb I've got about 40 pieces of lambs about three pounds and now I'm gonna cut up some garlic got a lamb and garlic and rosemary all kinds of Mediterranean spices so it's about five or six cloves of garlic just mince it up I'm gonna let this marinate for a couple of hours but if you can let it marinate overnight or even for a day or two it's even better okay that's the garlic that's a lot of garlic it's a lot of lamb too okay then one about two tablespoons of fresh rosemary take the rosemary and just run your finger down the stem get the leaves off just chop up the rosemary since the lamb kebabs are sort of Mediterranean theme everything's gonna be met attorney in the table setting the wine the garden okay that's the rosemary and now some thyme I love to use fresh thyme I really think spices and in jars sometimes consider round in the store for years and just doesn't have the same flavor as fresh herbs okay right on top okay that's the time now I need 1/2 a cup of olive oil have a cup of red wine it was used something I'm gonna drink for dinner so some kind of an Italian I'm Mediterranean wine just pour it right over that lamb and the herbs and then a splash of red wine vinegar really brings out the flavors it's not a quarter of a cup toss it all together okay just need salt and pepper 2 teaspoons of salt 1 teaspoon of pepper stir it all together I can already smell the rosemary and garlic it smells delicious I'm gonna let it marinate for a few hours in the refrigerator and they're gonna put on skewers with red onion and put it on the grill it's gonna be really fun I can't wait to see what Miguel is up to i nice making lamb kabobs tonight so I thought we'll use rosemary plants as centerpieces at the end when the meal is done we can actually break a few leaves of the plant and sprinkle them on our meat so as long as I was going with a Mediterranean theme I thought tomatoes feta I make a salad out of that so I'm gonna make it tomato feta salad I was trying to choose the tomatoes that taste the best so I choose grape tomatoes they're really just delicious they're grape shaped I have about 4 pints of cherry tomatoes it's gonna put these right into this big bowl and I've chopped up a cup and a half of red onion give it lots of flavor okay next I'm gonna make the vinaigrette so I need about 6 tablespoons of olive oil which is between a quarter and a half a cup 1/4 of a cup of white wine vinegar or champagne vinegar whatever you have that's good about two teaspoons of kosher salt 1 teaspoon of pepper it's gonna mix that up I don't put the feta in last cuz I don't want it to get crumbly I toss it all together okay so the longer this sit than where the flavors get into the tomatoes vinaigrette and the red onion this would be pretty good by itself but I think it's gonna be even better with feta okay so I'm a nice big chunk of feta so this is a Greek feta French feta is very good pick something has great flavor too they want to make cubes rather than have it crumble into the salad otherwise it just looks like a mess this is about one and a half pounds this is great for any kind of party because you serve it at room temperature or garden temperature you have to worry about having it hot or cold or whatever [Music] nice big cubes in the salad I'm just gonna fold it in carefully so I don't break the feta [Music] now the last thing is and chop up some fresh herbs pull them in so fresh basil whatever you have around is great time but I'm gonna use basil and parsley okay just chop this up roughly in goes the basil parsley he's flat leaf parsley I think it is a little more flavor than curly parsley but doesn't matter that much okay they can't fit with fresh parsley I'm gonna toss it together very carefully let the flavors really blend together the feta and the red onion and next I'm gonna make a real treat I'm gonna make lighter-than-air chocolate angel food cake with a chocolate ganache on would be really good so I decided I'm gonna make a chocolate angel food cake it's an angel food cake with chocolate chunks what sort of chocolate flakes and a dark chocolate lace on the top so the first thing I have to do is sift together half a cup of sugar and 100 third cups of cake flour it's actually just regular cake flour it's not self-rising be sure you get the right one I'm just going to sift it together four times just to make sure it's really well combined perfect now this is the key to really good angel food cake is room-temperature eggs I have about one and a half cups which is ten to twelve egg whites okay so I need 3/4 of teaspoon salt one and a half teaspoons of cream of tartar so I'm gonna beat these up for about a minute until they get sort of soft peaks and then we're gonna add lots of superfine sugar one and a half cups of superfine sugar [Music] look at it flowing it's gonna get very shiny starting to get really thick and shiny that's in the hold of me see how firm they are that's great that's exactly what we want them so when you take the beater out it stands up all by itself when it holds a peak okay now I just want to add some vanilla then I'll make the rest of the cake one teaspoon of good vanilla [Music] okay that's good for the egg whites okay it's really important not to deflate the egg whites so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put the egg whites into a big bowl and then very carefully fold the flour that's mixed with the sugar into it okay looks like an angel food cake it ready so I'm gonna just stir this in very carefully just take the spatula and go right down in the middle and then fold it over and just keep moving the ball around like that that's really a classic way to fold something it's like when you're doing mooses or angel food cake it disturbs the WIPP thing as little as possible okay this looks like it's nicely folded in don't want to overdo it just enough and now the good part I'm gonna put chocolate in it so I need about 1/2 a cup of grated chocolate this is this good semi-sweet chocolate don't want to use chocolate chips because they have stabilizers in them you just want regular chocolate and you want to do it on the course that's great it's not easy okay that should be about half a cup whoa it's everywhere let's gonna put this right in just fold the chocolate right in it smells good okay just enough so that it's folded in but not so much that you deflate the egg whites okay so I've got an ungreased 10-inch angel food cake pan I'm just gonna pour this whole thing right in just do it really carefully this is a great summer dessert because it's got a lot of flavor but it's really like not a heavy dessert clearly just smooth the top and bake this 350 degrees for about 35 to 40 minutes I'm gonna see what Miguel is up to and when the cakes done I'm gonna go shopping there's rosemary in the lamp oh it's fabulous all right off to the stores I'll be right back I used to think when I was entertaining I had to make everything and I mean everything finally I got a little smarter and I thought I'm just gonna buy a few things assemble them and it's gonna be just delicious hey Larry all right I need some olives baby I'm these French pecially look good and the same one of the French black olives thanks so much Larry have a great day thank you so since we have a Mediterranean theme going I thought hummus would be nice I'll drizzle with olive oil sauteed pignoli it's gonna be delicious Pumas gotta have PETA I think I'll brush it with a little bit of olive oil put it on the grill with the lamb it's gonna be great okay I've got pita i've got hummus olives all i have to do now is go home and glaze the chocolate angel food cake [Music] okay I need something for the top of my chocolate angel food cake I would say chocolate chips is a good place to start so the black and white angel food cake came out pretty good but I'm gonna make it extra good with a drizzle of chocolate ganache on the top so I need about a half a pound of chocolate chips just like that I'm gonna pour some heavy cream on it and melt it and it makes ganache it's not a chocolate drizzle on top just melt it together I'm just taking it so I have a better 1/2 pound of chocolate chips semi-sweet chocolate chips and about 3/4 of a cup of heavy cream okay while the chocolates melted I'm gonna get the cake set up so what I've done is I take a little piece of parchment paper and I put them right between the cake and the pedestal and that way when I drizzle the chocolate on they'll keep the pedestal really nice and clean then I can just pull them out beautiful cake and pedestal okay how's this doing and see that's just perfect you want so it's thick enough to stay in the cake and thin enough so it'll drizzle down the side [Music] that doesn't look at that [Music] [Applause] make sure it's nice all the way around it works for me and I'd say we have a nice dessert for the party [Music] time to skewer the lamb kabobs so I've got all the lambs been marinated for a few hours and it's flavored with olive oil red wine rosemary thyme I'm just gonna put a piece on the skewer another piece of onion I've cut up the red onion in quarters and then just pulled a few leaves apart oh there's garlic and olive oil this is gonna be wonderful another piece of onion does that look great no I think I'm gonna have one of my friends actually grill it get them involved I think the more involved your guests are the more fun they have you put zucchini on this anything that will grill quickly is really great it's important that the lamb pieces are all about the same size so they cook evenly if you have small pieces they'll cook too quickly okay I'd say probably one kebab per person with a few extra just in case [Music] three okay last one takes a little time but at least it's not while the guests are here okay and those are ready for the grill okay now I'm just gonna assemble a few things like hummus olives ready for the food table [Music] so store-bought hummus drizzle of olive oil some toasted pignoli nobody for a party [Music] okay guys you two come with me now put your glass and you can't drink and do this project at the same time okay who's in charge here is that the way it goes okay while we do those and we leave a little extra room for Peter Britt you know what I do I brush it with an olive oil just brush one side with olive oil lightly don't you put one Peter Daniels see how that goes yeah perfect okay can we leave you to it sure sure how long do we leave them on say like 10 to 15 minutes and turn them maybe three times while they're cooking okay and when are you coming back I'll be back really soon I'm just gonna make a sauce for the kabobs okay I'm just gonna make a really quick sauce for the lamb kabobs okay I have a cup of chicken stock I'm gonna do 1/2 a cup of olive oil 2 tablespoons of lemon juice I'm just going to let that boil away until it's reduced by that 1/2 just really concentrates the flavor and since it's why I'm gonna have fresh rosemary a couple of tablespoons of minced fresh rosemary so just chop it up this time you want it very fine because you're gonna be eating it raw so you wanted to be really finely minced put the fresh rosemary in just swirl it around a little bit of salt a little bit of pepper that's the sauce put in a sauce boat [Music] it smells great I can smell the olive oil rosemary perfect for the lamb tomatoes with Bennet totally spelled differently along [Music] remember how many times we made this chocolate angel food cake I think we ate every single one of them
