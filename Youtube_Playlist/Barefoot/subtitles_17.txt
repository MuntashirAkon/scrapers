[Music] for twenty years and especially food store in the Hamptons called Barefoot Contessa I can't tell you how many millions of muffins we made or how many thousands of people worked for me today I've invited six people from the very early years to come for dinner I can't wait to see them I'm gonna make some classic different recipes that I know they're gonna remember I'm making barbecued ribs with the sauce we all develop together served with our famous Barefoot Contessa coleslaw updated with blue cheese and for dessert delicious chocolate ganache cupcakes that will send them all down memory lane we all worked hard together and we played hard together and I can't wait to see what they're all doing now barbecued ribs I can't tell you how many millions of pounds of these we've made at Barefoot Contessa in fact Martine who's coming today had a shop called bridge ribs ribs and guess what she made lots of them so what I'm gonna do first I'm gonna make the sauce and I'm starting with one red onion that's been sauteed two cloves of garlic a little bit of olive oil I'm just gonna cook them until the onion is tender about five minutes I'm gonna have lots of great spices 2 teaspoons of chili powder mmm smells great 1 teaspoon of cumin very tex-mex spice and for heat 1/2 a teaspoon of crushed red pepper flakes and then a few really unusual ingredients a tablespoon of grated ginger this is sort of a combination of tex-mex and Asian the zest of one lime that a teaspoon when I first made this sauce actually I tried all kinds of really specialized things one with tomato one with mustard one with Asian and then I found if I mix them all together I got a much more complex and interesting sauce so that was the sauce we used for years of every contestant so one teaspoon of grated lime says third a cup of apple cider vinegar soy sauce third of a cup the Asian part 1/2 a cup of tomato paste that's the text lunchbox [Music] have a cup of honey because of the nice sweet and sour taste two tablespoons of Dijon mustard and the last ingredient is a quarter of a cup of fresh orange juice [Music] so I'm just going to simmer this for about 15 minutes and let all those flavors really going together and then I'll cool it and use it as a marinade for the ribs I don't remind us all of those great ribs we used to have in Westhampton chocolate ganache cake is such a Barefoot Contessa classic we made it into wedding cakes for 600 people we've made it into individual ganache cakes but what everybody remembers most is the chocolate ganache cupcakes with a little candied violet on top so I thought it'd be really fun to do for the Barefoot reunion so to make it I start with quarter pound of butter at room temperature very important and a cup of sugar it's got a secret ingredient I'll show you I'm gonna beat those together until they're light and fluffy for extra-large eggs [Music] last one [Music] hello speed add the eggs one at a time until they're well mixed in scrape down the bowl to make sure you get well mixed [Music] [Music] now comes the secret ingredient chocolate syrup I know it sounds odd and a cake but it's really good 16-ounce cam this recipe originally comes from my friend Devin Frederick's who owned loaves &amp; Fishes when she was like 25 years old she's an amazing cook 1 tablespoon of good vanilla extract and the last name is a cup of flour just sprinkle it in slowly so it doesn't get lumpy [Music] and this is the point you want to mix in the flour just enough but don't over beat it otherwise it'll make it tough cake that looks really good smells so chocolatey so this is enough for one eight or nine inch cake but I'm gonna make 12 cupcakes out of it music a muffin pan very inexpensive muffin pan for the from the hardware store and an ice cream scoop which gives you perfect cupcakes every time it's much easier to measure you want them almost filled they don't rise to much and then later after they cool I'm gonna do shiny chocolate glaze it's double chocolate double trouble so I'm gonna bake these at 325 for about 25 to 30 minutes and now I'm going to go marinate the ribs they're gonna be great time to marinate the ribs please look great so I'm gonna put them in the platter meat side up the key about this is I'm going to take some of the rib marinade and set it aside first I don't want to use this dipping sauce any of the marinade that's touched the raw meat and okay the rest I'm just gonna spoon right over the ribs I'm gonna marinate this for as long as I can get as much flavor as possible into them a couple of hours overnight what as much time as you have marinate them in the refrigerator I did a lot of research on ribs when we were selling them at their free Contessa you can buy baby back ribs which I found just didn't have enough meat on them or you can buy spareribs which I think are too fatty these are something called country ribs they're not often carried by butchers but you can order them in advance and they're meaty and flavorful and just delicious [Music] I hear a commotion outside public tr [Music] well instead of booze in the flowers so some instant instant photos oh that's a great take pictures of each other don't see this like 20 years so you're in charge of the grill there's a little libation go like I can work on that [Music] why is it when I think about what the Samsun I think about champagne I think has we had a really good time put those glasses down all right here this is so you can do the grill and I'm gonna take my champagne and go finish the coleslaw how's that cheers so happy having here [Music] since your having a barefoot reunion i thought i'd do all classic recipes and coleslaw is definitely one of those but i thought i'd update it a little bit with blue cheese i'm going to show you how easy it is in a food processor just take the slicing blade put it on top put the cabbage in sideways so you get long shreds otherwise you get short ones how easy this back just keep putting more cabbage in the top and slicing you can't put it in sideways that's half a white or green cabbage pour that into a large ball and now for the red cabbage then the red cabbage goes right on top don't mix them in otherwise the red cabbage will make the white cabbage red just put right on top last thing is carrots I'm gonna grate them with a grating disc the top back on you don't use this very often but when you do it's really useful yes it's gonna come out shredded and just put that right on top now all the vegetables are ready and we make the sauce so the sauce we start 16 ounces of mayonnaise this makes a lot it's a great recipe for a crowd and that's what we're happened quarter of a cup of Dijon mustard 2 tablespoons of whole grain mustard 2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar spoon celery salt it gives it great flavor at the teaspoon of salt a teaspoon of pepper together if you're making this in advance you can actually stop right here leave the vegetables and the sauce separate in the refrigerator for actually even a few days and then mix it before you in a server but since the party's today I can do it now just pour this over the whole thing we want enough sauce so it moistens it but not so much that it's wet and sloppy [Music] okay now I'm gonna add blue cheese and parsley I like Roquefort for this it's got a really sharp flavor so I'm just cut off the end the edge I'm gonna just chop it up and mix it in let's put it in I know there are those of you who think this smell smells like gym socks but it's really delicious now okay mix that in and the flavors are really blend as they sit okay the last thing is parsley just toss the parsley in mix it in it's done okay just gonna put that in the refrigerator that's gonna just get better and better as it sits [Music] next I'm gonna make chocolate ganache for the chocolate cupcakes everybody likes a nice chocolate cake but the icing that every people loves but my chocolates not gonna do it chocolate ganache icing with just a shiny chocolate glaze music so in a double boiler which is basically just the heat proof Bowl over simmering water and put a half a cup of heavy cream half a pound of semi-sweet chocolate chips because I always like coffee and chocolate it gives a real depth of flavor that I had tablespoon of and some coffee granules some to let that sit over simmering water until it just melts don't want to burn it around alone in the meantime I'm gonna get the ribs for two yards start grilling [Music] [Music] Oh Katie are you ready for some barbecue ribs I think the grills are perfect so the coals have the coals are perfect just put them on yeah you're in charge so any side first right the way they are right the way they are it's gonna be so great these are fantastic just the way you remember them I'm gonna do the table you're in charge okay great should I put the lid on this I would say with a flame like that put the lid on it the old African Tessa colors are red and white so I thought so appropriate to have a red in like cloth white plates hey Pierre I'm getting smoke in my face it's not it's not a barbecue until it catches on fire I think these still need a little bit more time before over we just have bags of candy with barefoot ribbons I thought it'd be really fun to put them right down the middle of the table [Music] all right er how the roots doing they're looking pretty good I think a little bit longer I'm impressed big napkins for ribs [Music] tear these look amazing you know one thing that's really important is that the coals are even and they're not too thick and you know how to do that they look pretty good but not too hot I'm so excited to see can't wait to see everybody we haven't seen some of them 20 years 20 years I mean it just it blows my mind I think yeah that's Susan Julie they they each have three kids oh is it time to turn these cars I think it's time to turn them we're gonna have a really good dinner licious perfect [Music] so the ganache is still a little bit warm so it's easy to pour it's amazing how shiny it is just gorgeous you can really taste that little bit of coffee and it really brings out the chocolate flavor can't imagine the think of baths of ganache we used to make for chocolate wedding cakes it was such an unusual wedding cake and I covered in fresh violets and white roses so beautiful big shiny chocolate wedding cake I have wonderful candied violets that we used to use that put on each one edible violets these are sometimes a little hard to find but if you find a bakery supply store or a specialty food store or cake decorating store something like that [Music] that doesn't look so bad doesn't okay I'm gonna put them on cake stands and they'll be ready to go out onto the table so the food's already tiers on the grill after 20 years I can't wait to see what everybody's doing much is local wine expert so we want everything she has I [Music] love the I think Martina and I worked on that it would be too was the combination of five marinades secret recipes old all combined together the secret ingredient is blue cheese surprise [Music] [Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Music]
