Efrain needs an arsenal of really easy dinner party dishes just pour the sauce right over it oh my god this is delicious you wear so many different hats you're a cook caterer business owner author and the like if you had to give yourself a job title what would it what would it be cookbook writer I think that's my primary delight and everything else comes from that certainly not nuclear policy analyst you said that each of your books has a backstory each of your books has a point of view what's the point of view of your latest book well the book is called thinking ahead and the reason why I wrote it is because I get this question all the time I mean can I make Christmas cookies in July freeze them and defrost them in December and I thought no you really can't but there is a way to do it you can make the dough freeze it and then bake it off before you serve it that is absolutely the most frequent question can I make it ahead and I thought because I have so much experience in the food business as at a specialty food store I actually know how to make things ahead so I thought why don't I write that and see if I can solve people's problems you've had a really unconventional career trajectory you started your career in many ways in the window clear energy policies in the what is a likelihood of career move and your life changed very dramatically thanks to a New York Times ad describe what motivated you to take on this entrepreneurial endeavor well what happened was I found I was I mean I was working in the White House of nuclear energy policy thinking life has to be more fun than this and I saw an ad for business for sale in The New York Times and it was a specialty food store in a place I've never been before and what I used to do when I wasn't working as I would cook I would always cook on the weekends I cook at night I just love to cook and I really taught my taught myself how to cook and when I saw this ad for especially food store I thought oh maybe I could do this professionally instead of just in the in the time in-between so I went home I said to Jeffrey you know I really need to do something else and he gave me such great advice he said pick something fun if it's fun you'll be really good at it and I said funny you should mention it I saw this ad for a business for sale and he said let's go look at it you said that when you first started this story you didn't know what you were doing but you knew that it was what was what you wanted to do describe that process making that very dramatic career jump into this this very new experience was totally new for me in every way I'd never had employees I'd never been in the food business I didn't even been a waiter in a restaurant I didn't know how to prepare things professionally I really didn't know the deal I made the woman who sold me the store is that she would stay with me for a month and teach me what I needed to know of course thinking that a month would do it and I immediately I was in over my head and I went home and I said to Jeffrey I don't know if I'll ever be able to do this and he said to me if if you can do it in the first month you'll be bored in the second month and I thought that was such good that really focused me so he's been my best advisor you built this incredibly successful store catering business and the like but there was a point in time where you were eager to look at a next chapter in your life even if you may not have known what that chapter was how did you know when you were ready to move on and with very low threshold of boredom I just I eighteen years I just thought I really have to do something else and I think a lot of people find new stimulation in the business they're in and I really admire that I just I felt like I had you know made enough chocolate cakes and done enough parties and and in fact many years ago I was at a lunch and I was seated between Chuck Williams from William Sonoma and Joel Dean from Dean &amp; Deluca and I said to chuck when did you know that you'd hit the wall and he said 20 years I just couldn't do it I couldn't sweep the sidewalk one more time and I said the same thing to Joel Dean and said 20 years so I mean I think a lot of people keep their enthusiasm up past that but it seems to be the dividing line 20 years you did something a little bit unconventional and that you left the story sold the store and you didn't know what that never be I can honestly say I thought when I left the store that it was it was probably the end of my professional career and little did I know it hadn't even started it was a friend of mine who's actually therapist said type-a people think that they can do figure out what the what they're going to do next while they're doing something and they can't and I thought about it for a while maybe you're - I thought about what's next and I finally said okay I'm going to trust her and I'm going to try it and she was exactly right it was a really I mean I don't want to sort of sugarcoat this it was a really hard year because I've gone from like baking a thousand made gets and having all these customers and a lot going I'm really a lot going on to having literally nothing to do for a year you've scaled this extraordinary business extraordinary and growth but you've also been very decided about which opportunities you decide to pursue very you know very very conscious decisions in which areas you expand your business describe the process of how you evaluate new opportunities and what's been important to you as you've grown well I think one of the things that's different about me is I'm not twenty-five so I've done a lot of things and I love having a life I really love it and I don't want to do anything that changes that so I make decisions based on what's good for the brand you know what customers want like make it a head of something it's fair but it's something that I'm really interested in I make does it I have in my head sort of a list of words that the brand is about and I try and stick to that like the first word is fun I think as Oscar Wilde said it's work is easy fun is hard so if you're doing something that's fun I think people are just naturally attracted to that so I tend not to do something that's not fun which works for me personally also but I also I love being hands-on I don't love I couldn't imagine having like 20 restaurants and and a TV show and four cookbooks and I love doing things carefully and deliberately and I'm sure I could have a much bigger business if I was willing to do those things but I'm just not it just doesn't make me happy so I tend to keep it very tight and controlled and I think most people would be very surprised to find that my entire team is three of us and we meet every morning we have a great time together
