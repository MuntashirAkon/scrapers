[Music] every Friday night my husband Jeffrey drives three and a half hours to come home for the weekend and I always make them a roast chicken I'm gonna surprise them tonight with a traditional Jewish dinner it's really easy to make and the house is gonna smell just wonderful so here's my plan I'll make a traditional chopped liver appetizer but my way cooked with a little Madeira wine and a brisket pot roast simmered in tomato sauce piled high with carrots and onions quickly sauteed spinach with lots of garlic then melt-in-your-mouth regular cookies with cinnamon sugar apricot jam and raisins and nuts my only problem now is he's gonna want this meal every Friday night it's Friday Geoffrey's coming home tonight just when it's expecting yet another roast chicken I always like to shake it up a little bit so I'm making an old-fashioned Jewish dinner with brisket carrots onions to be really good whoa that's a big piece of meat for two people but it's like making beef stew it lasts forever you can reheat it brisket for do people and I'll show you how easy this I'm gonna make a rub for the top two tablespoons of salt I know it seems like a lot of salt but it's a big piece of brisket 20 tablespoon of garlic chopped up garlic 2 teaspoons of dried oregano and two teaspoons of freshly ground pepper smoosh that all together and then rub it on top of the brisket okay that's appropriately smushed together I'm just gonna sprinkle it on the top and then rub it in briskets a great cut of stewing me to buy when you go to the store make sure you don't buy a corned beef brisket which is the same cut but it's already even processed with spices and salt okay that's done I'm gonna put on a pound of carrots just chop them up in chunks it's gonna stew along with the beef I'll be really good these are big cats pound of carrots can be anything from two big carrots to five small ones okay and then eight stalks of celery just cut off the ends a little bit the Brown ends and then just cut it in chunks remember this goes true for three and a half hours celery okay and onions I've got six onions sliced all over the top this already looks like it has a lot of flavor doesn't it and some bay leaves for flavor these are beautiful bay leaves six how's that okay and then I'm gonna pour good tomato juice all over the top of it just enough to come up about 3/4 of the way up the beef so just pour right on top and this is gonna make the sauce after it cooks okay now we're just gonna cover it and bake it so I'm gonna cover it with aluminum foil but first because I don't want the foil to touch the tomato juice it wrapped really badly I'll either cover it with plastic wrap or parchment paper [Music] to the oven 350 degrees for about three and a half hours until it's fork-tender so that was pretty fast for dinner that could feed probably ten people but for tonight is just everything so tonight instead of a big dessert I thought maybe with coffee I make little cookies called rugelach they're made with cream cheese dough and a really good vanilla so the first thing I'm going to do is make the dough and the reason why it's so delicious is half a pound of cream cheese is the first ingredient so make it a mixer half a pound of butter [Music] and quarter of a cup of sugar quarter of a teaspoon of salt and one teaspoon of vanilla two cups of flour this is wonderful it's a 2 cup measure just put it in slowly as it gets incorporated [Music] okay once the flowers in don't overmix it that's I end up with really tough pastry so this looks good [Music] dump the dough out to make sure it's well mixed [Music] that accused a really light and flaky dough is to make sure it's well chilled before you roll it out and also before you bake so just make a ball out of it it's good and stinky and because it's just two of us I'm gonna cut it up in quarters freeze three quarters of it and just make cookies out of a quarter for us and then I'll have pastry dough whenever I want to make cookies usually I put this in plastic wrap but little plastic bags work just as well [Music] okay one for the fridge free for the freezer and while it's chilling I'm going to make a nice chopped liver [Music] well you can't have an old-fashioned Jewish meal without a little chopped liver a little matzo so I'm gonna make chopped liver for Jeffrey for anybody who doesn't like chopped liver just think of it as like French pate it's really the same kind of thing so I've done this in two batches I have two pounds of chicken livers and I'm gonna saute them a little bit of chicken fat has to be chicken fat for chopped liver very quickly until they're just barely done you want them a little pink inside if chicken livers are overcooked they can be really dry with it okay these guys are done just take them out as they're done okay now the lots of onions more chicken fat I'm gonna put in onions and just saute them until they're caramelized and browned and just so sweet I've actually asked Jeffrey to run an errand I wonder what he's gonna come back with well I'm asked me to bring home some spinach and that might sound simple but I have screwed it up before I remember the time she asked me to bring back a cantaloupe and I brought back another kind of melon I thought it was a cantaloupe but it it was not a success so I approach this with a little apprehension oh this looks like the spinach this must be curly spinach and this must be baby spinach I'll get a bit of each just to play it safe okay great success yes so I'm gonna finish the chopped liver before shepard gets back from his errand this is an unusual ingredient my chopped liver is Madeira it's a fortified dessert wine and it's a little sweet I had a third of a cup deglazes the pan and gets all those scrapings out I'm just gonna pour this right into the chicken livers this is a mixture that I'm gonna chop up later maybe chicken livers but anything tastes good with all those onions on it okay the next thing is for hard cooked eggs just gonna chop them up just roughly [Music] now quarter of a cup of chopped parsley it smells good rough chop okay two teaspoons of fresh thyme two teaspoons of soul it's appropriate def kosher salt for this one teaspoon of pepper and I asked put a pinch of cayenne to give it a little bit of heat and I'm gonna mix this in the food processor with more of the chicken fat just enough to make it the right consistency I'm gonna chop it roughly you don't want to pureed that's pretty good I'm gonna chill it and then I'm gonna taste it when it's all chilled for seasoning make sure it has enough salt pepper this isn't Jeffrey's ordinary Friday night dinner [Music] I'm gonna chill it'll be ready for dinner tonight with a little matzo so I think the briskets ready let's just check it out if this is enough for two people for dinner [Music] brisket vegetables it's a whole meal in one check and make sure the meats done perfect should be fork-tender but not like falling apart liked it take me that let it rest for a little bit and then I'm gonna boil the sauce down so it gets thickened okay cover this with foil I'm just going to turn the flame on under yes so let's go simmer away for about 30 minutes and now I'm going to finish the regular just that wonderful little cook [Music] time to make the cookies so the rug Allah is a cream-cheese dough and the trapped around a filling of cinnamon sugar walnuts and raisins so one cup of walnuts chopped up six tablespoons of granulated sugar quarter cup of brown sugar a teaspoon a good cinnamon three quarters of a cup of raisins just mix that all together it smells so good that cannot be bad the cream cheese dough that we refrigerated earlier it's nice and firm just want to roll this out to a nine inch circle flour on my counter I mean you're only something in a circle just go from the center to the outside don't roll back and forth make a nice circle and try not to touch it so it doesn't get warm the colder it is the better the cookies will be the more flaky the dough is I'm going to spread it apricot jam i pureed it in the food processor so it's really fine it's really beautiful this cookie actually is great made with lots of different feelings we raspberry jams wonderful and sometimes it's even done in chocolate but I really like the traditional apricot so just a very thin layer of jam don't neglect the edges okay and now just mix up the filling a nice even layer all the way around okay press down on the filling into the dough lightly then want to make a mess okay now I take my knife and cut it in quarters okay then each quarter cut into thirds okay starting from the wider edge just roll it up towards bend it a little so it's a crescent and just put it right on the cookie sheet lined with parchment paper okay just keep rolling them up and when you put it on the baking sheet make sure the little tips are down so that the heads down okay last one it's a really messy job but it's worth it the cookies are so good it's gonna chill them and they'll have nice and flaky Jeffrey should be home any minute I'm just gonna get the tip liver ready for him you know just because it's chopped liver doesn't mean it can't be served in a beautiful silver bowl so hi hi sweetie what'd you bring you got two guys two kinds of spinach with it whatever kind you need hey what's that why'd you bring me two tons of spinach well I figured that too different as opposed to the time you went out for a lemon or came back with a grapefruit yeah this is a really nice baby spinach yeah I thought so but I want that okay [Music] Cheers so what's for dinner it's a surprise can you give me a hint it's not chicken it's not true how about if you get yourself ready and I finish dinner okay okay I'm taking this with okay I'm so good you're home [Music] okay last step to those cookies I'm gonna make an egg wash and weed cinnamon and sugar they're gonna go into the up three tablespoons of sugar teaspoon of cinnamon really is like taking cinnamon toast together brush the top with that wash it's best time my grandmother used to make okay maybe the oven 350 degrees for about 15 to 20 minutes and they're gonna be crisp and delicious now I have to sautee the spinach to slice the meat I think Jeffrey's gonna be a very happy guy [Music] so I've got almost everything done for my Friday night dinner the briskets cooked the sauce is thickened I'm gonna make some spinach so that should be more than enough for the two of us just Jeffrey and me for dinner it's gonna put it right in the pan and just lay it out like that well it looks pretty good great I'm gonna pour the sauce over it and the vegetables that carrots and onions I'm just gonna keep it really moist mmm just just delicious okay into the oven keep it warm until we're ready for dinner okay I'm gonna make a really fast sauteed spinach with garlic I know there's olive oil and butter because you get the high burning temperature of olive oil and the flavor of butter good combination little butter I've got some chopped garlic spinach and garlic's great combination just toss it in hmm girl like an oil how bad can that be got the spinach or washed it's the baby spinach it's really tender it's tender and if you can make a salad out of it but I'm cooking it just dumped it right in remember spinach cooks out in very little so you want to do a lot really good spinach just toss it around a little bit salt and pepper [Applause] okay put the lid on you'd be surprised it looks like a lot but when I come back to be that big so it should be done oh my god there's nothing left it's perfect I've lots of brisket okay into the bowl lots of garlic just a little squeeze of lemon sweetie dinner's ready
