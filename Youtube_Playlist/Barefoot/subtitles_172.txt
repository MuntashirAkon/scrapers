[Music] that was a great party I love the holidays but it can be so much work so this year I promised myself I'm gonna make it really easy and I'll show you how [Music] join me on a three-day countdown until the grand finale the holiday meal day one a stress-free cocktail party on the menu melon and prosciutto hot apple cider and decadent potato and caviar pancakes well it is the holidays this year I'm also gonna make my own decorations they're going to be really festive completely organic even edible [Music] day two I'll make a romantic breakfast for my husband Jeffrey scrambled eggs on brioche with caviar and I'll still have time to bake and deliver some homemade gifts to my friends festive Jam thumb prints packed up and ready to go day three main event the holiday meal so elegant it's so easy a heroic standing rib roast melt-in-your-mouth butternut squash and I'm gonna share with you my secret for making popovers rice so high your friends will truly be amazed this year I'm having in front of my own party no getting up at dawn I want to have enough energy to eat dessert well it is raspberry cheesecake it looks festive and it tastes out-of-this-world join me at my home for my three-day holiday countdown [Music] it's the start of the holiday season and some friends are stopping by for a drink I'm gonna make really simple hors d'oeuvres because I didn't want to stress myself out on day one so the first thing I'm gonna make is melon and prosciutto it's really easy all I have to do is assemble it I've cut up a Galia melon which is a really gorgeous it's really fragrant green melon and I'm just gonna wrap each piece and everybody can help themselves it looks good it tastes good it's easy I'm gonna make some hot apple cider and maybe we'll put a little dark rum in it and some very simple orders somebody gave me a gift of caviar wasn't that nice and I had some potato so I thought I'd make potato pancakes and caviar but we'll all do it together so it'll be sort of a shared activity what the prosciutto to be sliced thin enough so it's easy to eat but you want to thick enough so it doesn't sort of shred when you peel it apart [Music] when it's really cold outside there's nothing better than a house that smells like hot apple cider so I always have some bubbling away on the stove but since my friends are coming tonight I thought I'd make some and spiked it mmm so I'm gonna start with good apple cider and this is the time of year for it there's 16 cups or a gallon so it smells good already and then with all kinds of spices in it you can actually get apple cider spices but I'd rather do it myself so the first thing is all this gorgeous orange peel I'm just gonna put it right in and then the juice of the two oranges [Music] already smells good this biggest-ever is so freaking tired day okay juice of two oranges and then lots of spices I love cinnamon so I think that would be just wonderful for cinnamon sticks and clothes are gonna make it really spicy maybe eight cloves and I like star anise it's really licorice so I'm gonna put six in but whatever you like just put it in its wonderful and that's it it's just going to simmer away on the stove and then when my friends get here I thought maybe a little dark rum I mean how bad can that be [Music] I love his Hampton in the snow it's so beautiful during the holidays I'm tempted to do a million things to decorate but at the end of the day it's really so much better to have one big statement like all these branches and I'll show you how I'm going to decorate them so what I've done is I've sliced fruit really thin like oranges and apples and I put them on a rack in the oven overnight at a really low temperature like 170 degrees and in the morning I have dried fruit ornaments like this pear and I just put them on little strings of raffia and they can stay in a closed container for weeks and just decorate the cherry with it so it's edible its organic and it's beautiful [Music] coming up my decadent potato and caviar pancakes and lots of friends to ensure Latham the party will be so stress-free that we'll even have the energy to bake the next morning [Music] Teta pancakes and caviar it's such a great holiday order so I'm grading two pounds of potatoes and then I'm gonna make a batter out of it but first I want to squeeze as much water out of the potatoes as possible just in that kitchen towel it's a little messy but it's really worth doing and just roll it up watch this and then amazing how much water comes out of these at the dryer they are the better the potato pancakes are okay that's a lot of the water out I'm just gonna put them in a bowl so now I'm gonna make the batter I have two eggs then you just mix them in the ball when they're and that six tablespoons of flour two teaspoons of salt what about a half a teaspoon of pepper I'm just gonna mix this whole thing up and make the batter when my friends are here I'm gonna make these with creme fraiche and caviar on the top but you can do anything you do applesauce you can do sour cream and caviar or you can just eat them plain but it's gonna be fun because I'm gonna have them cook with me and love candles but I hate really strongly scented ones that compete with the food sort of like having good wine you want it to complement food so since we're having spiced apple cider I thought I would have cloves and cinnamon in the bottom of the candles and then when you light the candle you get all of that scent from the warmth of the candle so I'm just gonna put it right here in this hurricane maybe a few cinnamon sticks at the bottom so it's beautiful and it's holiday-ish but it's not some jasmine candle that's really competing with your food it smells good already [Music] [Music] so Michael you charge your drinks okay hot apple cider and rum for everybody lots of rum for me okay then you cook to help me are you are you available Barbara fantastic I'm gonna put the potato pancakes right there and how would you like to put creme fraiche which is right there and a little bit of caviar on the top perfect that looks great thank you well it's just cuz they have caviar on it right [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Applause] [Music] every still asleep it's time to make the cookies first thing is first coffee [Music] instead of spending a fortune on Christmas gifts I think it's so much nicer to bake cookies for people so I'm gonna make my favorite Jam thumb prints so I've got 3/4 of a pound of butter a cup of sugar you need to use butter for good cookies and a teaspoon of vanilla and I just mixed it up I didn't whip it just mix it up and now I'm gonna get the flour ready 3 and a half cups of flour try and get it all over yourself at the same time like I do I'm just gonna put it through a sifter at 1/4 of a teaspoon of salt sift it through see there's always something that you wish you had sifted at the bottom so I always make it a policy to do that ok I'm just gonna turn it on low and just slowly add the flour to the butter and sugar okay mix it up well that's it so I'm just gonna roll it into a ball but first now a lot of people ask me what the paddle attachment is this is actually the beater but it's also called the paddle as opposed to the whisk or the dough hook okay clear the desk here dump it out this dough looks perfect messy but perfect so I'm just gonna roll it into a ball and a disk little plastic wrap put it in the fridge for about a half an hour and they'll be ready to make their cookies but first I better bring Geoffrey some coffee coming up a romantic breakfast for Geoffrey and May and time to spare to bake gifts for my friends I love making Jam thumb prints they're really very old-fashioned cookies but they taste better than you expect very nostalgic for the holidays so let me show you what I'm doing so I'm going to take a piece of the dough it's chilled but not really cold and hard and being obsessive as I am I'm gonna weigh each one and it's great if each one is about an ounce then I'm gonna just put it in an egg wash whether just egg in a little bit of water roll it in the coconut it's great because the coconut gets toasted when you bake it it looks good it tastes good and then just make a little indentation for the jam now I'm gonna fill the middle of each one with a little bit of jam raspberry jam and then when it bakes the jam gets into the cookie it's so good and apricot jam okay into the oven 350 degrees for about 20 to 25 minutes and they're gonna be really golden brown and the coconut will be crisp and flavorful I love these Jam thumb prints it makes lots of jam thumb prints [Music] now I'm just going to get started on the breakfast table no since Geoffrey's missing the holiday dinner I thought at least he should feel like he's had a holiday meal so I'm gonna make breakfast special okay and I had clementines in the fridge and I have these dried pomegranates that I keep around during the holidays they're great cuz they last forever a little spiky doesn't it I think any different kinds of greens will make it look a little softer and the place is your place don't forget me as a gift and I love them.i storage napkin to match the clementines [Music] and if it's a holiday anymore celebrate gotta have champagne I say that stuff great I smell toasted coconut [Music] shortbread coconut and jam who wouldn't like those [Music] I just must serve [Music] so while those cool I'm gonna make some breakfast time to make breakfast but not everyday breakfast I'm gonna make scrambled eggs with leftover caviar on the top the first thing I need to do is get the brioche in the toaster nice big thick slice this is one big slice I'm going to slice it in half into the texture okay toasts in and scramble the eggs I think everybody knows how to make scrambled eggs but these are particularly good for a holiday I'm going to instead of you smell communities a little half-and-half it seems like it's always a holiday here splash of half-and-half so not too much cuz the caviar is salty pepper and I'm gonna cook them on a very low heat you don't want to cook protein on a high heat otherwise it gets tough we first see Jeffrey's ready sweetie wanna come help me okay excellent got reinforcements hi sweetie breakfast is almost ready want to get the drinks ready okay mm-hmm they're glasses right there there's champagne and orange juice in the fridge okay and I'm gonna make scrambled eggs should I get one bottle for you one bottle for me oh that looks good are you gonna wrestle that bottle of champagne to the to the ground until the court let me know who wins okay here goes okay I'm ready ready yeah excellent whoa you gonna drink the champagne yeah exactly I'd say I wanna drink the champagne forget the scrambled eggs and caviar happy holidays screaming I love you hmm it did an extraordinary job I'm really impressed with my resume little caviar that's great it's just so what exactly are you going to work we haven't figured that out I think you don't me as a lot of work so I think we need to restructure I'd say you're gonna miss a really good party keep some leftovers okay no time to feel sad about Jeffrey's leaving port guy has to work tomorrow I've got gifts to pack and deliver and I'll need to start the raspberry cheesecake for tomorrow's holiday meal [Music] definitely something bubbly for the holidays Prosecco it's an Italian sparkling wine it's less expensive than champagne I think I'll mix it with cassis and make kir Royale that's gonna be good [Music] for my holiday meal tomorrow I'm gonna make a very traditional rib roast for dinner and a slightly less traditional cheesecake for dessert it's really good so I'm gonna start the cheesecake first the crust I'm gonna up 3/4 of a stick of butter why does every recipe start with butter but for a holiday meal it has to be that way so I'm gonna make a graham cracker crust for the cheesecake it's so much easier than pastry crust I'm going to take 10 graham crackers and just grind [Music] if you don't have a food processor you can also do it with a rolling pin just roll it out and crumble them so graham crackers tablespoon of sugar and now for the butter traditional American cheesecake tends to be very dense kind of like a block of cream cheese with that red cherry stuff on the top a little too red so what I'm gonna make is a cheesecake that's much lighter and has lemon and vanilla in it so it has lots of flavor and fresh raspberries on top it's really good okay that's ready and I love anything that doesn't have a pastry crust graham cracker crust so much easier [Music] okay this is ready it's gonna press it in just do it evenly around this is a wonderful thing to make for the holidays because in fact it's better if you make it in advance okay into the oven 350 degrees for eight minutes it's gonna be so good so now for the thumbprint cookies so I can pack these without eating them last year I gave them to everybody for the holiday and of course this year they're expecting them again there's a metal right away I'm gonna put them in this glass een bag and you get them a party good stores or at art supply stores I just think you can really see the cookies so a few apricot ones two raspberry ones just a pretty white ribbon at the end sharp scissors are better okay just I find if you hold the bag open at the top and then pull it together it comes out really pretty double knot and it's ready to give away as a gift [Music] so I can smell the Cheesecake crust is about ready so I'm just gonna take it out of the oven and then deliver these to my friends I think they'll be happy to see me that looks done gotta go [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] happy holidays vertook Jim's son Prince your favorite myself before anybody do you need to have a hot chocolate shit so many errands to do [Music] [Applause] [Music] and now the cheesecake filling I've got two and a half pounds of cream cheese at room temperature and one and a half cups of sugar all mixed up together and I'm gonna add the eggs it's five whole eggs and two egg yolks gotta break some eggs to make good cheesecake I'm gonna scrape it down make sure it's really well mixed already looks like cheese kicked go to the cupboard sour cream and this is what I my steez cake is really good it has lots of flavor a tablespoon of lemon zest and half a tablespoon of good vanilla extract make sure it's really well mixed and that's really the mixture I'm going to pour it into the crust and then after I bake it I'm gonna put fresh raspberries on the top it's gonna be so gorgeous and into the crust this is the crust that I baked for eight minutes and it's just a little cooled and I'm gonna bake it at 450 degrees for 15 minutes and then lower the temperature to 225 and bake it for an hour and 15 minutes and that's my favorite cheesecake just the table to set tonight and I'm ready for the big day I do hope you stay for the party [Music] so the last big thing I have to do tonight is get the dining room ready for dinner tomorrow so just when everybody's expecting me to fill the house of flowers I love to use fruits and vegetables to decorate I'll show you how great it is so I've got lemons and small oranges but I thought artichokes look great sort of like pinecones but better tucked in the greens and that's my favorite holiday table it's a deliverer your brief and I'm gonna make it right down the center of the table it's got gorgeous color texture and actually even scent so in among the branches I'm gonna put all kinds of gorgeous fruit it's really important to have greens that are very flat on the table if they're too bushy oh really sort of lose the impact of the fruit and lines you use clementines or tangelos any kind of really small kind of orange and lemons never kind of beautiful fruit you can find but it should be small not no big things and just tuck them in between the greens and then up to use grapes because it sort of messes it up a little bit right down the middle red grapes green grapes I just wanted to look through a band and very cornucopia like then the last night is really important as candles [Music] they've got a beautiful holiday table and all you had to do is go to the produce market for it plates and verses and I think that [Music] cheesecake's should be done in the oven off oh it looks great so I'm just gonna let it sit in the oven with a door oven for about 30 minutes and when it's cool I'm gonna refrigerate it can't wait for tomorrow my friends are coming for a holiday meal so I better get started first thing we're gonna make is mustard horseradish sauce it's gonna be so good with standing rib roast and I'm making a really easy one so I need 1 and 1/2 cups of mayonnaise another 1/2 third of a cup of sour cream there are sauces that I make where you have to cook for 45 minutes and their sauces I make like this one that take like five minutes so for the holidays I try and keep it simple now for the flavor three tablespoons a good Dijon mustard one an empty spoons of coarse grain mustard which you can always buy in the grocery store it's really great it's you can see the coarse grains of mustard in it so not only does it add flavor but it makes the sauce look like mustard which I really like 1 tablespoon of prepared horseradish forget grading it yourself and 1/4 of a teaspoon of salt whisk it all together I love when something I'm making actually looks like what it is and because of the coarse mustard it really looks like mustard and that's ready all I'm gonna do is put it in gorgeous Bowl to serve him and nobody needs to know and only took five minutes I think nothing makes it feel more like a holiday than a standing rib roast and I've got a gorgeous one so this is a three-way broast isn't that incredible and all I have to do is season it and throw it in the oven so I'm going to use a tablespoon of salt it sounds like a lot but it's a large piece of meat just spread it on the top it's gonna be so good with mustard horseradish sauce mmm and 1/2 tablespoon of pepper rub it all over the top and it's ready for the oven how easy is that I'm gonna roast it at 500 degrees for 45 minutes turn the oven down to 325 for another 30 minutes and then turn it back up to 450 for 30 minutes and it's gonna be really crisp on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside it's gonna be so good for holiday meal with a standing rib roast my all-time favorite vegetable is butternut squash I'm gonna roast it with brown sugar and get it really caramelized so good this is two butternut squash cubed cube them really large I think they look better and they roast better and then I'm gonna add some melted butter it's a holiday so you can use butter brown sugar which caramelizes them lots of salt black pepper and this is the messy part clean hands just toss it all together and that's it I'm gonna rest at a really high temperature 400 degrees for about 45 to 55 minutes and the acid gets really browned and caramelized and the inside is really juicy and sweet it's gonna be really good with a roast coming up popovers to bake and a rib roast a car then it's party time I hope you'll come [Music] so I'm in the homestretch now next thing I want to do is decorate the cheesecake so I'm gonna make raspberry topping for it forget those floppy red cherries that you usually find on the top of a cheesecake I just think it's so much nicer to fresh fruit so I'm going to do a raspberry topping but I've done is melt a cup of red jelly it's red currant jelly but you can use raspberry jelly or strawberry jelly or whatever you like you don't really need any water and it just melt the jelly one more second okay I'm gonna turn off the heat and then I'm gonna put three half pints of fresh raspberries right into the jelly and it's gonna coat them and make them really shiny and I'll show you how great it looks on the Cheesecake I'm just gonna toss these together really gently because I don't want to break the berries and the jelly is gonna coat the raspberries okay and then it's just going to go right on the cheesecake and the key here is to just pile it up you don't want to have any kind of arranged raspberries here and if it drips down the front all the better maybe I'll help it drip down the side and I would say that's a raspberry cheesecake fit for anybody's holiday dinner Rose smells so good [Music] that looks like a party so just make sure the internal temperature is 125 degrees and then I'm gonna cover it with aluminum foil aluminum foil a minute just people used to cooking the middle a little bit so it stays nice and hot and a little let it sit for just 20 minutes and then I'm gonna carve it [Music] so the last thing we're gonna make is popover it's their really old-fashioned and there's so much easier than you think they are first I need to clear the decks a little bit okay I need one and a half cups of milk I'm gonna mix them in this measuring cup so I can just pour them right into the pans and three eggs the good news about this batteries you can make it not only early in the day you can make the day before and leave it in the fridge then just pour it into the popover pans okay three cloves of teaspoon of salt why don't have cups of flour the last thing is wanting to have tablespoons of melted butter now there are two key things about successful popovers first is heat the pans beforehand for exactly two minutes and I'll tell you the second one just fill them about two-thirds full I've greased the pans really well so I make sure they come out no point in making popovers if you can't get them out of the pan well that worked out perfectly okay into the oven 425 for exactly 30 minutes and this is the other secret don't peek right now all I have to do is get myself ready [Music] okay huh needs a little family so now all I have to do is carve the roast and get everyone the table oh my god they're wonderful it's gonna carve a few slices and then finish carving it at the table I think it looks so much more dramatic just got it started and then because I think that I always like to decorate the platter with something in the dish but here we have beef salt and pepper I thought some table decoration would be great and green grapes I thought would be the perfect touch simple elegant and ready for the table [Music] [Music] [Laughter] all right who's first Mike you don't want it ready for cheesecake thank you and honey would you like a little raspberry cheesecake and Cecily [Laughter] [Applause]
