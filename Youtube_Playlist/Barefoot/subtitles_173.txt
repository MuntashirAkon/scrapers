Here's to putting up with me for 45 years. Oh, god. Isn't that gorgeous? Can we start with that? Yeah, we can start with that. So I've got another surprise for you. You do? And it involves a flight in the middle of London. You're kidding? Here's to the best year ever. This was the best chicken I ever had. You say that every Friday. I always come to New York and think about that first time, our first date, when you took me to New York. You took me to Tad's Steakhouse for $1.29 steak dinner. That's right. And I loved you at that moment. That looks great. [interposing voices] What'd you bring? - I brought you some flowers. - You brought me flowers? - Yeah. - Uh-oh. Have you been bad? Thomas Keller's fried chicken. Mm, boy that's good. Is it the best fried chicken you ever had? Next to the one you make, yeah. That's the right answer. So I got you a present-- something you always wanted, Elizabeth David-- Oh, my goodness. --a cookbook. French country cooking, how fabulous. I figured you cook everything in it for me. You got a tent? I thought we sold that 40 years ago. If this tent be rockin', don't be knockin'.
