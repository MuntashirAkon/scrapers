in the summer when the fields here are filled with gorgeous corn I love to make fresh corn salad and you're not gonna believe how easy this is so I boiled corn for about three minutes until it's just not starchy and the way you can tell is just to take a little kernel off and taste it so you still have the fresh corn flavor and it's perfect they're crisp but they're cooked all the way through and I'm gonna put them in ice water it's called shocking them this is gonna be so good with my all-american grill and hamburgers and instead of hotdogs I'm gonna do turkey sausages and homemade coleslaw and a surprise for dessert okay so that's nicely oh you know putting it in ice water actually stops the cooking but what else it does is it keeps the bright yellow color and we wanted to look gorgeous take the little hand off right there and just stand it up in its rear end and then run your knife all the way down the cob and the kernels just come off beautifully like that when the corns fresh in Easthampton I feel like I want to eat it every day it's actually surprising how much corn you get from the kernels isn't it okay five corn right into the bowl then I'm just gonna add a few ingredients that will really give it all of its fresh corn flavor so the first thing we may add is a little red onion what are the tricks for cutting an onion is to leave the end one end on and then it keeps the whole thing together when you're cutting it so I'll show you how this works it's a slice it this way keep your fingers out of the way and this way the whole thing stays together when you're dicing it so I need about 1/2 a cup of red onion which is one small red onion okay that's done all right a little bit of cider vinegar and olive oil I think the cider vinegar is really wonderful it's sort of sweet and it enhances the fresh corn flavor three tablespoons of each oh good olive oil salt and pepper always good salt and pepper the last ingredient is fresh basil I just think corn and basil go really well together so I put them together so this is a really great little trick how did julienne basil leaves and you just stack them up one on top of the other and then roll them up like a tight cigar and then take a knife and just do really thin slices and you end up with really gorgeous julienned or sometimes called Shiva nod okay just like that toss it up it's so fresh tasting now how long do was that
