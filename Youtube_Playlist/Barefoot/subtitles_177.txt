[Music] my friend Michael grooms having a really hectic day today so I've invited him for dinner tonight this is the time for good old-fashioned comfort food Michael actually grew up in a farm in Pennsylvania I understand as long as it's fabulous but I want to make it sour cream mashed potatoes I peeled them and cut them in big chunks I put them in salted boiling water for maybe about 10 to 15 minutes okay next thing I want to do is heat up a little bit of milk and butter when you have cups of milk 6 tablespoons of butter and meanwhile I'm going to get the potatoes pureed so this is called a food mill you can really find it in a hardware store or any kind of a cookware store and it's not very expensive so I'm just going to put the potatoes in I'll show you how to do work so you just turn the blade and you can turn it backwards just to clean the blade and then turn it again see how light and fluffy it is at the bottom you can use any kind of boiling potatoes Yukon Gold which are a little yellow which these are are the best one done okay I'm just going to whisk this into the potato just do it slowly don't do all of it at once I want to make sure that you have enough so that's creamy but not so much that it's soupy no potato soup okay now for a little depth of flavor better half a cup of sour cream two teaspoons of salt the better half a teaspoon of pepper this is really good Michael's gonna be very happy camper [Music]
