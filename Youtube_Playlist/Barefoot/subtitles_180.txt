my friends are coming for an anniversary dinner and what I thought would be really great with the rack of lamb is orzo with roasted vegetables what it is is like roast all these vegetables a very high temperature and they get really sweet and delicious and then mix them with orzo which is a rice shaped pasta lemon vinaigrette feta fresh basil can be really delicious yellow pepper you can use anything you want to get orange peppers it's great and then the last thing is olive oil salt and pepper give it lots of flavor toss it all together and I'm going to roast this at a high temperature 425 for about 40 minutes until it's brown and crusty it's colorful it's delicious and it's good for you so now I'm going to do the final assembly on the orzo with roasted vegetables vegetables are all cooked in their crusty and brown just wonderful all the juices and it goes into the orzo which remembers the pasta that shaped like rice like I left to get all the juices and the bits of vegetables and in the bowl all the flavor next I'm going to do is make a vinaigrette which is this is a really simple lemon vinaigrette the third of a cup of lemon juice got to be fresh an equal amount of olive oil lots of salt really makes a difference in this remember the orzo doesn't have any salt in it at all so you want to make sure that it really has flavor whisk it together it's a wonderful vinaigrette for like a ruble and Parmesan or the both green salad so pour it over all the orzo and the vegetables just enough so it absorbs it it's really best to do this when the or goes hot because then it absorbs all that lemon vinaigrette and I'm going to add lots of really delicious fresh things like scallions lots of chopped scallions fresh basil leaves lots of feta he's really good said it makes a difference and toss it all together all the flavors of the basil and scallions and feta and sweet roasted vegetables and the last thing we put on toasted pignoli what I've done is heat them in the pan and a dry pan until they just browned I'm going to put them right on top fresh it's good for you
