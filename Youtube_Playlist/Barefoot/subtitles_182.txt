my friends are coming from the city with their two adorable children and I thought I'd make children's food that grown-ups would like we're gonna feel like kids in a candy store so for dinner we're having parmesan chicken broccoli with bowties ice cream sundaes and chocolate truffles truffles are easier than you think they are it's basically cream which I've got nice and hot now and lots of chocolate which I'm going to chop up really fine so I've got a half a pound of semi-sweet chocolate and a half a pound of bitter chocolate the reason why I use both of them is because I think bittersweet chocolates a little too bitter and semi-sweet chocolates a little too sweet so I combine them to get the best of both worlds so I'm just gonna chop this up really finely that's good I'm gonna put it all in a big bowl what smells good already and then I'm gonna take the hot cream that just boiled I pour it through a sieve just to make sure you know sometimes you get a little bit of a skin on the top and you don't want that to happen and then a whisk and just stir it slowly until the hot cream melts the chocolate so I'm gonna make this mixture let it sit until it gets firm and then make little balls out of it and roll it in cocoa powder and confectioner sugar so good I love when it gets really shiny and it's doing that okay that's great nice and smooth so I'm gonna put in a little bit of vanilla got a half a teaspoon a really important ingredient for chocolate is coffee I'll show you for some reason coffee really brings out the flavour in chocolate so I'm just gonna add about a tablespoon of hot brewed coffee you won't really taste it but it'll make a huge difference in how the chocolate tastes when I can smell it when the hot coffee hits the chocolate it smells so good great that's perfect this is just gonna sit here for about an hour until it gets nice and firm in the meantime I'm gonna shopping for more sweets for my party years ago the African test I started filling these bags with candy I thought the kids would like them you and I know who's eating them on their way home so for my party I think that'd be great toppings for ice cream and gift bag for people on the way home lots of colors lots of flavors it's gonna be really fun ice-cream sundaes I'd like to do a few unusual flavors like raspberry sounds so delicious but I still need the classics chocolate and vanilla I have kids coming for dinner and we know what finicky eaters they can be so I thought I would make broccoli but I'm gonna put in bowtie pasta so they'll eat it so I'm going to start with a little bit of butter and olive oil to make the sauce the butter is for the flavor and the olive oil is because it has a higher burning temperature this is gonna be so good with Parmesan chicken so I'm gonna add chopped garlic and then I'm gonna make a lemon and garlic sauce for it and then at the end throw in Parmesan cheese and pignoli so it's got lots of flavor okay right into the pan with the garlic meanwhile I'm gonna zest it lemon this is a great zester because it actually has strips of lemon zest rather than a grater and that way the lemon zest gets cooked into the sauce and you can actually even see it in the dish which I like if it's going to taste like lemon I think it should look like lemons and I do it right over the pan so I get the oil you can see the oil from the lemon right into the sauce just I take the garlic for a minute until it's cooked so now I want the juice in it it's a really simple dish and it uses a really fresh ingredients so it's actually even good for you okay a few tablespoons of fresh lemon juice and the sauce is ready oh it smells garlicky and lemony it's gonna be wonderful so I've got bowtie pasta all cooked and I blanched some broccoli for a few minutes until it was like nice and green and then pour over the sauce right onto it just want to make sure I get all of it two teaspoons of salt about a half a teaspoon of pepper looks good and then when I had two more things grated Parmesan cheese that I graded and left in the fridge and the last thing is from your only nuts I sauteed something you always until they're just sort of brown and nutty they just taste so much better when they're a little browned and crisp right on the top just toss it all together mmm mister which is fresh from the lemon juice and it has the spiciness of the parmesan this gonna be really good for my party my friends are coming soon and I just want to finish the truck of truffles before they get here so this is a mixture of chocolate and cream perfect with a little vanilla and coffee to give it lots of flavor so to scoop these out most people use two spoons but I find a melon baller really works perfectly well just dip it in really hot water and then it'll come out perfectly great now comes the really messy part I'm going to dip some of them in powdered sugar just like that and some of them in cocoa powder these are so good they're pretty easy to make the named truffles really comes from a savory thing it's like the mushrooms that are dug up with pigs but these chocolate truffles supposed to be really rough like those mushrooms that are dug up so you don't want perfect little boss you don't want to sort of messy little things that are incredibly delicious inside what they should do is just melt in your mouth and these really will before I do the powdered sugar but it wash my hands otherwise all the mess so my party today is kids in the candy store I just thought it'd be really fun to have children's food that even grown-ups love so my friends are bringing their children we're absolutely adorable and we're going to have Parmesan chicken and broccoli with bow ties and ice cream sundaes we can all act like children oh I think my friends are here perfect timing I'm so glad to know you I got my hands in powdered sugar from the truffles nobody wants which I touch it with okay a little cooking so what would you guys like to do we go to the beach yeah what that sounds like that's it for today okay Kim I want to see what's in that bag I look really excited people see you later all right bye okay great first what's this well we have licorice our life rabbits are cool let's tie the napkin to a great idea of fabulous your bubble gum tree a little bit of bubble gum you know my girls they love bubble gum and when I have some really terrific Patties oh they're so cool those fun yeah I'm definitely wearing a hat okay candy dots oh great bring back all the memories eat something the best and some chocolate lots of chocolate coins fantastic how do ass lollipops integrate our welcome I love them so why don't I set the table and surprise you with the other goodies in event ask Iran okay I'm gonna finish dinner okay see ya but my friend Kim is the perfect person to do the table she runs EA T gifts which is the most incredible children's store in the city and she's bought wonderful goodies for everybody fruit juice shapes it's a really easy way to get fruit to us and for your kids what it is is a combination of really good juice and gelatin and the kids can pick it up in their hands it's really fun so I have four cups of fruit juice I'm using grape juice cuz kids love Concord grape juice three cups into the pan which I'm going to heat up and one cup into the bowl and then mix in four packages of gelatin I like this recipe two ingredients anybody can do it so I'm going to dissolve the gelatin in the fruit juice just like that and then pour the hot juice in and the good thing is you can do it with all different kinds of juices I like to use the clear juices okay mmm love the smell of Concord grape juice so we get this nice and hot doesn't have to be totally hot but just had enough to dissolve the gelatin yeah it's definitely ready there's a pour this in mix it up we pour it into the pan let it set then I'm going to cut out of shape to the kids they'll love them I'm having a party my friend Kim is doing the table setting isn't that nice her family's the beach and I'm doing the cooking so I'm gonna make Parmesan chicken which i think is great for kids and for adults Tamas on chicken to something my mother used to make for us as kids and I thought it'd be really fun to make my party it's boneless chicken breast I'm gonna cut each one into four long strips now I'm gonna do a coating so they have three things that we addictive chicken it and the first one is a cup of flour which are in the season with a teaspoon of salt and a half a teaspoon of pepper and just mix that up together so that's seasoned flour the second thing is two eggs a tablespoon of water just gonna mix those together and the third dish is a cup of seasoned breadcrumbs and you can just buy them already seasoned they're really very good about a cup and a half a cup of freshly grated Parmesan cheese which I keep in their fridge I'm just gonna mix those together well I can already smell the parmesan and the herbs wonderful okay and then I'm just gonna take these little chicken tenders and roll them roll whole bunch of them in flour and then dust them off there's a little bit of a process but it really means that the coating sticks to the chicken and make sure you get egg on all the parts and then move messy into the bread crumb and parmesan mixture coat the whole thing okay so now I'm going to saute them so as I usually do I'm going to mix oil and butter two tablespoons of butter and two tablespoons of oil melt these together you do this in a big pan but if you know of such a big pan you can always do it into smaller ones I'm gonna get this nice and hot and then saute the chicken and I'm gonna serve it with broccoli and bowties and for dessert what kid doesn't like ice cream sundaes and truffles so good and then go to chicken strips these are going to saute for about three to five minutes until they're really beautifully browned on the outside and still tender on the inside first I'm gonna go wash my hands okay ready to turn these guys throw they're nicely browned we'll be careful not to overcook because chicken can get really tough if it's overcooked gets tough and dry so these look great they smell spicy to the parmesan and smell the herbs and they're still really tender inside and if they start to stick a little bit just add more butter and oil to the pan I can keep these warm in the oven at 200 degrees for about fifteen to thirty minutes and they'll still be really tender and crisp on the outside these are gonna be so good for the stick on it everybody's on have a really good time so I thought it'd be find out the kids eat their juice so making fruit juice shapes it's grape juice and gelatin and I'm just gonna dunk this pan in hot water to loosen it a little bit that should do it okay turn it out on this plate and then cut out shapes and it worked okay I've got all kinds of you can cut it out in any shapes but I'm gonna do hearts and circles not great I love the weight jiggles and some rounds love to have circles that have fluted edges on them and some little hearts and it's fun when the grown-ups get to play - you make this all kinds of juices but I like the clear ones best like white grape juice or cranberry juice and they end up with a sort of jewel like colors which is great cuz you can also make it with orange juice if you want to and since these really are delicious there's one for me too one last thing to do with the parmesan chicken that smells great so I want to make chicken on a stick sometimes I use skewers but I think they're a little pointy for young kids so I'm going to use one of these so Oh Todd each piece of chicken is gonna go on a stick and it's gonna be like an ice cream pop it's great it's fun for the kids but I have to tell you it's really fun for the adults too oh I hear children hi you guys are fun at the beach what you do you run around a lot make a lot of noise yeah oh good it was beautiful - I'm making parmesan chicken on a stick does that look like fun to eat no good I can't wait either okay girls let's go let's it aren't to finish I'll see you in a second are they adorable
