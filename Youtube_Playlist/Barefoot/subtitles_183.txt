[Music] edweena van gaal was the most wonderful garden designer not only did she design my garden but I feel really lucky to count her as one of my dear friends so today edweena's bringing me a big box with all kinds of fresh herbs in it and I thought I would return the favor by making her a box with a wonderful dinner on the menu furred weena is a lobster cobb salad bursting with flavors packed into a roll with the delicious brown rice tomato and basil salad that's both hearty and healthy and for dessert an individual orange Chocolate Chunk cake that's been soaked and our sir and drizzled with chocolate ganache so I'd better start cooking because I've got a mini feast to prepare [Music] I'd love to take a recipe that I know really well like a pound cake and do lots of variations and so what I'm gonna do for Edwina is I'm gonna make an orange Chocolate Chunk cake which is basically a pound cake with lots of orange flavor and chocolate chunks through it how good does that sound so the first thing I'm doing is dusting two oranges and the smell is amazing I just love the combination of chocolate and orange I think they really complement each other sort of like chocolate moves with her and Grand Marnier so what I've done is I've creamed quarter of a pound of butter and one cup of sugar until it's light and fluffy for about five minutes and then I'm gonna add some things to eggs one at a time until they're mixed in and they aren't just lots of arms okay now I'm gonna do the dry ingredients one and a half cups of flour and I stick them all together make sure they're really well combined and a half bacon it's really important to be exact okay then according to teaspoon of baking powder and make sure it's fresh so it rises properly go to the chick from the baking soda [Applause] according to police all let me sip this together it's not so good I can tell the orange zest and just mix it lightly with your hand so it's well mixed okay that's the dry mixture I'm going to make the wet mixture so the first thing I need is a quarter of a cup of fresh orange juice he's elected to sir if it's more than one on but it's a great tool if you only have a small amount to do okay that should do that right perfect okay now I need three ounces of buttermilk and actually always make sure you mix up the buttermilk because it sometimes settles down a little bit so it's relaxes it better month okay it's gonna look curdled don't be nervous about it and then one teaspoon of vanilla okay so that's the wet mixture so what I'm going to do is add the wet mix turn the dry mixture ultimately to the butter mixture and I'll end up with a really moist like cake this looks great it's really well whipped and everything's well incorporated so I'm going to add about a third of this mixture this is one you don't want to over beat it otherwise you'll end it with bread not cake let's do it slowly with your hand and then at the wet mixture a lot of people say they can't fake but it's really a matter of just being precise and then the dry so I'm going to put half of this in and leave a little at the end and then the wet mixture and then the dry mixture perfect and now for the reason why we're making this cake chocolate sauce we need one cup of chocolate chunks you can sometimes buy chocolate chunks in the grocery store but I'm just gonna use good chocolate and just chop it up what I'm doing is I'm gonna chop it up and then I'm going to add a little flour so they don't sink to the bottom of the cake just like that it really simple [Music] just a little dusting of flour to keep them from sinking to the bottom and now I'm just gonna fold them right in so usually I make this in a large bundt cake which is beautiful but I thought it'd be fun to make individual ones like the individual things kind of like cupcakes anybody get seven our own cake and they don't have to share at the end of the day well like children want our own so follow these chocolate chunks right in [Music] it was always such an inspiration for me and I was so touched when she said she wanted bring me an herb box so I thought well I'll just return the favor and send her back with good food so I'll show you what I've discovered recently it's amazing he's incredible little and they look I don't know what they are it's a silly sort of flexible silicone baking form looks like something with an acident but I'm sure they didn't they're wonderful for baking so these are gonna be simply little cakes and when you just flip them out they come out of the pan really easily there's no squeeze in [Music] and bake these 350 degrees for about 30 minutes and then I'm gonna soak it in a little bit of an orange syrup and put an orange glaze on it I think it is gonna be really pleased with them at least I hope so I'm painting up these two boxes one for me and one for ina and I'm doing this great blue for IANA because it reminds me of her and I call it Greek shuttered blue it's such a happy color [Music] so the chocolate orange chunk takes it cooled a little bit now sometimes I come out a little lopsided and I might straighten it out if it was a formal event but since it's a really earthy want I like the way they look now so there are three stages you can do them all in advance first the cakes next I'm gonna make an orange syrup that's gonna infuse them the flavor and then later I'm going to drizzle them with a little bit of chocolate ganache it sounds good doesn't it so first to make the syrup glaze I need a quarter of a cup of fresh orange juice okay I'm just gonna heat this up the quarter of a cup of sugar doesn't really have to cook I just want to heat it up so the sugar melts and it becomes very clear syrup so bring to a boil turn it off and it's done I'm just gonna spoon it over the cakes do it slowly and when the cakes are a little bit warm they absorb the syrup even better and then next I'm gonna make a chocolate ganache which is chocolate and cream that I'm gonna drizzle over the outside and I'm gonna make a brown rice tomato and basil salad for Audrina so next I'm gonna make chocolate ganache for the orange Chocolate Chunk cakes so I need have to kind of semi-sweet chocolate chips this bag is 12 ounces so it's got approximately what half a pound is writing can be people over simmering water and then I need 1/2 a cup of heavy cream don't worry about measuring too exactly if it's too thin you can add another few chocolate chips as if too thick you can just add some more cream and then one teaspoon of instant coffee powder or espresso whichever I just think coffee really brings out the chocolate flavor you're not aware of what it is it sort of cuts the sweetness and brings it out I'm just going to let that sit over simmering water for a few minutes just until it melts and it's smooth and then I'll drizzle it over the cake okay it's ready now you know it's a little bit thick we wanted to be running that sort of guapi so I'm gonna add another drop of heavy cream carefully I don't want to add too much do it just mix it in turn off the heat yes see that make the difference now it's running perfect I'm just going to drizzle it over the cakes it's gonna drizzle it over there just maybe like a tablespoon on the top and let it just drizzle down the side that looks good if you want to you can also just sort of drizzle it this way whichever you like I know what she likes and rosemary and a little something exotic some lemongrass so they don't look like much now but that's part of the fun of it that they're going to grow a lot so I decided to make brown rice of tomatoes and basil for agreement she's sort of a grown-up hippie and she does like a nice organic thing so I just thought it'd be perfectly appropriate for her so nervous something decadent for dessert and make something good for her how's the salad this is a really good salad and the best part is that the brown rice gives it a really nutty flavor and then I'm gonna add lots of tomatoes and fresh basil a nice vinaigrette so I'm just gonna cut up about a pound of tomatoes he's a good Israeli tomatoes on the vine so now I'm gonna make the vinaigrette I need a quarter of a cup of good champagne or white wine vinegar you know it's easy to make a vinaigrette right in the mixing Cup two teaspoons of sugar really makes the tomatoes sweeter tablespoon of good olive oil teaspoon of salt and a pinch of black pepper remember you want the vinaigrette to be really flavorful so that I've cooked the brown rice took about 45 minutes so just pour the vinaigrette over and when it's warm it really absorbs the vinaigrette now that looks gorgeous I'm gonna toss it around I can smell on the vinaigrette hits the warm rice I can really smell it champagne vinegar all the flavors lots of tomatoes clean hams even the tomato juice is absorbed by the rice and then lots of fresh basil maybe about a cup of fresh basil leaves okay so can either julienne this or chop this I think I'll just chop it up it's great to make this in advance because all the flavors really get into the rice the vinaigrette lets absorb right into the middle of it and the basil gets into it and the tomato juice just tastes better and better and there's nothing that can spoil so considerably temperature okay lots of chopped basil right into the salad I'm gonna pack some pretty way that the Chinese takeout the dinner it's a really handy containers throw the Chinese takeout and ass up if I can have some they're always really nice and next I'm gonna make a lobster cops out for my favorite salads and the servant a role I think is gonna be really happy lobster Cobb salad I think I've made this more than anything else in all of my books it's really good it's really easy to make and you can assemble all the ingredients in advance there's all different kinds of vegetables avocados tomatoes and lobster and a delicious lemon vinaigrette blue cheese bacon it's really good and I think Ford we know what I'm going to do is put it into world so to be sandwich lobster Cobb salad sandwich the best avocados are Hass avocados from California it's not the bright green ones it's these ugly brown ones you can't smell it and you don't want to press it because you'll bruise it but you can tell when it's ripe when it's just this really brown color these are gorgeous big dose you've got a little fresh lemon juice with stuff the avocado from turning brown that's the trick with guacamole - fresh lemon juice always keeps the other color nice and green so toss it around just make sure all the cut surfaces are covered with lemon juice okay that's one ingredient next thing is Lobster I actually cheat and get it cooked in the seaters this is gorgeous cooked lobster I'm just going to dice it up so it's easy to eat what I have is one and a half pounds of cooked lobster meat it's about 2 1 and a half pound lobsters I'm cutting it up and I'd say the large bite-size pieces no one at all finely minced but you also want to be in let me eat it with a fork no nice ok that's it for the lobster next thing you can start Tomatoes one pint just kind of cut them in half if they're big you can use grape tomatoes which of those delicious tomato shaped like grapes or cherry tomatoes they can be read into the yellow I'm just gonna say anything lobster and tomato sauce or salt and pepper [Music] cop salad really is usually made with chicken this is a very luxurious palm of cobb salad but since the green has gone to all the trouble of making herb boxes for me I wanted to do something special from her [Music] this does it justice done and let's just make sure we've made the right choice the chartreuse or the blue definitely the blue that's perfect for ina okay now for fresh lemon vinaigrette for the lobster cobb salad gotta have fresh lemon so I need a quarter of a cup of fresh lemon juice [Applause] that's about one lemon [Applause] [Music] perfect I usually make the vinaigrette right in the measuring container you need 1/3 of a cup of olive oil I don't have tablespoon of Dijon mustard that's a better one okay where's the teaspoon of salt 1/2 teaspoon of pepper and just whisk it up actually love this little whisk that's amazing how often I use it just for a little vinaigrette measuring cup it's a really flavorful vinaigrette lots of mustard and lemon juice so I'm going to pour a lot of it over the lobster and tomatoes - save some for later because I've got more ingredients to put in just toss it all together then we're gonna add some more great ingredients gonna pack up the box for everyone [Music] okay so the next step in the lobster Cobb salad got lobster tomatoes nice lemon vinaigrette avocados that have been diced with lemon juice to keep them nice and bright green the next thing is bacon which I actually baked on a baking rack it's a really easy way to cook bacon just until it's nice and crisp and then I'm just going to cut it in chunks well you can just crumble it with your hands put right on top then you cheese you can use Stilton which I love but if you can't find still any kind of a crumbly bleu cheese it's really nice just adds a really great flavor to the lobster Cobb salad this is really composed salad and I love things like that now okay so blue cheese I'm gonna toss it all together make sure all these flavors are blended well the last thing I found is really good as a ruler it's a really peppery leaf and it really gives it a wonderful fresh kind of flavor it was tossed around with a vinaigrette so since lobster rolls are sort of at least Hampton thing and they're always served in like a hot dog bun I thought wouldn't it be fun to do lobster Cobb selling in a roll so that's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna fill this you can obviously serve it just as a salad but I think it's fun to have a special treat where everything's individual like a kid at a birthday party having his own cupcake so that's one and the second one since its dinner I'm gonna make two I always say this is a mother unless out when your mother-in-law comes make it four she'll love it I love you okay I'm gonna wrap them up get them both in one piece of parchment paper perfect you even put into boxford we know it's got a bakery box from bakery store and I'm gonna line it with parchment paper so first the brown rice of tomatoes and basil and then the table salads sandwiches and the last thing is orange Chocolate Chunk cake final moment of decadence so that's a really special dinner for dueña in a box [Music] what are these babies this is the little bay tree yeah wow it's fantastic oh my god sage and lemongrass I never use lemongrass bye bye I love it it takes that's really big the blue is for you because you always been blue thank you and since you bring me herbs in the Box I made you dinner in the box with your trails afraid side
