[Music] every Friday night my husband Jeffrey drives three and a half hours to come home for the weekend and I always make him a roast chicken I'm going to surprise him tonight with a traditional Jewish dinner it's really easy to make and the house is going to smell just wonderful so here's my plan I make a traditional chopped liver appetizer but my wait cook with a little Madeira wine and a brisket pot roast simmered in tomato sauce piled high with carrots and onions quickly sauteed spinach with lots of garlic then melt-in-your-mouth regular cookies with cinnamon sugar apricot jam and raisins and nuts my only problem now is he's going to want this meal every Friday night it's Friday Geoffrey's coming home tonight just what is expecting yet another roast chicken I always like to shake it up a little bit so I'm making an old-fashioned Jewish dinner with brisket carrots onions to be really good well that's a big piece of meat for two people but it's like making beef stew it lasts forever and you can reheat it it's a big risk it for do people and I'll show you how easy it is I'm gonna make a rub for the top two tablespoons of salt I know it seems like a lot of salt but it's a big piece of brisket one tablespoon of garlic chopped up garlic two teaspoons of dried oregano and two teaspoons of freshly ground pepper smoosh that all together and then rub it on top of the brisket okay that's appropriately smushed together I'm just gonna sprinkle it on the top and then rub it in briskets a great cut of stewing me to buy when you go to the store make sure you don't buy corned beef brisket which is the same cut but it's already been processed with spices and salt okay that's done I'm gonna put on a pound of carrots just chop them up in chunks it's gonna stew along with the beef I'll be really good these are big cats two pound of carrots can be anything from two big carrots to five small ones okay and then eight stalks of celery just cut off the ends a little bit the brown ends and then just cut it in chunks remember this goes to four three and a half hours so okay and onions I've got six onions sliced all over the top this already looks like it has a lot of flavor doesn't it and some bay leaves for flavor these are beautiful bay leaves six how's that okay and then I'm going to pour good tomato juice all over the top of it just enough to come up about three-quarters of the way up the beef so just pour right on top and this is going to make the sauce after it cooks okay now we're just going to cover it and bake it so I'm going to cover it with aluminum foil but first because I don't want the foil to touch the tomato juice it reacts really badly I'll either cover it with plastic wrap or parchment paper [Music] into the oven 350 degrees for about three and half hours until it's fork-tender so that was pretty fast for dinner that could feed probably ten people but for tonight is just Jeffrey [Music] so tonight instead of a big dessert I thought maybe with coffee I'd make little cookies called rugelach they're made with cream cheese dough and really good vanilla so the first thing I'm going to do is make the dough and the reason why it's so delicious is 1/2 pound of cream cheese is the first ingredient so make the mixer half a pound of butter [Music] and court up a cup of sugar part of a teaspoon of salt and one teaspoon of vanilla [Music] two cups of flour [Music] this is wonderful - to cut measure just put it in slowly as it gets incorporated [Music] okay once the flowers in don't overmix it that's I end up with really tough pastry so this looks good [Music] dump the dough out make sure it's well mixed [Music] the keys to really light and flaky dough is to make sure it's well chilled before you roll it out and also before you bake so just pick a ball out of it it's good and sticky and because it's just two of us I'm gonna cut it up in quarters freeze three quarters of it and just make cookies out of a quarter for us and then I'll have pastry dough whenever I want to make cookies usually I put this in plastic wrap but little plastic bags work just as well [Music] okay one for the fridge free for the freezer and while it's chilling I'm gonna make a nice chopped liver [Music] well you can't have an old-fashioned Jewish meal without a little chopped liver a little massa selling to make chopped liver for Jeffrey for anybody who doesn't like chopped liver just think of it as like French pate it's really the same kind of thing so I've done this in two batches I have two pounds of chicken livers and I'm gonna saute them a little bit of chicken fat has to be chicken fat for chopped liver very quickly until they're just barely done you want them a little pink inside if chicken livers are overcooked they can be really dry with it okay these guys are done let's take them out as they're done okay now lots of onions more chicken fat I'm gonna put in onions and just saute them until they're caramelized and browned and just so sweet I've actually asked Jeffrey to run an errand and wonder what he's gonna come back with well I asked me to bring home some spinach and that might sound simple but I have screwed it up before I remember the time she asked me to bring back the cantaloupe and I brought back another kind of melon I thought it was a cantaloupe but it it was not a success so I approached this with a little apprehension oh this looks like a spinach this must be curly spinach and this must be baby spinach now get a bit of each just to play it safe all right you've got curly and you have baby okay great success yes so I'm gonna finish the chopped liver before Jeffrey gets back from his errand this is an unusual ingredient my chopped liver is Madeira it's a fortified dessert wine and it's a little sweet I had a third of a cup deglazes the pan and gets all those scrapings out I'm just gonna pour this right into the chicken livers this is a mixture that I'm gonna chop up later I may be chicken liver that anything tastes good with all those onions on it okay the next thing is for hard cooked eggs just gonna chop them up just roughly [Music] now quarter of a cup of chopped parsley it smells good rough chop okay two teaspoons of fresh thyme - two teaspoons of salt it's appropriate of kosher salt for this one teaspoon of pepper and I ask a pinch of cayenne to give it a little bit of heat and I'm gonna mix this in the food processor with more of the chicken fat just enough to make it the right consistency I'm going to chop it roughly you don't want to pureed that's pretty good I'm gonna chill it and then I'm gonna taste it when it's all chilled for seasoning make sure it has enough salt pepper this isn't Jeffrey's ordinary Friday night dinner [Music] I'm gonna chill it and it'll be ready for dinner tonight with a little matzo [Applause] so I think the briskets ready let's just check it out this is enough for two people for dinner [Music] brisket vegetables it's a whole meal in one check and make sure the meats done perfect should be fork tender but not like falling apart liked it take the meat out let it rest for a little bit and then I'm gonna boil the sauce down so it gets thickened okay cover this with foil I'm just going to turn the flame on yes so let's go to simmer away for about 30 minutes and now I'm going to finish the rug lock which that wonderful little cookie time to break the cookies so the rug Allah is a cream cheese dough and it's wrapped around a filling cinnamon sugar walnuts and raisins so walk up a wall ma chopped up six tablespoons of granulated sugar quarter cup of brown sugar half a teaspoon of good cinnamon [Music] 3/4 cup of raisins just mix that all together it smells so good how can that be bad it's the cream cheese dough that we refrigerated earlier it's nice and firm just want to roll this out to a 9 inch circle flour on my quatre I mean you're only something in a circle just go from the center to the outside don't roll back and forth I make a nice circle and try not to touch it so it doesn't get warm the colder it is the better the cookies will be the more flaky the dough is I'm going to spread it apricot jam I pureed it in the food processor so it's really fine it's really beautiful this cookie actually is great made with lots of different feelings whereas bear jams wonderful and sometimes it's even done in chocolate but I really like the traditional Africa so just a very thin layer of jam don't neglect the edges okay and now just mix up the filling a nice even
