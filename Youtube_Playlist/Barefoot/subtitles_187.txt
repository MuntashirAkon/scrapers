[Music] my friend Roberts Dylan's birthday what do you get a guy who has everything so I thought I'd cook my a really special birthday dinner he'll invite the guests and then all he has to do is sit back and have fun who wouldn't want that first birthday I'm making a juicy rack of lamb with garlic and parsley creamy potato fennel Greta sautéed carrots and for dessert a heart-shaped Kurla creme with the fresh raspberry and Bret linear sauce and the best thing about this present is there nothing to return to the store so I was trying to figure out what would be a nice birthday dessert for Robert and I have to say at some point nobody needs to have candles on a birthday cake so I thought well maybe something heart-shaped and I thought about a Corolla creme which is a heart-shaped cream dessert and it's absolutely delicious so that's what we're making I'm gonna serve it with a raspberry sauce so I'm gonna start with 12 ounces of room-temperature cream cheese it's not the whipped cream cheese it's regular cream cheese very important detail this dessert actually comes from my friend on a pump writes the loaves and fishes cookbook she made it for us for dessert once we not only ate our desserts we like diving into the serving platter it wasn't pretty it was so good one and a quarter cups of confectioner's sugar it's one time that get it all over ourselves in another quarter I'm just gonna mix those up just the mexican bottom you don't want to whip it okay it's really important that it's room temperature cream cheese otherwise it'll never work leave it out for hours so that's the beater and I'm going to switch to a whisk attachment that's the whisk and if you have the handheld mixer that one beater will do the job of both and now I'm gonna add two and a half cups of cold heavy cream it has to be cold otherwise it won't whip just a most speed start pouring it in this is gonna whip like whipped cream is can get very light and fluffy and just a few flavorings two teaspoons of vanilla vanilla extract [Music] cordobas piece for the lemon zest just a little bit if you want to be really decadent the season of vanilla bean and not only tastes great but it also then looks like it's vanilla the spirit that seeds it out you look great me this curl like friend so now I'm just gonna whip it until it's thick like whipped cream that should do it okay so now the next step is to put it in the mold and this is what a curl a creme mold is I'm going to pour it into this and the liquid is going to drain out and what's gonna be left is something really thick and absolutely delicious and I'm gonna put it on a plate because you wanted to drain on the plate not into your refrigerator and I'm gonna line the mold with cheesecloth you can buy it in the hardware store you can really use paper towels but I prefer cheesecloth because it'll make a nice design on the outside of the car la creme mold yeah pour this into the mold that doesn't that look gorgeous now I'm gonna pull the sides of this up and cover it and I'm gonna refrigerate it and overnight some of the liquid from the cheese is going to come out and it's gonna get really thick almost like a cheese itself tomorrow I'm gonna start with fresh raspberry sauce it was back and now I'm getting a good night's sleep because I have a lot to do for Roberts party teddy bear town is a really classic French dish but I thought I'd turn up the volume and make it a fennel it has a really sort of anise flavor I love it this is a great utensil to have it's a mandolin it's been really sharp so be very careful but it's so much better than using a knife because the slices can be absolutely regular so I've 2 pounds of potatoes but first I have some onions and fennel cooking together it's two small heads of fennel or one big one if you have one big one 1 onion 2 tablespoons of olive oil and 1 tablespoon of butter and I've cooked them for about 15 minutes until they're really nicely softened okay so now I'm just going to combine everything big ball one of the best things about this dish is you can make it in advance which is what I'm gonna do refrigerate it and then bake it off just before the party I'm gonna take it to Robert's house so it's 2 pounds of russet potatoes peeled and sliced oops I get them all on the bowl cook fennel and onions it's so good and then 2 cups of cream and two cups of grated Gruyere cheese okay teaspoon of salt 1/2 teaspoon of pepper toss it all together it doesn't look bad so far okay I'm just gonna put it in a greased baking dish anything you have oval dish square dish whatever you have so when this bakes the starch and the potatoes and the cheese are gonna make the cream set like a custard this is a hands job clean hands just press it all down in the dish into the fridge and then I'm gonna bake it off at Roberts house and it's gonna be creamy and delicious and he's so good with the garlic and parsley of the rack of lamb parsley on which I'm going to do that [Music] great need lots of parsley preparer say odd I need parsley and garlic but I actually add some lemon zest I'm gonna chop it all up with breadcrumbs and pack it on a rack of lamb and it's gonna be so and flowers run your knife right along the edge doesn't have to be perfect Presley's always used for decoration but the truth is it's got great flavor it's never out of season always available and very inexpensive it doesn't have to be perfect it's all going in the food processor okay two cups of fresh chopped parsley right in with a steel blade three cloves of garlic it's about a tablespoon and half a stick of butter melted and cooled I'm just gonna chop it up quickly okay two more ingredients the zest of two lemons my favorite zester grass just get the outside of the lemon not the white part that's what has the flavor and oil just think how good this is gonna be with the lamb it's gonna really flavor the meat parsley garlic lemon zest mm-hmm it's gonna be a real birthday dinner okay zest of two lemons okay one cup of fresh breadcrumbs I'm just gonna pulse it for a second to combine them okay so this is gonna go in the lamb it's gonna flavor it incredibly well I'm just gonna put it in the container and so I'm ready I put Robert in charge of martinis I hope you're not drinking to them and still has to be the hose [Music] I know there's nothing to chance she even left me the directions for the martinis two cups of fresh pineapple juice two and a half cups of vodka 1/4 of a cup of the road 2 teaspoons of Chambord and that's it even I can't get this wrong so bet you think French sauces are really hard to make watch this one raspberry sauce so easy so I'm gonna start with 1/2 a cup of sugar 1/4 of a cup of water and 1/2 the punch of fresh raspberries this raspberry sauce is gonna be amazing with the Kurla creme it's the creme is so creamy and the raspberry sauce it's both sweet but it's also tart because of the raspberries so I'm just gonna heat this through for about 4 minutes till all the juices from the raspberries come out and next I need raspberry jam and Grand Marnier raspberry jam Grand Marnier ready to go look like the raspberries are just done perfect well the gorgeous juice wonderful okay so I'm gonna pour this into the food processor I'll play it in the food processor not on me and watch this two more ingredients a cup of raspberry jam I prefer c-list but it doesn't whichever you like is fine the cup is just just this jar two tablespoons of Grand Marnier liqueur which is orange liqueur but if you have firm boss which is raspberry liqueur it's also delicious puree it [Applause] and that's raspberry sauce [Music] and now not McRoberts [Music] flowers my garden and I've got the main course terrific okay until you clear the decks all right so let me tell you what we have for dinner we have to find piercing on yeah I'm clean garlic little lemon zest sautéed carrots and potatoes fennel fresh ham mmm I think the ovens going down yesterday sure about 400 degrees for about an hour an hour and 15 minutes I think that's gonna be pretty good and dessert the surprise dessert all right I'm gonna get to work okay great is it what can I do okay sure I'll get the house ready and get myself ready so clear all this off it's fun cooking in somebody else's kitchen change up menu I've got three racks each rack is really perfect for about two people with leftovers and actually ask the butcher to French this which means he took all the extra meat off the bones it's much more elegant so just put them on the pan with the fat side up just like that maybe a little olive oil salt and pepper so just drizzle a little bit of olive oil on the top just enough so it Browns nicely sprinkle it with salt and pepper lamb is actually really easy to cook but it's a little expensive so it's a great birthday dinner okay so the first part is I'm going to roast this at 450 degrees for 10 minutes and then later I'm going to take it out and put the parsley and garlic and breadcrumbs and lemon zest it's gonna be so delicious to the middle of the dish gorgeous fresh raspberry sauce just pour it around I'm gonna serve a little more on the side but just for now just smush it around and if she'd get a little bit on the platter and just wipe it off okay and then fresh raspberries right on top I'm just gonna leave this in the fridge and it's all ready to serve for Roberts birthday dessert so it's ten minutes and the records lamb is ready to come out for its and parsley oh it's starting to brown they look just great and now I'm gonna put the pair say out on parsley garlic bread crumbs and lemon zest just press it on the top you can smell it already just getting it on the hot lamb gorgeous does that look great I love when something looks good and tastes good okay just a little more in the first one and back in the oven for another 15 minutes Wow that's gonna be great all okay you guys have a good time one last thing to do to get ready so take carrots so I've got a little bit of water in here salt and pepper and I got the cat's already at home it's always a good idea anyway do them in advance just put them in here just toss them around so I get the seasoning on them okay snow cover them for seven minutes cook really nice and in there and then I think they need a little bit of butter at the end so I think that grant town should be done not half bad then the lack of land should be perfectly cooked now ah that's rack of lamb per se alive and still coverage people the juices in so this is the trick about the carrots as in seven minutes all the waters evaporated and they're perfectly cooked I'm staying a little bit of butter to it mix it in and they're done okay that's done we're just gonna keep them on with the lid up Wow I don't think Roberts going to be disappointed I'm gonna carve it up it's perfectly cooked in pink okay that's going all right we're almost ready bring the dish does it smell good okay rack of lamb karin-sama but it's gonna be disappointed do you know I don't think okay excellent it's little parsley the carrots and then okay you in charge of this absolutely beautiful I'll be right behind you at the potato Greta so this potato fennel gratin and we have rack of lamb sautéed carrots and potatoes fennel great time [Music] so who's that for birthday dessert I'm surprised love dessert you're the right guy at a certain point a boy doesn't eat birthday candles on the cake should i sir would you rather just look at it so it's cheese and cream and lemon and vanilla and raspberry sauce happy birthday Robert [Music]
