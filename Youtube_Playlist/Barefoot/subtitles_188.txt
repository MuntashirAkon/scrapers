I first met I know Garten about ten years ago while I was shopping in the Barefoot Contessa her mouth-watering specialty food store on the eastern end of Long Island ina and I discovered that we shared many interests cooking gardening and of course entertaining and Ines recently published book the Barefoot Contessa cookbook she shares her very delicious recipes and practical and yet casual approach to entertaining and I'm so glad to finally have you here as this studio I love the book as you know I said I wrote the foreword is excellent for you've done so many different kinds of entertaining menus but this one just appealed to me so much the clambake and pot it's actually really fun to do and it's incredibly easy so kitchen clambake I'll do anything you tell me I do want you to start reason why I did a clambake in the kitchen is because after years of doing clam bakes outside when it guaranteed it's going to be the hottest day of the year the rainiest day of the interest or the success you can hear everything I guess and everything including the food I thought well why not just do it inside so that's what we're going to do today often is scrubbing the muscle okay fantastic so the first thing that I do is I put 3 cups of yellow onions in the pot well 1/4 of a cup of olive oil and 2 cups of leeks I like to just dice the white part of the leek and you know you have to get them nice and clean from the sand so that's going to saute in here into the onions and leeks are a little bit browned about 15 minutes and meanwhile what we can do is clean all the mussels don't take that little beard off yeah just make sure it's pretty way and yeah now that oh here's one more little beard yeah the little beard okay sounds like a must hold off and either pretty nice usually pretty clean when they come from the success that's red or just rinse when you drop them a little bit with a brush here's a little um nail brushing wooden nail brush which oh sorry now this what we did with it with these is we put them in water and I put some cornmeal in drink the water and the cornmeal if discord is any sand that's left so that's they've been soaking for about 30 minutes and they just rinse all the cornmeal off and that's it and these are the steamers most of these things are from the East End of Long Island where Barefoot Contessa is so it's not a knife not a kebab I love it from your favorite place already for a wiki Kara wiki and the best job on so it is ok one of the nice right great chef is already so what we do with the kielbasa is this is more than we need actually but it does not if you love cube ah so you can put more in we need about a pound and a half want to cut the Fetzer so what I do is like one inch pieces and on diagonal times yeah so good the onions and leeks are cooking really nicely now so then all we do is just layer everything one on top of the other in order to cook everything separately it all just goes in first I want to put the potato did these don't do position in potatoes but one and a half pounds of potatoes put that in on the bottom and then I put in a tablespoon of kosher salt and a half a tablespoon of freshly ground black pepper and then put the Cabasa and I like to put it right next to the potato so it slavery up so good so right on top and pound of steamer clams license perfect just stomp almond this is the easiest cousin colony it's almost like assembling rather than cooking and then we have two dozen Little Neck clams everything on top and two pounds of mussels and then one and a half pounds of large shrimp in the shell don't even have to shell them we do that at the table when we're in red and these are all rinsed but they're really just exactly as you get them from the store and I like to use two cups of white wine which is going to make the broth and then I like to use three one and a half pound lobsters if goes three turn the fire up a little bit to medium you cook for 15 minutes until you start to see steam coming out of the pot and then you turn the stove down a little bit and you let it simmer for 15 more minutes and it's done the potatoes are cooked the kielbasa is heated throw me my salt we have 30 minutes all together and it turns out perfectly every time well it looks Adams you're the clam I always find myself at the end with a flashlight looking into the pot because it's not only sandy and it's windy but it's dark so that just stays like that so while that's cooking we have the pot water ready for the corn how's the rest of the corn I like it you know the thing about salt is that if you season things as you go along I find they're perfectly well seasoned if you season them at the end you're just salty so I like to really season the water very well I put a lot of kosher salt in the water I think maybe you should do the tomato salad first I'll just finish fantastic tomato salad really to me is the essence of really good cooking it's about taking a great local ingredient and just enhancing it it's not about layering on lots of other flavors and just add kosher salt a little fresh basil and olive oil and that's it there's something about hands-on food where it's shared it's family style I love that I love to cook like that and serve like that what's been the response for the boat oh it's sad that I can be on my dream this is I Anna's first book and I'm sure the first of many books are you working on a second one already I thought it was going to be sort of daunting to think about writing a cookbook and I started thinking well write one chapter and see how it goes but as your natural confident is a perfectly natural extension of what you do on a daily basis at the store so we do a chiffonade of basil is that beautiful fresh basil people worry about basil leaves getting Brown and what we do with the store dunk it in water and then dry it really thoroughly in a salad spinner and then I take a baggie or some kind of a plastic bag put it just barely damp paper towel on the bottom and put the basil leaves in and that keeps them green for really four days yeah we're just ready to kind of great let's you so I'm going to stack all these basil leaves up in a little pile and then you roll them up really tight and the need to shift them do very thin julienne strips and then you really get the flavor of the first basil on the tomato just like that and I sleep really strongly in using whatever the flavor of what you're cooking is in the garnish rather than doing something that's different so I like to put a big bunch of fresh basil so when you look at it it looks like basil it smells like basil really over just lots of coarse salt got great kosher salt here lots of cores he's all right for default Leah and just drizzle some great olive oil on and that's it so the salads already the corn has about five more minutes okay five eight lambic is just let's go look at the David's starting to seem it's just starting yeah we can finish off the wine here this is not only the new book but the clambake I can't wait to taste and see if it sounds ready it's ready that's it yep so I'm going to turn it down now - what - low and it will just steam for another 15 minutes and it will be done [Music]
