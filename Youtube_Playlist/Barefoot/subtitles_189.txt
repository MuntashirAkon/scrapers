everybody always says they don't want to have dessert but I don't remember anybody turning it down in my house one of the reasons I think is because I really make traditional deserves sometimes I'll make them in a different way like this time I'm going to make apple turnovers which are apples hearts for them doing them in puff pastry so the first thing I'm going to start with is three apples so I usually pick a fairly tart apple it's granny smith apples so if you want to mix them sometimes that's nice during apple season you can get something like a McCune or a Empire Apple so three greatest examples chopped up and then right away I want to put something aesthetic on this and they don't turn brown suzumiya-san orange does he sort of grated orange zest and three tablespoons of freshly squeezed orange juice that has an overage 3 tablespoons of sugar [Music] she's a tart apple so a little food whatever sort of flour [Music] teaspoon of cinnamon agency motive limit you can toss that together and then I'm going to use dried cherries to be really good for the tartness of the cherry and the apple it's a really good balance for each other about three tablespoons okay so it's a pinch of salt I know it's surprising but it makes a big difference it's actually a good idea at this point to just taste it and just be short it tastes just like apple pie okay that's the filling and now I'm going to make the pastry at times I feel like make my own pie crust and tons I just don't this is one of those times and the good news is it doesn't make any difference it's going to be really delicious so I'm going to use this frozen puff pastry this is layers and layers of layers ago and butter and when you put it in the oven it puffs up and it's really nice and money so it's going to roll out lightly till it's 12 by 12 make sure 12 I so wanted to make to the board you want be sure it stays really cold the trim piece making pie crust doesn't it okay 12 by 12 we're there so we cut this in quarters and one for the filling in each one [Music] so a little egg wash on all the edges and then when I crimp it it will feel it show you how this works just fold it right over take a fork and just crimp the edges the way you would with the pie crust he's going to get nice and brown sort of a golden brown color and there'll be just gorgeous right on the pan like that okay consistent out best thing is I can make this early in the day and just bake them before I'm serving them so we have nice hot apple turnovers looks pretty good and a little sprinkling of sugar and a little flick to let that steam when they big okay into the fridge I'm going to bake them off on my guests are here we'll have some silk apple pie thank you and this is cream if anybody would like some before
