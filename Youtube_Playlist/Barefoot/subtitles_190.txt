[Music] so the next thing I'm going to make would be great for food table at the gallery our spinach strudels and they're called spanakopita so the first thing I have here is one bunch of scallions chopped and got a half a cup of olive oil it's okay for about five minutes until the scallions are wilted and then two ten ounce box of the frozen chopped spinach just squeeze the liquid out not so it's bone-dry just as most of liquid is out in the second box sometimes people do this in a kitchen towel but you just row in the kitchen towel so just do it with your hand okay I'm going to take this sauteed onion and olive oil I'm just going to mix the cold spinach with a warm scallions I'm adding eggs next and I want them to scramble okay three eggs just whisk it mix it lightly and then just added to the finish and scallion okay mix that in so I'm going to add 8 ounces of feta to the Greek cheese goes with spinach strudels at 8 ounces right in okay mix that in now I'm going to add some fresh dill okay that should be like 2 tablespoons okay now salt and pepper 1/2 a teaspoon of salt half a teaspoon of pepper and just mix it all up and that's the filling perfect okay so now for the phyllo dough show you what this is so it's in the freezer in the grocery store this is very very thin dough pastry showing a house in it is like paper thin that's okay yes I'm going to take one sheet or so it was melted butter just brush it all over but quickly and then the second sheet right on top going to place on top because the butter it won't slide right on top push that with melted butter so I'm piling up ten sheets of phyllo dough brushing those butter in between and sometimes with bread crumbs okay that's ten so I'm going to take a quarter of the filling and just run it right on the edge of the strudel and while I'm doing this we're going to take this damp cloth and put it right on top of the phyllo dough that I haven't used yet to keep it moist so pick up one corner and pull it right up over the filling and take the middle and if it tears don't worry about it you're just going to keep folding it rolling it up wanted to be even perfect okay some tickets true don't put it right on the baking sheet okay brush the top with butter so it gets nice and brown when it bakes and then with a sharp knife just going to score the top so after its baked it's very easy to cut I like to do diagonal slices if you'd like them any other way but anyway you like okay then I'm going to make the other four rolls and later these are going to bake at 400 degrees for about 12 minutes [Music]
