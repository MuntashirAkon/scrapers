[Music] since my husband Jeffrey is away during the week we try to make the most of our weekends one of his favorite things to do is go to the beach offseason so today I thought we'd take a nice long walk and they're bringing hot soup and then we're gonna come home for luxurious lunch with wine something tells me there's gonna be an app to follow first I'll make french onion soup with Greer croutons to take to the beach and a thermos when we get home there will be delicious goat cheese tart with garlic and herbs served with heirloom tomato and fennel salad and a lemony vinaigrette and for dessert an outrageous chocolate orange mousse and the best part is everything will be made in advance so when we get home there's nothing more difficult to do than get the sand out of our shoes okay my putting you in charge of some wine for lunch yeah this is Harry hope you know what to get yeah great so happen if I move to the beach of an hour so okay okay see them I'm gonna go finish lunch okay but isn't it creme de menthe why do I think there's gonna be a cookie involved [Music] he's so adorable so I wanted to make a dessert for Jeffrey that he'd really love and he loves chocolate mousse I don't know any guy that doesn't so I'm gonna make a chocolate mousse with orange with Grand Marnier and orange zest so first thing I want to do is melt six ounces of semi-sweet chocolate choose good chocolate just putting this in a double boiler you don't need a formal double boiler just any kind of a heat proof ball that can sit over simmering water is perfect and I'm also gonna use two ounces of bittersweet chocolate real chocolate lovers love bittersweet chocolate but I just think it's too bitter it's as sort of to me a little bit of a chalky taste so I like to combine the two so semi-sweet chocolate with a little bit of bitter it gives it a sort of a rounder flavor so that's the chocolate quarter of a cup the four water this is my favorite ingredient a quarter of a cup of Grand Marnier which is an orange liqueur because it's so much flavor mmm love the smell of that one teaspoon of good vanilla extract it's a really important flavor for chocolate and one teaspoon of grated orange zest which is gonna really heighten the orange flavor actually the orange is really interesting because the Grand Marnier makes the chocolate a little sweeter and the zest makes it a little bitter so it's kind of like adding the semi-sweet chocolate and bitter chocolate together so we'll just let this melt I'm gonna stir it a little bit then I'm gonna turn off the heat let it cool a little bit and add the orange zest that make good chocolate mousse without lots of eggs so the egg yolks go into the mixture and then the whites lighten it so I need eight eggs separated you know in France when you get chocolate mousse they very often serve a family-style they bring you a huge bowl of chocolate mousse and you're supposed to take one portion my husband Jeffrey didn't know that one time when he was very young and went to France on his own they brought him a huge bowl of chocolate mousse and he helped himself to some and then he thought I think I'll take a little more it was really good and then he had a little more and boy did he regret it the next day and I can imagine the proprietor thinking he ain't the whole thing oops I got a little egg yolk in here this is the way to get egg yolk out of egg whites take the shell and just dip it right in and you'll see the egg yolk goes right into the shell if you try and do it with a spoon it'll never work this is great chocolates melted take it off the heat I'm just gonna let that sit until it cools and then later I'll add the orange zest but first I'm gonna beat the egg yolks and sugar okay and egg yolks I have a cup of sugar so I'm gonna whip this for about four minutes until it's pale yellow and very dense and it sort of falls back on itself in a ribbon [Music] so it add some flavor to the chocolate one teaspoon of the grated orange zest and I need butter and it has to be room temperature butter this is why it's really important for the chocolate to be room temperature and the butter because they need to mix them in without the butter melted so one of them sticks of butter remember this makes a lot of chocolate mousse with these together just mix that in however you need to do it with a spoon or a whisk just important that it's a creamy texture when it's done and gifts are perfect if you lift the beater what falls back into the ball falls back on a perfect ribbon so it's really thick and light yellow perfect for the chocolate just going to turn it on low and then add the chocolate this is great when you have Jeffrey's getting on at the wine shop hope you bring somewhere bottle fine knowing Jeffrey you could come home with scotch [Music] look I'm in a high state attention here okay ina sent me for some wine and I don't know what kind you want so I'm gonna rely on you sure okay what are you guys we're having a goat cheese tart no cheese time right so what do you suggest um you know what just let's do a simple good crispy Grigio it's 12 bucks great look it looks terrific yeah the grape all the wine for the price okay are you really sure right I'm very sure okay time to finish the chocolate mousse so this is the chocolate semi-sweet chocolate and bitter chocolate orange zest and Grand Marnier and then I'm gonna lighten it with egg whites and beaten cream this is one cup of egg whites tablespoon of sugar and a little bit of salt they're stiff but not firm and dry so just whisk this in it's lighten it I think I'm gonna have a very happy hubby loves chocolate mousse okay that's Whiston and you don't want to tap this out of the bowl because anything that deflates the egg whites makes the chocolate mousse dancer don't want to do that and now just take the rest of it and just fold it in this is perfect folding technique if you take your rubber spatula and go down right down in the middle and then fold it from the side and you'll deflate the egg whites a little as possible and really mix it in just keep turning the bowl and fold it in okay a little bit of whipped cream give it two richness you can add cream to bowl that has egg whites in it but you can't do the reverse because the fat and the cream won't allow the egg whites to beat so I did the egg whites first and now the cream so 1/2 a cup of cream take a spoon of sugar just whip that until it's dead cold cream lips better perfect so I'm just gonna fold the cream in you see it really makes a difference just adds a little bit of richness which gives the chocolate much more flavor and again I'm going to fold this in right down through the middle up through the side just folding it over until it's incorporated mmm I can smell the chocolate and orange together it's actually one of my favorite combinations fill these little cups then later I'm going to decorate them with whipped cream and mandarin oranges who wouldn't want that for dessert [Music] thank you I'd love one of these cookies they look so great [Music] I promised Jeffrey a nice romantic walk on the beach before lunch today but no no no the weather report looks cold and rainy so I thought maybe I'd make some hot French onion soup and we'll go to the beach but maybe we'll leave it in the car so what I've done is I've saut√©ed that two and a half pounds of yellow onions and some butter and a bay leaf until they're really nice and caramelized and browned so now I'm gonna get to things some sherry and some kind yak but half a cup of each and what that's gonna do is it's gonna deglaze the pan from the onions but it's also gonna have lots of great flavor have a cup of sherry its medium dry sherry you don't want too sweet sherry because I don't want sweet onions and half a cup of cognac you can also use brandy cognac is brandy from the cognac region of France and just let that cook for about five minutes get all those brown crusty bits off the pan let the flavors get into the onions so why don't half cups of a dry white wine it's a Chardonnay which is really good this is just gonna cook for about 15 minutes in the meantime I think I'll make a goat cheese tart while Geoffrey's away I wonder what he's up to oh this looks great but if I have a bite of it I'm I'm gonna ruin my appetite maybe I just have a little bit just a little [Music] this is goat cheese I need an 11 ounce piece I chose the 1 and 1/2 ounces and it usually comes in this size package sometimes Co Montrachet and I get it with garlic and herbs I'm a very creamy there's a lot of flavor and it's wonderful for this tart so when do to make the filling just put 11 and a half ounces of garlic and herb goat cheese 1 cup of cream 3 eggs quarter cup of fresh basil about 1/4 teaspoon of salt eighth of a teaspoon of pepper you puree [Music] I don't affect at Art Show when I saw tape some shallots a little bit of butter in oil put that on the bottom I'm gonna pour the filling over or just in sick right so it's gonna bake 350 degrees for about 30 to 40 minutes until it begins to set the way custard would it's gonna be really good for lunch so French onion soup last thing I want to do is put in 4 cups of chicken stock and four cups of beef stock now I make chicken stock myself and I buy beef stock in a can you can do whatever you like but I think it really makes a different step good stock just mix that together it's beginning to look like French bean soup tablespoon of salt depending on how salty the stocks are half a teaspoon of pepper you can use white pepper black pepper but I really prefer black just stir it around [Music] so let that simmer away for about 20 minutes all the flavors are just gonna be wonderful and while that happens I think I'll make a tomato and fennel salad then I'll meet Jeffrey of the beach the French onion soup you have to have croutons so since we're taking it to the beach I thought I'd make them separately and we'll have these crackers so what I did is I just took slices of French bread olive oil salt and pepper and then shredded Gruyere on the top and baked it for a few minutes until it's nice and crisp and they're gonna be delicious with a French onion soup and I think the goat cheese tart smells like it's ready how pretty is that so let that cool it's best served at room temperature and now I'm gonna make a tomato offense out so with the goat cheese tart I thought it'd be really nice to have tomato and fennel salad I'm gonna make it with a lemon vinaigrette this is fennel I love it it has an anise flavor and this is the bulb of the fennel and this is the fronds and I'm gonna use both of them in the salad so just take the fronds off and reserve them for later it's kind of they look like deal and then just cut off the stalks don't really want to eat them they're very tough and you're left with the bulb so just take the bulb cut it in half cut out the little core I sometimes make this with an orange vinaigrette but today I thought the fennel and lemon would be perfectly great and I'm just gonna slice this very thinly across then one was a fairly strong flavour when it's raw when it's cooked it's just wonderful okay so that's the film these are great heirloom tomatoes there are they come in all different colors and flavors with the dish this simple you want to be sure that you're using really good ingredients just Tomatoes fennel and a little vinaigrette [Music] be sure you don't put tomatoes in the refrigerator they're really best when they're left at room temperature and then I have these wonderful little cherry tomatoes all different colors I would have the small ones and quarter the bigger ones okay that should do it and then I'm going to take the fennel and just let's turn across the top of it now I'm gonna make a vinaigrette two tablespoons of fresh lemon juice [Applause] two tablespoons of good olive oil one tablespoon of cider vinegar it was sweet salt [Music] just whisk it together I just pour it right up [Music] and then just as a Cornish I'm just going to take these fennel fronds just chop them up so this can just sit at room temperature that's gonna be delicious with a goat cheese tart French onion soup looks great just gorgeous so this is the thermos so we can take it to the beach it's a messy job but worthwhile croutons nice and cold like little bags with three times each of us three are croutons two mugs thermos of French onion soup and I'm off to the beach is it cold enough for you at the beach but a crew time to go with it we got a four-course meal yeah what's real French onion soup isn't it I think we should go for a walk on the beach before it gets even colder sounds like a good idea I'm gonna finish the chocolate mousse I love to decorate something with the ingredients that are in it so you know exactly what it is so I'm going to decorate it with whipped cream and a little bit of orange this is just casual heavy cream a little bit of sugar - and vanilla I speed that's it usually what I do is pipe it on with a pastry tube but you know I think this should just be casual just a da buff cream a mandarin orange it's simple it's delicious he's gonna be very handsome and will have a lot more for later if anybody comes to visit and two for Jeffrey and me just getting everything ready for lunch so the first thing that happens to goat cheese tart [Music] just hope it's good [Music] I can smell the goat cheese in the garlic and arms [Music] and the tomato and fennel similar level of flavors in this lemon and fennel Tomatoes perfect [Music] okay some bread and Stoppers [Music] a little white wine let's pinkie-swear it's a nice nap and the best thing is Jeffrey's gonna think I'm really smart that I can get lunch ready in five minutes after the beach only we'll know the truth
