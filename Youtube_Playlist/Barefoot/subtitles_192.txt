[Music] Lemmon capellini is just about the fastest weeknight costume you can make and one of the reasons is because capellini so thin it cooks in two to three minutes so I've got one pound of capellini I'm going to put it in a big pot of boiling salted water and the amazing thing is the sauce doesn't take much more going to make its lemons and butter so first thing I need is a half a pound of butter I know I know it's a lot of butter but after a bad day it works so it's good two lemons I need the zest and the juice so I just want to get that very very thin yellow part of the lemon and remember you always want to desc them before you choose them I'm going to do a second lemon this pastas really versatile you can either serve it with a little shrimp or chicken or if you've had a really bad day at the office you can just have it all by itself it's a lot of lemon zest but you really want a lot of flavor lemon zest right into the butter I'm in the juice of both lemons I love my little juicer so fast you definitely want to use fresh lemon juice I'm not a big fan of anything but fresh lemon juice I always have that like awful metallic flavor even if you juice lemons in advance like a day or two and maybe the fridge which wouldn't fit decided okay this goes right into the pan with the butter and the lemon zest 1 teaspoon of salt once you sort of pepper just swirl it around if the task is done and this is the key to the whole thing instead of draining the water what I'm going to do is take the pasta and put it right into the sauce and then it's going to cook them the sauce first so just about a minute or two and it's going to serve all the butter and the lemon but don't try out the pasta water because actually if the sauce gets a little too thick and always take a little of the pasta water protestin starch in it and send it out a little bit toss it all together so all the lemon and the butter and the zest and all the seasonings get all mixed in well it's a weeknight and it's just about dinnertime I just want to make sure this is really good so I wanted to be one serving like this and I think it needs a little lemon zest on top I would say weeknight dinner doesn't get any easier than this or for delicious you
