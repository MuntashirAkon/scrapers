so for lunch with Marisa and Pam I'll make one of my favorite soups it's called borscht and it's a beet soup it's a nice summer dish and what I've done is I've cooked the beets about 35 to 40 minutes until they're really tender and I saved the cooking liquid and that's when I'm going to start the soup with I cooked about two pounds of beets the first thing is one and a half cups of beef cooking liquid I'm going to start the soup so there's also a winter borscht which is like a beef stew with vegetables but they're all basically Russian peasant food since I was originally a Russian peasant perfect okay why don't they have cups of beef cooking liquid two cups of chicken stock if I'm a chicken sex always better but if not he's a good hand 116 ounces of sour cream half a cup of yogurt sort of a cup of sugar bring out the sweetness of the beads fresh lemon juice 2 tablespoons perfect 2 teaspoons of vinegar or champagne vinegar tablespoon salt that's a lot of borscht one and a half teaspoons of pepper and a whisk this all together it's a wonderful cold soup and the good news is you can just sit in the refrigerator for days just serve it whenever you want to it's gonna be ready when you are okay now lots of fresh vegetables one chopped cucumber the most force is really kind of pureed but I'm going to make a really chunky vegetable soup I can have a cup of scallions chopped give it a little heat 2 tablespoons of fresh dill okay that's good and the last thing of the beef so hands are going to really read and biddies but the only way to do it so the beets I just cooked in boiling salted water for about 35 to 45 minutes until they're done and then I just cool them peel them and save the cooking liquid no beets are really available to year-round I've made this what can be - that's fine but if you can get fresh beets it's even better now it's beginning to look like borscht nice red ham it's gonna be gorgeous I'd love to serve it in a white mug dollop of sour cream some fresh dill it's going to be really delicious cold soup okay into the fridge be going to wash my hands and I'm going to go off shopping [Music] so the borscht is nice chilled so it's got great flavor with beets and cucumbers lots of dill and I'm putting it in a cup because I thought it'd be so much easier for a business lunch not to have a big bowl of soup I thought that sour cream never heard and put a little sprig of fresh dill on top and lunch is ready
