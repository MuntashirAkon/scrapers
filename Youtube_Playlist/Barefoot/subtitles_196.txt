[Music] I write an entertaining column for House Beautiful magazine and I've invited the top brass for dinner tonight including the editor-in-chief Steven Drucker who as luck would have it is one of my dearest friends now this is a design magazine so I think not only the dinner but also the setting should be pretty wonderful wouldn't want to disappoint the boss instead of the usual filet of beef dinner that they're probably expecting I'm making Stephens favorite comfort food spaghetti and meatballs on the side really good garlic bread made with ciabatta olive oil and lots of garlic and for dessert something fun ice cream sodas with homemade chocolate and raspberry sauce I'm gonna do everything I can to dazzle this crowd but most of all I want them to go home saying wasn't that fun just when people are expecting a really fancy over-the-top dessert it's just when I like to Surprise them and do something really earthy and so I'm gonna make ice cream sodas I'm gonna make two sauces chocolate sauce and fresh raspberry sauce so for the fresh raspberry sauce I've got two packets of fresh raspberries that have a nice each have a cup of sugar this is so easy won't believe it and the juice of one lemon this relates to sort of dessert and everybody remembers from their childhood and they go crazy when they know they're gonna have them for dessert so the juice of one lemon and lemon doesn't have to sit in the refrigerator and the juices from the raspberries are gonna come out and if we make a syrup really good in ice cream sodas now how easy was that [Music] so the next thing I want to make for ice-cream service is chocolate sauce it's a little harder than making raspberry sauce but not a lot the first thing is 3/4 of a cup of unsweetened cocoa powder I actually save it because sometimes it gets a little lumpy in the container okay I just just make sure it's smooth it smells good already chocolate sauce who wouldn't want this in their ice-cream soda okay into a pan okay why don't half cups of sugar pinch of salt one cup of water half a teaspoon of instant coffee really makes chocolate taste like chocolate it's gonna stir this up and simmer for about five minutes so this is what we're gonna do for dessert everybody's gonna have an ice-cream soda glass they can choose chocolate sauce or raspberry sauce a little bit of milk in the bottom of the glass fill it with club soda so we'll have either chocolate soda or raspberry soda and then lots of choices of ice cream it's most delicious that's perfect okay this is done before into the glass gorgeous lip service your left I'm gonna add is a little vanilla I didn't put it into the original mix of 71 for the flavor to be evaporated while I cook it so one teaspoon of good vanilla just stir it in and I guess let me chop this sauce for our ice cream sodas so the last thing I have to do is sieve the raspberry sauce sorry marinated ladies lemon juice and sugar and now I'm just going to sieve them end up with raspberry syrup so the other surprise I have for tonight in addition to ice cream sodas as I'm making Stephan his absolutely favorite meal its meatballs and spaghetti just when he thinks I'm gonna be serving something fancy like filet of beef I'm just gonna make meatballs in spaghetti can't wait to see the look on his face so I'm just gonna push this through a little bit take the seeds out and a lot of the pulp but just sort of squeeze a lot of the juice out to make a really good syrup that should be it yeah let's see how this is mmm-hmm a really intense raspberry flavor it's gonna be so good in the ice cream sodas so now I'm off to get some things for another pasta to serve with drinks [Music] I'm a few rules for easy entertaining and one of the most important is I never make more than two things so I thought with drinks maybe I'm gonna serve a big as opposed to a platter actually like to do it under passed a platter because just by a few ingredients everybody uses their fingers and it's really easy I don't cook anything hi Deb good morning this looks gorgeous I know I like the oil-cured olives I love the mixed ones but I think the black ones will look better on the platter it's nice to have big blocks of color so I'm just going to choose the solid black ones perfect and then what's the difference in the artichokes these here are the imported artichokes okay that's what I'll take how's that great same size same size would be wonderful they're wonderful they still have the stems on them and it's delicious maybe some big chunk of parmesan and some salami is to go on the platter [Music] in about a quarter of a pound perfect the most wonderful platter [Music] what could possibly be more earthly to serve a fancy crowd than spaghetti and meatballs but they'll be surprised so I'm gonna start with three different kinds of meat have a pound of pork have a pound of veal and a pound of ground beef so these are all ground up fresh that's the meat and then I'm gonna add a cup of fresh breadcrumbs this is about four slices of bread I took the crusts off and just grind it up on the food processor a quarter cup of dry breadcrumbs actually use fresh breadcrumbs to keep them moist and dry bread crumbs to hold them together when I'm cooking them and fresh parsley about two tablespoons okay so I'm just gonna strip the leaves off I always love to surprise people for dinner I would say the last thing they're expecting is spaghetti and meatballs and just because it's beginning me post doesn't mean it doesn't have to be really fabulous okay so two tablespoons of freshly minced parsley the next thing is Parmesan cheese and I'll show you how I do it really quickly turn it on it's really noisy how fast is that I need about a half a cup of grated Parmesan cheese i think it's unusual and meatballs but i think gives it lots of flavor one egg all these ingredients are just on to either flavor it or hold it together so I'm just gonna plate it a little bit pour it on top now some seasoning a quarter teaspoon of nutmeg 2 teaspoons of salt 1/2 a teaspoon of pepper and here's the surprising part warm water 3/4 of a cup I sure learned this trick from Rao's that famous Italian restaurant in New York and it keeps the meatballs so moist you wouldn't believe it ok clean hands cooks best tool and you want to do this really lightly you don't want to sort of compact it you want to fluff it up and still mix them together oh this smells so good it's gonna make about 16 really good size meatballs just perfect for my guess [Music] a quarter inch of oil olive oil and vegetable oil let's go to saute these I just keep turning them so they Brown evenly on all sides I'm doing them in two batches so I don't want to overcrowd them so they're brown nicely [Music] okay that's eight done maybe would it do [Music] it right into the oil for about ten minutes and with and browned on the outside I don't need to be fully cooked inside it doesn't little cook them in tomato sauce later in the meantime so let me get everything together my tomato sauce [Music] so the second batch of Meatballs you've done just ten minutes until they're nice and brown and I'm gonna finish cooking with a tomato sauce okay I'm just gonna pour off all the oil that I used for cooking the meatballs so I'm gonna use the same pan it's got all that great flavor from the meatballs a little bit of fresh olive oil 1 cup of onions it's one or two onions depending on how big they are and they're gonna cook for 10 minutes until they're really tender and flavorful and now I need some wine for the sauce [Music] okay one and a half teaspoons of garlic I do the garlic at the end because it burns really quickly garlic immediately it's wonderful okay you have a couple of red wine deglaze the pan get all those really crusty bits from the meatballs really flavors the sauce and leave the pan to one 28-ounce can of fresh tomatoes yeah okay that's nice great better tablespoon parsley we're gonna have two spoons of salt one and a half teaspoons of pepper we're gonna put that together for a minute okay so now what I'm gonna do is take the meatballs and just put them right back into the sauce and they're gonna cook for about 25 to 30 minutes okay put them all in oh who could resist this looks so good so these are gonna cook for about 25 to 30 minutes until the meatballs are cooked and the sauce is thickened and in the meantime you gotta have garlic bread so I'm gonna do it with a twist meatballs and spaghetti gotta have girl with bread someone cooked the garlic first I'm gonna have a cup of olive oil and then lots of girl so it's chopped up six cloves of garlic really roughly gonna do this really fast in the food processor quarter cup of fresh parsley in the same way that I like to surprise people and make something earthy when they're expecting something fancy there's nothing more earth as it garlic Breton so we're gonna make a little fancier making it with Giovanna or just a wonderful Italian bread and I've got fresh oregano which is a rare treat but it's really wonderful I've got an eighth of a cup just put it right in 20 spoon of salt half teaspoon of pepper I'm stoked pirata of course you can do this by hand but it's so much quicker in the food processor okay love the smell of that I'm just gonna put it into the hot oil and just cook it for about 30 seconds really fast don't want to do is let the garlic [Music] okay that's good just enough to cook the garlic that's not wrong okay for the bread and just spoon this gorgeous garlic and herb mixture over it [Music] and the other side it whispers just a little bit of butter and then I'm gonna wrap it in foil put it in the oven 350 degrees for about five minutes then take the foil off and let it get really nice and crisp well okay into the oven the whole house is gonna smell like garlic and herbs if that doesn't impress the boss I don't know what will and now I'm gonna do the table every Italian table has water and wine right on the table but they don't know is this the ice-cream service well the dinner is Italian and the meal is one of Stephens favorite dinners now we usually serve to your boss I'll give you a hint does oregano in it we like oregano but what do you think stay right here I'll be right back spaghetti I have a couple of rules about making spaghetti any kind of prostatic big pot of water lots of salt and I'm just put it right in six people about time didn't have a pasta yeah okay splash of oil to make sure the pasta doesn't stick it's gonna cook for about ten minutes in the meantime I smelled garlic bread now it's nice and hot crisp big shocks [Music] I can really smell it garlic in the herbs and the fresh oregano it's right onto the table does not record just I love the way that works on all the green herbs [Music] okay I think pastas just about ready [Music] nice tomato sauce and meatballs hey bunch of basil right in the middle big spoons can't wait to see their faces [Music] okay it's meatballs and skinny [Music] [Laughter] [Music] to all the bosses so you think this is missing quite easy dessert I'll be right back [Music] they thought people spaghetti with someone do-it-yourselfers come sodas are even better chocolate sauce it's dangerous I just it's ready okay everybody ice cream sodas for dessert how's that for unlikely Farber your first would you like chocolate raspberry sauce chocolate of course of course how silly of me okay so it's chocolate sauce and now I have vanilla strawberry chocolate and espresso this espresso you don't even I don't have to go beyond just press out okay espresso ice cream with real espresso how's that I want the vanilla okay that's it right out of New York all right chocolate all around okay you got it I can do that too oh really miss isn't that the way they always are [Laughter]
