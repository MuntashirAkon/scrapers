[Music] fresh tuna tartare what'd you say this it's great when you go to the fish store to ask for fresh tuna ask for sushi grade too and you want to center cut piece and it shouldn't have any fishy smell at all so slice the tuna in quarter-inch slices and now I'm going to make quarter inch dice it's very small pieces but it's not really minced after I've marinated this in the lime juice marinade I'm going to add all kinds of flavorings and seasonings like scallions and chili peppers get a little heat and then I'm going to add diced avocados which gives a great flavor and texture so that's four and a half pounds of fresh tuna so now for the marinade you want to have cup of good olive oil okay when within one cup of lime juice don't even think about using the bottle cut that's a six fresh limes a lot of zest so it's going to give a lot of flavor tablespoon wasabi powder which is really really really hot Japanese horseradish generally don't use a tablespoon it's a lot of marinade next is soy sauce 3 tablespoons of soy sauce which is really the salt in it one and a half tablespoons of Tabasco which is more heat but remember it's a lot of tuna ok that's good salt and pepper that's two tablespoons of freshly ground pepper okay I'm just going to whisk back together it's really just like making it very spicy vinaigrette so pour it over the tuna just mix it together pretty good a riddle okay now I'm going to add some other great things 1/2 cups of chopped scallions lots of scallions quarter of a cup of chili peppers they're really hot that they're good mix those in now I need about 6 diced avocado right into the tuna just mix it in a little disc just make sure the lime juice gets to the avocado to keep from turning brown about two tablespoons of sesame seeds on top so it's really lots of Asian flavorings and seasonings in a little California avocados thrown in and then later after it's marinated at the party and we serve it on the cracker we'll let it marinate for about an hour in there frigerator just before everybody gets here I'm gonna make the tuna tartare it's amazing how the lime juice keeps the avocado from turning brown and it also cooks the tuna
