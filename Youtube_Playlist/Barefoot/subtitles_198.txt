when it comes to comfort food I say mac and cheese is pretty high in everybody's list so for dinner tomorrow night I thought I'd make a grown up mac and cheese with bacon and blue cheese okay so I need one and a half cups of milk and I'm going to heat it up and then in another pot two tablespoons of butter [Music] come on the heat two tablespoons of flour so I'm just going to cook these together for about two minutes you don't want the butter to burn let's whip them together so this cook butter and flour is going to act as a thickener for the sauce now I'm going to add the hot milk to it and it's going to stick in it okay I'm just going to cook that over low heat until it just gets a little thicker okay let's see how this is doing oh the white sauce is just perfect now it's thickened it's not incredibly thick but what it does is just coat the spoon so now off the heat I'm going to add all the cheese's so 1/2 a cup of Korea third of a cup of cheddar and about 2 ounces of Roquefort you can really use any kind of blue cheese but Roquefort has a particularly wonderful flavor a little bit of nutmeg it's a really classic spice that's used in grit towns you should won't know what's there but it'll make everything else taste better give it a stir so the cheese is all melted that's a much better way to do bacon so it's not splattering all over the place just chop it up [Music] but it right is okay time to drain the pasta simply put this break back into the sauce to stir it around this is so easy to make it a large quantity but it's just stripped in naming it for two and the best thing I can make it today and bake it off tomorrow when I can spend tomorrow with Jeffrey instead of cooking okay a little bit of a topping so it's sort of crunchy on the top so it takes to take two pieces of white bread cut up the cross and just chop them up put them in the bowl of a food processor with a steel blade and just a little bit of fresh basil a couple leaves right in the food processor with it bread folks it builds from [Music] okay and just right on top of the mac and cheese so it's creamy on the bottom and crunchy on the top okay into the fridge I'm gonna bake it tomorrow knife for cozy and comforting dinner for Jeffrey me [Music]
