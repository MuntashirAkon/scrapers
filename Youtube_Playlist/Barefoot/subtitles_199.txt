[Music] so traditionally there are two problems with fried chicken one is all that grease and the second one is you have to do it just before you serve it I'm going to show you how to do the oven cells both those problems first thing you set up on this little rear end take your knife and there's a backbone here that I'm going to take out and you want to run your knife right along both sides of that backbone keep your fingers out of the way okay that's the backbone not great in fried chicken fabulous and soup so I'll save it for later so then you want to have a chicken flat out like this and there's this little part in the breastbone to Nick it with your knife and then run your fingers down both sides of this little bone and then pull it right out just should come out in one fell swoop okay and now it's really easy to cut up just run your knife right down the back flip it over cut the leg from the white meat cut the legs on the side pull it back it's easy to see where the bombs connect so we've got eight pieces ready for fried chicken and I'm going to put all the chicken in one bowl and I'm going to pour buttermilk over it and it's going to tenderize it the acid in the buttermilk really makes the chicken very tender and four quart of buttermilk over it this is good for two chickens but I only have one so what you want to do is get the buttermilk in around the chicken part okay wash up I'm going to marinate it for two hours if you have open eyes even better time to fry the chicken so family chicken is marinating in buttermilk which is gonna make it moist and really tender so first thing I'm going to season some flour to make the coating to make it really crisp to cut the flour 1 tablespoon of salt and 1 tablespoon of fresh pepper I'm just going to mix it all together and then put the chicken in so the secret of this recipe is instead of frying the chicken while everybody's standing there waiting for dinner I'm going to fry it really quickly get the coating really crisp and then I'm going to bake it in the oven so it's going to crisp on the outside and incredibly tender and juicy on the inside it's a messy job but really worth doing and ok last piece a really messy okay now let's get some oil really hot maybe oil about 360 degrees here's a candy thermometer which really hangs on the pot it gets almost there okay check it in just about three minutes on each side because remember we're going to finish cooking it in the oven it's browned on one side I want to turn them for another three minutes and then put them on a sheet pan to bake in the oven smelling like fried chicken now for the flour I just use salt and pepper because I like it simple but you can always be something spicy like cyan pepper whatever you like a little chili powder okay three minutes ready to come out and go on the sheet pan I'm going to fry the rest of these up then I'm going to put them all in the oven together 350 degrees for about 30 to 40 minutes until they're incredibly crisp on the outside and really to the inside
