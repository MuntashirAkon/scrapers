it's my friend Stevens birthday and I've given him a cooking class for a present so he's gonna come over and we're gonna cook together and then some friends are coming for dinner it's gonna be really fun coconut cupcakes are one of Stephens favorite desserts I'm gonna make them for his birthday so 3/4 a pound of butter and two cups of sugar think about baking that's really important is it should be exact really measure things carefully when you're cooking you just throw things in taste and see how it is but with baking you really don't know if it's good or not until you've taken it out of the oven and it's done so want to be sure that the measurements are exact don't rush this step it's a really important part of baking the next step is the eggs and this recipe calls for five eggs three four and five eggs so later on I'm gonna show seeking how to make Indonesian chicken roasted carrots and buzz mati rice and it's a really easy dinner that he can make for his friends maybe even me okay so the next ingredients are vanilla extract and almond extract so one and a half teaspoons of pure vanilla extract and one and a half teaspoons of pure on the Dex tract and now I'm going to put together my dry mixture and a wet mixture that are gonna go in alternately I'll show you so I need about three cups of all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon of baking powder half a teaspoon of baking soda and half a teaspoon of kosher salt so now I'm gonna sift these together which is actually gonna not only sift the flour and dry ingredients but it's gonna combine them and the next thing is buttermilk I have 1 cup of buttermilk I'm gonna turn the mixer on very low speed and I want to add a quarter of the flour until it's just mixed in remember when start doing the flour you don't want to over mix it a third of the liquid ingredients another portion of flour until it's just mixed in another portion of liquid ingredients this is going to make a really moist delicious coconut cupcake it's all part of the fun of it at the end of with flour all over you and mix it just until it's done so in fact I'll usually save the last mix for my spatula and then the last ingredient is coconut so it's seven ounces of coconut that goes right in you can actually do it on the mixer I like to do it by hand and it's just perfect and then we're gonna add more coconut to the top with the icing mmm Stephens gonna be very happy this is my secret for making coconut cupcakes every single one is exactly the same size ice cream scoop just a regular a standard ice cream scoop and you fill it up so it's sort of overflowing like that and then you drop one in each and they're gonna rise a little bit but not so much so that's exactly the size you want them I think maybe I might have to put candles in each one for Stephen it's really fun to make cupcakes for instead of a birthday cake and then everybody gets their own little cupcake so they're gonna go in the oven 325 for about 25 minutes until they're done and then I'm gonna ice them mmm parse it from my roasted calf all these green hydrangeas are you perfect for the table gorgeous so the cupcakes are in the oven and I'm about to make that icing love that icing confectioner sugar so the first thing is cream cheese and butter it's really important like really important that they be room temperature otherwise the butter ends up in little bits all through the icing not good so that's a pound of cream cheese and 3/4 of a pound of butter I don't want to whip this I just want to mix it until it's just combined and with my just just scrape down sides 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract the good kind and half a teaspoon of almond extract these are the two flavorings in the coconut cupcakes so really has the same kind of flavoring just combine it like that and now the last ingredient how easy is this is one and a half pounds of confectioner sugar so right after this I'm gonna go shopping for all the ingredients for my dinner with my friend Steven it's his birthday dinner be fun still sifting now show you what I want to do on a very low speed I'm gonna very slowly I had the confectioner sugar to the cream cheese butter and flavorings and that's it so we'll leave this here and I'll see how the coconut cupcakes are doing oh they look perfect I feel done I use a skewer like a bamboo skewer but you can use a toothpick just to put it right in the middle of the coconut cupcake and if it comes out clean and it does it's perfect my friend Stephens birthday today and I'm giving in to a cooking class as a gift he's not gonna believe how easy my Indonesian ginger chicken is to make oh look at these guys they're so sweet their little baby beads but I'm looking for carrots today so I'm gonna stay focused now I need some ginger don't be afraid of it it's wonderful and it has no smell at all but when you cut into it'll be really pungent so what's gonna make the Indonesian it's actually a great recipe it's really easy so I know you can make it for everybody mm-hmm including me maybe actually your breath always ruins to make chicken so it has four ingredients first one is honey into the pan okay Hunter fect just beautifully okay and the next thing I have I need 3/4 of a cup of soy sauce so which is great because actually it's the salt so it's the sweet and the salt you want to put that right in the pot mm-hmm be sure to get it all over my white shirt that's part of the experience okay the next ingredients ginger I won't just want to grade it on this box grad you want to keep your fingers out of the way so I'll peel something for you how's that and then you can grade it and then I'm gonna do the garlic you haven't said anything about desert well then a lot of talk about chicken what chicken here's more ginger well let's see I think Stephen I think what's your favorite cake Wow what's your favorite dessert does it start with cocoa and end with nut that would be it I made coconut cupcakes for your birthday yeah okay so I'm gonna do the garlic so now in that pot for the marinade we've got honey soy sauce we're gonna have your ginger and we're gonna have my garlic and we're gonna let it sit in that for a little while so this is not like a first date dinner it's definitely not a first date dinner now can I stop greeting sugar I need a half a cup let's take this is thought to be a half I need two of those in that pot with the soy sauce and with the funny you're on it they're going in okay doesn't have to be exact just throw it all in that is the kind of recipe monix my we're very casual ah there we go can I move into your space in your cutting and chopping space please our space our space it's okay so I'm going to chop this up I need a quarter of a cup so this is the entire marinade and we're gonna put the chicken into this and just let it sit and maybe four I mean we're hungry so maybe for an hour but mm-hmm if you want to leave it overnight we're hungry and thirsty outside we'll drink for the hour while we let it marinate that's about a quart of cover I'd say that's it so what we're gonna do is heat this up until the honey melts I'm gonna pour it over the chicken and let it sit for about an hour or if you have the time let it sit overnight in the refrigerator and then it's really good and that's when we're gonna release one oh yeah I think that's exactly the hour we're gonna be drinking it so just until that until you feel that the honey is melted this is pretty liquid that's exactly--it then I think it's done I'm gonna put it in a roasting pan the good news is we're gonna marinate it in the roasting pan then we're going to bake it in the roasting pan so you don't even have to change pans I think just want to pour that marinade right over to me that smells so good doesn't it women when the garlic and the ginger heat up you can really smell it and the honey mmm so I'm gonna cover this with foil and I'm gonna let it marinate for about an hour and as I said you could let it marinate for an hour or overnight if you want to this could be pretty good you could do this okay in the fridge okay let's clean up so I put these in to just review the dishwasher guys okay fabulous you know about God's and dish 1,000 dishwashers I don't know guys idea of doing the dishes is putting them in the sink so after this you know we're gonna do I'm gonna show you how to ice a cupcake oh that's a good skill huh have you ever done it no I remember I memorized the cake oh all right so here are the cupcakes these are the three options I have for ice and choose your weapon I like like that I used to speckle it's sort of the same skill actually it's good Oh doesn't this look fabulous all that cream cheese and vanilla and um and don't we have to taste it make sure it's okay that's good that's perfect great right there should I do one okay and you're like okay so you want lots of icing on top cuz it's the yummy part of this so I think I'm just putting on the stand like that so you're next here we go not enough okay no does the icing um harden a little bit it actually stays pretty crewmates it's a little bit it'll be a little firmer but it stays really creamy okay and the last one goes there and then the final touch is coconut so I'm gonna start and then you're gonna keep going lots of coconut right on the top how we gonna stand from eating them before the party more coconut never too much coconut so let's see how this ginger chicken is doing almost not to cook it oh yeah it's time to cook it but I can even smell it even with the foil on it uh doesn't that look fabulous oh you can smell it when you take it off the ginger and the honey in the mmm and the garlic already all right I'm gonna put the foil on we're gonna put it in the oven for about half an hour at 350 degrees and then we're gonna take the foil off turn the chicken and it's gonna get nice and brown and the juices will become the sauce I think it'd be very happy perfect we should cook together more often I like this so you're always so nice about my table settings want me to show you how I do it so you're gonna know the secrets now but it's sort of like that Paris Bistro thing where there are two layers of call so one goes on a diagonal and then the good cloth goes on top where'd you get this oh we've got a little place in forest so I save it for very special occasions perfect you're in charge of Soph where you said your knifes pacing in or out facing in great so since green is our color we did this flower arrangement out of green hydrangeas it's wonderful and our wine glasses give our place settings a little height so we're ready for your birthday so roasted carrots forget what you used to have when you were a kid they were all mushy yeah I hate them these are cryptid a really high temperature and they're gonna be really caramelized on the outside and they're gonna be just tender and sweet on the inside you know it's hard to remember a flavor so what I do is I line things up this is I think you'll think this is interesting so I've got four different kinds of salt kosher salt which I usually use I'm gonna put I'm gonna line them up and then we're gonna taste them all you see what incredible difference it is so the first one is table salt the usual kind that you have on the table the second one is kosher salt which we use a lot the third one is sea salt infected flaked sea salt so it's really interesting sees totally different texture and the fourth one is another kind of sea salt called fleur de sel is it fresh it's fresh that's called fleur de sel touch your tongue to your finger and just put it right in the salt it's salty it's wrong um I think it has a harshness like a bitterness about it doesn't it mm-hmm and then the second one is kosher salt house that is different to you Wilder it's milder it's softer I think it has a more round than the third one does the sea salt that went to me is softer it's more it's closer to the kosher salt but it's got a softer flavor and it sort of melts in your mouth doesn't has almost sweeter it's sweeter that's exactly right the last ones fleur de sel and it's actually if you can find it it's um I use it for finishing because it actually is so soft to me that just his briny sort of like the ocean doesn't it it's very soft and it's it's really kind of sweet isn't it oh you're right isn't that interesting it's very delicate it is like the ocean and that's where it comes from it's harvested from the ocean so now you'll always remember about the different kinds of salt which one do you want to use for the UM carrots sea salt sea salt you got it great so the next thing we're gonna do is cut these guys up so you want to take the top off and then just a little bit of the base you don't wanna cut too much off I just do big chunks like this really big really big what happens is in the oven they tend to shrink a little bit so you want to be sure to cut them really big and chunky good done okay next things roasting pan you know you can do this in a bowl but I just don't rent on the pan carrots go on the sheet pan so the next thing we're gonna need is olive oil which is right there when you drizzle olive oil you want to cover the top with your finger just a little bit so that you're you don't dump yeah you know dump the entire bottle on the olive oil actually when it gets hot it really roasts the carrots so it's important to have some olive oil and all the carrots okay now we need salt choose your salt sea sea salt okay with flake sea salt I'm a prepper great thank you sounds good graded on the top and how simple go out couldn't be easier good amazing right and it really can do it so many vegetables okay into the oven 400 degrees for about 20 minutes and we'll take a look at them and as long as we're here I think the chicken might be ready to return thank you oh my god that smells so good so I'm just gonna turn this so that when it cooks the skin gets really Brown and just delicious and now all the juices from the chicken and ginger and garlic and the honey are gonna make a wonderful sauce okay so now without the foil so if it gets nice and brown I'm gonna put it back in the oven I know where I am I'm turning up the oven to 375 a little higher temperature goes back in the oven for about half an hour and that carrots and the chicken will be ready at the same time pretty out here tonight isn't it I believe the cooking lesson was her birthday gift she's such a great teacher she makes everything look so easy doesn't that look great this is the Indonesian ginger chicken and it's just I can smell all the garlic and the ginger and the honey and it's just it's gorgeous it was perfectly cooked you know the hardest thing about a meal is getting everything done at the same time and the good news is all of us can stay warm in the oven for a little while until everything's done together hmm I love that it actually makes its own sauce too as you don't have to make a separate thing for a sauce the great thing about cooking it covered is it gets nice and cooked but then when you take the foil off I get so nice and brown I love the way that looks I've got lots of sauce you'd see all the ginger and garlic in it it's all cooked you know the garlic was a lot of garlic but in fact when it cooks like this it gets really sweet so it's wonderful next is the roasted carrots which I roasted for about a half an hour to high temperature about 400 degrees and they're just perfectly cooked they came in a little parsley up that's special parsley to my garden I love these carrots because they're so sweet when you roast them like this made a little fuzz body rice and I cut up a few scallions I thought that'd be good in it maybe a little parsley why not please eat going out to the party let's start dancing fun I can smell the ginger and the garlic in the chicken see it's not so garlic its place fairly famous rustle - laughs car please all right let's try this see if we really know what we're doing yet what do you think chef Drucker I think this is a very successful birthday all right they know who they are steve is great these are both right now
