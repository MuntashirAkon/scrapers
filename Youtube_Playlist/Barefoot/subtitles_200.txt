[Music] the method I think I use the most it's particularly for salads it's bone-in skin-on chicken breast and I'm just going to show you how I do it olive oil salt and pepper it's as easy as that [Music] so olive oil salt and pepper lots of pepper you want to have lots of flavor in the oven 350 degrees for 35 to 40 minutes and it comes out perfectly every time first step of the chicken but in the same oven let's cook some bacon and doing the same oven i roasted some nuts it's actually walnuts cashews and almonds they're just roasted them for like 10 minutes really brings out the flavor okay those are the components now we're going to make the vinaigrette so the first thing is olive oil I need two thirds of a cup of olive oil 3 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar next thing is mustard give it a little heat I love to add mustard to vinaigrette because it mul suffice it to teaspoons of honey just a little bit of sweetness is nice and then we're going to have teaspoons of salt one to have lots of flavor half teaspoon of pepper give it a whisk and that's a vinaigrette I just kind of with my hands just do large shreds of chicken the next thing is bacon it's nice and cool now and I'm just going to dice it up and next I've got all kinds of lettuces to put in I've got kale and fris√©e got them all washed and dried and you want to be sure to spin dry them really well because if they're wet the vinaigrette won't stick to it and the next thing is spinach and when these baby spinach leaves just wriggle in classic Waldorf salad has grapes I'm using red Lisa said that I have a cup okay next is cheese it's a really good sharp cheddar about a cup next the bacon and the chicken nice crisp red apple if you can make this a little in advance to the Apple s if you don't want to share too Brown okay now of course we need salt and pepper and the vinaigrette one last ingredient self balled eggs I'm just going to cut them in quarters and while I do I'm going to show you how I made them I put four extra-large egg into a medium saucepan and cover the most tap water brought it to a full boil then immediately turned off the heat I let them sit in the water for exactly four minutes then I put them into a bowl of cold tap water for two minutes to cool I like to put the eggs on top I don't want to mix them in too much because you don't want them messed up
