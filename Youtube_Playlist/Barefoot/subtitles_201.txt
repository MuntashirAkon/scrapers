[Music] tiramisu Lucinda 90s with pasta pesto Wester the 80s it was done done and overdone and we all stopped making it and in fact it's one of those really delicious and easy things to make someone make it today for my husband Jeffrey so I need six egg yolks if you want to really be squishy and messy about this it's the best way to separate eggs it's just do it in your hand and the whites fall right through your fingers and the yolk goes right into the bowl and it's gone I'm going to add a quarter of a cup of sugar and now I'm going to whisk these for about five minutes until they're really light and you'll see they change completely [Music] so while that's going I'm going to put the other ingredients together the first one is I need really good rum dark rum is so wonderful because it's got really great depth of flavor since it's not that so I need a quarter of a cup of dark rum and a quarter of a cup of espresso and then the less ingredient I need is my cell phone and I'll show you what it is it's a really lovely ingredient it's really Italian cream cheese it's very thick at the triple creme and it's so rich in this amazing third position well the X was done so I'll show you this is just the way they want to look it's light and when you hold it up it falls back on itself in a ribbon so now a medium speed I'm just going to add a combination of the espresso and the rum so I can smell the Roman espresso when it hits the eggs it's wonderful I'm just going to add the mascarpone would put it at 16 ounces of mascarpone it's either one large or two small containers so that's the cream mixture and now we're going to go to assembling it this is the secret to making really good tiramisu they're called salvo you already and you get them in the Italian specialty store possibly even the grocery store they're ladyfingers but unlike American ladyfingers they're really crisp they're great on their own and what I'm going to do is dip them in a mixture of rum and coffee and then pour the cream over these T's fantastic the key to the ladyfingers is if you dip them for too long they get very soggy if you dip them for too little time they're going to not absorb enough flavor so we'll just do it like this exactly that amount of time and then put it right into the dish and then the next one on one side on the other side and then lift it out and now I'm going to take this incredible delicious screams this is the mascarpone and eggs and rum and espresso and pour half of it right over the top of this like that and now we're going to do another layer of espresso rum soaked ladyfingers the good news about this is it's not rocket science all I'm doing basically is assembling this and I didn't have to cook a thing there's no standing the government going is it done is it not done and the last layer of cream just smooth it over the top and then just before I serve it I'm going to put shaved chocolate and sometimes a little bit of powdered sugar on the top so it goes in the fridge and it'll sit for about an hour or two but the good news is to consider for two days back in the fridge and desserts already [Music]
