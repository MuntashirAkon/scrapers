you tomorrow I'm a really busy day and I have friends coming for dinner so I'm gonna make everything in advance and then I can have a party that's absolutely stressful so tomorrow night's dinner is chicken stew with biscuits it's a great meal to make ahead because I can assemble it today and then bake it off just before dinner but I thought while I was cooking off the chicken for the stew I was gonna make myself a little lunch chicken with goat cheese and basil it's really easy so I'm take one of these boneless chicken breasts and run my finger right under the skin between the skin and the meat and then take a little bit of goat cheese I have garlic and herb goat cheese but you can really use any kind of goat cheese or even Brie or mozzarella whatever you have around just take two slices and put it right into the skin just like that and then because I had a little basil in the refrigerator but I put one big basil leaf right underneath the skin and that's gonna flavor it this is really easy enough to do for yourself but it's delicious enough to make for company some other time little olive oil salt and pepper right over the top of the chicken how quick was that so I'm going to roast the chicken at 350 degrees for about 35 to 40 minutes and the skin gets really crisp and the chicken will be really juicy and tender so dessert for tomorrow night is summer pudding which is this great make-ahead dessert but first I'm going to wash up and get the berries for the pudding so summer pudding is this really old-fashioned dessert and it's layers of usually bread but I'm going to use brioche because I think it has more flavor and stewed berries and it all sits together overnight in the fridge and the brioche absorbs all that wonderful juice of the berries and just incredibly delicious and it's a great thing to make ahead because all it does it sit in the fridge and then as though that's not good enough I'm going to serve it with rum whipped cream which is just so over the top one pint of strawberries into the pan why don't I have cups of sugar and a little bit of water that a quarter of a cup I'm gonna cook this all together and it's gonna be wonderful stewed berry that's gonna be absorbed by all that gorgeous brioche and then I'm gonna add some other berries and some Framboise you'd be really surprised how much time I spend in the pantry staring at the shelf I've got pastry cream and I'm trying to write a recipe and I think well what would be good in the pastry cream and I take out some tiny yak mmm that's really good with vanilla so or I've got some whipped cream and I'm trying to figure out what to do with it and I look at the rum and I think Oh dark rum that that would be wonderful but right now I'm making summer pudding so I need Framboise so the strawberries have been cooking away with sugar and a little bit of water and it beautifully cooked and now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna add more berries to it to half pints of fresh raspberries I love to make this in the summer when the berries are particularly good but can really get good berries from California almost all year long to have kinds of fresh blueberries these look like good blueberries and I'm gonna leave one of the half pints of raspberries to put him later just because I want some cooked berries and some fresh berries in it so this gonna cook for about five minutes on a very low flame just like a low simmer okay so while that's happening I'm gonna cut the brioche up but first I gotta clear the decks this is a huge brioche loaf we're going to use most of it made by a friend of mine a lightsaber and makes the most wonderful breads so I'm going to do half-inch thick slices stack them all up cut off the crust it doesn't have to be exact it's more like cake than it is bread so the berries should be done by now and they are it's perfect so but I turn it off and the last thing I'm going to do just to give us some real texture is that another half pint of fresh raspberries off the heat and 2 tablespoons of friend Waze which is raspberry flavored with brandy and it just gives it so much flavor that'll do it so this is a su flavor 7 or 8 inches it doesn't really matter and I want something that's tall enough so after it's set when I turn it out it's high like a cake look great so the first thing is a ladle full of cooked berries in the bottom of the bowl I'm gonna take the brioche and fit it in the bottom remember when you turn it over that's gonna be the top so I want to be sure that there's a really pretty layer okra yosh I'm going to start by doing it around like this let's see how does this fit in so it's you wanted to be sure it fits it nicely so that's just going to sit in there and now another layer of berries and then I could smell the friend blahs when it hits the heat really does a great job of flavoring it and what the oh Sh I find it's easier to assemble it if I cut this in triangles but you still can sort of squish it together and fit it in more berries and juice less lair so now when I turn this out this is the bottom so now I'm just gonna wait it with a plate that's just smaller than the circumference of the souffle dish and then put some kind of a can on top and it's just gonna sit on there for about six or eight hours until it gets sort of denser and absolutely delicious and then I'll take it off and it's gonna be ready whenever I want so while I'm making dinner for my friends tomorrow night I thought I'd make myself a little lunch zucchini with parmesan so I've got some onions cooking here just a little olive oil for five or ten minutes until they're really nicely cooked and a zucchini this is one of my really quick recipes for zucchini to saute it and then hit it with fresh Parmesan cheese at the end it's just delicious then I'm just going to throw this Akemi in and cook this until it's sort of browned on the outside and crisp tender on the inside so I promise I'm Reggiana which is really the best then I'm going to grade it in the food processor but instead of using the grater I'm going to use the steel blade show you how fast it is so all the parmesan just goes right in when you buy from the store you never know when it was grated so I think it's best to grade it yourself so when a salt and pepper this it looks like it's just right so browned on the outside and tender on the inside I'm gonna hit it with a little bit of parmesan until it melts for just a second good lunch I'm just gonna have this Mike chicken stuff with goat cheese and basil so I'm gonna check on the chicken so all the chickens cooked for the chicken stew with biscuits and I had my special lunch chicken with goat cheese and basil you can smell the goat cheese looks so good I'm gonna let this cool in the back I have a wonderful this is so good I should really do this more often I love to plant long rows of tulips because I think the more you put in one ball of each color the better it looks this one's called spring green I think these are gonna be gorgeous they should have quiet very elegant but sometimes I like to be more outrageous so I plant rows of orange tulips or these apricot parrots are just incredible I would never mix them but I think one on the couch will be just gorgeous isn't that incredible love it the good news about parsley is the more you cut it the more it grows and I need lots of it for my chickens still with biscuits chicken stew with biscuits is such a great thing for entertaining because I can assemble the whole thing in advance one of the things I love to do when I'm entertaining is to really master a dish like chicken pot pie or chicken stew and then I can make all different variations of it and I find it so much less stressful so sometimes I'll make chicken stew with biscuits or maybe lobster stew or vegetable stew and I just feel it's really comfortable for me and I know that I can make it really well and now I'm going to make the sauce so I have two cups of onions and one and a half sticks of butter and it's a lot of butter but it's going to make the sauce and they just sauteed for about 10 minutes until the onions are really flavorful and translucent and I'm going to add 3/4 of a cup of flour to thicken it so that's half a cup another quarter so I'm just going to add this and cook it for 30 seconds or a minute just until the flour doesn't have any of that raw flour taste in the meantime I've got five cups of chicken stock this is homemade but use a really good can stock if you don't have some and in order to bump up the flavor I put in two bullion cubes chicken bullion cubes and it just adds great flavor to the sauce okay now I'm gonna add that hot chicken stock basically we're doing is making a white sauce I'm just gonna cook this for a minute until the thickens 2 teaspoons of salt make sure it has great flavor and a half a teaspoon of freshly ground black pepper and then just to make sure it's really good I'm gonna add a quarter of a cup of heavy cream as though it's not rich enough if you want to use half-and-half or milk that's fine too okay now I'm ready to add all the chicken and the vegetables this is six chicken breasts that I roasted off I think I'll do this off the heat actually and about 2 cups of carrots that I blanch for about two minutes right in and now for my secret frozen vegetables some frozen vegetables are really great in this dish they're so easy and they're just as good as fresh vegetables 2 cups of frozen peas one and a half cups of frozen small whole onions so last thing is fresh parsley from my garden and the heat will defrost all the vegetables so comes up perfect now went to the pan I'm going to bake it at 375 for about 15 minutes and meanwhile I'm going to make the biscuits that are going to go on top so now for the biscuits on the chicken stew I have 2 cups of flour tablespoon of baking powder to make them really light teaspoon of salt you'd be surprised how important salt is when you're baking and a teaspoon of sugar I'm just going to mix that together and this is the key ingredient butter so one stick of butter I want it really cold because when you mix it in I want to be sure that it doesn't mix completely into the dough and that's going to go right into the flour and baking powder I'm going to let that mix up until the butter is about the size of peas so while that's going on and get a three-quarters of a cup of half-and-half it just goes right in okay the butters just right last thing we're going to have is about a half a cup of chopped parsley I want this to be a really savory biscuit and that's it we've got the dough for the biscuits the key to this is to make sure they're really light and flaky not like hockey pucks flour on the board I'm going to try and handle this as little as possible so I don't make the butter melt just pull it together it'll be light and flaky and flavorful okay now I'm going to get the stew out of the oven and put the biscuits right on top it's great and just put them right on top in the last biscuit and then what I'm going to do finally is put a little bit of egg wash on the biscuits it's gonna make them really browned and gorgeous egg wash is really an egg and maybe a little bit of water or half and half cream whatever you have around just to thin it okay back in the oven for about twenty to thirty minutes until the chicken stew is really bubbly and hot and the biscuits are nice and browned on the time and then that's all ready for me to reheat it for dinner tomorrow night rum whipped cream for my summer putting it to really good so I have cup of cream I'm going to add three tablespoons of sugar tablespoon of the good stuff good rum it's dark rum I love the way it smells and half a teaspoon of vanilla and just whipping on high smells good already that was noisy into a ball and it's ready for the summer pudding smells like the chicken stew was ready Oh looks so good want to leave it to cool here and then tomorrow night I'm gonna reheat it with a green salad it's gonna be so good now for the moment of truth about my summer pudding it looks pretty good just run a knife on the outside it's the time I always hold my breath but it looks great the berries and the brioche and it worked then that outrageous and so you can smell the berries and the brioche is gonna be just wonderful people are so shocked by it with a big dollop of rum whipped cream on the top it's gonna be so good for dessert for my party tomorrow night I'm even doing the table setting in advance so I've got my gorgeous tool list from the garden I'm thinking green so I've got a white cloth with green dots on it and then I have green plates so you can see once I get a color in my mind I just go with it green everything but different textures and different shades of green think it's really nice okay glasses votive candles and since we're thinking spring green spring green tulips we're done I almost forgot something really important for the party freezing the martini glasses now I'm ready for the party you'd be really surprised how much time I spend in the pantry staring at the shelf I've got pastry cream and I'm trying to write a recipe and I think well what would be good in the pastry cream and I take out some tiny yak mmm that's really good with vanilla so or I've got some whipped cream and I'm trying to figure out what to do with it and I look at the rum and I think Oh dark rum that that would be wonderful but right now I'm making summer pudding so I need Framboise so the
