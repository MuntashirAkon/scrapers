[Music] since we're having a barefoot reunion I thought I'd do all classic recipes and coleslaw is definitely one of those I thought I'd updated a little bit with blue cheese I'll show you how easy it is in a food processor just take the slicing blade on time put the cabbage in sideways so you get long shreds otherwise you get short one how easy is that just keep putting more cabbage on the top and slicing you can't put it in sideways that's half a white or green cabbage pour that into a large ball and now for the red cabbage then the red cabbage goes right on top don't mix them in otherwise the red cabbage in like the white cabbage red just put right on top last thing is Kara I'm going to grate them with a grating disc top that you don't use this very often but when you do it's really useful if it's going too much credit and one that would take by hand and just put that right on top now all the vegetables are ready and make a sauce so the sauce is like 16 ounces of mayonnaise this makes a lot great recipe for a crowd semester we're have quarter of a cup of Dijon mustard two tablespoons of whole grain mustard two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar [Music] absolute celery salt it gives it great flavor as it tastes bit of salt a teaspoon of pepper and whisk that together just for this whole thing not enough salt wasn't it but not so much this wet and sloppy okay now I'm going to add blue cheese and parsley I like rogues are for this got a really sharp flavor I'll just cut off the end the edge and then just chop it up and mix it in put it in I know there are those of you to think the chef smells like gym socks but it's really delicious and okay mix that in and the flavors are really blend as they sit ok blessing is parsley just toss the parsley in mix it in you [Music]
