[Music] so I think I'm going to make Krypton spirit which is like a French ham and cheese sandwich so the first thing I need to do is make a roux which is a white sauce I need two tables from the butter not that three tablespoons of flour and you just dump the flour into all at once cook it over low heat just for about a minute or two until the flour is a little bit cooked white sauce is a really convenient thing to know how to make it's great for thickening things like chicken pot pie it's great in grams now what I'm going to do is add two cups of scalded milk it's nice if it's just a little boiling point and just cook that until it thickens to stir it the whole time so it doesn't burn okay so just a little bit boiling point so now I'm going to add teaspoon salt 1/2 a teaspoon of pepper and a pinch of nutmeg it's classic and white sauce 1/2 a cup of Parmesan cheese and half a cup of grated Gruyere and it's all just going to melt together in the sauce so it's really nice cheese soft lots of flavor because the parmesan grier taste very different it gives a real depth of flavor it looks good ok now I'm going to assemble them so what I've done is I toasted the bread taking off the crust and I bake them at 400 degrees for about 5 minutes turn them to baking another two minutes and they're ready to go now what I'm going to do is put a little mustard on one side cryptids here the classic French lunch and any good cafe in France has croque monsieur or crook madam which has it's exactly the same thing with the fried egg on top so get it thinly sliced a really good either big Virginia ham or a black forest ham something like that and then sprinkle some three around on top the other slice on top of that a [Music] little bit of the cheese on really cheesy or gray on top so the bakery is at 400 degrees for five minutes and then I'm going to broil them for three to five minutes would be nice and brown and crusty on the top [Music] have some the boiler and it was bad dizzy lunch is ready this is my idea of what a business meeting should be having a tough mature which is a French ham and cheese sandwich isn't a scences I hope it does hmm
