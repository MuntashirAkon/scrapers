[Music] my friend Carol Barden is coming to stay she builds the most gorgeous houses in Houston Texas she's coming too late for dinner so I'm gonna make her a special treat tonight and then tomorrow morning I've invited some friends for breakfast they're all extraordinary entrepreneurs so I think they'll get along famously when Carol arised I'm going to have a fruit and cheese tray ready this delicious homemade parmesan crackers then in the morning I'm making a decadent breakfast bread pudding with maple roasted bacon delicious roasted garlic and herb tomatoes and a sparkling pomegranate fizz drink I love having guests for breakfast the food is easy everybody's relaxed you can sit in the garden it's a great start to the day so I thought it'd be nice to have something welcoming and delicious for my friend Carol but of course it's too late to have dinner so I'm gonna make some homemade crackers parmesan and thyme crackers and a little fruit and cheese tray and then we can just hang out and catch up so the first thing I need to do for the parmesan crackers is I need 2 cups of grated Parmesan cheese okay I think I have about that it's about 3 ounces that's good enough so I'm starting with is a quarter of a pound of butter at room temperature it's already been mixed in the mixer and I'm just going to add the parmesan and then I need to add one teaspoon of thyme you can really use any kind of herbs you like but I just like the combination of parmesan in time I actually found these crackers when I was in London with a friend and there's a wonderful market called Borough Market that sets up on Saturdays it's like a real farmers market it's just wonderful everybody brings their fresh produce and I saw these crackers in the store and they come in all different kinds of cheese and herb flavors like blue cheese and rosemary and I just left these parmesan in time ones will be perfect for my friend Carol okay that should be it I'm just gonna get and I can chop it all up it's a rough chop at the time okay one teaspoon right into the mixer yeah a half a teaspoon of black pepper [Music] next thing we do is combine one and a quarter cups of flour plus a quarter teaspoon of salt just mix it together and then with the mixer on low I'm just gonna add the flour to the butter mixture let's add it slowly so it's incorporated so just like making shortbread cookies this is gonna make a log and then I'm gonna slice it into crackers and bake it this is perfect good looks beautiful it's very important for the butter to be room temperature otherwise it'll never come together it's gonna make about thirty six crackers okay just a little flour on the board roll out the dough I roll and I took about 12 or 13 inches doesn't matter exactly it really depends on how thick you want the crackers or how big you want them okay perfect I'm just gonna wrap it in plastic wrap and I'm gonna freeze it for about 30 minutes until it's really firm and then I'm gonna cut it and bake it next I'm gonna get the cheese is ready so just gonna make the cheese board now sighs some brie I was like to take the labels off cheese's hate when there's paint on a cheese board and that piece of still good English Stilton I just love so I always like to have some kind of a flat leaf and hydrangea leaves are great I'm in a classic or fig leaves but I can't really find them here in California you can just some kind of I think it really makes everything looks so much fresher and so much livelier unfortunately a hydrangea bushes in the front of my house so just sort of put them randomly it doesn't have to be perfect in fact it shouldn't be perfect it should be just random and then something green is always really important so a big bunch of grapes just right in the middle and some clementines that's important just big spots of color and dates these are really good in the jewel dates I love them I wish I put these guys right there just sort of spilling out then I'm gonna leave it in a space right here for the crackers when they come out of the oven nice knife so we can help ourselves now that can't be any easier countess it's actually great for cheese to eat room temperature so I'm just cleave in at room temperature right now so next thing I need to do is just bake the parmesan in time crackers they've been chili for about 30 minutes good thing about these guys is you can actually make them in advance and keep them in the freezer or the refrigerator and just bake them off whenever you need them I'm just gonna slice them about a quarter of an inch thick it's gonna be great with a fruit and cheese tray that's just nice to make a little something so I'm just gonna put these on a sheet tray these things don't expand like cookies they they pretty much keep their shape when you bake them so you can put them pretty close together on the sheet pan okay into the oven twenty two minutes at 350 degrees and they're gonna be golden brown Parmesan time crackers which is perfect timing because I think carols do just about them [Music] some grapes please so glad you're here I'm so glad I'm here just be able to do a little snack before you go to bed I couldn't have you just arrived and have nothing to you there little parmesan and thyme crackers that I made mmm oh this is so good with thank you nobody cooks like this for me [Music] so Carol's got her coffee I told her it's a vacation stay in bed and read while I start breakfast I'm gonna make a breakfast bread pudding it's so decadent and so delicious it's really like french toast but I'm just gonna bake it in a dish so I'm not standing at the stove making them individually so the first thing I did was cut up a hollow you can use any kind of brioche or egg bread and then I'm gonna make the custard our bread pudding is usually dessert but I'm gonna make a breakfast one with orange zest and not so much sweetness so I have 5 eggs and 2 extra egg yolks I use extra large eggs I'm gonna do two and a half cups of half-and-half that's the decadent part [Music] third of a cup of honey always think about French toast is really bread that's been dipped in a custard and so now I'm just gonna bake it with the custard actually love breakfast parties everybody so much energy in the morning and then you have the whole rest of the day to yourself why don't have teaspoons of good vanilla that's good and you make it takes even more like breakfast I'm gonna do two teaspoons of grated orange zest then I'll choose the oranges for later look I just want some cord in the morning [Music] okay that should be about two teaspoons okay the last thing is 1/2 teaspoon salt basically just making a custard but not a sweet one breakfast one whisk it all together and then while I'm do is layer the collet bread the custard and some white raisins and then I'll serve it with good maple syrup how bad could that be okay ready to assemble it so take some bread just layer it and the pan okay next thing we do is texting bolded raises just put me in between the layers and I want to have the golden raisins on the top because otherwise I'll actually burn in the oven just a handful just a little sort of it's like having raisins with your oatmeal and then we'll pour the custard over the whole thing it's gonna be so much easier than standing at the stove making french toast okay press this down just to make sure it soaks into the bread actually if you have day-old bread it's even better because a little drier it soaks up the custard better just press it down a little bit okay it's gonna learn a baking sheet let's go so for another 15 minutes and then I'm gonna bake at 350 degrees for about 55 to 60 minutes gonna be puffed and golden and gorgeous and now we need some flowers for the table [Music] forget fancy flower arrangements I really like casual ones from the garden and I have to say hydrangeas are my favorite best thing about them is they're always different I sort of start out this wonderful lime green and then they turn white and then this core just sort of hot pink color but I think this would be really gorgeous and casual front breakfast [Music] why don't we make breakfast so complicated I hate standing at the stove flipping french toast and even worse I hate having bacon in the frying pan I feel like I have to clean the kitchen afterwards so what I've devised is a way to do bacon in the oven so you take a sheet pan and a baking rack and just lay the strips of bacon on the baking pan you don't have to turn them you don't have to watch them they come at perfectly flat and I'll wrinkled up the way they do in a frying pan this is thick cut bacon you can use any kind of baked and you like to put it right on the pan okay into the oven 400 degrees for about 15 to 20 minutes depending on the thickness of the bacon and then I'm gonna do something really special with [Music] so with the breakfast bread pudding and the maple roasted bacon I thought I'm gonna do Gerlich and herb tomatoes I'm gonna use these wonderful grape tomatoes and he kind of cherry tomatoes great friends they'll be perfect so first I'm gonna heat up some oil about three tablespoons and chop up some garlic two cloves of garlic make it really garlicky it's kind of an odd combination of flavors but it really works well together so to make the maple a little less sweet a little more savory so one of the keys to this is you only cook the garlic too long because you don't want it to burn it has sort of a bitter taste when it burns so I'm just gonna cook it for about 30 seconds in the olive oil and then add the tomatoes and lots of fresh green herbs right into the oil well that is really fast and the garlic smells just afraid okay next with tomatoes I've two pints of cherry tomatoes these are the grape tomatoes but any kind of small tomatoes like that in the summer a lot of cherry tomatoes taste great but I find the grape tomatoes not as high season always tastes good okay let's go give him a little cross and then lots of fresh green herbs the two tablespoons of parsley [Music] it's not so good smell like garlic everywhere even is curly parsley or flat leaf parsley whatever you happened okay two tablespoons right in two tablespoons of fresh basil leaves [Music] it's going to tick up the leaves Oh get the tomatoes popping it's really nice basil just great for pungent smell so just layer them up do it Julian I think roll it up tight and just slice it [Music] just like that two tablespoons maybe a little more some fresh thyme just hold the stem I think I'll do it right into the tomato about two teaspoons of fresh thyme [Music] okay so that's the time teaspoon salt to put a pepper and this is gonna just saute away for better five to seven minutes just until the tomatoes start to burst a little bit and there's so much flavor you can just see the flavor maybe I'm low heat and that's ready so if you think oven roasted bacon is good enough white teas do this what is it about hot bacon that smells so good mmm so I'm going to take a little bit of maple syrup just put it in a dish it's got to be good maple syrup dark amber grade-a not the stuff that's maple flavored which has nothing to do with maple syrup just brush a little bit of maple syrup on each of the slices of bacon and you've got maple roasted bacon it's so good just a little bit on each one and next I'm making a pomegranate fizz to go with all this really good breakfast treat mmm back into the oven just to crisp it up it's gonna be so good with breakfast bread pudding [Music] I always want to make something special to drink for a party but can't have cocktails for breakfast so I thought I'm gonna make a pomegranate fizz which is so easy to make and so delicious it's also actually good for you so first I have pomegranate juice one of the third cups we're going to pour it all into a pitcher it's just delicious sparkling water two and a half cups we don't really have to measure it you can just pour it right into the jar it's about 1/3 and 2/3 1/3 pomegranate juice 2/3 sparkling water [Music] yeah okay little fresh lime juice about two tablespoons I suppose you could do this with champagne but I think for breakfast this would be great 1 tablespoon superfine sugar simplifying triggers great because it dissolves really quickly it's good for drinks I think I might slice a few limes just for the glasses so everybody knows it flying I just think that nice pomegranate fizz is gonna be good with the maple roasted bacon breakfast bread pudding garlic and herb tomatoes okay so nice slice lines just make sure it tastes good it's so good it's sort of tart and sweet ooh it's gonna be really good with breakfast what's a great color that's the best part I love the color isn't it great okay I skipped breakfast bread pudding out of the oven I'll be right back don't have any fun until I get back Wow that's amazing and it smells good too okay everybody breakfast bread pudding I decided I wanted to make this really decadent so I knew when Carol was coming for the night and these guys get along famously because you're interested in architecture and it's turned out okay right this is my idea of a great way to start the day I think we're all gonna have to go take a nap tomorrow you're invited back I think I'll still be here breakfast in the garden with great friends thank you I didn't Carole needs a little bit [Music]
