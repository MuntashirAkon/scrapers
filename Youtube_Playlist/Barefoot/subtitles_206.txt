[Music] when my friends come to visit I want them to feel like they've checked into the most fabulous country house hotel I want them to sleep really well and I want them to eat really well which is why I'm going to make my fennel roast salmon can be so delicious when I have friends for the weekend I hate being stuck in the kitchen the whole time so what I'm going to do is I'm going to make several recipes where the leftovers become other recipes so this wonderful salmon with fennel that I'm going to make the leftovers are going to become salmon salad for lunch tomorrow and nobody will ever know how easy it was what I'm going to do is fill this whole salmon with sliced fennel and onions and orange and thyme very Provence all spices and then pull this em and over and it will be filled and tied and it's going to be absolutely delicious so now for the filling I want lots of filling actually for two reasons one is because it has great flavor but also I want the salmon to be big and round the way it was when it was swimming around in the sea so about a 1/2 a cup of olive oil and then I'm going to put in the 2 key ingredients here our onions about 5 cups of sliced onions and then about 5 cups of sliced fennel so this is a mandolin it's a great piece of equipment it's also incredibly dangerous so there's a slicer blade right here which you can let raise or lower depending on how thick you want this channel to be slice so the key is to keep your hands out of the way and slice it looks like that right on this and as you get lower you want to keep your hand really out of the way and if you don't have a mandolin a regular knife is perfectly fine just takes ever so slightly longer that should do it see how fast that was once what all this sounds in this pan salt and pepper I always want to salt things as you go along because then the flavoring really is enhanced rather than sitting on the top of the fennel and onions it's going to cook for about 10 minutes in the oil on a medium heat until the onions in the phenols are really translucent and then I'm going to add all kinds of gorgeous for myself flavorings to it so that's perfect for the onions and fennel I just cooked through and just starting to brand and I'm going to add the wonderful ingredients so the two tablespoons of fennel fronds and three tablespoons of fresh thyme leaves live when the heat hits that you can smell it and the dest of one orange and I'm going to put in the juice of one orange about two tablespoons when the orange juice hits the onions and fennel it just when it's hot it just absorbs or beautifully and then lots of salt and pepper to make sure it has great flavor so I'm going to cook this for about five more minutes insatiable love of orange when it goes in I've got a baking sheet with parchment paper on it and it goes into the oven for five minutes and then I'm going to assemble the salmon with a filling tie the whole thing up and put it right on the hot baking sheet and it's really great so I've got the whole salmon that my fishmonger butterflied for me took all the bones out and all the guts and stuff out and I'm just going to season both have with salt and pepper okay now I'm going to take this filling and just pour it on one side of the salmon right down the middle and then take this entire side and flip it over the filling just like that and then I'm going to tie it with kitchen twine about every two inches just like this so it keeps the filling in and it keeps the shape of the salmon perfectly well just like this you can actually make this whole thing in advance but if you want to keep it in the refrigerator cool the filling first and then put it in the salmon and it'll sit in the fridge for a day and then you can throw it into the oven a half an hour before you want to serve it okay so that's really take my hot pan and back in the 500 degree oven for exactly 30 minutes and it's going to be perfect it'll be browned on the outside and succulent and delicious on the inside and my friends I can love it oh here's your room okay you guys make yourself comfortable and probably naturally Danielle Cheers thank you you look seeing it a little bit oh let's take a look at these chocolates what's this look it's a great good [Music] beautiful that feels really good music - we won't be here for at least a couple of days Oh Sam fabulous and love the way it looks all brown on the outside and juicy on the inside I'm going to cut off the strings and then I'll slice it when it's at the table and my friends think it's just an ordinary dinner gonna be really great I just love when the garnish it's from whatever the flavorings are on the dish so that's done got all kinds of greens I have a vinaigrette right in the bottom that was ready and waiting okay everybody dinner's ready I don't know if you think this is enough for the three of us but I'm in a home with family that learned is for you Susan I don't know what earns the Trinity pulse haven't filled with fennel and onions and thyme and I'm just real net or frozen pie would you do it really hard temperature Oh so while my friends rest had having a little private time by themselves I'm going to make lunch with what was left over from dinner last night they'll never recognize it I've had two pounds of salmon leftover salmon salad is wonderful when the salmon is cold you'll see its flakes better watch this just flake it in big flakes into this bowl then what's so moist and tender just going to be delicious so I think we put in celery and onions if the celery has a lot of strings on it an easy way to get rid of a lot it's just run your knife right down the back of it look right in the middle okay then we rough dice we really didn't this so that should be good pile it on top and then we'll mix the whole thing together and then some red onion to give it a little bit of spice the trick to chopping red onion easily is to leave one end intact and it will keep the whole onion together while you chop it and keep your hand out of the way slice it this way and we'll just do a nice dice that's be enough okay red onion and I think some deal would be good in this just run your knife along the edge and take it off the stems I love dill so maybe about two tablespoons of fresh dill would be great on top I love the way the colors look to the next thing I wanted something a little vinegary and I think capers will do the trick and what I'm going to do is I'm going to drain the capers and then put about two tablespoons of capers in it just have a nice spice that don't overpower the flavor I mean they're good little vinegary kind of flavor in it and this is the key ingredient for the salad I love raspberry vinegar with salmon it has a sweetness that somehow really complements the salmon and what I'm going to do is instead of mixing a vinaigrette I'm just pouring it right over the salad so two tablespoons and raspberry vinegar and two tablespoons of olive oil I love the way to select them they'll never recognize it from the roast salmon last night [Music] so delicious you can face all the pressures and famine comes through very clearly and be wonderful for lunch [Music] curried couscous is the quintessential recipe if you can boil water you can make this what I've done is put the couscous and boiling water and a tablespoon of butter in this bowl and I'm just going to it's been sitting here for five minutes and it all you want to do with the fork is just fluff it up a little bit cliff because looks like a grain but it's a pasta semolina and this is North African couscous Israeli couscous has a larger grains that is basically the same thing it's a dried pasta sometimes because because it serves hot I put the lamb dish and vegetables and Moroccan style and sometimes it's served home temperature like this for there are two parts first we want to make the trough and then we're going to check in all kinds of great vegetables the sauce is made with yogurt and curry and I'm just going to whisk them together you can use any kind of yogurt you have around non-fat yogurt low-fat yogurt about a quarter of a cup and a bed a quarter of a cup of olive oil and then white wine vinegar I use white wine vinegar but if you have champagne vinegar whatever you have around it's great just going to make a little creamy sauce which is great curry powder using this how did you like or as mild as you like and turmeric turmeric is one of the ingredients in curry powder but I think it adds a really nice yellow color to this sauce add it in and then salt and pepper remember it's like pasta it needs some good flavouring in it and I'm just going to pour it over the couscous and mix it in I always do this with a fork you don't want the couscous to get tamp down so that's the couscous and then we're going to get all kinds of delicious vegetables in it the first thing is I've got some diced carrots which I think was the great color for that and diced red onion gives it a little bit of heat and some chopped scallions and then parsley get all the herbs in and the two last ingredients are sliced almonds and raisins and this too you can use whatever you like if you like cashews you can put them in I think the almonds look really great and they give a nice crunch to the salad and instead of raisins you can use currants which is sort of smaller and have a little more tartness or you can use dried cranberries you're good so I'm just going to 12 all together big spoons looks gorgeous we'll leave this ass better at room temperature and make my orange try some my friends are here for the weekend and I've already made salmon salad and couscous and now I'm going to make a trifle for dessert what I'm making here is the orange cream that's going to go on the layers of cake and cream and raspberry jam and fresh raspberries so good so what I've done is I've scalded some milk which means to bring it up to just below a simmer with some orange zest it's 1/2 1/2 cups of milk and the zest of one orange and now I'm going to thicken it so over here I have in the mix or five egg yolks that were room-temperature and half a cup of sugar and I'd leave them until they're really light and now I'm going to add two tablespoons of cornstarch since fuck my he had custard actually okay so while that's going on mostly I'm going for the hot milk into the egg yolk mmm so delicious I can smell the orange already so on very low speed so doesn't splatter just going to pour a hot milk into these egg yolk that's great the hot milk and the orange chef and now I'm going to take the whole thing and pour it back into the pan and I'm going to cook it until it thickens so it's like making a custard great back on the fire this is the process where you want to watch it really carefully because if it cooks too much you're not going to end up with orange custard you'll end up with orange scrambled eggs it's not delicious so I'm just going to keep stirring this with a wooden spoon and if it starts to thicken as it's going right now I just get a whisk and just turn off the heat and just whisk it so that's it thickened great and now I'm going to add the flavoring half a teaspoon of vanilla good vanilla it's really important 1/2 a teaspoon of orange liqueur and that might get a little more but that'll be fine a tablespoon of butter and it tapes from the heavy cream this is really wonderful now the last thing is just to be sure there's nothing that looks like scrambled eggs in this I'm going to strain it I'm just going to put a little piece of plastic wrap not over the bowl but actually over the orange cream itself just right on the top and that will make sure that it stays really creamy okay into the fridge to chill and I'm going to lay the table this is my favorite model recent revolt when I travel I love to buy local dishes and flatware things to the table I was like when the napkins match the flowers it gives me a guideline so it's simple it's lunch and I'm going to make the trifle so we've got orange cake raspberry jam the orange cream that I allowed to cool and now I'm going to make some whipped cream the whipped cream is really heavy cream sugar I'm going to use about a cup of cold heavy cream and two tablespoons of sugar and I want it whipped so it's firm and I'm going to add a little bit of vanilla they do better half a teaspoon it's a great treat okay that's perfect just right okay now I'm going to just assemble the whole thing so I'm going to slice the cake and then spread each layer with some raspberry jam okay so each of these layers is going to go in the bottom drizzle some of the orange cream on top and then fresh raspberries I'm going to bigd all the whipped cream this is definitely not something want to eat every day but for a special treat when you have guests coming to stay it's wonderful very casual more raspberries more with creams usually the trifles that are made at the holidays have a lot of liquor in them and they're a little too strong for me so I thought wouldn't it be nice to make something a little lighter and it turned out to be good and then finally raspberries on top a big dollop of whipped cream and I don't think anybody's going to be disappointed but I just have this tiny little piece left over that have to make sure it's okay not bad so this is going to go in the fridge and home ready for lunch and I'm going to show you the simplest sugar snap pea salad you've ever seen my friend staying for the weekend and I've already made salmon salad and couscous and now I'm going to make the easiest thing you can possibly imagine so pay attention sugar snap peas which I love and what I did was take the end off and peel the string down and then blanch them which is putting them in boiling water for about a minute and then taking them out and putting them in cold water and they're just sitting there frigerator and this is the sauce consommé oil and black sesame seeds this is Asian sesame oil so it smells like sesame seeds not that clear flavorless sesame oil and black sesame seeds which you can find in the Asian section of the grocery store and you toss them together maybe with a little salt and that's it it's done and it is just delicious [Music] he's already I made salmon salad with it well we're ready fresh salmon with dill and capers and raspberry vinegar couscous and sugar snap peas cool so everything's ready you guys ready for lon oh yeah how's that that's what you love yourself Sherman so much I think we'll all take a math after this right well they were so hard to make it took me all afternoon [Laughter] clearly better than something nice and life for dessert if it's not a vacation when you're here it's not fun right orange cream and if that isn't enough little whipped cream to top it off how's that how we go oh I took all the calories out before it's served with a couple of raspberries don't you feel like it the fruits of it right welcome that's what we convinced so far no mining this is about as grand as it gets oh thank you where's I sign up she really makes weekend [Music]
