[Music] Barbara live F is my assistant and dear friend her daughter Cassandra is not only gorgeous but she's a competitive beach volleyball player I thought it'd be fun for Barbara and me to take a picnic down to the beach and watch them play for Barbara and me I'm making sweet and spicy curry chicken wraps containers of panzanella an Italian vegetable salad with toasted bread cubes and I'm sending Cassandra to the beach with peanut butter and jelly bars for all the volleyball players to give them energy I've never been one for going to the beach and lying in the Sun but for a picnic with Barbara and a volleyball game I'm willing to get a little sand in my shoes at one time or another we've all thought it was a good idea to cook at the beach it's not little gust of wind sand in your food so I'm gonna make a picnic for Barbara and me but everything's made in advance and so I served at room temperature first thing is curry chicken laughs first thing I do is roast chicken and what I've got is chicken breast on the bone for the skin still on I've tried it a million different ways that's the best way to make cooked chicken salad rub a little olive oil on the top whoa better lot just a little sprinkle with salt and pepper into the oven 350 degrees for about 35 to 40 minutes and a semi tender and juicy I wasn't wanting to make a dessert that tasted like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich I thought cookies no peanut butter and jelly bars and I made them and people went crazy so I thought it'd be fun to give to Cassandra to take down to the beach for her friends maybe everyone left over for Barbara and me so I'll show you how to make the first thing is and of course I have to kind of butter getting a bad reputation here one and a half cups of sugar but this is like a shortbread with peanut butter in it and jelly in the middle so cream together the butter and sugar be sure to use room-temperature butter it makes all the difference in the world when you're baking I just need it for a minute until it's light and fluffy and then on a low speed add two eggs one at a time he's been a vanilla and 18 ounces of peanut butter yikes okay now for the dry ingredients three cups of flour one teaspoon of baking powder and one and a half of salt just sift that all together so it's really as simple as making shortbread okay with a mixer on low just slowly put the dry ingredients into the wet ones or should I say the dry ingredients in the peanut ones hope in a cloud of flour okay that looks great yeah it's like one big peanut butter cookie put the Dex go pan then I greased and floured and put a little parchment paper on the bottom so I'm gonna take 2/3 of the dough and just Pat it on the bottom a little bit and just Pat this out into the bottom of the pan to the champ art but 18 am chance of jam which has got one and a half cups smells like a PB&amp;J sandwich another six ounces so we have 18 ounces all together just spread it evenly over the peanut butter shortbread layer and peanut butter crumble on the top so take the shortbread and just little pieces of dough just drop them across the top it doesn't have to touch when it bakes it all go together just sort of crumble it evenly on top and then we put nuts on top peanuts I'll give it a crunch so it's creamy it's sweet it's peanut e and it's crunchy I bet can that be very casual okay let's play on the top of chopped peanuts salted peanuts are really good these are gonna bake it's 350 degrees for 45 minutes and you would believe how good they are chicken should be done for the Kurd chicken wraps way you can tell is by pressing if it's really firm to the touch it's done so I'm just going to let this cool I'm gonna go shopping for ingredients for my panzanella wait you see this so I've done some cooking and I'm off to the market to get vegetables to my panzanella and the Kurd chicken rest nice thing about a small town is the markets not so far away so sometimes I come to the produce market it's sort of the equivalent of standing the refrigerator door looking for inspiration just looking for something that would be great I'm making curried chicken wraps in a tortilla and you know I think might be nice a little bit of celery for a crunch would be good and a little scallion for a little bite that'll be good too the next thing I'm gonna make is panzanella which is like a chunky vegetable salad with toasted cubes of bread and vinaigrette all over it it's so good and I'm gonna get some red peppers that looks like a nice firm one some yellow peppers that's a pretty one you want really firm things that if their wrinkly they've been around too long these are gorgeous and the last thing I wanted some some cucumbers now you can get these regular cucumbers these are sort of a garden-variety cucumbers but they're a little bit bitter and I find that skin very tough the ones I love are called hot house or seedless cucumbers and they're very thin-skinned they're absolutely delicious and they have very little seeds and they're sweet it'll be so good in the panzanella hey who are you good or just dead [Music] if butter and jelly bars are baked and cooled what do you see in them not look amazing Cassandra and her friends are gonna go crazy so far we're gonna pack them up and send them to the beach and had to be something beachy so I thought I'd wrap them all in parchment and send them in a little beach pale pale so what I made for you I made a beach pale filled with peanut butter and jelly I think we can probably fudge one right here nobody'll ever know so the peanut butter shortbread with raspberry jam delicious and napkins for the beach and I'll see you at the beach I can't wait to watch you play volleyball okay I've never since she was five she incredibly lovely I can't wait to see her play volleyball she's amazing so the chickens cooked for the chicken curry wraps and I have to make the sauce one and a half cups of mayonnaise use good mayonnaise it makes such a difference third of a cup of white wine that'll thin it and give it a better texture and flavor quarter of a cup of chutney curry and chutneys a classic combination and three tablespoons of good curry powder you know they're all different kinds of curry powder is actually an assortment of spices some are spicy or some are sweeter I like a sweet one someone can put three tablespoons in but it depends on what kind of curry powder you use so maybe start with two and then add more 1/2 teaspoons of salt already smells good I love curry and chutney together looks good so now I'm going to show you how I do chicken you can cut it up for chicken sound lots of different ways I can dice it but I find for something like the wraps if you shred the chicken it actually catches more of the sauce it's better in a wrap so I'm just gonna take the skin off and then just with your fingers just pull the meat away from the bone I wanna make sure they're cool enough so you can handle them and then just start shredding it you can see that the chickens really moist makes such a difference instead of boiling chicken for salad to roast it like that really keeps the texture and the flavor I'm gonna pour on the sauce a few more ingredients two stalks of celery get some crunch and two scallions give it a little heat and a quarter of a cup of raisins these are all the topics that you'd normally have when curry and later I'm gonna add roasted cashews so we'll put this in the fridge until the flavors blend really well and then I'm gonna make panzanella which is this delicious Italian salad with bread I brought some peanut butter and jelly bars strawberry jelly my favorite is a peanut butter cookie almost we got the peanuts in the top like chunky peanut butter it's good stuff I actually didn't move to the beach can be tricky sometimes you want something's really easy to eat that can be served at room temperature my assistant Barbara and I are going to the beach and I'm gonna take panzanella which she loves and I think I'll serve it in those Chinese takeout containers first thing we do is heat up some oil and then toast break cubes in it Italians made up the salad to use leftover bread so it's a great way to use it if it's a little bit dry it's even better really soaks up a vinaigrette big chunks the first time Barbara and I tested this recipe we we decided any salad that has bread cubes dipped in vinaigrette was just fine with us I think we actually ate around the vegetables okay oils hot just tossing the bread cubes no salt tell them around your home and while those toasts I'm gonna make a nice garlic vinaigrette for the salad can't make garlic vinaigrette with that one clove of garlic I need a bad teaspoon it should be just right now okay so about a teaspoon of garlic right into the bowl half a teaspoon of good Dijon mustard three tablespoons if I use champagne vinegar you can use any good white wine vinegar half a cup of good olive oil mustard will actually emulsify the vinaigrette which is nice 1/2 a teaspoon of salt 1/4 of a teaspoon of pepper and that's the vinaigrette so next is getting vegetables ready the first thing is the cucumber I really like seedless cucumbers that are called English or hothouse cucumbers just right off the ends cut it in half and then with a small spoon or a tea spoon just take out the seeds it's called seedless but it has a few seeds but it's so much less bitter than regular American cucumbers it's just when a knife right down in the middle what this a really chunky salad you don't want finely chopped so I already have red peppers yellow peppers and red onions thinly sliced I got chunky cucumbers this is gonna make a lot of sound and the longer it sits the better it tastes okay that's the cucumbers got Tomatoes these are good Israeli Tomatoes so big chunky slices of tomato it's a really casual salad okay so into a ball [Music] that great it's so colorful okay then I'm gonna add some capers about three tablespoons fresh basil okay that looks a good part croutons they're perfectly toasted great warm croutons vinaigrette [Music] smell so good on coot on from the vinaigrette are so good together in the vegetable base all capers that's gonna be really good at the beach and Bart was going to be thrilled [Music] the things that I put in the curry salad or things that are traditionally served with curry raisins chutney and caffeine thinking about cashews is sometimes they've been sitting around in the package for a while so I always like to dry sautee them just for a few minutes to crisp them up a little bit I once salted roasted cashews just heat them in a dry pan until they're warm through wouldn't believe what a difference it hasn't flavor even when I'm just serving cashews with strengths I hate them up like this so when these are done I'm gonna fish the chicken salad put it in the wrap and we're off to the beach so the last thing I have to add to the chicken salad before I put them in the wraps is salted roasted cashews I chopped them up I thought they'd be easier to eat in a wrap this looks pretty good that's a lot here so I'm gonna make a wrap one each for Barbara and me show how this works it's big spoon of chicken sound right in the middle so I'm gonna fold the ends in and then roll the whole thing up just like that I'm just going to cut it in half separate things and one more you really do this with any kind of salad just fold the ends in and wrap it up around this chicken salad how great that works hack it up and that even the sand can get in their mouth at panzanella peanut-butter-and-jelly bars stay and we're ready to go to the beach [Music] how are they doing they're doing great who's winning well it's kind of going back and forth like on his court sitting here watching them play oh I'd love to have a pretty color my favorite my favorite Chinese takeout containers perfect creaking and round delicious lots of bread stuffing vinaigrette oh my bloody tested this recipe we had all that break but I'm the only thing that wasn't let's try some bit I'm so glad that you didn't eat the peanut butter jelly bars [Laughter]
