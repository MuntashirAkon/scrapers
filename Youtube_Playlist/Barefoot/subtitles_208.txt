[Music] my friend Frank has invited some friends to dinner tonight and I'm testing soup recipes all day so I said what are we join forces I'll bring soup to your house for dinner that way he doesn't have to cook and I can rotate as my recipes the first soup is a really hearty lentil soup with spicy sausage and it's sprinkled with freshly grated Parmesan cheese the second recipe is a seafood stew that's full of shrimp and chunky fish just like a classic bluey bez but it's so much easier to make and to go with the soups I'm testing lighter-than-air chive biscuits with chives from my own garden it's funny how you can get yourself invited for dinner when you bring the dinner I wish I'd known that when I was 20 [Music] some of my lentil soup first thing is lentils and what I'm gonna do is soak them in boiling water they dose up for about 15 minutes just softens them enough and then I'm gonna make big pot of soup and put them in and cook so I was with most soups I start with onions I'm just a really important process and you want to do it carefully and slowly so you really get the most flavor from the onions four cups of onions it's about three large onions at four cups of leeks it makes a lot of soup I have to say most of my soup recipes are huge amounts of soup because you can freeze it so easily and then you have soup for months one tablespoon of chopped garlic we're just met three cloves of garlic okay how about a tablespoon of fresh thyme leaves I'm just gonna do approximately just hold it by the end and just run your fingers down the stem next thing is a teaspoon of cumin there's actually sort of classic combination they're really good to get it lentils and cumin tablespoon of salt and one and a half teaspoons or half a tablespoon of pepper I'm just going to cook this for about 20 minutes until the onions and the leeks are tender and translucent and then and lots of good stuff to the soup well that already smells great can really smell the onions and the leeks and the cumin and the time it's going to be wonderful hearty soup okay so while this cook I'm gonna chop up some vegetables so the first thing is carrots keep it the vegetables you want to have them chopped and roughly the same size so they cook evenly so I tend to like things not too fine I actually like it to look like it's homemade okay just big days more carrots so these carrots aren't quite so big so I'm just gonna boot cut them like this I do find that carrots that you buy with the tops on tend to be a little fresher tasting a little sweeter okay so that's the carrots and celery I'm going to do it right down the middle I'm Barefoot Contessa we have recipes for lentil soup but like called for a 40 pound bag of carrots or case of celery and you'd end up with like 200 quarts of soup it was really good okay so that's the carrots and the celery let me see if onions are ready no they're just simmering way here yeah they're perfect everything's cooked really nicely together the onions are really tender Lise okay now I'm going to add all the vegetables lots of celery four cups of celery and then four cups of carrots it's gonna be really hard a soup okay just saute those for a minute someone drain the lentils and I think Wendell's got a really bad rap in the 70s it was considered like hippie vegetarian food but I think they're really good and what I like is the green lentils I think they're firmer than the brown lentils and have more flavor next is chicken stock how my chicken stuck you can use canned chicken stock but I have to say it's one of those things I really like homemade chicken second it's so easy to make so I have three quarts you'll go right in somebody find veal stock beef stock there's so much more complicated but chicken stock you throw a couple of chickens in a pot with some carrots and celery thyme whole peppercorns it's so easy and I'm always in the kitchen for a couple of hours and it just boils away and then you have a really good stock to make soups with I just keep it in the freezer and it's ready whenever I want to make soup okay so that's three quarts of chicken stock and then a quart of a cup of tomato paste gives it a lot of flavor it's surprising and last but not least lentils so this is a pound of lentils that I've soaked for about 15 minutes just pour them all in this is a big pot of soup so we're just going to simmer this for about an hour all the flavors are going to blend together and then it Franks has someone add spicy kielbasa sausage and I'm going to serve it with a drizzle of olive oil red wine and some Parmesan cheese delicious [Music] hmmm chive biscuits I thought they'd be wonderful with my soups thinking biscuits really is a lot like making scones the same sort of process so first I need 2 cups of flour into my mixer the key to both of them is the butter you want it really cold and you want it in big chunks so they stay nice and light and fluffy one tablespoon of baking powder one teaspoon of soft [Music] and once you spill of sugar just a little bit of sweetness in them okay the next thing is butter so once take a very cold butter and we're going to dice it and then put it in the mixer and the mixers can do all the work [Music] okay I'm just going to mix it until the butters about the size of peas okay meantime I need 3/4 of a cup of half-and-half can really make scones with any kind of savory herb like time would be wonderful for Sage maybe for Thanksgiving making with Said's I'd be good with turkey until that's ready on one chop some chives just line them up nice sharp knife hmm smells great it's a really delicate onion flavor it's gonna be good in the biscuits okay got a half a cup who's gonna put it in at the end so it doesn't get all smashed up a really fresh chive flavor okay that looks good I can pour the cream in slowly with a mixer on it's a really wet dough but it's really delicious and the chives okay they're ready to roll out okay flour the board that's a really nice dough I can really smell the chives too it's great good that's sticky this should make better 8-bit biscuits just keep moving around on the board you just want to make sure it doesn't stick and you can pat them out or you can roll the map I was like to roll it looks nice smooth even biscuit I just think it's nice if you have something as simple as soup to have something a little special like homemade bread okay two and a half inch cutter just come out put them on the pan these are great served on their own but they're also absolutely delicious sort of as a little sandwich like a 40 or something I bet than that thing that's great exactly eight okay now I'm going to do a little egg wash make the tops nice and brown and a little bit of half-and-half just whisk it together that easy to do in a small ball okay I'm just gonna brush the top slightly well these are gonna be just delicious with soups okay - like the smell of biscuits 400 degrees for about 20 minutes and when a delicious jive biscuits with our soup [Music] I love a classic French boy abyss but it takes forever to make so instead I'm going to make a seafood stew with all the same flavors shellfish shrimp fish and it's going to be so delicious hi Neil hi how are you I'm good incredible display so I'm making a seafood stew okay can you get me a few things actually there are a lot of kinds of shrimp but why don't I take the clean ones all right so a pound of clean shrimp please and then I can always peel them in devayne them myself but why not get them already done that's a lot of work they - sometime exactly [Music] 24 mussels all right she's a great they are wonderful and I need a pound of halibut delay sure fabulous you and I need a plan to see bass please all right you know there are a few things to look for when you're looking for fish and I think the pretty standard one is that it doesn't smell very fishy and this I mean there's no fish smell here it's amazing and the other is that the eye of the fish is really bright that was really fast thanks so much Neal well it's gonna be great they do thank you enjoy bye-bye [Music] second soup I want to test is seafood stew so the first thing I heat some oil and then cut up some onions two yellow onions oil is hot it's going to put the onions right in next I'm going to do potatoes I need 2 cups of potatoes and these are you kind of go they have lots of flavor next the fennel I love bell it's got that wonderful anise flavor and when it's cooked not that crazy about it raw but when it's cooked it just there's a really delicate flavor so I'm just gonna chop this up this were very porous all flavor and into the soup okay that's it for the fennel two teaspoons of salt one teaspoon of pepper stir it all together let's gonna cook about 15 minutes so the vegetables and the potatoes are all tender in the meantime I need some seafood for the seafood stew [Music] lots of great seafood it's a good stock so first thing I want to do is soak the mussels sometimes have a little sand and the mussels and nobody needs sand in their seafood stew so put them in a bowl fill those water and then a handful of flower in the water just mix it around and what happens is the muscles break the water with the flower and they discourage any of sand that they have inside to leave these to soak and I think seafood stew is ready for a little wine two clips of a nice dry white wine you never cook with anything I wouldn't want to drink and seafood stock you can make it organ by it I need four cups which is a quart it smells good and one twenty ounce can of tomatoes warm right in okay next we want to add some garlic got to have garlic and seafood stew sounds going to chop it out three cloves 3 big cloves of garlic actually add this later in the stew so it doesn't burn okay three cloves of garlic right into the stew and then the truly Provencal ingredient is saffron it's the stamens of crocuses you want to choose really good whole saffron not the powdered Cong and I'm going to add one teaspoon which is all of this they love saffron it really gives a full flavor and a little bit of spice to this do so this is going to just simmer for about 15 minutes while I get the seafood ready so I owe this great fish first want to start with a halibut just slice it in big chunks do is want to choose sort of firm flesh fish it's not going to just disintegrate in this do the second one it's a sea bass [Music] who's going slices across to so you want big enough chunks so then it's just integrate but small enough ones I still actually cooking let's do pretty quickly okay next one we'll rinse the mussels first I'm just going to check and see if any of them are open permanently Simmons they're not alive and they all look gorgeous so they're fun it's gonna risk me a few times to make sure there's no flour perfect ok the last things the shrimp before my glad I got this peeled and deveined so much work okay I think the students just about ready for the seafood well this looks pretty good okay lots of fish stir it in it's going to cook really fast now mix the shrimp [Music] this looks so chunky and delicious full of flavors okay last the muscles I love the color and the texture the snake let alone the flavor it's gonna cook in about five minutes all the fish and the shrimp and mussels are gonna be done and then when I go to Frank's house I'm gonna add the two essential for your best ingredients Curnow and orange zest squeeze so delicious [Music] Frank's guests are arriving he's giving you the nice glass of white wine and I'm gonna just finish the soups love cooking in this kitchen so the seafood student needs a little bit of orange zest and some pear no I love this two flavors in it okay that should be about a tablespoon put the orange zest into the soup splash of Pernod liquors flavor that really brings out the flavor of this film just going to mix it together this looks so gorgeous [Music] well that's ready they better be hungry as a friend they better not be having too much fun without me I'm going to feel like Cinderella in the kitchen now okay one soup down one to go so I made lentil soup often but I just thought I'd experiment by putting sausage in it so I'm putting in kielbasa which is a cooked Polish sausage it's really good it's got some nice spice to it but this is really easy

three large onions that's four cups of leeks it makes the latter suit I have to say most of my soup recipes are huge amounts of soup because it can freeze it so easily and then you have soup for months one tablespoon of chopped garlic we're just about three cloves of garlic okay how about a tablespoon of fresh thyme leaves I'm just gonna do approximately just hold it by the end and just run your fingers down the stem next thing is a teaspoon of cumin there's actually sort of classic combination they're really good to get it lentils and cumin tablespoon of salt and 1/2 teaspoons or half a tablespoon of pepper I'm just going to cook this for about 20 minutes until the onions and the leeks are tender and translucent and then and lots of good stuff to the soup well that already smells great can really smell the onions and the leeks and the cumin and the time it's gonna be wonderful hearty soup okay so while this cook I'm gonna chop up some vegetables so the first thing is Karis keep it the vegetables you want to have them chopped and roughly the same size so they cook evenly so I tend to like things not too fine I actually liked it to look like it's homemade okay just big dice more carrots so these carrots aren't quite so big so I'm just going to cut them like this I do find that carrots that you buy with the tops on tend to be a little fresher tasting a little sweeter okay so that's the carrots and celery I'm just going to do it right down the middle at Barefoot Contessa we have recipes for lentil soup but like called for a 40 pound bag of carrots or case of celery and you'd end up with like 200 quarts of soup but it's really good okay so that's the carrots in the celery let me see if bones are ready no they're just simmering away here yeah they're perfect everything's cooked really nicely together the onions are really tender leaves okay now I'm gonna end all the vegetables lots of celery four cups of celery and then four cups of carrots it's gonna be a really hearty soup okay just saute those for a minute someone drain the lentils and I think Wendell's got a really bad rap in the 70s it was considered like hippy vegetarian food but I think they're really good and what I like is the green lentils I think they're firmer than the brown lentils and they have more flavor next is chicken stock I'll make chicken stock you can use canned chicken stock but I have to say it's one of those things I really like homemade chicken second it's so easy to make so I have three quarts which is gonna go right in somehow I find veal stock beef stock there's so much more complicated but chicken stock you throw a couple of chickens and a pot with some carrots and celery
