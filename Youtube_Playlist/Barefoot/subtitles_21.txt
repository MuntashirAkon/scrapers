[Music] my friend Patricia is coming after a really long trip from Paris and I thought wouldn't it be nice to just greet her with like big steaming bowls of chili but since she's being really good I thought maybe I instead of making beef chili I'd make chicken chili so I've got about four cups of onions and 2 tablespoons of olive oil and they've cooked until you can really smell them at 10 minutes and I'm going to add lots of good stuff 2 tablespoons of chopped garlic who's going to be really good one of cook garlic for just a minute because it really bitter and 2 yellow peppers and 2 red peppers it's a really quick way to cut peppers just straight down and then what's left over you can use for snacking and I'm just going to do big chunks kind of chili should be big chunks of good stuff so peppers okay now all the good spices first thing of course is chili powder so I've got huge spoon of chili powder teaspoon of cumin which is a really essential ingredient in all chili and then these are the things that make it hot red pepper just sort of a pinch of it maybe a quarter teaspoon and then cayenne pepper which is really hot so use it at your own risk I like when things have a lot of flavor and a little bit of heat but if you like it really hot just add more so two teaspoons of salt this is great and I'm going to cook that for about a minute while I get the tomatoes ready I always get this is canned tomatoes life's too short to peel a tomato so I'm just going to chop them up really quickly within two 28 ounce cans of tomatoes try not to get it all over the kitchen like I do and into the sauce give this there so most chili has cilantro in it but I personally hate cilantro so I'm going to put basil in instead it gives it great flavor let's take the leaves off and just give it a really rough chop so maybe that a quarter of a cup should be good wonderful so it's going to cook for about 30 minutes so this is a chicken that I cooked on the bone with the skin on it and it really keeps it moist I just tested all different kinds of ways of doing this and I found it's so much better roasting it than it is to boil it the way you normally do it for a chicken like this the church is on a book tour for her new book Provence I can't wait to see it so just sort of tear off this bone with your hands so that's way to do it big shots wanted to be really delicious and chunky right into the pot just stir it around just going to fill for about 20 minutes all the flavors get into the chicken chilli cumin basil tomatoes so we got all kinds of toppings g gajala a little sour cream yeah that were cream for the ship did you just create this like in the shower one well you know I always my beef chili and I'd be healthier if I made chicken jus like so I just particular instead brilliant it's been a good one Geoffrey
