nothing a beach picnic and I'm going to bring shrimp salad pasta pesto and peas and my favorite lemon cake transports really well to the beach I'm going to show you how to make this if you can make this lemon cake you can make any cake I've got room-temperature butter half a pound and 2 cups of sugar that I've been mixing in the mixer until it's really light and fluffy then I'm going to add four room-temperature eggs I'm going to add the eggs one at a time and just let them get incorporated into the butter and sugar okay the next I'm going to put in is 1/3 of a cup of grated lemon zest and that's goes in wonderful okay then I have to put together my dry ingredients and wet ingredients first the wet ingredients I have a quarter of a cup of fresh lemon juice that I've squeezed buttermilk which is great it's a low-fat milk that's got a culture in it so 1/4 cup of lemon juice that's 3/4 of a cup of buttermilk and the next thing is vanilla you love the smell of vanilla I figure out how to put it into almost every big product so teaspoon of vanilla now the dry ingredients so that's three cups of flour 1/2 a teaspoon of baking soda 1/2 a teaspoon of baking powder and a teaspoon of salt salt surprisingly important in baking things really brings out the lemon and the lemon cake and I'm just going to sift these together sifting really combines it but it also makes sure that there's nothing in the bottom I want to put them in alternately starting and ending with the dry ingredients just until it's mixed and then add the wet ingredients this keeps the batter from getting too thick or too runny and it keeps it really light great thing about this recipe is it's in fact better the next day so if you're having a party it's really great to make it in advance and then the last flour so that's it I've got the dry ingredients of wet ingredients and I'm just going to give it one more mix with a spatula make sure it's really well mixed smell the first ball wonderful just one more mix with a spatula okay I've got two baking pans that I've greased and floured and a little piece of parchment paper on the bottom so there's no point in making a delicious cake if you can't get it out of the pan divide this up evenly that looks good even right looks good so they're going to bake 350 degrees for about 40 to 45 minutes and after they come out I have a simple syrup made of lemon juice and sugar and the drizzle on the top and it's soaks in and it just has such a fresh lemon flavor and it keeps it incredibly moist
