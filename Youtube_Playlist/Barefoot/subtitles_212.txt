[Music] my life's gotten so busy that sometimes it's hard to find a day to just test recipes but today's the day I've got some ideas I have two classic recipes that I want to update and a soup I've always loved this is definitely my kind of day first I'm taking my classic strawberry scones and seeing if there are other flavors that would make it even better next a wild mushroom lasagna using local mushrooms and finally a shrimp bisque that's as delicious as the classic one that's so much easier to make this is going to be really fun a couple of classic Barefoot Contessa recipes that I'm always trying to improve on and one of them is scones I'm gonna start with four cups of flour all-purpose flour need two tablespoons of sugar you want them a little sweet but not really sweet two tablespoons of baking powder make them light and fluffy and two teaspoons of salt we have lots of flavor combine that in the mixer okay now I need some butter the key to really light flaky scones is the butter it's really important that it's very cold when the heat of the oven hits the butter and the scones the water evaporates and the steam puffs them up okay into the flour mixture just turn the mixer on low we mix it until the butter isn't like pea-sized pieces okay in the meantime I'm gonna get the eggs and the cream ready so I need four extra-large eggs it's best if they're cold so they don't make the butter warm and my cup of cold heavy cream it's gonna mix the eggs and put them right into the cream so I'm just gonna pour that creaming the eggs right in it's gonna be a really wet dough but the wetter it is the more moist that scones are perfect don't over mix it so I need 3/4 of a cup of dried strawberries the classic is raisins but I barefoot we used to do them with dried strawberries I'm gonna start with that and then see if I can make variations of it if you can't find them you can always use raisins or cranberries some kind of dried fruit is really good okay let's go put this right in okay I'm gonna mix it with a tablespoon of flour so it stays well distributed in the mix okay into the mix now I wouldn't know what else I can add to this I can't tell you how many times I find myself in the pantry looking for inspiration so I want something that would go really well with scones salted peanuts yeah roasted cashews Jeffrey already ate them what else honey I make them too sweet currents already did that one no I think that's too sweet I think walnuts is it Marge that might be good to actually walnuts and oranges that says breakfast right so I'm gonna chop up some walnuts in the bowl maybe some orange zest just do it right on the ball and then I'll flour these and I think I'll make two kinds of scones I'll make the plain strawberry ones and then I'll make the ones with strawberries orange and walnuts then I can see which one I like the best I'd say this is about third of a cup of walnuts and a tablespoon of orange zest I need a little bit of flour maybe a bit another tablespoon I'm gonna roll out half of them playing say getting lots of flour it's really stinky I'm gonna Pat it out that's requires an interesting and I like to use a square cutter and it can really be any size cutter it can be around when it can be square one I like to make triangles out of a big square okay so those are plain ones I'm gonna add bananas and orange zest I can actually see the butter and I can see the car exhaust looks good roll it out to about 3/4 of an inch I think I'll bring into the office and see what everybody here thinks okay that's enough for a test these are the new ones just going to cut these in triangles that's the experimental walnut in orange tray and now for the traditional ones with just strawberry so we can use that as a control test okay I've washed just a little beaten egg white with a little milk or water just makes it nice and brown on the top it's pretty cool if sugar and make it look good [Music] into the oven 400 degrees for 20 to 25 minutes I think I know which one I'm gonna like best I'm curious which one they like okay Susanna and Shanae I think I like the one with the walnuts better okay I think it's the orange scones with walnuts right okay my next challenge is I'm going to take classic lasagna recipe and make a wild mushroom lasagna what do you think it sounds delicious oh good hey you guys want to come for lunch you that was neckla Sonia with turkey sausage which is perfectly fine but I thought wouldn't it be nice to make it with wild mushrooms and I heard about a wild mushroom farm somewhere around here I think that sounds delicious [Music] look at these mushrooms they're amazing nice shiitake I just he's awful blogs in the back oh they're gorgeous actually I need why don't I have pounds of mushrooms I usually make a turkey lasagna and I want to make it with wild mushrooms well so since you're the wild mushroom man so what are these guys what I have here are some some blue oyster mushrooms named blue for the color but always de mushrooms because of their shape just like a moister okay then what are these guys these are the king of oysters they call him a king because it's kind of the king of the oyster mushrooms got a nice firm texture and nutty flavor and you know and that's calico cream-colored cat are they different in flavor they're gonna be a little more rich a little stronger like nutty flavor almost if mushrooms can be nutty and these will be a little more mild and tender I think that's perfect to do okay great as often thank you these look amazing I can't wait to make the lasagna [Music] I guess so much day my voter by David you doing [Music] well no matter what kind of lasagna I'm testing you have to start out with a lasagna noodles so I have a big pot of boiling water olive oil make sure they don't stick together salt that's three quarters of a pound of lasagna noodles I'm gonna boil them for bet at 8 to 10 minutes just until they're done so the first thing I'm gonna do for the mushroom lasagna is a bechamel or white sauce it's really kind of a classic for lasagna so the first thing is I need butter I would stick of butter just melt that over medium heat and what I've got is I've got a quart of milk that I'm heating up I need to have a cup of flour it's gonna put it right into the butter just dump the whole thing in I'm just gonna cook it for just a bit a minute okay I'm just gonna put the milk in all at once it's gonna make a really thick white sauce just needs some seasonings tablespoon of salt teaspoon of pepper and nutmeg court of the teaspoon of fresh nutmeg I'm just gonna keep stirring this so just thickened it happened so fast I only want to keep an eye on it its thickens too fast you can just whisk it until it's smooth I'd say that's perfect okay next for the mushrooms big saute pan okay time to slice the mushrooms so I'm gonna do this in two batches cuz you don't want if there are too many mushrooms in the pan without steam instead of saute and they won't have as much flavor so I'm just gonna slice these big slices if you can't find these mushrooms which are hard to find actually cuz they're really special you can use portobello mushrooms or porcini mushrooms or shiitakes are delicious it's amazing how many kinds of varieties there are okay salmon here 2 tablespoons of butter and 2 tablespoons of oil it'll just help them Brown a little bit just has so much more flavor when they're sauteed into the pan on the cookies for five minutes and then another batch for five minutes nothing written to assembles of lasagna [Music] so the first thing to do is pour some white sauce on the bottom of the dish they're about three or four layers of this when we have put the sauce holds on you noodles and the mushrooms with lots of Parmesan cheese in the middle okay so the next thing is noise on your noodles just fit them in loosely it doesn't have to be perfect they're hot they're really hot and if you have to cut them to fit that's fine okay more sauce doesn't have to bind it all together it's a really elegant kind of lasagna it's great as a main course for a vegetarian but it's also nice if you want to do a roast and a little bit of lasagna to go with it so about a third of the mushrooms and there's a good part Parmesan cheese about a quarter of a cup of Parmesan cheese this is really gonna flavor it okay I'm gonna do it again Willa's Anja [Music] more sauce one of the great things about was on there always is that you can make it in advance and then just bake it before dinner okay more mushrooms more parmesan more lasagna noodles [Music] okay into the oven 375 degrees 45 minutes it smells delicious the proofs can be in the tasting [Music] perfect timing I do it did I notice on you'd show up all right this is the test I mean you know you never know it's a mushroom lasagna how's this is that a big enough taste what do you think get the mushrooms from that wonderful guy in four champion who has mushroom farm oh it smells pretty good actually in every house oh okay go for it [Music] good what's the spice ina okay I'm the worst critic one of the things I've learned when I'm recipe testing is write it down immediately because by tomorrow I've totally forgotten what I've done so I would say the strawberries comes for a success everybody like them including me with orange zest and walnuts so just when I thought something was perfect the way it was it can be even better and the Wang mushroom lasagna that was a surprise I actually really like lasagna with meat in it but the mushrooms are so meaty who needs me it was just wonderful [Music] sure bisque I love it but every recipe I've seen is really complicated I decided I'm gonna see if I can make a really simple version that's just delicious I bought fish stock and I've added the shrimp shells to it to give it even more flavor I'm gonna strain the fish stock I need 3 and 3/4 cups so if I have a little less I'm just gonna have some water yep just a little water okay so first thing I've done here is sauteed two cups of leeks and three tablespoons of olive oil just make sure the links are really really clean before you cook them okay I'm gonna add some garlic but a tablespoon of garlic just saute it for a bit a minute actually love shrimp bisque I like that rich shrimp flavor and a little bit of sherry so the next thing it needs a little bit of cayenne pepper just a pinch not too much you don't want to overpower the shrimp and just cook that together okay and then a pound of shrimp this is where the shells came from and just cook the shrimp for about three minutes until they're just perfectly pink and just tender and the shrimp's cooked I'm gonna add the rest of the ingredients and have a really rich delicious shrimp it [Music] well I can't make good shrimp bisque with that sherry but I've actually decided little cognac would help it too so I'm gonna start with a quarter of a cup of cognac just going to pour it right into the shrimp and leeks better cook from this and that smells good and a quarter of a cup of dry sherry and all that's just going to really get into the shrimp and flavor the soup now that smells like shrimp bisque shrimp and sharing so classic okay I'm gonna puree this now just put it right into the food processor now I'm just gonna puree until it's really chunky and I like it when it's too smooth [Music] [Music] okay that's perfect so now I'm gonna make a white sauce that's gonna be the base with the soup this white sauce is really the same kind of white sauce I made for the lasagna I'm starting with half a stick of butter and a quarter of a cup of flour I'm gonna cook it over medium low heat for about a minute just to cook the flour then I'm adding two cups of half-and-half who's gonna stir this is what heaven 1/2 gets hot and it thickens with the flour so far it's been pretty easy ok the next I'm gonna put in is the pureed shrimp and leeks really smells good I can smell the cognac and sherry that's my have some good flavor the fish stock 3 and 3/4 cups third of a cup of tomato paste 2 teaspoons of salt and one teaspoon of pepper and that's it let's go stir it up and just let this simmer all the flavors are going to go together it's going to be rich and delicious I hope hmm so good classic taste half the time I'm happy it was a good day [Music]
