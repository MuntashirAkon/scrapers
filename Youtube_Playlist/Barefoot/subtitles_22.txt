[Music] so the first thing I want to make for my lunch today as I getting facial is a crunchy noodle salad with lots of Asian spices so I'm going to start with thin pasta actually like thin spaghetti for it seems to absorb the flavor the best to that the bowl okay the next thing is sugar snap pea it's about a pound I'm going to salt the water and then blanch them for about three to five minutes just until they're crisp tender okay first scallions go into the salad and the red peppers the next thing is the sugar snap peas shock them first which means take them out of the boiling water putting them iced water stuff the cooking really sets the color and it stops them from getting overcooked just take the second first just make sure they're really cold and they are right into the salad it's really cold okay now the soft got great flavor okay the first day's cup of vegetable oil don't use olive oil here because I want the other Asian sizes to come out I wanted it clear oil there's no flavor an intense ol quarter of a cup of rice wine vinegar and find this in the Asian section new grocery store third of a cup of soy sauce 3 tablespoons of toasted sesame oil this isn't a fair one it's the limit the dark one it's got lots of flavor 1 tablespoon of honey give it a little sweetness and 2 cloves of chopped garlic so what's the spoon of grated ginger if you want a higher you can always put more in okay this is the bits that have come of peanut butter that's really what gives it sort of an Indonesian flavor and you want to use smooth peanut butter and then just whisk it all together then you can make the thoughts way in advance and you can make the salad in advance but not too far because actually the soy sauce will break down the noodles I think the less I'm going to put in the sauce is some toasted sesame seeds I toasted them in a dry pan just put about two tablespoons in and save the rest to decorate the salad okay right on the salad so this the warm noodles a spaghetti tin spaghetti and the scallions sugar snap peas rich peppers toss it all together and I can watch this go off on it and some chopped parsley such a rough chop and then some more sesame seeds so it looks like sesame
