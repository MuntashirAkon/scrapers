I'm starting with a big roasting chicken first thing I want to do is salt and pepper the inside of the cavity I've already washed and patted it dry lots of salt inside to give it lots of flavor and lots of pepper once it's have great flavor and I'm going to take a whole head of garlic I'm not even going to peel it just cut it right in half and all that garlic flavor just gets right into the chicken sweet delicious and the next thing I'm going to do with lemons because I love the way the lemon taste in chicken so I'm just going to quarter this and put that right into the chicken just that way and then some fresh thyme big sprig of fresh thyme right in the middle all this is really just to give the chicken more flavor as it roasts if you have other herbs around like oregano or rosemary or something like that you can also use that but I particularly like thyme okay now I'm going to show you how to trust a chicken it's really simple just want to do two things and let tie the legs together a little bit of kitchen string just tie these guys together this is really about making sure that the chicken cooks evenly if the legs are flapping around in the pan they're going to cook faster than the rest of the chicken and the wings are the same thing you don't want them flapping around in the pan so what you want to do is just turn them backwards and tuck them right underneath the body of the chicken they keep them closed just like that and you can brush the whole top with butter just to make sure that it has lots of flavor and that it Browns really nicely in the pan I'm gonna sprinkle it without the salt and pepper and now comes the surprising part I'm going to put strips of bacon over the top which is going to actually give it lots of flavor and then later I'm going to crumble the crisp bacon into the salad so going to be a combination of dishes this is the usual friday-night chicken but dressed up for company now I'm going to add more flavor to the sauce too by putting in garlic in the pan another whole head of garlic just cut right in half even roast it in a pan and then the juices from the chicken are going to make a sauce with the garlic and I think I'll put in two lemons so these are the flavors in the chicken that's also going to add to the sauce cut off the end and then just cut it in half and do big wedges and you'll see the lemon is going to brown and just and have great flavor right in the sauce just right in the pan stooop instead of vegetables okay so I think it's already 425 degrees for about an hour and 15 minutes and before it's done I'm going to take the bacon also the chicken Browns really nicely
