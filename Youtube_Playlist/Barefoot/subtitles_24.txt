[Music] my friends Devin and Eli are coming for dinner tonight and they're bringing their incredibly chic Parisian friends so I thought instead of making a French dinner I would make something very American all with local ingredients it's one of my favorite meal [Music] except for my very American dinner I thought I'd use all the local ingredients so I'm gonna make roast duck with Long Island duck sauteed corn with wonderful corn from Jim pecks con stand right here and because the apples are wonderful in the orchard I'm gonna make an apple crisp with really good vanilla ice cream so for my Ducks aren't these great I don't know about you but I always imagined roasting ducks is like smoke billowing out of the oven fat everywhere I have a better method what you do is you boil them for about 45 minutes and a lot of the fat comes out in the stock and then you roast them at high temperature and they're crisp and moist and absolutely delicious so I'm going to show you how so the first thing that I do is just take a fork and prick the skin a little bit not into the meat but just through the skin and that allows a lot of the fat to come out when it's boiled and I'm gonna put it in 6 quarts of chicken stock canned chicken stocks just fine with some salt and then I'm just gonna put these ducks right and let's chicken stock carefully it's hot and because Ducks tend to float we all know that I'm gonna put a plate on the top and it'll keep them submerged in the hot stock so I'm just gonna simmer this for 45 minutes and after they're done I'm gonna roast them at really high temperature and they're gonna be really good perfect and now I'm gonna work on dessert so for dessert I'm gonna make apple crisp with the local apples from the farm and vanilla ice cream all I'm gonna do is flavor the cream chill it and then put in an ice cream maker it's really easy and it's so good so I want to start with 3 cups of heavy cream it's gonna heat it a little bit 2/3 of a cup of sugar just like that just pour the sugar right in with the cream I'm heating it because I want to dissolve the sugar I have to admit this my favorite flavor of ice cream and with the apple crisp I think it's gonna be really good I think you know is underrated as a flavor but you need to use really good vanilla since it's the only flavor in the ice cream one teaspoon of vanilla good vanilla extract and then because the vanilla is really important I'm gonna put the seeds of a vanilla bean in so just take a bean and slice it all the way down the middle the really sharp knife and then pull it apart and then take your knife and just run it right along the inside and those little seeds that come out are the vanilla seeds and it's great flavor so just stir this over medium heat just for a few minutes until the sugar dissolves and you can tell because you can sort of feel a little bit of grittiness when the sugar still they are and that's really all you have to do is just dissolve the sugar take it off the heat just strain it you can see all those little vanilla seeds in that mixture and it's going to flavor it's going to be just wonderful I'm gonna chill it and then freeze it my ice cream maker later back to the Ducks so they've been simmering for about 45 minutes let's plate in there not the Ducks going to take the plate out that just holds them down so they're submerged be really careful it's nothing worse than putting your hand up pot of boiling stock oh they look great I'm gonna roast them next so it's really only two stages you boil them and then you roast them the first thing I'm gonna do is take a little bit of the fat off the top of the stock and put it in the roasting pan just so the Ducks don't stick while they're roasting and it's amazing how much fat is in the top of this the good news is you won't be eating it okay just all that around and now put the Ducks in ducks so just do this really carefully because you've got a pot of hot style well there's a lot of stock in here but what I do is I put it in the freezer and I save it for the next time I'm making ducks so I don't have to do six quarts of stock every time and it get just gets better and better yeah okay a second little guy wonderful and now I'm just gonna dry the top so the skin gets really nice and crisp when it's roasting just Pat the top dry like that teaspoon of salt we want to really season it well want them to have lots of flavor it's been a pepper [Music] thirty minutes 500 degrees and we're gonna have delicious ducks my vanilla ice cream mixture is nice and chill so I'll show you how easy it is now to make ice cream we all remember when it was ice and salt and hand-crank things at least I do and now it's just a frozen canister and that's what the freezing is with a blade it's a great little electric ice cream maker just pour the chilled mixture right in I wanna make sure I get all the vanilla beans and all that gorgeous flavor right in now all I have to do is turn it on and all by itself it makes the best vanilla ice cream to go with apple crisp for dessert I can't wait this vanilla ice cream looks incredible it's gonna go with the apple crisp and I think I need to taste it make sure it's okay mmm it's like sweet and vanilla whipped cream but frozen it's so good tonight I'm gonna serve it with the apple crisp so I'm gonna put it in a container put it in the freezer it gets a little harder but then I'll leave it at room temperature for a few minutes until it gets soft enough to scoop out I mean who needs apple crisp this is so wonderful so see how easy it is to make really good ice cream [Music] [Music] so when I was thinking about making a dinner with local ingredients I thought about the apple orchard the milk pail which I just love the apples are really ripe so I went to the milk pail and I got mccune and McIntosh apples I like the combination once a little sweeter and ones a little tartar and then you get the best of both flavors and the apple crisp okay I'm just going to cut them like big chunks it's 5 pounds of apples it sounds like a lot that they really cook down and you want a big high apple crisp okay that's the apples and I'm just gonna flavor them so I'd love to use citrus with apples so I'm going to use the zest and the juice of one orange and one lemon so lots of orange zest you always want exactly orange before you juice it otherwise you won't be able to zest it and some juice and then one lemon also the zest and the juice mmm love the spice of lemon and then the juice okay wanted a little bit sweet but not too sweet have a cup of sugar a little bit of cinnamon not too much because it can really overpower it a little bit of nutmeg because I love him and then clean hands just toss it all together mmm it's like apple pie without the crust and you know I'll do anything not to make a crust okay into a bowl for baking I just want it piled really high okay and you want to get all the juices in cuz that's all gonna bake into the apples mm-hmm that looks good okay so I'm going to clear the decks and then make the topping [Music] so for the topping I want to have lots of flavor and lots of crunch so this what I'm going to do take 1/2 cups of flour it's recorded with a cup of granulated sugar through Crow's a cup of brown sugar I think is it a really good flavor half a teaspoon of salt a cup of oatmeal I use really good you're Irish quick cooking oats whatever you have around is fine this is what gives it all its flavor half a pound of butter two sticks of butter diced and into the mixer okay turn the mixer on until it's all mixed I'm really looking for the butter and the flour and the oatmeal to be crumbly together this is good right now you can do this with your hands but it'll take much longer so I'm just gonna put it right on top it's gonna be really good together especially with homemade vanilla ice cream I know some people like chocolate and some people like cakes but me I like fruit crisps and this is my favorite one apple crisp it's gonna bake for 350 degrees for about an hour and it's gonna make the house smell wonderful and we're gonna have a fabulous dessert [Music] that looks like roast duck whoo I'm just gonna cover it with foil for about 20 minutes let them rest at room temperature and it completes all the juices back into the knee I can't wait for dinner [Music] there's my dinner tonight has all local ingredients I thought why not use hydrangea since they're so typical for the Hamptons okay great a lot of people are confused about the color of hydrangeas most of them either turn blue or pink depending on how alkaline the soil is mine are actually wide they're called sister Teresa they start at this lime green which I particularly love they turn white and then in the fall they become pink and blue I love them all so I'm gonna do an assortment for the table I think that'd be great for dinner I'm gonna do a very earthy table setting but it's gonna be both French and American the first thing is hydrangeas hydrangeas are best if they're put in really hot tap water so I put my little bosses with tap water I'm just going to put one or two hydrangeas into each one so I've all these pink and green ones and since nature isn't perfect I wouldn't have one wacky want so it's going to be white it's very American to use kitchen towels for dinner napkins I thought it a nice twist would be to use antique French kitchen towels what's great is for the messy meal like duck you get a really big napkin I love the contrasts of antique French silver against an old American wooden table I'm gonna use simple American restaurant plates and very elegant Parisian water glasses and my favorite wine glasses I never really feel like I'm having a party until the table settings done so I'd say I'm ready this is my all-time favorite time of the year in East Hampton when the corn is good late summer early fall it's just this is actually particularly gorgeous it's white corn usually it's served boiled right on the cob but I'm going to show you how to make it really special just take your knife and run it down the sides and I'm gonna saute it and a little bit of butter salt and pepper and it's so delicious you just won't believe it it's the easiest recipe and I could just eat that for dinner now you'll see how easy this is so I'm just gonna heat a little butter usually for six people I use eight to ten years of corn you'd be surprised how fast it goes I love these four ingredient recipes corn butter salt and pepper okay that's melted and just throw in the corn lots of salt and pepper let's just go saute for about 5 to 10 minutes until it's just tender and it'll be really delicious can't wait now that looks great they've rested and they're ready to go they look so juicy so what I want to do is quarter the duck the first thing I'm going to do is cut down to both sides of the breastbone and then take it out just like that so once that's out you just pull it apart and you can see the backbone and just cut down both sides so you can remove it so make it so much easier to cut in quarters and then you just take that backbone out just like that okay now that I've got it in half I can cut it into quarters really easily if this looks like a really messy job it is okay that's one [Music] [Music] it may be a bit of a struggle for you but it will make it much easier for your dinner guests so it's worth it this looks great [Music] if I can't believe you brought all these Tomatoes they're gorgeous I think some you agree knows these are yeah yeah they call the early girl boy yeah I'll stand them in you cut them right so how about if I put some some of these orange ones on top great like that good okay so she put olive oil on it right you don't need too much olive oil either the question you know the salt will draw those the moisture out of the tomatoes and then you'll have your own sauce oh that's fantastic okay I've got sauteed corn are you staying for dinner Oh roast duck and corn and you have tomatoes I think so let's go okay everybody dinner served or as I say didn't a city doctor it's actually easier than you think you actually boil it for 45 minutes and then you take it out need a roast in a really high temperature like 500 degrees and it makes the skin really crisp and them and I get rid of all the fats it's like a racing dessert Oh an American dessert is apple crisp and homemade vanilla ice cream does that sound right okay great wait until they taste this apple crisp [Music] it smells great [Music] I'm so glad you're enjoying it next time you come I'll make you a clambake yes okay good Cheers on the beach exactly with sand tomorrow morning [Laughter] [Music]
