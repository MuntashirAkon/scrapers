[Music] these days when I'm doing a menu for a party I find that a lot of my friends have things that they can't eat one doesn't like fish somebody's allergic to nuts but what I find is everybody loves pasta so when I'm entertaining while it's not all pasta all the time at my house it's very often on the menu this wouldn't be list of my favorite pastas without lasagna it's a ball Time party classic and this one has a healthy twist and pasta pesto and pea salad sprinkled with toasted pignoli it's great on its own or with chicken as a side dish penne with five cheese's is on the list it's comforting and delicious plus incredibly easy to make and shrimp linguini fabulous flavor and ready in 15 minutes it works as well for a small elegant dinner as for a big casual Sunday supper last but not least pasta with sun-dried tomatoes a summery dish filled with the flavors of tomato mozzarella and basil so that's what's on the menu I've got some pasta to make lasagna it's one of the great make-ahead meals you can make the lasagna bake it freeze it and it's always ready when friends come over so what I have in this pot is i saute some onions and garlic and then broken up some sausage that i got at the store and this is turkey sausage you can get hot you can get sweet but I actually like to combine the two so it's half and half it's about a pound and a half of sausage and it's all cooked in a little bit of olive oil then I'm gonna add tomatoes a 28 ounce can of crushed tomatoes in puree if you use whole Tomatoes you can just put it in the food processor and crush them up yourself and a 6 ounce can of tomato paste the whole can I'm gonna have lots of flavoring some fresh basil just pick up some leaves and chop it up of course it's all gonna cook together anyway I love base I want to taste so good with tomato some turkey sausage it doesn't have to be perfect okay so right into the tomato and turkey sausage and then I think some fresh parsley you can use flat leaf parsley like this or you can use curly parsley I think this has a little more flavor but really depends on the parsley right into the pot I think we need salt and pepper 1/2 teaspoons of salt a lot of this depends on how salty and peppery the sausage is so you want to taste it half a teaspoon of pepper and then just stir it up I'm just gonna let this simmer for about 15 to 20 minutes over low heat until all the flavors blend together in the tomato and the basil and the turkey sausage all taste like one okay now I'm gonna get the cheese is ready I need 15 ounces of ricotta cheese which is usually one package and then I'm gonna put lots of flavors in it first thing is goat cheese I know it's unusual in a lasagna but I think it really gives a great flavor so this is a 4 ounce package if you have a four and a half ounce package or five ounce package just be casual about it it's just fine just crumble it right up into the ricotta it's sort of a little more punch and kind of flavor it's good 1 cup of grated Parmesan just mix that in and then one egg you know when you're putting an egg into a mixture I always put it into another glass bowl because you never know when you get a bad egg so one egg extra large egg just mix that in and then just gonna add a little bit of flavor with some chopped parsley that 2 tablespoons and of course salt and pepper you don't need too much because the parmesan is pretty salty quarter of a teaspoon of pepper and now what I'm gonna do is show you how I did the noodles and then I'm gonna layer the whole thing together with mozzarella it's gonna be fabulous what I do with the noodles is instead of boiling them I pour a really really really hot tap water into a ball and let the noodles soak for about 20 minutes and they soften up just enough to go into the baked lasagna okay now I'm just gonna drain it by the time they're drained I'm going to be ready to layer them just spread it out on the bottom of the dish mush it around this one do one layer of pasta [Music] I don't have to be perfect just cut them to fit just take about half the mozzarella and layer it on top and then the next layer is this cheese so we're kind about half the cheese remember it's the ricotta and goat cheese and Parmesan more sausage okay another layer of noodles mozzarella rest on the cheese it's amazing how fast this builds up and was nothing more strenuous to do than grate some parmesan over it put it in the oven at 400 degrees for 30 minutes and I had a dinner party okay a little turkey lasagna it's light as a feather because it's made with turkey sausage so is that who is that cheesy or why ina this is so good how did you get the time to do this today last week a dirty little secret as I made everything less we can put in the freezer that tastes absolutely fresh this is one of my favorite pastas but I have to say it has arrival that's pasta pesto and peas I'll show you how easy it is to make [Music] pasta pesto and please my first trick is frozen peas because I think they're actually delicious and when they're picked they're blanched and then frozen so they're just as good as shelling them yourself which could take forever I'm gonna pour them into a colander just run them under hot water and just let me sit and think for a minute so I cook the pasta already I actually made two different kinds bowties little bow ties and fusilli these but you can use any kind of dried pasta so the first thing I'm gonna do is make pesto just wonderful it's this basil and garlic really old-fashioned Italian thing I need a little bit of walnuts and a food processor got a quarter of a cup tablespoons of pignoli switch our pine nuts pesto is usually made with one of the other but I like the flavor when you make make it with both next ingredient like three big pieces of garlic and salt and pepper salt lots of pepper I like it really spicy that's a pepper and then one and a half cups of basil just dump it right in then I'm gonna puree this and then while that's going on a pour in about a third of a cup of olive oil [Music] so that's basic pesto and then I'm gonna add a few more ingredients to make a sauce for some Parmesan cheese I actually add spinach it's frozen chopped spinach that's been defrosted about 1/2 a package and about 3/4 of a cup of mayonnaise and just a squeeze of fresh lemon this is a really great sauce on pasta cuz it's spicy and it's flavorful there we go nice and lemon the lemon and the spinach are gonna keep the pesto from turning brown [Applause] just tasted to make sure it's perfect remember the sauce has to be really flavorful because the pasta doesn't have much flavor hmm it's garlicky and spicy a little more salt salt so important for pesto really bring out the basil flavor so that's my sauce I toss it with the pasta and add some final ingredients that's so that's the pasta and the pesto we've toasted this together so you can really smell the garlic and you see the spinach has kept the pesto really green so now we have pasta pesto we need peas so I have the frozen peas that I've defrosted I'm just gonna add some maybe half a package and for lots of flavor we're gonna add more Parmesan cheese it's a little more salt and pepper and the last ingredient is pignoli nuts I think these really add just a great flavor to the salad and they look great so it's green and white so let's make sure these tastes all right well it's been so much flavor parmesan and basil and garlic and all I had to do was pack the salad and Chinese takeout containers and hit the beach so everybody tell me what you like Oh God pasta pesto who would like pasta pesto is it good this is the perfect amphitheater in the beginning of the summer we all say another thing a little about pasta is it can be a really romantic dinner for two or a huge pasta dinner for a family and I always have lots of ingredients that I can put together with a pasta so I'm gonna make pasta with five cheese's I don't know anybody who doesn't anyway five cheese is one of my favorite things to make for a party it actually comes from friends of mine who want a fabulous restaurant in Providence Rhode Island called Al Forno you won't believe how easy it is to make so the first thing I'm going to do is grate some fontina there are lots of different kinds of fontina but I really think that good Italian fontina is really the best okay that's the grated fontina so I'm gonna make the sauce now let's start with two cups of cream a cup of tomatoes that are actually crushed and tomato juice and then we're gonna add all kinds of cheeses cap a cup of pecorino which is like parmesan but it's really stronger and has lots of flavor half a cup of the fontina which I graded and this is the good stuff this is gorgonzola it's Mountain gorgonzola and it's got lots of flavor and it's creamy and it's gonna really be good in the pasta this a wonderful dish because it's really a great way to use up leftovers if you have chicken just put it in if you have salmon leftover just chuck it in and it all tastes wonderful together two tablespoons of ricotta and a little bit of fresh mozzarella maybe about a quarter of a pound this is good homemade mozzarella you can use buffalo mozzarella which is really soft and delicious just be sure it's good mozzarella this is looking good and fresh basil leaves this just gives it a really good flavor and sort of add something fresh to it which I love so that's everything for the sauce and now I'm just gonna add the pasta I've cooked a pound of penne Rigate penne Rigate actually got it's this shape and its got ridges on it really holds the sauce well I cooked it for about four minutes which is not long enough to cook it it's very al dente but it's gonna cook more when I bake the pasta just gonna dump this whole thing in toss it all together this actually doesn't even require salt or pepper because the pasta is really well salted in the water that I boiled it in and the cheese is like the Romano and the gorgonzola they have a lot of salt in them so I'm going to fill these dishes individual gratin dishes for the pasta and then each person will get their own serving of pasta and when it's baked this way I just find that it's really creamy inside and crusty and browned on the top it's a great combination we're just gonna take a little bit of butter and dot it on the top so the top gets really nicely browned ten minutes in a really hot 500 degree oven and the penne is done I just had to warm it up when we got home and went to the movies calm relaxed [Music] pasta salad can be really boring but not my pasta with sun-dried tomatoes it's got big flavors and lots of sauce I'm gonna start with cook pasta about a half a pound pound of chopped tomatoes just dice up good tomatoes 3/4 of a cup of good chopped olives the olives that have pits and they'll always have better flavor so pick them yourself six sun-dried tomatoes chopped up these are sun-dried tomatoes in oil and a pound of good mozzarella don't buy the stuff in the grocery store that tastes like rubber tires buy good mozzarella makes all the difference in the world mozzarellas great for pasta salads when it's cold but I saw some wonderful hot and hot pasta dishes so I'm gonna make the sauce five sun-dried tomatoes two tablespoons of good red wine vinegar six tablespoons of olive oil it's like making a vinaigrette with lots of flavor [Music] one clove of garlic chopped 1 tsp of capers 2 teaspoons of salt it's all it's really important give pasta flavor that's recorders of a teaspoon of black pepper I'm just puree [Music] pour it out the salad it's gonna get all the ridges of a pasta lots of flavor almost done with this recipe I just want to show you another recipe I love shrimp with linguine it's really easy it's really delicious how bad is that [Music] two more great ingredients to put into the pasta with sun-dried tomatoes fresh basil lots of it and about a cup of grated Parmesan makes all the difference in the world based on Parmesan that I think I'm just gonna pack it up in court containers and I can happen all week for dinner I love really fast pasta recipes one of my favorites is shrimp linguini which I remember making for my friend Michael when he came over let me just set the scene the pasta was already cooked and I was ready to go with the shrimp okay that's three tablespoons of olive oil and about three tablespoons of butter I know this looks like a lot but it's the sauce for the entire dish and about one and a half tablespoons of garlic with garlic you really don't want to cook it too long for just about a minute nothing worse than the flavor of garlic so one minute while I get everything else ready so the first thing is shrimp and what I buy is a peeled and deveined shrimp fish store if you can't buy it you can always peel and devein it yourself I'm gonna add a pound of shrimp you just cook it for a very short time like three to five minutes and all that flavor of the garlic is gonna get into the shrimp so first thing I gonna do is salt and pepper the shrimp won't have lots of flavor because when you add the pasta the sauce has to flavor the pasta also since we really strongly flavored just turn the shrimp so they cook evenly on both sides it's so good all that garlic and butter and oil how bad can that be two spoons just toss it all together essentially great way to make any pasta Italians do it even when you're making pasta with tomato sauce as you cook the pasta and the sauce together for the last few minutes and it really absorbs the flavor okay and then the last ingredients a lemon zest lemon juice they're like a little bit of heat so just it's sprinkling of red pepper flakes okay just toss that together and then have two more things to put in parsley okay right on top and then because I want you to you can't really see the lemon but I want you to know it's lemon what I do is a few thin slices of lemon people are gonna eat them but they'll they'll see that it's lemon [Music] linguini with shrimp that's got so much garlic in it we have to both eat it all this cooking pasta some really fun I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did but it's lunchtime but I'm having pasta with sun-dried tomatoes [Music] you
