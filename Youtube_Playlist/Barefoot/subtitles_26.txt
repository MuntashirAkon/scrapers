[Music] just because I have a really busy day doesn't mean that Canada my friends for an elegant dinner just takes a little planning and a really easy menu that I can make ahead my friend Miguel has offered to do the table perfect and we've invited his friend Jack they've just moved into the neighborhood to start I'm gonna make a cold zucchini vichyssoise that I can make early in the day then Asian grilled salmon that's full of flavor quickly sauteed asparagus and sugar snap peas and for dessert a warm pair clafouti served with a dollop of creme fraiche this is just the kind of evening at home with friends that I really love from midweek party when I want to make everything a head soup is a great first course this is a particularly good one because I'm gonna serve it cold it's vichyssoise and I've done it with a little bit of a twist with fresh zucchini in it so the first thing I have is five cups of leeks I use the white and light green parts so take a little bit of butter and olive oil and then I'm gonna cut up potatoes and zucchini and put them right into the pan so use these little small hole boiling potatoes where the skins on and everything makes it really easy and I find really sort of tender ones so eight eight of these and I'm leaving the skins on the potatoes because I'm gonna put it through food mill and that'll take the skins out easier I made this the first time actually in France I was in the market myself beautiful potatoes and zucchini ax but put this together in a suit so the next thing when I cut up is the zucchini really rough chop this it's all gonna get pureed [Music] okay pour in six cups of chicken stock if you have homemade chicken stock is great if not this can turn the heat up a little bit until it simmers I'm just going to cook these vegetables for about 30 minutes until all the vegetables and potatoes are tender and then I'm going to puree it little touch of cream of gorgeous cold soup for dinner tonight [Music] so since I'm making a cold soup I thought it'd be really nice to make a warm dessert so I'm gonna make something called a clafouti which is like a pancake batter over fruit it's a French country dessert it's really great and so easy to make so I'm gonna start with 3 eggs and 1/3 of a cup of sugar this really is like making a pancake batter it's that easy and then I'm gonna refrigerate it and later I'm going to put pears in the bottom of a dish and then pour the batter over it right into the oven before dinner so I'm gonna mix this until quite and fluffy about a minute or two we wanna zest a lemon my handy-dandy zester love it here's a lemon or great combination together sort of sweet and tart at the same time okay I'm still trying to mix it down a little bit now the next ingredient is one and a half cups of cream well two teaspoons of good vanilla extract six tablespoons of flour which is actually a quarter of a cup is four tablespoons two more teaspoon of lemon zest remember you want to just get the bright yellow zest you don't want to need the white part quarter teaspoon of salt and the last ingredient is pear brandy which really enhances the flavor of the pears it's wonderful it's most still like pears and sometimes you can find it it has the pear in the bottle and what they've done is they've tied the bottle on the tree around the little flower that's gonna grow the pear and it grows in the bottle it's amazing to see a whole tree filled with bottles but it really adds wonderful flavor two tablespoons of pear brandy and that's it it really is like a pancake batter it's sort of thin and but when you pour it over the pears it's just wonderful cliff food is usually made with cherries sort of more traditional French countryside dessert but I really love it with pears so it's done I'm gonna refrigerator they've been refrigerated for as long as you want just like pancake batter and then later I'm gonna cut pears into a pan pour the batter over it into the oven we're gonna have a really gorgeous warm dessert be great [Music] and next I'm gonna make my favorite Asian marinated salmon and really simple sauteed sugar snap peas asparagus so the vegetables are all cooked in the vichyssoise the potatoes and zucchini and leeks and I'm gonna put it through the food mill you can always puree this in a food processor or a blender but I just think it ends up with a really gorgeous thick texture when it's done in a food mill and nobody wants to eat baby food so much better when you can really have a sense of the texture just best truth so around you one direction to puree it and then the other direction to clean it I'm kidding this is gonna be nice this is a great soup because it can be hot it can be cold you can freeze it for later so when you're not really sure like in the summer sometimes it's chilly at night you want to serve it hot just heat it up at the last minute I actually think it's one of my favorite pieces of equipment in the kitchen it's great for pureeing vegetables or for making soups and just really end up with a great texture i'm the good news is you can usually get in the hardware store okay that's it just make sure you get what's on the bottom it's really good okay a little touch of cream at the end just a few tablespoons gives a really nice extra flavor here just tasted for season these it's really good it's wonderful you can really taste suck all the fresh vegetables the zucchini a little bit of salt a little bit of heat I'm gonna chill it ass gonna be so delicious before the salmon for dinner [Music] next is Asian grilled salmon I can't tell you how many times I've made this and I guarantee you it's really easy this also elegant it's gonna start with a nice piece of Sanders beautiful center cut [Music] the idea of this recipe is I'm gonna make a marinade pour half of it over the salmon and then after the Salmons grilled pour the other half over so it becomes both a marinade and a sauce and it keeps it really moist and flavorful so I'm gonna cut five or six slices just make sure you get all the way through the skin this is clearly too much for three people but when I'm making Asian grilled salmon it's so good as leftovers both just from temperature but also in a salad that I always make extra and take these slices and just put them in a dish I'm gonna marinate them in this is about 3 pounds of salmon you want to figure about a half a pound per person okay now I'm gonna make a marinade so I have half a teaspoon of fresh chopped garlic in the ball gives a nice bite and the 2 tablespoons of good Dijon mustard that's about two tablespoons three tablespoons of good soy sauce this is the Asian part of the Asian marinated salmon and six tablespoons of good olive oil I [Music] like California olive oil I think it's got a good flavor but it's not too strong for the sauce the whole idea of this sauce is to make that the salmon taste better it's not to overpower it so it has lots of flavor but it's not really really snot running a flavored I'm just gonna whisk this together [Music] this sauce particularly great because the mustard emulsifies it so we're just going to pour half on spread it down okay great I've got the salmon done ready to grill I've got the batter done for the pair of clafouti I've got the soup done and now I'm gonna go off to the afternoon and Miguel's gonna come and do the table he's the perfect guest [Music] I'm telling you go under okay [Music] I think I recognize those shoes hey how are you what are you up to well love that you come and do the table settings I mean how does the girl get that walkie what I'm trying to do a little bit of a flower arrangement and I couldn't find it a frog okay so making this grid with scotch tape see this is the way you hold the flowers what a great idea I love this I'm loves lilac smells so famous and actually you think of it what the flowers is being white but you never think of the buds is being lime green is that great but I'll Camilla and roses this is gonna be core just to find out you it's gonna be gorgeous we'll try it so I'm gonna go work on dinner right I'm gonna leave you to this okay so Miguel's next-door doing the table his friend Jack is coming in about a half an hour and I'm gonna pull everything together for dinner I'm gonna start finishing the pair clafouti so I've got two or three pairs you want them firm but still smell like pairs and these are just gorgeous Bartlett pears so what I've done is I've prepared the dish I buttered it and then dusted it with sugar instead of flour makes a nice base for the pears so I've got one pair and I think too because these are so big should be fine you can really use any kind of just flavorful fruit in this apples pears okay so I'm just going to cut these in quarters and then slice them right into the dish I'm just going to slice this country each one of these they're just holding it all together put it into the dish and just fan it out a little bit remember it's gonna sort of peek through the batter so you want it to be really pretty just like that [Music] so these pears are a little firm but they're also very juicy so that's really what you want then Lily just before the pancake batter right over it just mix it up a little bit it smell a pear brandy and mr. Harris just wonderfully vanilla I'm just gonna bake this whole thing 375 about 35 or 40 minutes until it's puffed and golden and gorgeous and I'm going to serve it warm a little bit of cream [Music] secret to cooking salmon really well is make sure the grill pan is really hot and it is so I'm gonna put it on I start skin side down but I like to do it on a diagonal I think it looks better that way really hot open the windows turn on the fan did you do it on the grill too but today I'm just gonna do it inside okay five minutes on this side I'm going to flip it over five minutes on the other side and so we've just gorgeous so with the Asian grilled salmon I thought be really nice to do some sauteed vegetables and since sugar snap peas and asparagus are in season sort of late spring early summer they're great combination so just cut off the ends I actually like to cut these on the diagonal I think they look better great already so I'm just gonna heal the pan you want it nice and hot just add some olive oil in want the olive oil really hot women vegetables hit the pan so sugar snap peas these are gonna cook for about five or ten minutes until they're identical which is cooked through but still a little crispness salt kosher salt or sea salt pepper I think this needs a little bit of heat so I'm gonna have some crushed red pepper flakes just toss them together just cook them over medium-low heat five to ten minutes I'm gonna go check the family is of just half done perfectly return them [Music] Sibley fan [Music] unless you cook for another five to seven minutes until they're just a little bit raw on the inside and then they'll keep cooking until I'm ready to serve [Music] [Music] Asian grilled salmon is just done perfect so you can either take the skin off or not but I think it's just fine with the skin on fill you up - you turn it over on this plate I'm turning it over particularly looks nice that way but I want the sauce to get into the you need it fast and it's the hot and messy job I think four pieces of the perfect four [Music] okay I'm just gonna put the rest of the sauce on keeps the fish really moist and flavorful don't use the marinade from the raw fish [Music] sugar snap pea asparagus perfect sort of crisp and tender MF de flavor wonderful a little more salt that's a vegetable and cold zucchini vichyssoise that's great I would say this meal is so elegant they'll never know was easy a little bit of chive on the soup [Music] and I would say dinner is served [Music] Miguel zucchini vichyssoise Oh jack you good Khonsu friend are you pulled together such an elegant dinner party thank you well I wish I gotta say I had cooks and working and servers and I did it all myself really didn't take more than about an hour it's great hey I told you never get disappointed here prepare clafouti for dessert Wow I know it's weak ales particular favorite exactly same house making a pumpkin course as easy as making a pancake with pear brandy in it Oh Josh now that you know make dinner parties during the week please come back of course usually it's Chinese takeout [Laughter]
