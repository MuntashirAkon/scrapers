chocolate ganache cake is such a barefoot contessa classic we made it into wedding cakes for 600 people we've made it into individual ganache cakes but what everybody remembers most is the chocolate ganache cupcakes with a little candy violent on top so I thought it'd be really fun to do for the Barefoot reunion so to make it I start with quarter pound of butter room temperature very important and a cup of sugar it's got a secret ingredient I'll show you I'm gonna beat those together until they're light and fluffy for extra-large eggs I love speed add the eggs one at a time until they're well mixed in now comes the secret ingredient chocolate syrup I know it sounds odd in a cake but it's really good 16-ounce cam this recipe originally comes from my friend Devin Frederick's who owned loaves &amp; Fishes when she was like 25 years old she's an amazing cook 1 tablespoon of good vanilla extract and the last thing is a cup of flour just sprinkle it in slowly so it doesn't get lumpy and this is the point you want to mix in the flour just enough but don't over beat it otherwise it'll make a tough cake that looks really good it smells so chocolatey so this is enough for one eight or nine inch cake now I'm gonna make 12 cupcakes out of it so use it a muffin pan very inexpensive muffin pan for the from the hardware store and an ice cream scoop which gives you perfect cupcakes every time it's much easier to measure you want them almost filled they don't rise to much and then later after they cool I'm gonna do shiny chocolate glaze it's double chocolate double trouble so I'm gonna bake these at 325 for about 25 to 30 minutes everybody likes a nice chocolate cake but if the icing that everybody loves for my chocolate I gonna do it chocolate ganache icing just a shiny chocolate glaze really easy amazing so in a double boiler which is basically just a heatproof bowl over simmering water and put a half a cup of heavy cream half a pound of semi-sweet chocolate chips because I always like coffee and chocolate it gives a real depth of flavor a tablespoon of and some coffee granules something let that sit over simmering water until it just melts don't want to burn it stir it around the room so the ganache is still a little bit warm so it's easy to pour it's an amazing how shiny it is just gorgeous you can really taste that little bit of coffee and it really brings out the chocolate flavor can't imagine the big fats of ganache we used to make for chocolate wedding cakes with such an unusual wedding cake and I covered in fresh violets and white roses so beautiful big shiny chocolate wedding cake I have wonderful candied violets that we used to use that I put on each one edible violets these are sometimes a little hard to find but if you find a bakery supply store or specialty food store or cake decorating store something like that remember these get them with violates yeah
