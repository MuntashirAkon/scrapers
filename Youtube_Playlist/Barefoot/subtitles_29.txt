[Music] but I told my friends I was thinking about making ham for Thanksgiving they went crazy no Turkey they cried so I decided to cave in and I'm making everyone's favorite turkey with urban Apple stuffing pumpkin banana mousse tart and no [Music] so for Thanksgiving everybody asks that pumpkin pie but at my house my mother used to make a pumpkin banana mousse tart which was actually really good so I'm doing a version of that it's kind of like pumpkin pie with the volume turned up and the good news it starts with a graham cracker crust so 14 graham crackers all ground up it's about 2 cups of graham cracker crumbs third of a cup of sugar and I put a little bit of cinnamon in I just think it gives it a nice pumpkin pie spice lots of flavor big on flavor and the last thing of course is butter so it's one stick of melted butter I'm just gonna mix it all together so later I'm gonna fill this with a pumpkin mousse that's flavored with a little bit of banana which makes it wonderfully sweet and some orange zest and lots of spices it's really good into an 11 inch tart shell clean hands always a cook's best tool so just Pat it out so it's even and then I take a cup measure middle cup measure and do the edge just like that and then you know and then for the thick crust right at the edge so much easier than traditional pie crust so into the oven 350 degrees for about 10 minutes until it's just a little firmer than it is now now we get to make the good part the pumpkin banana mousse filling so the first thing is 1/2 a cup of half-and-half and I'm gonna put it into a double boiler I know every starter set of pots comes with a double boiler which is two pots one on top of the other but you can really make your own double boiler by putting a heatproof bowl directly over a pot and then you can have all different sizes and the next thing is one 15 ounce can of pumpkin puree I've done this with cooking a pumpkin and puree it or a can of pumpkin puree and believe me you can't tell the difference and I can tell you which one's easier okay so that's in next ingredient is one cup of brown sugar and you want this sort of lightly packed it's how brown sugar is generally measured right into the pumpkin and then some good spices 3/4 of teaspoon of salt half a teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/4 of a teaspoon of nutmeg big wooden spoon and just stir it around so I'm gonna cook this for about five minutes until it just gets warm and then I'm gonna add egg yolks to it to make a custard but I think the tart shell is ready to come out of the oven [Music] perfect it's just a little Brown around the edges I'm just gonna cool and get firm so now I'm gonna make the custard so I've got two egg yolks and what I want to do is I want to warm up the egg yolks a little bit with a pumpkin mixture so and I'll end up with scrambled eggs just like making a traditional custard and then pour the whole thing back into the hot pumpkin mixture see when ice scraper I just want to get all of it and just mix that up and just cook that for about four or five minutes so it's gonna go into that tart shell it's gonna cool overnight if you want to you can make it the day before and then I'm gonna decorate it with whipped cream so it's not only delicious but it's really gorgeous so let's take one package of gelatin and just soften in a quarter of a cup of cold water when it's chilled the egg yolks are gonna help the mousse to set but the gelatin is gonna help it - okay off the heat I'm just gonna add these other ingredients mashed bananas the softened gelatin and the last thing is orange zest okay I'm just gonna stir this up so while that cools I'm gonna whip the cream you need about 1/2 a cup of heavy cream and then I'm gonna use more for decoration later but and 2 tablespoons of sugar okay that should do it didn't do this with a hand mixer if you want to also okay that's perfect with whipped cream you want to make sure that it's really firm like that that it stands up but if you get it too far you end up with butter don't want that okay I'm gonna fold this into the pumpkin mixture so put the whipped cream right in the middle and then the spatula I use a rubber spatula just go straight down through the middle and then fold it over that way straight down through the middle and then right to the bottom of the bowl and then fold it over just keep doing that until it's really more mixed she's looking gorgeous perfect right into the graham cracker crust it smells great and the good news about this is you can make it in advance leave in the fridge for a day and then decorate it just before you're going to serve doesn't look at bad doesn't so I pulled on my friends to find out what their favorite thing for Thanksgiving is but the truth is I can't have Thanksgiving without this cranberry fruit can serve so I'm going to add a cup of water and one in 3/4 cups of sugar so I'm gonna cook this together for about 5 minutes until the cranberries sort of pop open when it gets really hot the skins burst open and then you get all of the cranberry fruit in this conserve the next thing I'm gonna put it in is apple and actually granny smith apples are great because the green apples have a lot of pectin in it and it's the pectin that's gonna make the cranberry fruit conserve set so you want to pick a really tart apple the tart of the Apple the more pectin it has I'm just gonna peel this little guy and then just chop it up you wanted to sort of disappear when it cooks into the she serve so I'm gonna chop it up fine this Apple is nicely chopped up it's gonna go into a bowl and then I'm gonna have the zest of an orange and the zest of a lemon and the fruit also I can hear the cranberries popping okay one orange and the zest of a lemon I just think this really takes away from the sweetness of the fruit conserve okay that's the zest I'm just gonna check and see how the cranberries are doing and I'd say they're popping okay that's gonna cook for another few minutes while I juice the fruit okay so the juice of one arms and the juice of a lemon okay so all this is gonna go in the apples and the orange zest and lemon zest and then I'm gonna cook them all together for about 15 minutes and you'll see that Apple just sort of melts into the cranberry fruit conserve and the pectin in the apple is gonna make the whole thing jail just it's magic great so while that's cooking we're gonna start the urban Apple stuffing it's a really good stuffing for the turkey it's very traditional it's got much more modern zing to it and now I just need to get some other ingredients four cups of onions two cups of chopped celery always get them in advance the next thing is to chopped apples into the saut√© pan with the celery and okay so that's gonna cook on sort of medium-low heat so I'm gonna have it about two tablespoons of fresh parsley it doesn't have to be perfectly minced just serve wrap and then I'm gonna do but I'm gonna have teaspoons of fresh rosemary and we just need salt and pepper the onions have just start to brown and I think it really pleased had all the flavor of vegetables for the meantime let me finish the cranberry sauce [Music] so with traditionalists I'm gonna leave it plain and for people like me that want a little more flavor I'm gonna add walnuts and raisins so these are two dishes I want to serve them in and I can just chill them right in the dish so that's the cranberry fruit concern now everybody wants Thanksgiving exactly the way they remember when they were kids so I really try and do it for each person the way they remember it and Steven doesn't like nuts so I want to make sure yes exactly what he wants so I'm just gonna add raisins and chopped walnuts to the rest just mix them in and it's got great flavor and texture so we've got cranberry fruit conserved for the traditionalists and the wild and crazy ones so I have bread cubes that I've toasted sourdough bread which I like and I toasted them just so they get some of the moisture out and then it'll really absorb the flavors of the turkey and stock and everything else so I'm just gonna take all the vegetables I just cooked and pour it right over I'm gonna add about a cup of chicken stock it smells the cooked apples and celery and toss it all together and that's ready to go inside a big bird this year I tried suggesting to my friends that would make a big Virginia ham for Thanksgiving and they went nuts they said we have to have turkey so we're having Turkey so I've got a really good fresh 12 pound turkey and I'm gonna stuff it and trust it and it's so easy won't believe it no when I was young my mother used to get up at 4 o'clock in the morning to make turkey I think I had this feeling they had to cook for like 15 hours but the truth is Turkey really only used about two and a half hours to cook and it'll be really moist and delicious so I'm just gonna stuff the cavity full but not really packed you want the heat to be able to get around so it can cook properly okay that looks good so I'm just gonna tie it's a little legs together and then tie around the tail so that's not flapping around just cut it off and the only other thing to do is just take the wing tips just like doing a chicken just tuck them right underneath the body so it keeps them from flapping around okay and then the last thing is I'm just gonna brush it with butter salt and pepper [Music] so this turkey I'm gonna roast at 350 degrees for about two and a half hours and stirring noise and delicious now comes the fun part decorating the pumpkin banana mousse tart it's out in the refrigerator until it just sat and then I'm gonna decorate it with whipped cream that's pretty good so far so I need a cup of heavy cream quarter of a cup of sugar and a splash of vanilla when I say a splash of an element a quarter a half a teaspoon I'm just gonna whip it until it's firm [Music] that looks good I want it really nice and firm but not turned into butter and that's about right great [Music] so the easiest way to decorate this and it's perfectly great is to do whipped cream around the middle leaving a little border of pumpkin sort of like meringue on the top but I love to pipe it so I'll show you how to do that so take a pastry bag with a big star tip on it I think that's the nicest one and the easiest you know piping looks really mysterious but the way I learned how to do it is I just spent a day piping buttercream or whipped cream just practice and you'll get it I'm the best way to practice it's just on a board or on the marble so because you can keep using it over and over again so I'll show you if you wanted to do a shell pattern which is what I like to do just a little bit like that just like that and it's really about the pressure in the bag and really getting a feel for it it's not that hard if you want to do something even simpler it's just stars but I think for this one I'm gonna do the shell pattern so just all the way around just do like a ripping pattern and the good news is if you make a mistake you can just scoop it back into the bag and do it again how hard is that okay then maybe swirl in the middle great and then because I like the decoration to be the flavors that are in the tart I thought it'd be really nice to decorate it with a little bit of orange maybe some orange zest the traditional thing that I use for orange zest is this zester but you see it ends up very fine and I think I have a better way to decorate see it's really too fine but then the other zester is this little wonderful tool that just has little sharp edges and I'll show you what it does with the orange it has long strips of zest and I think that would be really pretty to decorate the tart with and then just take it and put it around the edge just slightly so now somebody knows it's pumpkin and orange and cream and delicious and it's ready for dessert I'm so we keep in the refrigerator until we're ready to serve it I think that's not bad have to say carving is not something that generally do with company around because I can make a real mess just put up a leg nice big leg for somebody that likes that what I do is I let the turkey sit for about 20 minutes and if all the juices get right back into the turkey it really makes it flavorful and moist and the trick of the white meat is instead of slicing it the way it's traditionally done I'm going to run my knife where I mean cut off the entire breast in one piece and then slice it it's exactly what I like to do a chicken and then just slice it right across I think it's so much easier than wrestling with it this looks really sudden one side and I would say that looks like Thanksgiving and I have parmesan smashed potatoes every family has their favorite recipe so this is mine and I keep it warm on the top of the double boiler and then Frank wanted Brussels sprouts and roasted Brussels sprouts I rest them a really high temperature with olive oil salt and pepper couldn't be easier and that's what Frank wanted for Thanksgiving and plain cranberry fruit conserve and cranberry food conserved with raisins and nuts come everybody help yourself this so wonderful and I read do you have enough cranberry sauce Parsa a little sour cream here's to the absent [Music] my experience is nobody remembers what they have for dinner but they always remember dessert all right who wants pumpkin banana mousse tart I know Nyree needs a casement there's everybody cool so it turns out you know how to cook sometimes I even surprise myself Happy Thanksgiving [Music]
