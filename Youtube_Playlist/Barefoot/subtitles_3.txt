[Music] I love entertaining on the beach so when my friends Joey and Maureen told me it was their dog Theo's birthday I thought what a great excuse for a party so I've invited lots of friends with their dogs to meet me at the beach the four-legged ones are gonna get these amazing treats and the humans what else hot dogs on the grill well not really hot dogs but grilled sausages in Funds piled high with sauteed onions and peppers plus a classic potato salad well with the volume turned up and what better to serve for drinks at the beach but sea breezes and for dessert a fabulous sheet cake with chocolate frosting and decorated with adorable dog cookies why no the dogs are going to have fun at the beach and with all that good food I bet the humans won't have a bad time either [Music] so we're off to the beach with the dogs and since we're having hot dogs or chicken sausages I thought what would be more perfect with it then really good potato salad so the potatoes are done I'm just gonna drain them so I cook them for about ten minutes and then I let them steam for another ten minutes so that's three pounds of new potatoes it's a small ones you can use red ones or white ones whichever you like and I'm just going to let them steam and the steam really gets into the potatoes and cooks them beautifully so next I'm gonna make the sauce so one cup of mayonnaise quarter of a cup of buttermilk or white wine or chicken stock whatever you have just whisk it together until it's creamy so having some kind of liquid to mayonnaise takes away that sort of gloppy flavor and it makes it more like a sauce now I'm gonna add lots of flavor two tablespoons of Dijon mustard two tablespoons of coarse mustard it's this grainy mustard really has great flavor and it also looks like mustard so you know exactly what's in it and then lots of fresh dill about a half a cup of chopped fresh dill if you don't like tell you can always use parsley or something like that but I really like doing this it gives it lots of flavor so just chop off the leaves chopped it up roughly mmm smells like summer to me and that should be about a half a cup teaspoon of salt teaspoon of pepper I'm just gonna whisk this all together and I've got the sauce actually I'm a summer you can make a huge amount of this if you're having a potato salad a lot and then just use it as you make the potatoes don't leave it in the fridge okay potatoes should be ready so it's gonna clean up a little bit and see how they are perfect and they look beautiful so I'm gonna cut up the potatoes and just gonna quarter these guys if they're really big you can cut them in smaller pieces but quarters are just about right I used small round potatoes so you use the skins they're very thin-skinned and actually the skins have a lot of nutrition in them so it's really worth keeping I also love the way it looks I think it's much easier looking it's gonna be great I'm gonna pack it and Chinese containers and everybody have their own little potato salad at the beach okay that's it for the potatoes so I'm gonna let them cool a little bit well I chopped up some celery and red onion for it one of the things that's really important for me when I'm making salads it's not just the flavor and the color but also the texture and with this salads really nice to have a little bit of a crunch with the celery and red onions so I need might be about a half a cup of celery and red onion in this just nice rough chop remember this is a homemade salad it's supposed to look like a homemade salad don't obsess about having perfect sized pieces that's crazy [Music] when you're cutting red onion leave the back part attached keep your fingers out of the way just do slices like that and then straight down really let the blade do the work by moving rather than pushing it move the blade half a cup of red onion that's gonna give a nice flavor okay I think the potatoes are cool enough so I'm gonna put the dressing on toss it all together this is great salad cuz if it sits a little bit really absorbs into the flavor of the potatoes mmm this looks good and then tossing all the red onion and celery give it lots of crunch and flavor Oh looks really good I'm actually not gonna check it for seasonings right now because it's warm and it's gonna be served cold it's better to check the seasonings when it's the temperature you're gonna eat it so I'm gonna put it in the refrigerator and pack it up later and take it to the beach and now I'm off to the beach to find the perfect spot for the party [Music] hi Joey how's the birthday boy he is so excited about this party Mandy I'm just looking around to see what we should set up I thought somewhere maybe down by the water in front of the pavilion how does that sound to you sounds fabulous okay will you call everybody it's on the word to me I'll bring all the food and the cocktails we're having hot dogs very funny ina the dogs will never get the joke [Music] I don't know who's gonna have more fun at this party the people are the pooches so I'm gonna make the grilled sausage the hot dogs and of course we can do mustard and ketchup and all those things but I thought be so much better to have sauteed onions and peppers to put on them so I'm gonna make a big pot of it bring it to the beach and then heat it up on the grill so I need lots of onions I'm using Spanish onions those big ones that you can find in the store just big half rounds of Spanish onions I've got oil heating up in the pan and then I'm just gonna put this big pile of onions in it's about 10 cups of onions okay I'm just gonna let those cook for about 15 to 20 minutes until they're browned and sweet and Cara moss and they'll be reduced millionaire's peppers and flavorings while that's cooking I'm gonna get the other things ready so it's to red peppers it's good idea to keep an eye on the onions where they're starting to brown they look great okay that's two yellow peppers and the onions it's the whole house not great I'm gonna make some garlic and then this would be done just stick with the garlic right in the pan I don't cook garlic very long just for 3060 seconds these onions look amazing they're browned and caramelized and the bottom of the pan is all crusty and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take some sherry vinegar and deglaze the pan it'll get all that great flavor I think about a quarter of a cup of sherry vinegar that's gonna get up all that brown scrapings on the bottom sherry woman vinegar and the onions are fabulous together okay now all the peppers go in [Music] I'm gonna add some tomato paste think that tablespoon should be good and some crushed red pepper flakes I don't like things too spicy so I'm just gonna add about a half a teaspoon so I'll start with a teaspoon and see how it goes and pepper 1/2 a teaspoon okay I'm just gonna let this simmer Wayne until it gets reduced and sweet and delicious it's gonna be so good with the chicken sausages now for the main event the birthday cake not for the dogs for the people [Music] I need two hundred quarter sticks of butter I need three cups of sugar and while they're creaming I'm gonna get the rest of the ingredients together [Music] okay the butter and sugar really well creamed they're light and fluffy gets really a light yellow color just gonna scrape down the bowl to make sure it's not sticking to the bottom okay and then with a mixer on low when I add the eggs one at a time just make sure they get really well incorporated it's gonna make a huge cake whatever reason he gets them to take home next the zest of one lemon it's a right cake but there's a little bit of lemon really gives it lots of flavor one and a half teaspoons of good vanilla [Applause] and what type of sour cream this one keeps it really moist it's an 8 ounce container hmm it's already smells good okay now for the dry ingredients first thing is three cups of flour any all-purpose flour I use unbleached flour whatever you have cornstarch third of a cup this basically approximates cake flour makes it nice and light teaspoon of baking soda and a teaspoon of salt just set that all together okay I'm very low speed I'm just going to add the dry ingredients to the wet ones and mix it just until it's blended make sure it's really well mixed mmm can really smell the lemon and I just think makes us such a difference because it a very fresh flavor without being lemony so this is a half sheet pan is 12 by 18 and about one and a quarter inches deep it's gonna get them in any cookware stores just pour the batter in this is a really useful batter I make cupcakes out of them I make small cakes out of it sometimes I've flavored a little bit with orange and lemon just spread it out evenly and then later I'm gonna just cover the whole thing with the most gorgeous chocolate frosting and you won't believe the decorations I found for them nice and smooth into the oven 25 to 30 minutes 350 degrees and it's going to be a knockout cake [Music] so for my pooch party the dogs are gonna have dog biscuits and water but the humans are having chicken sausage potato salad and birthday cake for dessert so I'm gonna do a chocolate icing for my white cake first thing I need is 24 ounces of semi-sweet chocolate chips mmm already smells good why don't have cups of heavy cream and just let the chocolate melt over double boiler simmering water I don't want it to get too hot because otherwise the chocolate will separate not pretty I just chopped the chips but if you want to use bars of chocolate that's fine to just make sweet chocolate actually the more you stir it the shinier it gets it makes a really nice frosting okay so off the heat I'm gonna add two tablespoons of corn syrup actually keeps the frosting spreadable Florida 1/2 teaspoons of vanilla actually gonna check it off the double boiler so it goes down pretty fast because I'm gonna have to let it cool a little bit before I add the butter make the buttercream so I'm just gonna stir that in and now wait do you see what I have to decorate this cake with so I was trying to think how am I gonna decorate a cake for humans that's a dog party and I found these amazing cookies wait do you see them they just admit I love them it's a little fire hydrant and they're great dogs and so I'm going to decorate the cake with them just so the dogs don't feel left out I've got wonderful things for the dogs to cook these they look like cookies and they really don't biscuits okay time to ice the cake so I have the cool chocolate it's really nice and thick just wonderful I'm gonna pour it into the mixer that's a lot of chocolate but it's a lot of cake too it's always so dramatic to have a huge cake and it's not that expensive a half a stick of room-temperature butter I'm just gonna beat this together until it's light and fluffy and it's a nice buttercream okay that should do it nice and thick oh it's gorgeous now I'm spread it on the cake you want to be sure the cake is nice and cool when you do this otherwise you let me talk like a mess [Music] okay just spread it out evenly this is a great frosting for cupcakes and for chocolate cakes but I just thought in this case a nice white sheet cake would be really fun perfect except to make sure the icing is good so chocolatey it's just delicious okay now we're gonna decorate this well we have to start with a fire hydrant right right there and I think the dogs are gonna be all lined up don't you this is so great okay and what I think this guy is pretty cute that's gonna go right there and I love him that's my courage right there I think we might have a cat in there little cat in the middle and a little black one little guy and right there okay how great does that look I'd say that's a treat for the humans and I've got treats for the dogs everybody's gonna be happy now I'm gonna pack everything up and I'm off to the beach [Music] I say they're having a good time so am i I'm making chicken sausages on the grill I just thought they'd be really flavorful he's sort of like having hot dogs but not and then I'm gonna have a sauteed onions and red peppers to top them off it's gonna be really good dinner this is good enough to eat so it was a challenge growing on the beach but I'm always surprised how great it feels when it comes out right and what I have here is I have the sauteed peppers and onions and I'm heating up on this other grill and they're heating up really fast oh they look great it's really really good on the sausages [Music] sea breezes are really easy it's two parts cranberry juice1 part grapefruit juice and one part vodka that's the good part [Music] shake it up and serve it with some line kind of warned my buds and I'm not kidding dinner's ready okay everybody dinner's ready come on over it went straight for the main course chicken sausage really mess that you think it's chicken sausage with peppers and onions ambulance chicken sausage and sausage to live who need to explain why you've got the better themselves sausage excellent with peppers and they're like okay [Music] yeah you know
