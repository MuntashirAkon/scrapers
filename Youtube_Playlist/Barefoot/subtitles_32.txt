[Music] entertaining from the Israeli by gathering my friends together and making a delicious food that's really nurturing I don't think there's anything more nurturing than a big pot of cheddar corn chowder bubbling away on the stove I always think Saturday night is the hardest night to entertain I just think it's the most daunting meal you have to make three courses it's a big deal people stay past my bedtime so I love to entertain on Sunday for lunch it's just a wonderful time so I'm going to make shedder corn chowder it's a very simple meal with a salad and some cheese and wonderful little dessert and everybody has a great time and by 3 o'clock they're off on their way and it's a wonderful day so for cheddar corn chowder I've got some vacation cooking a little bit of olive oil I never knew any soup this tougher from a little bit of bacon and this bacon is going to go into the soup later and it can be a garnish so to be really good I'm going to put in about 6 cups of onions - laughs it's going to make a lot of soup when you're cooking with onions I always use Spanish onions which are these big onions but you can also use some small regular yellow onions I just make a bigger one through easy to cut up some has to fit on a medium high flame for 10 minutes until the onions are translucent and they have lots of flavor so while the onions are cooking I'm going to cut up the potatoes I don't even peel them first of all days here I also like the way it looks it just looks really earthy and real these are actually Yukon Gold potatoes but you can use any kind of coil impetus I just love that sort of buttery color and flavor of the Yukon Gold so these kids gorgeous they're really in the fall it's wonderful to use things with freshly dug and we're really firm so my onions are good now they're really translucent and you smell them everywhere so good ok then I'm going to add 1/2 a cup of flour this is just going to take a list it a little bit and we're going to cook it to make sure the flour doesn't only sort of raw flour tape and a little bit of turmeric turmeric to spice that's using curry powder and it's just going to be give a little intensity to this and of course turning yellow which is gorgeous and salt and pepper that's the time I'd like to add the seasonings which I think it really gets into the flavor of the soup and it's spring the heat really brings out the turmeric and the salt and pepper yet it later just tastes salty wonderful okay and then my potatoes that's six cups of diced potatoes and twelve cups of chicken stock I have homemade chicken stock cuz I love it but you can really use a good canned chicken stock if you if you don't have time to make it if you thought you had to sacrifice from the fridge if you have it in the freezer just a frosted the night before so now I'm just going to bring it up to a simmer and cook it for about 15 minutes and then the potatoes are going to be done and then I'm going to add all this gorgeous corn that I got from pikes oh and after the corns gone in I'm going to finish it off with a little bit of cream and cheddar cheese mmm [Music] [Music] hi Amy hi ru and you're gonna help me I'm getting special treatment yeah thank you I need some shelter for my children chatter okay I have a look we're not havin chatter yeah how would that be okay it's a really sharp cheddar it'll be wonderful with a chowder he's like that perfect as much as I need a little left over for the show Hey we hope you with some bread to go with the name fabulous all right let's see I want everything I don't think all these cookies no what I really need is a bread for my soup okay I think what are here maybe one of the bed guests that you make sure I love those and it may be one of the Eli seven-grain bread and then I'll restrain myself from the is this S&amp;M [Music] I think with lunch you don't want to send people home really full you know like holding their bellies so I thought coconut macaroons would be wonderful for dessert so I've got 14 ounces of coconut it's really the wonderful big balls of coconut it's sweetened grated coconut ly buy in the grocery store it's 2 7 ounce packages I'm going to add 1 can of sweetened condensed milk not going to believe how easy these are to make or have fast they disappear about a teaspoon of vanilla good vanilla and just fold these together I just love these so it's full rich coconut flavor of these and help you do there or to make it and just whip them up okay and then the last ingredient is beaten egg whites two eggs plainly two egg whites room temperature because otherwise though it won't whip very well and I want to show you how I beat it pinch of salt keeps them from going flat flip it on high-speed so I think that's it but this is what you want to look for is that the egg whites stand up and they're still soft it's not really hard and then we're just going to fold it into the coconut mixture and that's a whole batter so I'm just going to fold them and carefully so don't deflate the eggs that's it that's the batter show you how to bake them I actually use an ice cream scoops and just nice big full scoops of macaroons see this Lake coconut is going to get really brown on the outside but if you don't have a scoop like this you know what just do it with two spoons and the comment just is beautiful I'm going to serve two dips for lunch my favorite pan fried onion dip and sun-dried tomato dip it's big pot of cheddar corn chowder and nice salad and macaroons for desserts me so good so these go in the oven at 325 for about 25 to 30 minutes until they're nicely browned and the coconuts toasted that's going to be good so I've got the cheddar corn chowder on the stove for my scoop lunch and macaroons in the oven I'm just going to make a little sun-dried tomato dip with my guests arrived so let's say you've got a quarter of a cup of sun-dried tomatoes which you see how easy this is half a cup of mayonnaise half a cup of sour cream my friends Antonia and Donna and their daughter and Antonia's daughter Tess are coming they're going to love this set ten dashes of Tabasco salt and pepper - and pepper it happens of room-temperature cream cheese this is like that old fashioned flavor of Thousand Island dressing bit asleep on the disk and the sun-dried tomatoes got so much more flavor and one last ingredient is scallions so they are just going to chop up two scallions just give it a little fresh flavor and some heat I'm going to make a good dip it's really about the texture and the flavor I just think it's so important but if you close your eyes you know exactly what you're reading that's the test this doesn't have to be so perfectly chopped that's going into the food processor these were cute scallions I'm not going to use the whole thing is is that looks so good it's the right color to all tomato is so you know what it is before you tasted tomato and a little scallion so people know what's in it as a garnish [Music] and I think I smell the macaroons they must be done hot coconut macaroons that's the best one of the fun things to do when I'm surprising people is when I have a very earthly meal like a soup once which I'm going to have to do risk fancy cutlery and wonderful China and really drag out the good stuff now what I'm doing is setting I always do the flowers first because I'll go out to the garden or go to the florist see what's really nice and then design the table setting around that so they all match and just take my inspiration from this so this is the kind of lunch where it's really fun I just set the table and everything for lunch and set up in my kitchen the soup is in a pot on the show make it feel like family no you can just go into the kitchen and help yourself [Music] what I have here is two large onions that I've cooked for about 25 minutes so you get all the sweetness of those wonderful onions and then I'm gonna make a dip out of it I'm going to pour these into the food processor and the add salt and pepper and for some heat a little pinch of cayenne pepper 1/2 a cup of mayonnaise 1/2 a cup of sour cream out of that 4 ounces of cream cheese so I've got all this gorgeous caramelized onions and all the flavorings in here and I'm just going to pulse it until it's all mixed together now I can smell all that delicious sweet onion how easy is that just taste it make sure it's okay I'm so good it's got that wonderful caramelized sweet onion flavor and just so everybody will know exactly what it is I need to the last few onions from the pan on the class so that's done I'll put it in the fridge until lunch is ready and I think I'll make my cheese board next [Music] my soup lunch a nice cheese and salad course is going to add real substance or a simple meal the first one is I try to have an assortment of cheeses I have three of them here one six sharp a treeless cheddar one that's creamy it's a really spicy Taleggio it's got a creamy texture to it and the third one I like to have a blue cheese so I've gotten a really nice organ Zola so the thing about G is you really want to buy in advance and when you go to the store ask for case that she's still really expected to taste things and it's the only way to know what you like try new cheeses maybe a sheep's milk cheese and something you've never had and it can be really a great experience and your guests will get to taste different things too and I'm going to serve it with wonderful fruit I these gorgeous long-stemmed strawberries it's delicious and these little champagne grapes which are wonderful any kind of grapes will be good I find green leaves make the cheese look gorgeous and the fruit so you can either go to the florist and ask them for lemon leaves or I have some hydrangeas outside so I'm going to go get some lead [Music] big slide hydrangea leaves for my cheese board the key is that you want to flatly that the cheese will just sit very simply on so let's try a nice big one right there you'll see what a difference it makes and one more gorgeous big one okay the key to arranging any platter is that there's something for your eye to focus on in the middle so I'm going to put the cheese's on three cheese's facing out so it's easy for people to help themselves and the Taleggio so you'll see the first thing is the strawberries and because of the stems that's going to be my thing that's tall and long some strawberries are gorgeous but it can be a huge bunch of grapes with a stem that comes up it can be really anything you have some height to it so that's something that's tall that's like deep sky and then the cheese's are like the earth is something solid in the middle and then I'm going to take these little champagne grapes aren't they wonderful and have them flowing forward like the water it gives it balance without symmetry which is really a lovely thing so now I'm going to do all of the things in one place so it has some simplicity it's not like a big bowl of M&amp;Ms all different colors everywhere it's just something about the sweetness of the fig it's nice to see the inside of that gorgeous fig and the next thing is the apricots and when you do it on this side these gorgeous orange apricots now the colors and the flavors and the texture is just absolutely wonderful I'm going to put a knife right in here and I'm going to let it sit at room temperature for a while that's it [Music] the next is the green towel to go with all those gorgeous cheese's first thing is there's so many different kinds of lettuce to choose from and I just think it's really worth finding some delicious lettuces into the venture a big head of white lettuce that we're used to seeing so vinaigrette don't be afraid of it I don't know why people find it daunting it's really just an emulsion of vinegar and oil and a little bit of flavoring to make it taste great so the first thing is vinegar that's three tablespoons a good vinegar and then a little bit of garlic maybe a half a teaspoon of chopped garlic the next things mustard good Dijon mustard is really important and you can use whole grain mustard or smooth mustard about a half a teaspoon of mustard and then salt and pepper so parts easy isn't so I have a teaspoon of pepper and the last thing I'm going to use for a binder for an emulsion it's an egg yolk but frankly if you don't want to use a raw egg yolk and you can regret just leave it out the mustards going to mull safai it a little bit anyway so one raw egg yolk the whip things together and then I'm going to slowly add in oil better half a cup of olive oil I'm going to pour it in the verge close cream right there it's sort of like making mayonnaise but much good okay that was good and I'm Megan vinaigrette so I'm just going to take a nice source of lettuce because the only way to really test a vinaigrette is on the leaf you really find out that it doesn't overpower the flavor of the lettuce but it really enhances it I'm delicious just the right balance of vinegar olive oil and I do love the garlic it's wonderful so I'm just going to take this bowl I'm going to start tossing my lettuce on top of it and let it sit just tear them off after the rough it is the better so that's the la la raza lettuce lovely red leaf lettuce it's wonderful mescaline next which is all different kinds of leaves together and the last thing I want to put on this is miss soon which is sort of a spicy but really tender leaf all the clips to do is with the cheddar and the corn and the cheddar corn chowder and get ready for my guests [Music] so basically transfer time into sun-dried tomatoes ready oh good fabulous I did for Sandra's manager from Stanford on in depth do you do that when you do the onions you do them in butter or olive oil away bit in a little of each so I know what for that well I made a big pot of cheddar corn chowder and Excel and Jesus and because I thought tests would like it macaroons for dessert okay you guys want to send you out so I can finish making this guy working we don't have any fun without me okay I'll be right there okay I'll do it finish this to open everything's ready so remember the corn I've shut it and filled it and I'll show you how I do it's really easy take the husk off and then cut off the end like this suggest a nice little rear around like that and then just cut the chrome up right off the corner most of them go flying all over the kitchen wreck trying to get most on into the soup okay so it's about ten cup of corn kernels and I'm just going to put them in boiling salted water for a few minutes to blanch them just to get some of the starchiness ass and it cooks it so it goes into the last minute two cups of half-and-half into the soup I should do it and the cheddar cheese and just let that melt so that's a good cheddar that I bought that Vermont cheddar that I bought at the store about half a pound and it's just thickens the soup and gives a great flavor just drain this corn you know facial at the same time and it goes right into soup and it's done then a little bacon that we cooked earlier right into the soup okay soup's on so it's like a gentle light now you take a play this note guys oh okay he's got a cheddar corn chowder it is also going to write those what are you doing outside peel it off the because the corn first go to corn just blanch it quickly and put it in as a last minute how's that take a roll and I'll meet you in there okay I'll be right there so everyone enjoy your soup is it was going on this Johnson I would so crunchy go go oh of course really so fresh oh thank you so a little salad juice alone babylegs yummy your cheese is this really good Swiss cheddar run six weeks look at the
