[Music] when I'm having a party I almost never actually make something to serve with drinks so when some things is easy and delicious as tuna tapenade I make an exception tapenades actually an olive paste from South of France and I'm going to turn up the volume and add tuna to it okay that's 12 ounces of Italian tuna most good already next ingredient is very Provencal anchovy paste and put in 2 teaspoons basically anchovies pureed with some spices love it 1 teaspoon of thyme give it a big rough chop that should be about a teaspoon fresh thyme is really important and 2 tablespoons of fresh parsley just give it a big rough chop remember it's all going to be pureed in the food processor when this is done I'm going to serve on crostini which has thin slices of spread that have been oiled and toasted a little bit so it's crunchy it's going to be delicious with it okay that's about 2 tablespoons next it's to close a garlic chopped give it lots of Provencal flavor and the next is the zest of one lemon okay so best assess of one lemon probably about a tablespoon just right in just go put the lid on and just pulse it I don't want to puree I want it really roughly chopped let's just break up the tuna perfect now for freshly squeezed lemon juice okay three tablespoons well cheap it's never hurt okay next is three tablespoons of olive oil this is like making a vinaigrette lemon juice and olive oil next is the third of a cup of mascarpone what's the point is is incredible Italian creamy cheese it's going to give that quick twist in the blender to puree okay now Alice can't have tough enough without olives quarter of a cup of pitted olives I actually use kalamata olives I think they have a really great sort of whiny flavor not one you like people wine you like wine okay right in table sort of capers this is proven√ßal everything has capers drained capers okay and just to make sure it has great flavor one teaspoon salt a source of salt and one teaspoon of pepper and just get that over you want a two pureed but you want a well mixed I'm gonna let it sit in the fridge first a couple of hours so all the flavors blend together it's actually one of the reasons why this is a great thing to make for hors d'oeuvres you can actually make it a day in advance and just taste better how great is that I love the texture of this especially sort of smooth and creamy but you can still see the olives and you can see the parsley and you can smell the lemon so it's all there this Dishman you actually have a lot of Italian ingredients in it it's actually Mediterranean and it's perfect southern promo style dish to serve with a nice glass of rose a foragers just definitely sure it's good my friends are going to love this one
