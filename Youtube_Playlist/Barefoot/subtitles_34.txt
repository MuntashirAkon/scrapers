[Music] well you can't have a cocktail party without the food and this is my formula for an easy cocktail party because I serve six orders but I only make two of them and this is the first one it's turkey key sandwiches first thing I'm doing is taking a raisin in that bread and slicing it pretty thin I'm going to get maybe about 20 slices out of it next thing is cream cheese I need 12 ounces of cream cheese if the cream cheese isn't room temperature it's gonna be very hard to spread and the sandwiches won't stick together which is really important you don't want to mess on the plate you want beautiful tea sandwiches okay so that's 12 ounces of cream cheese just give it a little bit of a stir they need a half a cup of chopped scallion that's about 4 scallion just right into the cream cheese a little salt and pepper to give it more flavor it's really important not to whip it you just want it to be really smooth but not whipped so I'm just gonna take the bread and lay them out I tend to do things assembly wine just lay them right out like that important thing is to put the cream cheese on both sides of the bread so when you put them together they stick together and just free cream cheese on all the pieces of bread just a thin layer don't neglect the corners and for the quantities three or four pieces per person and you'll always have enough next is the turkey so what I've got is smoked turkey so we want to do is just cover each sandwich with one layer of smoked turkey and you only want to put it on half the sandwiches because of course the other ones are going to be the top okay that's is the basil I'm just putting one leaf on each sandwich basil is really great because it's really peppery it just gives great flavor to this [Music] and then the taps go on I'm going to put the tops you want to make sure they line top and press them a little so they stick okay onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper so I'm going to refrigerate these until the cream cheese is really cold and then it stays together very well okay and this is the trick for keeping them really moist damp paper towel to take two paper towels some of them just slightly damp only slightly just dampen it and then squeeze it out hopefully they stay together I'm going to store this just like this in the refrigerator for about an hour until they get nice and firm if I'm going to store them so longer than that or reposeful thing in plastic wrap and if they just delicious for like six hours so get these nice and cold and then cut them just before the party when the sandwiches are cold put them on a board cut the crusts off with a very sharp knife then cut each sandwich and a half I do it diagonally I think it looks great but the little triangle with sandwiches onto a square platter with the points up I arrange them in two rows then because I like to garnish it with something that's in the sandwich I put a bunch of basil on the platter
