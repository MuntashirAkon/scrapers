[Music] sometimes the best ideas happen by chance one day my bridge friends and I were just sitting around saying we needed to have more fun so I suggested we have a potluck dinner where everybody brings a different course it all started two weeks ago [Music] you know I just have this feeling that all my friends think I live out in the Hamptons all I ever do is party but bridge is about it don't we need to have a party or something real party so what should we do no come on we got to be able to think of something I guess we could are you down then I had a great idea how about this how about if we do a potluck party and we'll all draw straws to see who makes what and I'll be the host okay everybody choose a course and that's how the cards were dealt so who got what hi I'm Jack and I can't cook a thing but the good news is I got antipasto for the potluck dinner and as ina says if you can't cook you buy it and assemble it and that's what I'm gonna do hi I'm mark and I'm gonna be doing dessert that's what I chose I think what I'll do is I'm his peach and raspberry Chris she made it for me quite a while ago and I've been cooking it ever since it's delicious and it's very easy to do I'm Patti I've got the wine and it's a great excuse to try a few bottles and me I'm making the main course and since it was all my idea I get to be the host - I can't wait to see what everybody else is bringing I thought it'd make vegetable pot pie and since the party's tonight I better get started so a lot of parts to this recipe but the first one is I'm gonna make the sauce and what I've done is I've put one and a half sticks of butter in a pot I know it looks like a lot of butter and it makes lots of vegetable pot pies I'm just gonna chop up these onions actually I think I'm gonna just slice them we use some unusual ingredients in this recipe we use fennel which has sort of Anna nice flavour and saffron which gives a great spice they're sort of Provence all flavors so the next thing is fennel which is actually a licorice flavored vegetable it's very sharp when it's fresh you can eat it fresh but I like it much better cooked it has a very delicate flavor and when it's cooked in butter and it's it's just so delicate and flavorful I love it so one head of fennel should do it so that's gonna cook for about ten minutes until the onions are translucent and the fennel has a really sweet flavor so the vegetable pot pie has all different kinds of vegetables in it and the first one is potatoes which are cut up in a dice and I've been cooking for about 10 minutes has a lot of vegetables most of them I'm just gonna blanch for a few minutes so they get some liquid in them before I actually bake the potpie so I've got carrots but one and a half cups butternut squash and he was blanch them all together just fine and then asparagus tips about one and a half cups right into the pot of boiling water so these vegetables are gonna blanch for about five minutes and they all cook together which is great and then time I can smell the onions and fennel are done okay and now I'm gonna make this sauce so the first thing is 1/2 a cup of flour we're just gonna thicken the sauce and then it's gonna cook for about two minutes you get rid of that sort of raw flour taste okay it's time to take the vegetables out I just think they needs a little bit of moisture that you get when they blanch before they go into the pot pie tastes so much better it's something really good in the pot pie and any goes chicken stock and of course if you want to make this vegetarian you can always use vegetable stock that's gonna start to thicken really quickly but a few more ingredients to add this is Pernod what you buy in the liquor store and it's actually got a fennel flavor and I think it just mmm love the way it smells just gonna add about a tablespoon to enhance the fennel flavor in this might have been a little more than a tablespoon it'll be good and then saffron saffron is actually the stamens of crocuses can you imagine collecting those it's why it's so expensive and a big pinch of it really adds an enormous flavor and spice to this epic teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon of pepper a lot of this depends on how salty or peppery your chicken stock is so you want to taste it and look how thick and gorgeous this sauce is now I wonder what my friends are up to what kind of trouble they're getting into hey Brian Jack how are you good I need a nice platter of antipasto sure and I think I'll start with 4 artichokes but Hank maybe some octopus salad all right and is there any type of cheese that you make here that's sort of impressive or oh well we make the fresh mozzarella every day okay so I definitely want one of those I'll put that in the water for you I'll stay fresh that way okay so here we go and I think that's it all right we wrap yeah perfect to paraphrase Gloria Vanderbilt the sauce can never be too rich or too delicious so I'm gonna add a little bit of heavy cream but you really don't have to just makes it taste all that much better like three tablespoons it just gives it a smoothness that's wonderful and now the vegetables so I've got all these blanch vegetables I'm just going to put them right in those that looked great I love the colors and the textures flavors it's gonna be good okay and then my little secret frozen small whole onions nobody needs to peel all these onions and you can throw them in frozen because I'm gonna defrost in the sauce and the last thing is for parsley and the sauce is done and the next thing I want to do is make the case Brook for the really important things about making pastry like the one I'm gonna make for the vegetable pot pie it's really cold ingredients like ice water and very cold butter and the other thing is to make sure the ingredients like the butter isn't chopped up too fun I'll show you how to do it I think a lot of people find pastry really don't think once you get the hang of the principles it's not so hard okay first thing is flour and I make pastry and a food processor it's really fast three cups of flour I use all-purpose flour 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of salt 1 teaspoon of baking powder you want to make sure it's fresh you know what baking powder it's been sitting in your pantry for two years okay and then I'm gonna add butter okay what butter it's nice and cold really big chunks okay right into it food processor 1/2 a cup of vegetable shortening I actually like to combine the flavor of butter with the flakiness that vegetable shortening gives right into the food processor so this is the next important step in addition to cold ingredients is I'm going to process this in the food processor but I want bits of butter all through the dough I don't want it pureed maybe ten pulses and then I'm just gonna check it and you want the butter like the size of peas so that's perfect just all through it and now I'm gonna put the ice water in about two-thirds of a cup with the motor running just pour it in just until it forms a ball of dough perfect so I'm gonna flour the board this is stone so I can do it directly on the stone you can use a wooden board anything like that it's gonna dump the dough right on top carefully take out the blade I've been known to cut myself we roll this in a ball this is just great it's soft it's got a nice feeling about it and I can see little bits of butter throughout the dough so I know I've done it right okay that's perfect the wrap in plastic wrap I'm gonna refrigerate it for about 30 minutes and that allows the gluten in the flour to relax it makes a really flaky pastry hey I'm going to a potluck party tonight and I don't know what they're serving could be fish could be meat can you help me find something I've got just a knife great thanks so educators of California Pinot Grigio okay it's gonna be light crisp very intense in flavor clothes s it's gonna go well with pasta salads okay do they make a good read as well they also make a nice Cabernet goes very well with things like if I don't barbecue very light very smooth great why don't it take one light and one red and party all happen by [Music] and finally we get to make vegetable pot pies I'm gonna make individual ones I think they'll be really nice so I'm gonna fill each bowl with a filling all the vegetables and sauce with fennel and pear no okay now I'm going to cover each one with pastry so this is the pastry than it chilled for about 30 minutes so it's firm enough and it has time for the gluten to relax it's perfect don't be nervous about having too much flour on the board just you want to be sure the pastry is always moving more like having flour all over me I'm gonna roll it out big enough so that I can cut out for large rounds to go on top of these balls they always want to roll from the center to the outside and you can see little bits of butter throughout the dough so I know it's gonna be really flaky so I'm gonna get another bowl and use it as a template to cut out the circles so upside-down Bowl we wanted about an inch bigger than the actual bowl so you can fold it over the edge of the bowl okay now I'm gonna use egg wash it's actually just an egg beaten with water or cream or milk whatever you have around but a tablespoon it's gonna become like a little bit of a glue and then the pastry top goes on top just like that so I'm just gonna press this to the edge make sure it stays so all the filling stays inside before you put these in the oven be sure you have oven proof dishes okay now what I'm going to do is I'm going to brush the top with egg wash just because that'll make it nice and brown when it comes out of the oven the pastry will be gorgeous and then I think it looks great to have salt and pepper on the top so I'm gonna just put a little bit of salt on each one did that look like it has lots of flavor and then some pepper want to do it after the egg wash so it sticks and then with my knife I'm just gonna cut a few slits in the top of each one so some of the steam escapes you don't want these things exploding in the oven okay 375 degrees for an hour and I'm gonna have absolutely delicious vegetable pot pies for my friends so Jack hinted that he was bringing onto posture I thought I'd surprise them and do roasted red peppers to add to it these red peppers are really sweet I find green peppers a little bitter I really want to get the core and those little white ribs out okay olive oil salt and pepper it's gonna drizzle it on this is the messy job I just want to drizzle each one with olive oil just she would sit around lots of salt and pepper really important okay I'm gonna roast them at 500 degrees which is really hot for about 20 minutes and then I'll show you how to take the skins off and later I'm gonna do them in basil oil it'd be really good inés recipe for peach raspberry crisp is so easy I know it by heart all I do is blanch the peaches add some orange zest a little granulated sugar some brown sugar and some flour tossing the raspberries I know everybody's gonna enjoy it pour it into an oval baking dish and let it sit for about five minutes just all the flavors sort of come together and then we'll add the topping later this pepper smell ready and they are cut gorgeous they are they're all sort of blackened and charred on the outside and they're gonna be really sweet on the inside this is the trick for peeling them really easily I put them in a big bowl and I'm gonna cover them with plastic wrap and let them sit for about 10 minutes [Music] the plastic graph is gonna keep the steam in and it's the steam that's gonna make it really easy to get the skins off so I understand Mart's making an old favorite I wonder what he's up to okay the fruits ready and now it's time for the crisp part of the recipe got flour [Music] some brown sugar some granulated sugar oatmeal a little bit of salt the butter which has been diced and it's nice and cold what we're gonna do is turn on the mixer low and just let it all mix up in the chill it becomes sort of pea-sized we're getting that okay this is done now all you do is put the topping on you gotta lay it on nice and thick because when it cooks it gets nice and bubbly and it so good it goes into the oven for an hour until the top is crispy and juices are bubbling always looking for new ways to give things flavor so I thought it'd be great on the red peppers to make like a basil oil watch how easy this is it's like a big handful of basil leaves and clove of garlic so we've got the flavors of pesto but much lighter much more like an oil you can use it in salad dressings just really wonderful to have around garlic I'm just gonna puree until the garlic is really chopped up fine and now I'm just going to pour oil and while it's go that smells great salt pepper and then just a taste to be sure it's really good it smells good Spray that's gonna be really good on the red peppers so I promise to be really easy to take the skins off these roasted peppers we'll see they've been steaming away and just all you have to do is just peel the skin off it's incredibly easy see it works and you didn't believe me later on I'm going to slice them and then drizzle them with basil oil so those are already [Music] [Music] perfect that's a great antipasto okay if it's a pretty delicious look for the base of all it just throws it on top like this so people know it's basil oil I would like to put a big bunch of basil right on the plate [Music] [Music] let's just put it right down on the table take your usual bridge seats Jax and Acosta looks fabulous it's a work of architecture work and I have roasted peppers of anybody nice Sauvignon with them we should test our poster oh thank you thank what a great idea who wants vegetable pot pie so it's got potatoes and butternut squash carrots asparagus and little onions I'll tell you the secret of a flaky crust I'm listening oh you're really cold ingredients and Mark made my favorite peach raspberry crisp I can't believe you know it was my favorite I love it marks the creator the first one great wine choose [Music]
