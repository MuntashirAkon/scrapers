I'm going to take two pounds of shrimp they're still in the shell I think they stay moister if you cook them in the shell and I'm pouring it into a pot of boiling water that's got lemon and salt in it and that will flavor it while they cook so the key to really good shrimp salad is to make sure that you don't cook the shrimp for more than three minutes it doesn't seem like a long time but if they cook for more than that it will definitely be overcooked what I'm looking for is to know that the shrimp are firm and hot and they're really done so I'm going to take them out and put them nice water stop the cooking immediately see how fast that was that almost wasn't even three minutes okay so now that it's an ice-water I can actually peel them right away so you take off the tail and then take off the shell and there's a little vein that goes right down the back of the shrimp that I want to take out just take it out with your knife that's done excellent so for the sauce it's a mayonnaise sauce but what I'd love to do with mayonnaise is thin it with some kind of flavoring I'm gonna start with one cup of mayonnaise I don't like that sort of gloppy mayonnaise thick mayonnaise taste so I always send it with something I'm going to do it with white wine just to my head in the fridge just tablespoon or so so that that's good that sort of a texture of it which is so much nicer than mayonnaise and then we're going to add all kinds of flavorings let's see how about some mustard let me have a teaspoon and salt once itself to be really well flavored because the shrimp are fairly bland and you wanted to really season this off nice pepper so we've got lots of fresh dill that I've cut up here so that's about three tablespoons of dill in there I'm just going to taste it and see how the sauce remember it has to be really highly seasoned because it's going to mix with the shrimp delicious got lots of flavor okay and then the shrimp I'm going to pour the sauce right over the shrimp took that all together and then I'm going to add some fresh vegetables some celery which is really traditional and some red onion which will give it a little spice are really good I'm going to put them one-and-a-half cups of chopped celery and I'm just going to use half an onion mix it all together so this looks great it's got a nice creamy dressing and all the fresh vegetables of celery and onions and the shrimp was dill perfect
