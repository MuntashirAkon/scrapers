I'm building a barn in my garden with a working kitchen and I love my architect where is he thank you to his whole team and I thought what better way than to make them a wonderful lunch okay so lobster paella I'm going to turn it up to 425 and I want to show you how I make really easy paella I actually used to avoid this because it was so complicated I thought what am I going to bother making a big pot of things we have to cook everything individually so I decided I would make it with lots of things I already cooked and I'll show you how easy it is so first a quarter of a cup of oil and I'm going to chop up some onions that wanted to have cups of onions so the first thing I did was I started on the cooktop but then I do most of the cooking in the oven so I'm not always standing over a hot pot and the second thing is instead of cooking each individual thing differently it has shrimp that has chicken and has sausage I decided I'm going to use all things that are cooked like cook cabassa cooked lobster I decide to make it really special I mentioned was the classic Spanish dish where you use that bowl the leftovers okay so saute those for about five minutes the meantime I'm going to cut up some red peppers so in order to julienne pepper so they're really nice-looking just going to cut straight down and then save that later for snack and then just julienne about half inch strips that's a great dish to make when you're serving a crowd it's great to make in large quantities and you don't have to serve it the minute it gets out of the oven okay how the onions doing they're just starting to get a little translucent and put the peppers in and let them cook for about five minutes just want to get the most flavor out of what you put in this is all going to flavor the right and then later I'm going to add all kinds of delicious things to it put it in the oven okay the next thing is garlic I like lots of garlic so I'm going to use like four or five cloves of garlic this can actually be a very inexpensive dish to make if you make it with cooked mussels and clams but I'm going to make a special one today for the architect with lobster okay so about two tablespoons of garlic just put it in cook this for about a minute so the garlic doesn't burn okay next with the right two cups of rice traditionally the Spanish use a short grain rice or a medium grain rice for this I like basmati rice I think it's really firm it's that great flavor so two cups of basmati rice and five cups of chicken stock you can use can stock but I really prefer homemade okay Nets and great spices 1/2 teaspoon of saffron which is actually amazingly the stamens of crocuses huge in collecting them and it's a seasoned it and it's going to give a great yellow color half a teaspoon of crushed red pepper flakes give it a little heat not too so much that you can't taste the rest of the ingredients 1 teaspoon of salt and 1 teaspoon of fennel [Music] okay just give it a big stir let it come to a simmer put the lid on put the whole thing in the oven for 25 to 15 minutes oh my goodness that's a lot of Paia it's all the rice and the saffron and peppers and onions garlic it's going to be fantastic I just have a few things I want to add to it the first thing is some Perrineau which is anise flavored wine will occur it's just going to give it a nice fennel flavor so I need 1/3 of a cup turn the heat on a little bit so all the liquids absorbed it can really smell the saffron and garlic fantastic and this is the trick for really easy pie things that are already cooked because the first thing I have is 1/2 1/2 pounds of cooked lobster meat this big chunky pieces it's a high and low heat a little more expensive to buy it already crust but certainly a huge difference in time just going to turn the heat off so the lobster doesn't cook anymore just scheme and then I would like to do some kind of sausage but since cabassa has already cooked always use that you can really find cabassa in any kind of a really traditional Italian or it's Polish sausage but any kind of it Adelie I'm going to put in a pound of kielbasa just nice big slices so you can really see it okay that goes in okay and now another secret is frozen peas so all we're going to do really is put them in the hot rice and they're going to defrost that's one 10 ounce package of frozen peas I'm just going to mix it all in looks amazing all the saffron rice and lobster kielbasa peppers just kind of fabulous and put the lid on and steam it for about 15 minutes and then I'm going to serve it with lots of parsley and big chunks of lemon and lunch is ready [Music]
