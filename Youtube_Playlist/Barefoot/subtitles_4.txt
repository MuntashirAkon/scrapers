[Music] my friend Barbara Beth's gorgeous daughter Cassandra is getting married this year and I've offered to help with the rehearsal dinner I believe in first impressions and last impressions so I've asked my friend Miguel to do two table settings for Cassandra to choose from and I'm making two over the top desserts first I'm making a baba of Rome which is a delicious cake made with yeast and then soaked and I mean soaked in rum syrup and second I'm giving her a choice with yo Flo Tom or floating island which is big mounds of meringue floating on a sea of vanilla creme anglaise and drizzled with caramel and pralines Cassandra's coming later to choose which table setting and which dessert she wants for her rehearsal dinner I think it's gonna be really hard to choose so the first dessert that I'm going to suggest for Cassandra's rehearsal dinner is a classic French bistro dessert and it's called Baba au Rhum or a rum Baba and what it is is it's a yeast cake made with currants and it's allowed to rise and it's soaked I mean we're talking soaked with rum syrup and it's absolutely delicious I've been making bubble room for Geoffrey I think since we first got married and I thought the santur would love it for her party okay that's really well buttered now I'm going to start making the cake so the first thing I need is warm milk you need 1/2 a cup of milk heated to 115 degrees that's the ball is really college one heat a little more but if you're not sure about 115 degrees use a thermometer pull one packet of yeast in there's a little bit of a process but you can do it in advance and then soak it just before you're going to serve it one packet of yeast and two tablespoons of sugar the sugar actually makes the yeast grow it's like food for the yeast I just stir it around clean hands you can do it with your fingers well it sit for about five minutes and leaves find it you'll see bubbles it's the carbon dioxide coming out of the knees and that's how you know it's aligned alive and with it and in the meantime I'm gonna soak the currants in rum mmm that's really everything in this cake is soaked in rum so I need third of a cup of currants that's a really great they're like raisins smaller and they're a little harder so I really like them and a tablespoon of good dark rum dark rums it's kind of like the difference in regular sugar and brown sugar it just has much more flavor just one tablespoon and just mix it up with your hands very hands on cake and then the currents are just gonna soak up all that wrong perfect okay the yeast is dissolved you can see it bubbling away in the bowl okay two eggs I would never crack eggs directly into the mixture because you never know when you get a bad one so the mixer on low speed I'm gonna put in me at first the eggs one and two thirds cups of flour all-purpose flour put the flour and slowly so it doesn't clump half a teaspoon of salt you always put the salt in last because the salt retards the growth of the yeast and four tablespoons of room-temperature butter remember it has to be really really soft this is gonna make a really light dough and just let me tune okay perfect you're gonna see it's very very wet and sticky but it's just right oh damn towel just a kitchen towel just slightly damp towel you don't want it soaking wet just enough so the dough doesn't dry out while it's rising okay I think I hear Miguel it's coming to due to table settings for Cassandra and I know that both gonna be so beautiful she'll never be able to choose hi time ago thank you so much for doing this every rehearsal table needs a good stylist and you're in so I got you all kinds of things I got you flowers and I got plates and napkins and glasses I did two different Clause you can change anything you like to say yeah I got two shapes I thought it'd be interesting for her choice of chicks right now and we'll we'll get the taste into good so the barroom dough has been sitting for a bed now and should be double in volume and it is it's perfect so the next thing I want to do is drain the currents these are soaked in rum I bet they're delicious I'd have to taste one make sure they're right mmm so good mmm I'm just gonna pour them into the dough so this is a yeast dough and it's got currants soaked in rum throughout the dough I'm gonna let it rise one more time and then soak it so this is a really sticky dough now and it's got all these currents in it it's beginning to smell rum like okay they're nicely distributed and now we're gonna do is put it into the cook of off malls you can see the devil it's really nice and don't be surprised it's really wet and sticky it is like wallpaper paste it just sticks to everything I think I'm gonna need a night for this just spread it around evenly in the pan it doesn't have to be perfect so I'm gonna put a damp cloth back on it let it rise for about 50 minutes until it's about double in volume and then I'm gonna bake it at 375 for about 30 minutes gonna be great and now I'm gonna make the sugar syrup [Music] so my bubble room is out of the oven and bake for 30 minutes at 375 and I just let it cool for about 10 minutes 15 minutes until I could starting to get it out of the pan this is just the moment of truth whether in fact I've greased it enough perfect oh isn't that Kourt just I'm always amazed myself so now I'm gonna do is make the rum syrup that soaks it it's gonna make it really good so the first thing you need is one and a half cups of water and a cup of sugar just cook this on high heat until the sugar dissolves you know I always thought that what this was originally a brioche that got stale and somebody said no let's just soak it in sugar syrup and see if it works and a little rum never hurts okay that was really fast I'm just gonna pour this into it and they have 2/3 of a cup of oil just experimenting a little bit usually the sugar syrup is that but I find that rum a little bit harsh and I found if I had a half a teaspoon of vanilla extract it just rounds out the flavor beautifully it's not a trauma hot syrup and now I'm just been very slowly pour it onto the cake so that it soaks in can you see it just absorbs all that gorgeous that's why you want the cake still to be warm when you do this and then afterwards I'm going to put a glaze on it to make it nice and shiny a little sweet and when it's sort of a big mound of whipped cream in the middle last bit of form syrup into the cake see I told you it would all go in every master huh okay now we're gonna make the apricot glaze so I'm gonna take a pan apricot preserves a spoon and just put about 3/4 of a cup of apricot jam into the pan add a tablespoon of water I'm just gonna keep this all together and then sieve it so it makes a nice thin clear glaze okay this just a six-second and then port right through the sieve okay most of my desserts don't take too long to make but every once in a while it's a special occasion and it's worth going through the steps good news about this is you can do a lot of it in advance okay so that's it we've got a nice thin clear glaze I'm just gonna brush it on the outside of the cake won't believe how beautiful this looks isn't amazing what the glaze does for the cake I wonder which dessert she's gonna choose but when I wonder which table setter she's gonna choose Cassandra is not decided where she's going to have the rehearsal dinner so I'm going to give her two options a round table which is slightly more Provencal more country like and this one which is more urban and more elegant more formal for the centerpiece we're going to use this very nice needs of ivy we're gonna create this nice little pattern in the middle looks slightly like a star and voila this very very nice bunch of hydrangeas for the second dessert I'm gonna make breakfast Sandra it's called ear flotant which is floating island it's an old-fashioned French Nursery dessert and I think she's going to just love it first thing I need to make us caramel sauce turn the heat on high really high so I've got 1/2 a cup of water and one and a half cups of sugar and I'm gonna cook it until it's a warm caramel brown color like a really rich color okay while that boils away I'm gonna start on the praline so I need one and a half cups of blanched sliced almonds you can find them in the grocery store know you can always smell this first it's just you can start to see the heat and just swirl it carefully it's just incredibly hot don't touch it just gonna turn it off I need 1/2 a cup of water I'm gonna add water and vanilla now this is the tricky part it's gonna bubble up violently so just stand back they need 1/2 a teaspoon of good vanilla extract and just stir this carefully and cook it until it's 230 degrees on a candy thermometer and it's gonna be just the right consistency he's gonna be pourable when it's at room temperature mmm you can smell that wonderful caramel the sort of burnt sugar and vanilla can be delicious okay we're there 230 degrees so I'm going to take about a quarter of a cup of the caramel you really careful this unbelievably hot just drizzle it right over and the rest of the caramel sauce I'm gonna say it for drizzling over the ill Fatone so just mix this up together make sure the almonds are coated in caramel spread it out on the pan I'm gonna bake this 350 degrees for 10 to 12 minutes until the almonds are nice and brown and crisp and then I'm going to sprinkle that over the top and then I'm gonna show you how easy the meringues are and they're just gorgeous [Music] so the next thing I'm going to make for Cassandra's ill float all is the islands or just meringue so I need eight egg whites at room temperature I'm gonna say the egg yolks for making the custard right into the mixer okay I'm just gonna put in a quarter of a teaspoon of cream of tartar that acts as a stabilizer for the egg whites and an eighth of a teaspoon of salt and then turn it on high speed exciting frothy I'm gonna throw away at a cup of sugar a decent vanilla okay I'm gonna do really messy mounds of this on two sheet pans lined with parchment paper good news about meringues is they're not supposed to be perfect sort of messy and organic looking this isn't like the hard meringues that you get that are like cookies these are gonna be really soft meringues and melt in your mouth and because of the good vanilla I'll taste like vanilla clouds it's impossible to do this without getting it all over you and the kitchen into the oven 250 degrees for about 20 minutes and we're gonna have meringues I think Miguel's starting to work on a second table setting I can't wait to see it [Music] in case that Cassandra wants something more informal I'm going to give her this second option which I'm calling it the provençal table and as you can see this is sort of wheat color over cloth I decided to use very modern glasses for the water and stemware for the wine instead of having one centerpiece I decided to have three centerpieces I like this because it gives the idea it sort of emphasizes the idea of the round table so no matter where you look you have different flowers to look at round Square and wonder which one she will choose for the last part of my element is Kremlin glass so the first thing I need is 1 and 3/4 cups of milk and I want to scald it which means I'm gonna heat it to just under the boiling point okay in the meantime I'm gonna start making it's a very light custard so it's got egg yolks these are four egg yolks left over for making meringues okay and then half a cup of sugar and a teaspoon of cornstarch [Music] and Oprah the milk is perfectly ready you see the bubbles around the outside and stuff before it's boiling actually it's easiest to pour it in as I born in this and report in very slowly otherwise you end up with scrambled eggs first search isn't always used they can come on with us but it acts as a stabilizer so it makes it easier to cook now looks great okay now goes back in the pan I'm gonna cook it over very low heat until it's just slightly thickens this isn't like pastry cream which is very thick this is really a thin sauce and then after it's cooked I'm gonna flavor it with amaretto and vanilla it's gonna be delicious so this is starting to thicken what it'll do is cut the spoon so a little bit more and be done perfect I'm gonna sip it just in case there are little particles and I know if there's anything cooked egg in it I think I just made it before it went too far look at that in that gorgeous okay one and a half teaspoons of amaretto which is almond liqueur mmm love the smell of that teaspoon of vanilla and you think I'll that's something to look like what it tastes like I think the seeds of half of Anila pod next I'm going to assemble the elf Lata and make some worm whipped cream for the bubble over [Music] Cassandra's gonna be here in a few minutes I want to assemble the ill Fatah and Baba au Rhum and time for her to get here first remember I made this wonderful creme on glass you can see the vanilla being specs in it I'm gonna make a puddle of it in the middle of this plate and then meringue islands right in the middle okay a drizzle of caramel sauce I've allowed it to cool so it's nice and thick and caramel and the last part is the praline almonds that I made earlier just crack them in big shards right on top of that meringue and caramel it's like heaven and the Baba au Rhum nice flat green leaf it's gonna be tough choice for Cassandra I don't know what I would choose now I'm just gonna fill this whole Center with whipped cream who wouldn't want to have that for dessert [Music] so these are the two desserts the first one is Baba au Rhum it's a cheesecake with currants that soaked in rum and of course it's filled with whipped cream okay and the second one is called a float top which is a floating island it's big meringues drizzled with caramel and then praline almonds sprinkled on the top so it's creamy on the bottom it's sort of light and fluffy in the middle and then crunchy on the top here's your test or you walk to it fantastic okay Miguel you have to taste - you don't get a vote but you get a taste only the bride gets a vote it was so much fun to make these what's the I think I like the floating island I do okay but I have to tell you if you wake up at 3 in the morning go oh my god it chose the wrong one you can choose the other one yeah oh I'm so glad Cheers another toaster to Santa Miguel for the tables so we have the previs all table and then we have the urban table I think I like the Provencal yeah I have more of a hydrangea theme at my wedding and I think I love something a little I totally agree I think it's gorgeous more desert I think we have to appeal flow Tom and Cassandra's on or right
