I love the combination of strawberries and cream and I thought it'd be really fun to make a cake that had those flavors so I came up with a strawberry country cake it was wonderful through simple white cake and I cut it in half and then I feel it was whipped cream and fresh strawberries I'm going to start with one and a half sticks of butter and two cups of sugar I'm gonna cream these together it's a nice light color it's really fluffy wonderful and now on low speed I'm going to add the eggs I need four eggs I always crack them into a bowl so there's a bad egg I haven't ruined everything I've made I'm going to add these eggs one at a time so next thing I want to add is sour cream so it's 3/4 of a cup of sour cream and that goes in I'm sour creams room-temperature - so it all gets incorporated nicely so first I'm gonna do a little orange zest but I have a teaspoon should do it so that's about a half a teaspoon half a teaspoon of lemon zest that should do it that's going to go into the batter mix those in and a little vanilla these flavors are really subtle because I don't want them to overpower the strawberries and whipped cream after I sell the cake okay I've got all the wet ingredients now I'm going to do the dry ingredients I need two cups of all-purpose flour and quarter of a cup of cornstarch teaspoon of baking soda which is the leavening just going to make it rise and 1/2 teaspoon of salt and then on low speed just add the flour really slowly and then into the pan so when I bake these both now once for the party tonight and what I'm going to freeze and I'll have another party another time but they get 350 degrees for about 45 minutes until a cake cluster comes out clean so now the cakes are nicely cooled and the first thing I want to do is put one of the cakes in the freezer now for our favorite cake the one we're going to have tonight I'm going to cut it in half and fill it with strawberries and whipped cream so I'll show you a chick I'm feeling shaky I'll take two six and just put them halfway through and then I'll cut just above the toothpicks and I know my knife will cut it exactly in half that's not so good now the first thing is we have two whipped cream that a cup of heavy cream and then while that's looking on this flavor is vanilla but it'd have to be soon and some sugar so this is really T okay perfect place a little bit of cream on the cake big thick slices of strawberries place them with a point tipping out the top goes on big dollop a little cream on the time I love about this is sort of a country kind of dessert it's a nice big strawberries on the top I like the way the stems on because it with more strawberry like house [Music]
