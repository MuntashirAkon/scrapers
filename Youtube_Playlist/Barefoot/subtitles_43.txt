[Music] I was trying to come up with my list of all-time favorite desserts would be something frozen something chocolate pie maybe a crisp was so hard to decide I went through all my old recipes and I realized what I liked best are the classics update it first summer pudding is traditionally a cake with cooked berries and bread but I'm making it even better with delicious brioche then my favorite comfort food rice pudding but I'm turning up the volume by adding good dark rum I'm making a traditional key lime pie even better by adding lots of fresh lime zest and serving it frozen and then two new recipes my favorite creme anglaise made into ice cream with vanilla and cognac and finally homemade caramel sauce for a quick dessert poured over ice cream or cake everyone says they don't want dessert but when I serve these my friends seem to clean their plates in the summer when the local berries are ripe and they're just right off the vine there's nothing better than a big bowl of fresh berries dusted with confectioners sugar and just serve it with a little cookie it's wonderful but every once in a while I want to do something really over-the-top and that's the time and I like to make summer pudding which is layers of cooked berries and brioche and it comes out like a cake it's so fantastic [Music] one pint of strawberries one and a half cups of sugar a little bit of water about a quarter of a cup I'm gonna cook this all together and it's gonna be a wonderful stewed berry that's gonna be absorbed by all that gorgeous brioche and now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna add more berries to it to half pints of fresh raspberries I love to make this in the summer when the berries are particularly good but can really get good berries from California almost all year long to have kinds of fresh blueberries these look like good blueberries and I'm gonna leave one of the half pints of raspberries to put in later just because I want some Cooke berries and some fresh berries in it so this is gonna cook for about five minutes on a very low flame just like a low simmer okay so while that's happening I'm gonna cut the brioche up I'm gonna do 1/2 inch thick slices stack them all up cut off the crust cause that's big that it's more like cake and it is bread so the berries should be done by now and they are it's perfect so but I turn it off and the last thing when they do just to give us some real texture I did another half kind of fresh raspberries 2 tablespoons of cr√®me blush which is raspberry paired with brandy and it just gives it so much flavor that'll do it so this is a souffle there's 7 or 8 inches it doesn't really matter and I want something that's tall enough so after it's set when I turn it out it's high like a cake it would look great so the first thing is a ladle full of cooked berries in the bottom of the bowl I'm gonna take the brioche and fit it in the bottom remember when you turn it over that's gonna be the top so I want to be sure that there's a really pretty layer of brioche and I'm gonna start by doing it around like this let's see how does this fit in so it's you wanted to be sure it fits in nicely so that's just gonna sit in there and now another layer of berries I mean I could smell the friend blahs when it hits the heat really doesn't a great job of flavoring it and what the oh Sh I find it's easier to assemble it if I cut this in triangles but you sort of can sort of squish it together and fit it in so it fits right just it's like a jigsaw puzzle just fit it together more berries in juice less layer so now when I turn this out this is the bottom one of the best parts I said it comes out raspberry red and it's just gorgeous so now I'm just gonna wait it with a plate that's just smaller than the circumference of the souffle dish and then put some kind of a can on top and it's just gonna sit on there for about six or eight hours until it gets sort of denser and absolutely delicious and then I'll take it off and it's gonna be ready whenever I want it then after eight hours in the refrigerator it was time for the moment of truth turning the summer pudding out just run a knife on the outside the time I always hold my breath but looks great with berries in the brioche [Music] and it looked that outrageous and so he'd smell the berries and the Brio she's gonna be just wonderful people are so shocked by it [Music] so it berries are in season in the summer the strawberries and raspberries and blueberries I buy extra keeping in the freezer for last-minute dessert it's a great party dessert they take about an hour to freeze and I serve them with hot white chocolate sauce it's so easy to make you just melt one pound of white chocolate with a cup of heavy cream and half a teaspoon of vanilla extract the berries are ice cold the chocolate is hot it's an amazing combination next I'm gonna make creme anglaise and then after that I'm gonna go back to a time when I made rum raisin rice pudding the most wonderful cozy fireside dinner now we're gonna make creme anglaise which is a vanilla custard dessert sauce it's delicious to serve with hot and cold desserts but it's also the base for wonderful ice cream half a cup of sugar and then mix those together and I have scalded milk right there on the stove I need 1 and 3/4 cups of scalded milk which is milk that's heated to just below the boiling point 1 teaspoon of cornstarch goes into the eggs and sugar mixture and now I'm gonna add the milk very slowly because I don't want scrambled eggs I want a beautiful sauce you can really add any kind of flavoring to a sauce like this but I particularly like vanilla and cognac so that's what I'm doing okay that's perfect it's gonna pour this back into the pan and cook it over very low heat until it just begins to thicken and then later I'm gonna flavor it and in the meantime I'm gonna show you how to make rum raisin rice pudding yeah so the first thing for rice pudding you need rice and I cooked about 3/4 of a cup of basmati rice I actually love to use basmati rice it's sort of got a nuttier flavor and it's like a whole grain rice so it's wonderful and rice pudding so that's cooked for about 8 or 9 minutes with a little bit of salt and now I'm gonna add 4 cups of half-and-half if you want to be good you can use milk but I want this to be delicious I'm gonna turn up the heat and then have a cup of sugar and just let that cook for about 25 minutes I'm gonna bring up the heat until it boils and then lower it and let it simmer for about 25 minutes until the rice is perfectly cooked and then I'm gonna add all these great flavors so I'm gonna take about 3/4 of a cup of raisins and 2 tablespoons are really good rum I love good dark rum it's got such a great flavor just pour it over I'm just gonna mix them up a little bit so the raisins soaked in all that rum these are just gonna sit here and get better and better wonderful so I'm just gonna turn this down to simmer and let it cook for 25 minutes the rice is ready looks just gorgeous creamy but I just want to make sure the rice grains we're done this is not the place for out that day it's great it's creamy I know it sounds like most rice pudding is actually made with milk and then you had a heavy cream at the end so I thought why not just make it easier and make it all half and a half just stir that in I'm just gonna add one egg and just stir it in slowly I'm just gonna give the rice pudding a really good texture okay and while that's cooking for a minute I'm gonna add one and a half teaspoons of vanilla and the rum and raisins that I've been soaked for about a half-hour [Music] so good and then just put it right in [Music] yikes stir it up mmm this looks so good I love him the rum hits the heat and you just get that whiff of rum it's sort of like raisin ice cream so I'm just gonna put it in a bowl and chill it and then it'll be ready for dessert I'm gonna put a little bit of film right over the top so it doesn't I'm just again I'd say that's when we really nice dessert on a chilly winter night in front of the fireplace and indeed it was when my friend and weena came for dinner and for the grand finale Wow but it's rice pudding [Laughter] rum-raisin rice pudding is good warm in the winter there's also delicious cold in the summer if you know somebody's not feeling too well it's the desert equivalent of chicken soup to make them feel better immediately so I'm just watching this creme anglaise it's just getting thick now you never want to let it boil just up to about a hundred and eighty degrees and it just thickens slightly until it coats the spoon and that's perfect it's done so I'm going to is I'm gonna strain it just to make sure there are no lumps in it just pour it right through a strainer great nice and smooth I'm gonna add a teaspoon of good vanilla extract and one and a half teaspoons of brandy or cognac whichever you have in the pantry don't go buy cognac just for one and a half teaspoons you can do rum whatever it tastes good just stir it up mmm I love the smell of vanilla and cognac together and then if you really want to be over-the-top and you have a vanilla bean around I'd love to put the seeds of vanilla bean into this not only flavors but then it looks like vanilla cut it in half we're in your life right along with vanilla bean and then put the seeds right in then stir it up refrigerate this next I'm going to show you Geoffrey's favorite dessert key lime hi frozen key lime pie is one of our all-time favorite summer desserts and what's wonderful is you don't even have to roll out the crust you just Pat it in I'll show you how I make it it just makes one and a half cups of graham cracker crumbs with a quarter cup of sugar and six tablespoons of melted butter press it into a pie pan no rolling pins and then just bake it 350 degrees for 10 minutes what it's cooled I'm gonna make the filling which is exactly what I did when I made this pie for Jeffrey this is my kind of cooking no cooking at all I've whipped six egg yolks in the mixer with a better quarter of a cup of sugar and now I'm gonna add sweetened condensed milk this is a really traditional recipe but I think this has more flavor than most yeah and to fish that lid out so I'm going to pour it in on low speed just so it mixes in make sure you get it all ah I even got it on the mixer that's nice the next thing is lime zest I always use lime juice but I think the zest has more flavor than the juice so I make sure that I get a lot in this is my handy dandy rasp I love it so that's about two tablespoons of lime zest just goes right in and the last ingredient is freshly squeezed lime juice it's about 3/4 of a cup well this looks so great you can see all the zest and the filling and that's it I'm just gonna pour it into my baked pie shell so it was into the freezer until it was frozen and then it was time to decorate it about a cup of heavy cream wearing part of it quarter cup of sugar and some vanilla and while that's going I'm just gonna slice up some lines I just think it's really important for something to be decorated with a flavor that it is so when you look at it you know exactly that it's line perfect you want it so it's really firm but not but it hasn't turned into butter yet so that's perfect and sometimes when I'm feeling up to it I'll pipe it in a decorative way but I think now it's gonna be really casual America right in the middle just so you can see the frozen key lime pie around the edges but you have the whipped cream in the middle just like that it's easy it's earthy and then with some fresh lime that's just wonderful really superb well I have to tell you this is the best working on a new recipe I'm always trying to find a balance of flavors a little bit of layering a little complexity but not unusual flavors I find it occur sometimes exactly what I'm looking for some like rum and friend wise I use over and over again and the cognac that I used earlier for the creme on glass but I think my favorite is Grand Marnier it's an orange liqueur and it gives chocolate an incredible depth of flavor like with chocolate mousse it's a fabulous and then there's chocolate gotta have chocolate so I always keep the chocolate chips on hand if I want to make really quick chocolate sauce and bor√•s of chocolate to make Chocolate Chunk cookies not bad and I actually also keep jars of good chocolate sauce available so if you make a really good ice cream sundae speaking of ice cream sundaes I particularly love caramel sauce I'll show you how I make it [Music] well the cremon glaze is nice and cool now I left some in the fridge to serve over berries but this I'm gonna make into ice cream pour it right into the ice cream maker and next I'm gonna show you a really delicious caramel sauce that's so easy to make ice cream with caramel sauce who wouldn't want that for dessert a thing about caramel sauce is you watch it and you watch it and you watch it and nothing happens the second you walk away it burns so I'm just going to keep watching this until the sugar and the water in the pan turns sort of a golden nutty brown and I think we're there that's one and a half cups of sugar and a third of a cup of water and it took about ten minutes to get to this stage okay and then I have to add two ingredients heavy cream one and a quarter cups now this is the critical stage I'm going to turn the stove off when I pour the cold cream into the hot caramel I just want to stand back because it's gonna really bubble up a little bit of vanilla extract and then I'm just gonna cook it until the caramel melts into the heavy cream and I've got caramel sauce just gonna slowly combine that looks delicious it looks dangerous and we have caramel sauce this is the ice cream I made with a creme on glass I can actually smell the cognac and vanilla and I just happen to have some homemade caramel sauce very dear friend of mine says when you invite people for dinner you never remember what you serve for dinner but they always remember dessert [Music]
