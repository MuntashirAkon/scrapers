I think just about every one of us has dreamed one time or another about owning a business well my friend Ina Garten turned her dream into a reality when she left her job in Washington DC in 1978 exactly and she opened a specialty food shop called the Barefoot Contessa how many of us always want to have a restaurant or a food store right I think a lot of people dream of it so you may area of the Barefoot Contessa she now has 50 employees a best-selling cookbook athle named the Barefoot Contessa cookbook and legions of devoted customers I do then how are you we spent some time with her any Hampton New York to learn the secret of her success I think a name really is important when you're getting started I actually inherited the name Barefoot Contessa and I think it's perfect because it comes from a movie with Hebert Gardner and Humphrey Bogart and what it's about is about being elegant and mercy and I think that's what we are the Barefoot Contessa is a 3,000 square foot Emporium of epicurean excellence delighting both the eye and the palate but this piece for the senses was created not by a gourmand but by a desk-bound bureaucrat who wanted to change when I was in my 20s and I was trying to figure out what to do with my life I was working in a group in the White House called office of management and budget working on nuclear energy policy what was I doing there so I decided that it was time to look for something new and I saw an ad for a business for sale in The New York Times there was a specialty food store in a town I'd never been in before and I thought I don't want to go investigate this starting your own business is a challenging and harrowing experience but choosing what to do according to ina is easy what a friend had told me is when you're thinking about what you want to do with your life think about what you used to do when you were 10 when you did things naturally with that thing about what should I be doing should I be a lawyer should I be a doctor what did you really enjoy doing and what I loved to do was cook so I went up to the town in the Hamptons to investigate this specialty food store and I thought this is excessive what I want to do so I made her a very low offer thinking well look home I'll think about it we'll negotiate and I went back to Washington and the next day she called me in my office and said thank you very much I accept your offer and I went oh my god what have I done the first thing she did was to negotiate a sensible financial arrangement we structured the deal so that first of all I could pay half of its money up front and then half of it out of the proceeds of the business so that I wasn't burdened with an enormous amount of expenses up front second she arranged to have the owner briefly stay on she stayed with me for months to teach me what I needed to know I didn't know how to hire somebody I knew how to make brownies for 12 people but I had no idea how to make 5,000 brownies and that's what I needed she know how to do you want to sit down right here five minutes register she'll take care of you there and the second day I was overwhelmed I had no idea what I was getting into I took over the store on Thursday before Memorial Day weekend and I thought at the end of the day the woman who sold me the store was telling me how to cash out the register we had eighty-five dollars in the drawer and I thought I'll never make it here and that next day having no idea what the Hansons was like Friday is Memorial Day weekend we were overrun I closed the store at 10 o'clock at night and everything in the store was gone it wasn't a cupcake that wasn't a salad there wasn't a brownie there wasn't a piece of cheese and we looked at each other and horror and I thought this is going to be the worst experience of my life now when I first met Larry he actually came to me and said he wanted to come work here and I said what do you like to make and he said cookies and I said you're hired and boy was I right so you make lie turned out to be ammonia's rewarding experiences of her life and it made her determined to learn every aspect of the business how's it going it was really important for me to know everybody's job so the first six months when I took over the store I decided I would not change anything I would just work with each person in the store and figure out exactly what they do so I knew I could do that job that's important for me for several reasons one if somebody's sick I can take over their job and second I think it commands more respective if I know how to do their job at least as well as they do and then as I built the business I knew how to train somebody because I had already done that job as the bread Rises instead of cracking in random places it will rise incidence catering was virgin territory to einen and in those early days elbow grease innovation and mom prevented a disaster we talked about the menu this was 20 years ago and I said well how about if we do a poached salmon and she said perfect and I thought poached salmon I've never made a poached salmon in my life so I got on the phone mom how do you poach a salmon so my mother talked to me about how to poach a salmon in the oven and I took it to this woman's house to do the salmon where you roll it up in foil and you put the court bullion in and you put the whole thing in the oven and I got there and realized the oven was too small for the Sam and I thought oh my god what am I going to do so I cut the head off I cut the tail off I put them all in pieces I put them in the oven and then we took it out and I reconstructed that salmon so nobody ever knew I had to cut it up it was fine and it was delicious creative solutions like these helps her become an expert in her field if I didn't know how to make what it is that I needed to be solved I'd go home by myself and I'd spend a week making scones and at the end of the process I know more about scones and anybody who worked for me and then I would bring them the recipes and say I think it'd be really interesting to make scones this way let's try it and that's how I really got knowledgeable about doing it and I'm not going to learn that in busy school I had to learn it by doing it myself [Music]
