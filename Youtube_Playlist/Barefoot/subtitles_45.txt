[Music] my friend did weena is coming for dinner tonight well she's not just any friend she's my incredibly talented friend who designed my garden and I thought after a chilly stroll through the orchard it'd be really wonderful to have a warm dinner by the fireplace just us girls [Music] it's that time of year when there's a little snap in the air and I'd love to make a really cozy dinner by the fire so I thought I'd make in Wien a roast loin of pork with roasted vegetables and maybe for dessert rum raisin rice pudding I actually use those big Spanish onions there's so much easier to slice and dice okay and next I think I'm going to do some potatoes I'd love to use these Yukon Gold potatoes you'll see the inside they're just this gorgeous yellow color and I just find them the flavor sort of buttery and really great but you can use red new potatoes or you can use white ones whatever you can find just like that so easy I've got a whole bunch right here and I've been cutting they go right on top of the onion some of them missed the pan I love this just because it's really one pot meal all the vegetables are in the bottom the earth loin of pork on the top they cook together it's not bad so the next thing I think I'm gonna do is carrots when carrots cook they really cook down they get smaller so just be sure you use really big chunks okay into the pan with the carrots I can really use any vegetables you like to roast but I think these are really delicious and colorful together and now for my favorite vegetable the fennel this is what fennel looks like when it's in the bulb sometimes it has big tops on it but you usually buy it like this and you can really find in the grocery store pretty frequently now I want to cut the top off like that these are really sort of tough so you don't want to eat them but interesting thing is when it's raw it has a very strong anise flavor which is good but I'm not that crazy about it but when it's cooked it's sweet and delicious and believe me it's wonderful and then just slice the whole thing in half you'll see there's a core here which is just fine to eat so I'm just gonna cut right through the core it will keep the fennel together when it roasts just cut it in big wedges just like that you can really do all of this chopping either early in the day or even the day before and just keep it wrapped in the refrigerator and then you can just roast the whole thing together the next day so sandal goes into the pan looks like a lot of vegetables so it's gonna cook down a little bit okay everything's in the pan together and now I'm just gonna season it a little bit of butter a little bit of olive oil lots of salt you'd be surprised how much you need for a big pot of vegetables like this lots of freshly ground black pepper ready and then clean hands just toss them all together you can really smell the liquors in the fennel so what I'm going to do is later I'm gonna roast it and then I'm gonna put a loin of pork on top to cook with it I'm really good but first I need some fresh thyme for my garden [Music] there are lots of different kinds of time like lemon time but I'm a traditionalist I like the old-fashioned English time I put it in Jeffrey's rose checking every Friday night but today I'm gonna use it with mustard and garlic for a loin of pork it's really really good got a really beautiful loin of pork from the butcher you know it used to be that pork was sort of dry it had to cook it forever and I think it had no flavor I didn't actually eat it when I was growing up so I've been experimenting with it and it turns out it's really flavorful and moist and I think it's changed dramatically over the past 10 years so I really recommend it when I asked the butcher to prepare this I asked him to leave a little bit of fat on the top so it keeps the meat really nice and moist so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna make a marinade that's gonna go on the top of the pork and it's all the flavors are gonna get into it it'll sit for a little while while I worse the vegetables it's gonna be really moist and delicious so two cloves of garlic just smash it and you take the peel off really easily just like that lose chop it up grab your phone okay man I need tablespoon of salt tablespoon of fresh thyme so this takes a little time but time takes time but it's really worth it so what you do is just run your fingers backwards along the stem and those little leaves really come off I made a better table in the fresh thyme okay into the food processor and I'm just going to mix it all up so much easier than all that chopping and the last thing I need is a quarter of a cup of mustard good Dijon mustard mix it all up and that's it for a marinade so I'm just gonna rub it on the outside of the pork my friend on a pump who owns loaves and fish isn't right - wonderful cookbooks does this a lot with pork and beef and things like that it's really like a rub that you put on top and let it just soak in so I learned that from her okay so I'm just gonna put this aside for about 30 minutes and let this gorgeous marinade get into the meat and in the meantime I'm gonna roast the vegetables so the vegetables rose at 425 which is pretty high temperature about 30 minutes and then I'm going to take the pork and put it on top and cook them all together it's gonna be really good I'm making a fireside dinner for my friend Audrina and me and when he's very special because she designed my garden and I thought what would be cozier on a chilly night than having rum raisin rice pudding for dessert so that's what I'm making so the first thing for rice pudding is you need rice and I've cooked about 3/4 of a cup of basmati rice I actually love to use basmati rice it's sort of got a nuttier flavor and it's like a whole grain rice so it's wonderful and rice pudding so that's cooked for about 8 or 9 minutes with a little bit of salt and now I'm gonna add 4 cups of half-and-half if you want to be good you can use milk but I want this to be delicious I'm gonna turn up the heat and then have a cup of sugar and just let that cook for about 25 minutes I'm gonna bring up the heat until it boils and then lower it and let it simmer for about 25 minutes until the rice is perfectly cooked and then I'm gonna add all these great flavors like rum raisin so I'm gonna take about 3/4 of a cup of raisins and 2 tablespoons of really good rum I love good dark room it's got such great flavor just pour it over I'm just gonna mix them up a little bit so the raisins soaked in all that rum these are just gonna sit here and get better and better wonderful so I'm just gonna turn this down to simmer and let it cook for 25 minutes can you tell I love to out yes and I thought since it weaned is coming for dinner I do something from the garden at the table so these white dahlias would be great you know the thing about flowers is it looks like a white Dahlia but if we really look in the center of it that lime green is such a great color on the table and when I'm doing an arrangement let's try and do it the wave grows so one of the buds in there is really nice gonna do something on the table some on the fireplace [Music] values are great because that is huge long stance and you can make an enormous arrangements out of them but for a small intimate table I just think it's nice that the proportion is really small and tight so I'm gonna cut the stems really short that's why do the centerpiece the flowers and the candles particularly the light from the candles is to focus your attention inward so if you have a nice small table for two people it just makes it much more intimate candle sort of represents the hearth or the fireplace that's the fireside dinner it's particularly appropriate [Music] I'd be nice and warm and cozy for dinner [Music] well I think the rice is ready looks just gorgeous creamy but I just want to make sure the rice grains are done this is not the place for al dente no that's great it's creamy and wonderful so I'm gonna add one more cup of half-and-half I know it sounds like a lotta half and a half but most rice pudding is actually made with milk and then you had heavy cream at the end so I thought why not just make it easier and make it all half and a half just stir that in so now I'm just gonna add an egg to thicken it mmm good and messy I'm just gonna add one egg and just stir it in slowly I'm just gonna give the rice pudding a really good texture okay and while that's cooking for a minute I'm gonna add one and a half teaspoons of vanilla I love the smell of that and the rum and raisins that I've really been soaking for about a half hour mmm they're so good and then just put it right in turn off the heat yikes stir it up mmm this looks so good I love when the rum hits the heat and you just get that whiff of rum it's sort of like rum raisin ice cream so I'm just gonna put it in a bowl and chill it and then it'll be ready for dessert and it's gonna be wonderful in front of the fire the loin of pork and saut√©ed cabbage I'm just gonna put a little bit of film right over the top so it doesn't form a skin and I think that's gonna be really nice dessert on a chilly winter night in front of the fireplace so that vegetables are about half done I'm gonna put the pork right on top they smell so good all the fennel and carrots and potatoes it's really starting to get brown you oh this smells so good Wow who even gets that pork with it yeah I'm gonna take this whole loin of pork I'll just put it right on top just like that and they're all gonna cook together so it's gonna cook at the same temperature 425 for about 30 minutes if the one of pork is this size sometimes they're much bigger something might take about 50 minutes but for this one it's 30 minutes at 425 until the loin of pork is exactly 138 degrees in the middle and it will be perfect now I can't wait for it winter to come for dinner hey Charlie just a moment I'm going over to Ines house for dinner tonight and we're gonna get her a plant [Music] oh these echinacea czar tempting but it's an orange and purple garden must stick to the color scheme this is great perfect padeen blooms in the fall just the right color I'll take this [Music] come on Charlie now it's time for you to go home get changed just a few things left to do for dinner that's so good so the loin of pork is cooked and the vegetables look fabulous so this is a secret to really good meat take it out of the oven and let it rest for about 20 minutes and it'll get really moist and juicy and delicious it just reabsorbs all those juices you surprised what a big difference it makes and then these vegetables the fennel and the carrots and onions and potatoes that all absorb all the juices not just from the pork but also from each other and back in the oven for another 20 minutes so they get even ground or they stay nice and hot for the pork Edwina what fabulous thing of your breath besides yourself lespedeza I like the name of it half-bad I can't wait to show you the garden it looks incredible and you taught me about things like our geranium such a silly little flower just grouped in a huge mass it's one it's just great yeah if we put it behind the fence it will come through oh and support it yeah it's just wonderful good and weena brings the best gifts I can't wait to see what this is oh they're garden gloves and they're off the lane that's wonderful but the idea that you don't lose you can see them from my mile away right but they look wonderful with my and are you in charge of planting plants I like that so with the one of porking roasted vegetables that it'll be really nice to have saut√©ed cabbage I know it's a really odd vegetable but it's really good I think we're used to having cabbage like it's coleslaw or boiled cabbage or just forget I don't like it all but when you saute it with a little butter and salt and pepper it's so good it gets really sweet and tender and you'd really be surprised and I happen to know why do we know was it so I'm gonna cut up this cabbage I'm gonna keep your hands out of the way find the smallest cabbage you possibly can and don't throw away the green leaves I love the way they look when you saute them and just shred it the way to shred coleslaw just long thin shreds just like that was design I know this looks like a lot of cabbage but it's kind of like spinach it cooks down to very little okay I'm going to show you what to do with the green leaves it's so much easier to do it this way roll them up like that and then this is called chiffonade or Juliette okay so ready to cook [Music] okay lots of salt and pepper so that's great that's gonna cook for about 15 minutes well I slice the lunar pork and get the vegetables out [Music] so good so I'll have to just get the cabbage ready and dinner sir [Music] so I put salt in the recipe I just think it makes such a difference to have a little bit of salt on the top and a great finishing salt is sea salt I actually have French fleur de sel but doesn't have to be that fancy just on the top you'd be surprised what a difference it makes and dinner's ready and I think it Wayne is on the way in from the garden hello hi Edwina hi isn't the light gorgeous in the garden when the Sun Goes Down oh it's just fabulous I got the plant in the ground oh great are you ready for dinner oh yeah I have loin of pork with roast vegetables and saut√©ed cabbage because I know you love it so will you take the flowers
