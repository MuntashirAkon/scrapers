you something that around here is usually Chinese takeout I'm gonna surprise my husband Jeffrey with a romantic dinner and I'm making his favorite meal breakfast just because I'm making breakfast for dinner with french toast and hash browns doesn't mean I have to have coffee and orange juice I would say nice little champagne cocktail be much more romantic everybody knows what a kir Royale is it's champagne with cassis I just thought it'd be really fun today to make a raspberry Royale which is champagne with a little friend Waze and maybe a raspberry so I'm gonna get the ingredients so this is vanilla sugar it's a vanilla bean that I've immersed in this jar of sugar and I just leave it there for years what I'm gonna do is dip the glasses and I let them dry and then later I'll put the champagne in the glasses so a little bit of friend Waze in one dish friend Waze is a raspberry liqueur and then the other dish a little bit of life and no live sugar this is great for baking or for flavoring tea or anything it's so good I'm gonna take that rim of the glass and just dip it right in the rim bloss and then directly into the vanilla sugar and you'll see it makes this gorgeous sort of a raspberry colored rim I'm gonna let that dry and then I'm gonna fill it with fresh raspberries a little bit of friend vos and champagne how fabulous is that so romantic I love it this is a challah it's um it's an egg bread that's been braided it's sort of a traditional Jewish bread but you can use any kind of egg bread or brioche bread that comes with a loaf I'm just gonna leave this to dry out a little bit so when I mix it with a custard will just absorb all that flavor so the custard six eggs and I always try and crack the eggs on the board rather than on the side of the dish so you don't get shells in them I like to use extra-large eggs but you can really use large eggs anything that you have around extra-large eggs I find our better value there's more egg pradhana or how's that for an esoteric fact okay and the next thing is milk or half and half if you really want to be over-the-top it's a cup and a half of whole milk or half and ham I'm gonna keep my husband around for a long time so I'll use milk I'm just gonna whisk it in when I was thinking about this recipe I wanted to make traditional french toast but I really wanted to pump up the flavor so challah does that which is great but also I wanted the custard to have more flavor so what I'm gonna do is I'll show you I'm gonna add orange which is a really traditional breakfast kind of thing my handy-dandy microplane which I love someone add a little bit of orange maybe about a teaspoon really make this to your own taste if you like more orange or less orange play with it until you get it exactly right and the next thing is vanilla so but 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla and honey honey I'll sweeten it but I think it sweetens it with more flavor than sugar white sugar really doesn't do anything for me and mmm doesn't that look good and the last thing is a pinch of salt it's amazing how much salt makes a difference in a recipe like this so now the custard has lots of flavor when I'm going to soak the bread it'll just absorb all that good flavor I'm I got isolated oh oh look at these these roses are incredible they smell incredible Oh fabulous so I need something not orange roses not hard how many years has it been I've been buying our dresses for way too long what's what's really nice I'm doing a romantic dinner for Jennifer dinner what would be fabulous well kukku high sense of you okay yeah that roses are beautiful card rose garden roses I don't know orange tulips I'll take have it all of this I want to Lipsett of Oz but also petals on the table that'll be pl okay before hi Reuben I'm good yeah oh these are gonna be beautiful think you ever think of manta oh they're fantastic thanks so much thank you mmm ah I'll season see you soon and that for one of my all-time favorite recipes shortbread hearts and what's more appropriate for a romantic dinner so first thing is butter lots of it and you want the butter to be absolutely room-temperature you can leave it at butter really doesn't spoil so you can leave it out overnight you can leave it out for a few hours but just make sure it's room temperature all the way through got three sticks of butter I love this recipe it's so easy to make and the incredible thing about it is you can make so many different things out of it you'll put this on very low speed and then I need a cup of sugar so I'm just gonna mix the sugar and butter until it's just combined I don't want to whip it because I don't want a lot of air in it so the butter and sugar is combined and now I'm just gonna add a teaspoon of vanilla okay time for the flour so I need three and a half cups of flour this is all-purpose flour and what I do is I just lighten it when I'm scooping it just lighten it a little bit and then scoop it without packing it down and level it off you can level it off with a knife I just use my finger and put it into a sieve over a bowl that's three and a half cups of flour and I'm gonna add a big pinch of salt and then just sift it all together I just want to make sure it's all smooth and all we have to do is put that in at low speed into the mixer just do it slowly so it gets combined it's a really critical stage in baking flour has gluten in it which is what you use to develop bread dough and you don't want to develop the gluten because you don't want it to get tough so it's all crumbly now I'm gonna dump it onto the board this should make about twenty four big shortbread parts I like to refrigerate it for about 15 minutes until it just firms up a little bit it's much easier to cut wrap it up is it the fruit so the shortbread should be perfectly chilling about 15 minutes what good is it if you're not wearing all the flour right got a rolling pin and my heart cookie cutter it's a little crooked but mean that just means it's been used a lot so don't worry about having too much flour on the shortbread because it really helps I want it when I'm rolling it out I want to be sure it's always moving and you roll it from the center out and then you make sure they end up with something that's evenly rolled out you can see it moves really nicely just keep moving the whole thing around so you're sure when you cut it out you're not going to end up with cookies stuck on the board I always do a little parchment paper on the cookie sheet so I know they're not gonna stick I just take them out obviously you can do this any shape but for tonight it's gonna be hard shape I'm just gonna sprinkle sugar on the cookies and I'm gonna bake now into the oven 350 for about 20 minutes or until they're just starting to brown on the top and they'll be wonderful strawberries so I've got some turkey sausages that I cooked they cook in about 20 minutes turkey sausages are so great I get them from the butcher and they're really much lighter than pork sausages and I think I'll keep them warm in the oven okay now on to the hashbrowns I was actually testing recipes when Jeffrey was working in the study one day and I kept bringing in all kinds of variations on hash browns and he said this was his favorite I'm just gonna put five tablespoons of butter in the pan and about one and a half cups of onions it's so maybe about two big onions these are really traditional hash browns but they have so much more flavor let that butter melt a little I've got about a pound and a half of potatoes that I've cut up in advance here and I soaked them just to make sure that they didn't turn brown drain them out so for this recipe I like to use boiling potatoes which are those sort of waxy rounder potatoes now this is the key it's really important to salt and pepper this dish while you're cooking with it so that the flavor really gets into the potatoes and the onions so I've got about it two teaspoons of salt I use kosher salt and one teaspoon of freshly ground black pepper I'm gonna let this sit for a few minutes until it gets really Brown and crusty on the bottom and then I'm gonna toss it so all the potatoes get perfectly browned all over uh it's gonna be so good he's gonna love it these are perfect egg brown and crusty so I'm gonna leave them over here to cook a little more and then just before serving we're gonna try some scallions and parsley it's gonna release all that wonderful herb flavor to be fabulous great so my challah french toast I'm gonna soak the challah in the custard just a couple of minutes on both sides just sort of hold it down so it gets nicely soaked if you can soak it for five minutes it's great if you don't have the time and you're too hungry it's okay but the longer you soak it and actually the drier the bread is the better I actually so one recipe where you had to let it sit for half an hour now just imagine that everybody's sitting waiting for breakfast and you have to stand there for half an hour and let it soak forget it so while that's okay I mean we get the butter so let me have a better tablespoon of butter when I'm sauteing things I want to mix butter and oil because I'll get the flavor of the butter with the high burning temperature of the oil so but a tablespoon of oil should do it that's perfect get it nice and hot shit so it's good and hot but not burning all right and they go I'm gonna cook these for about three minutes on each side until they're nice and browned and while that's happening I'm gonna soak the next slices of bread which is about the same amount of time three minutes it works out perfectly just like that this is gonna be so good with hashbrowns turkey sausage and then a treat for this earth I think my husband's gonna be thrilled so I'm gonna serve the French toast with a drizzle of really good maple syrup and maybe a dusting of confectioner's sugar it would be good so these look like they're perfectly done and put them on a sheet pan put them in the oven and now for the next one's in another tablespoon of butter maybe a little less this time I hate when everything has to come at exactly the same time and you're juggling all these pans but everything's gonna stay warm in the oven until it's all done and then dinner can be served at once I'm just gonna go get change for breakfast so Jeffrey thinks it's a day just like any other day boys he wrong I'm pulling out all the romantic stops so I'm gonna do chocolate dipped strawberries which I think are so lovely first the chocolate what I'm going to do is make ganache ganache is a combination of melted chocolate and heavy cream half a cup of chocolate chips three tablespoons of heavy cream the key is that this the chocolate melt but it not get too hot because otherwise it'll start to separate so I'm just gonna whisk this together and then I'm just gonna leave it to melt while I get the strawberries right these are the most gorgeous long stem strawberries and they're just they smell they have a strawberry essence that's just wonderful I'm just gonna snip that off a little bit on the diagonal it looks really pretty so I'm gonna set them out so they're ready so let's see how the chocolates doing oh it's nicely melted I want to make sure it's totally not that they're no little piece of chocolate in it I want to make sure that's a really low flame so it's not keep it on but very low so the chocolate doesn't burn there's nothing where's the taste of burnt chocolate they're not very romantic it's smooth it's glossy it's the perfect see the nice really nice consistency perfect for the strawberries now comes the good part I love to leave half of the strawberry showing so I'm just going to dip the bottom half in it how gorgeous is that mmm so sensual isn't it now you can really do this in dark chocolate bittersweet chocolate semi-sweet chocolate but also it's fun to do sometimes in white chocolate do the same thing and melt the white chocolate a little bit of heavy cream so you make a white chocolate ganache or sometimes if you want to be really over-the-top you can do dark chocolate and then drizzle the top with white chocolate melted white chocolate mmm how much this is a hmm it's so good it's strawberry sort of tart it's sweet but art and the chocolates like the perfect balance for that he's gonna love these all right I'm gonna put this all together now it's gonna be so gorgeous on the table in front of the fireplace I'm right smack in the middle remember these are the vanilla shortbread hearts with a dusting of sugar on the top so they sparkle now who wouldn't fall in love with you if you serve them this so I've got all these gorgeous potatoes ready though that have grounds and they just cooked in butter with onions and salt and pepper it's just so simple but I think it needs a little something to sort of just turn up the volume so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to add I've chopped parsley and scallions and I think that'll just do the trick it's gonna really give it that little hiccup I'm gonna turn off the heat toss them together maybe finish it with a just a touch of extra salt oh these look so good I've to taste to make sure they're all right I'm gonna I'm gonna serve it with his wonderful slices of kala french toast and turkey sausage I'm so good potatoes are crisp but they're tender and the scallions when the heat hits the scallions it really brings out the flavor so all that's left to do is pour out the champagne Geoffrey thinks to did just like any other day I'm sure he expects dinner in the kitchen but I'm setting it up in the living room in front of the roaring fire so clean up a little and never have too many flowers so I've got parrot tulips I think in a small intimate dinner it's really nice to have a small arrangement of flowers and these are orange parrot tulips one of the keys to keeping tulips straight is a little pin and it just stick it in the end of each tulip and then it drinks the water better I want them to straight cuz I like when tulips aren't avars the way they grow sort of a little wild and messy I think this if you're really sexy sitting may be the last I'm gonna scatter the petals on the table it's so beautiful I'd say he's gonna be surprised so the last thing is the raspberry Royale our champagne cocktail I've got my champagne glasses that were dipped in friend woz and vanilla sugar and this is so cool actually it's gotten very hard which is wonderful and it's pink which I love these are huge raspberries which are great maybe two raspberries in each one and a little bit of friend woz raspberry liqueur maybe about two tablespoons in each one else gonna be so good and of course champagne I wonder if I'll hear the pop hmm oh this is gonna be so good this is so simple and so luxurious that looks great hello fabulous what's in years it's friend woz and fresh raspberries well it was a great good champagne always makes a different milk yeah just when you were expected Chinese takeout right you got that's right this is not the usual raspberry Roy Chinese teeth this is habit-forming this is their habit of Harmony oh now you're gonna want it every Sunday night okay my gorgeous fellow french toast and the turkey sausages there's gorgeous hashbrowns I can smell it perhaps a bit of powdered sugar on the french toast how gorgeous is that I'm a drizzle a really good maple syrup like it doesn't feel like breakfast does oh no it feels like something really an okay it's like oh no a foreign country having something that you never thought of having before and then saying you got to make this all okay I will and deserve that's really good I'm so glad you like another but yeah listen until you get it exactly right and the next thing is vanilla so but half teaspoon of vanilla and honey honey I'll sweeten it but I think it sweetens it with more flavor than sugar white sugar really doesn't do anything for me and it doesn't that look good and the last thing is a pinch of salt it's amazing how much salt makes a difference in a recipe like this so now the custard has lots of flavor when I'm gonna soak the bread it'll just absorb all that good flavor hi my god I sweetie something that around here is usually Chinese takeout I'm going to surprise my husband Jeffrey with a romantic dinner and I'm making his favorite meal breakfast just because I'm making breakfast for dinner with french toast and hash browns doesn't mean I have to have coffee and orange juice I was saying that's little champagne cocktail be much more romantic everybody knows what a cure ray and the next thing is milk or half and half if you really want to be over the top it's a cup and a half of whole milk or
