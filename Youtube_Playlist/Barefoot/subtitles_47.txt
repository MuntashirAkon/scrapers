[Music] this is a challah it's um it's an egg bread that's been braided it's sort of a traditional Jewish bread but you can use any kind of egg bread or brioche bread that comes in a loaf I'm just going to leave this to dry out a little bit so when I mix it with a customer's it will just absorb all that flavor so the custard six eggs and I always try and crack the eggs on the board rather than on the side of the dish so you don't get shells in them I like to use extra-large eggs but you can really use large eggs anything that you have around extra-large eggs I find our better value there's more egg for Donnell or how's that for an esoteric fact okay and the next thing it is milk or half and half if you really want to be over the top it's a cup and a half of whole milk or half and half I want to keep my husband around for a long time so I'll he is milk I was going to whisk it in when I was thinking about the dress today I wanted to make traditional french toast but I won't really wanted to pump up those flavor so challah does that which is great but also I wanted the custard to have more flavor so what I'm going to do is I'll show you I'm going to add orange which is a really traditional breakfast kind of thing my handy dandy microplane which I love someone add a little bit of orange maybe about a teaspoon can we make this to your own taste if you like more orange or less orange play with it until you get it exactly right and the next thing Pinilla so about 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla and honey honey Leaton it but I think it's sweetened it with more flavor than sugar just white sugar really doesn't do anything for me and doesn't that look good and the last thing is a pinch of salt it's amazing how much salt makes the difference in a recipe like this so now the cut has lots of flavor when I'm going to soak the bread it'll just absorb all that good flavor I'm going to soak the kyla in the custard just a couple of minutes on both sides just to hold it down so it gets nicely soaked if you can soak it for five minutes it's great if you don't have the time and you're too hungry it's okay but the longer you soak it and actually the drier the bread is the better actually so one recipe where you had to let it sit for half an hour now just imagine that everybody sitting waiting for breakfast and you have to stand there for half an hour and let it soak forget it so while that's okay let me get the butter so let me have a better tablespoon of butter when I'm sauteing things I want to mix butter and oil because I'll get the flavor of the butter at the high burning temperature of the oil so by the tablespoon of oil should do it that's perfect get it nice and hot shit so it's good and hot but not burning all right and they go I'm going to cook these for about three minutes on each side until they're nice and browned and while that's happening I'm going to soak the next slices of bread which is about the same amount of time three minutes it works out perfectly just like that this would be so good with hashbrowns turkey sausage and then a treat for the serve I think my husband's going to be thrilled so I'm going to serve the French toast with a drizzle of really good maple syrup and maybe a dusting of confectioner's sugar it would be good so these look like they're perfectly done I put them on a sheet pan put them in the oven
