for dessert pecan squares dipped in warm chocolate so the first thing I do is one in a quarter of tons of butter 3/4 of a cup of sugar it's really just like making shortbread I'm just going to cream that for about 3 minutes until it's light and fluffy as I turn it on low just enough to mix it we really want to start with room-temperature butter otherwise it really won't scream well okay the next thing is three eggs and now resource a teaspoon of vanilla and then while that's mixing I want to combine the flour baking powder and salt so I need four and a half cups of flour 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder and a quarter teaspoon of salt and just missed it all together put the flour mixture into the butter mixture he's a great for a party or for a picnic because you can make them in advance and they transport really well I'm going to dip them in chocolate to make them even better okay that's the crunch the sheep in and patted out with my hem hundred and fifty degrees for 15 minutes and the crust it's set but not brown so the shortbread base is cooled and set and the next thing I have to do for my pecan bars is the filling needs just a little more butter one pound I'm going to turn it on if I want to melt it next thing is brown sugar brown sugar is granulated sugar and molasses mixed together and one pound is two and a quarter cup I need three cups all together and then that's recorded attached and the last thing is one cup of honey this is really just a filling for the pecans to hold them all together perfect so we're going to do is just stir it all together and melt it and then we're going to turn the heat up high and boil it for about three minutes so it really caramelizes it okay while that's heating I'm going to add two vents so that a teaspoon of lemon zest put that right in the teaspoon of our incense okay when I come to boil to boil it for about three minutes and it'll get really syrupy and sick we do a quarter cup of heavy cream [Music] and 2 pounds of pecans these delicious shortbread crust support this whole thing right on top one thing I learned is sometimes there's bubbles over a little in the oven so I put a piece of aluminum foil on the bottom of the oven floor it's certainly easier to throw away the aluminum foil and it is to clean the oven and just spread it all out come on solution okay all done so into the oven 350 degrees for about 20 to 30 minutes until they've set and when they're cool in a dip them in chocolate those are good dip it right in just the edge you know what the whole time how's that
