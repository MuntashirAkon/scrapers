[Music] Geoffrey's coming home tonight really late from a long trip so I'm not gonna be able to make as usual friday-night roast chicken so instead I'm gonna make him some really good hot chocolate before it goes to bed tonight and tomorrow I'm gonna surprise him with a fabulous breakfast I'm making buttery brioche warm from the oven with homemade strawberry jam fresh fruit crunch with yogurt and granola topping and fresh peach Bellinis I always say I don't want to cook for him I'm sure somebody else would be very happy to do it for me I'm not taking any chances I know this sounds like a daunting thing to make but I'm gonna make strawberry jam and you won't believe how easy it is so what I have in the pot here is I've heated it very very slowly is one and a half cups of sugar the juice of a lemon and the zest of a lemon I'd love to use the zest it has lots of flavor and I've heated it really slowly so it doesn't burn and the lemon juice is great because not only to flavor it but has pectin it so it's gonna have a gel okay now we're gonna add the good stuff the strawberries you want to pick strawberries that smell really good and these are really ripe strawberries okay so I'm just take the hull out cut these guys in half it's a wonderful thing to do in strawberry season when the strawberries are particularly lovely but in the United States California strawberries are really good all the time this is gonna make probably about two pints we're just gonna be great we'll have one for breakfast minutes and Jeffrey back with some and put all the strawberries into the sugar carefully it's ha ha and just give it a stir and just bring the heat up just a smidge and in about 15 or 20 minutes strawberry jam so while that's cooking I'm gonna start the brioche who wouldn't like that for breakfast strawberry jam homemade strawberry jam and brioche so brioche bread it's really like a tasty bread I want to start with a half a cup of very warm water it has to be about 110 120 degrees when it's in the ball so you want to start out with water that's hotter than that cuz the ball is always cold one package of yeast of dry yeast it's about 2 teaspoons and 3 tablespoons of sugar just to have the yeast grow so yeast meets food and warmth to activate it so the heat of the water is the warmth and the sugar as the food okay swish around with your hands as you can feel it's not dissolved next I need six eggs as I said this is an egg bread just a great richness I'm gonna put this in and then mix them for about a minute on medium speed okay when the lower the speed to low we've put in two cups of flour just put it in slowly so doesn't get lumpy trying to get it all in and split up on the counter and two and a half teaspoons of salt I actually put the flour in first an assault second because the salt retards the growth of the yeast and it sort of buffers it okay I'm just gonna scrape down the sides make sure it's well mixed it's a very soft mixture right now and leave it on medium speed for about five minutes meanwhile I'm gonna test the jam plate in the freezer just a little bit of the jam just put it right on the plate let it sit there for a minute roll it around and as it chills you can see it this is gonna be perfect it's jelly okay into the jars be careful that Sam's really have what it looks particularly at this Jam you can still see a whole story [Music] yours is looking good okay now I've put a two and a quarter cups of flour it's a little bit of a process but it's really not hard I can just turn on low our [Music] just turn up to medium for about five minutes just enough time for me to make a label for my champ like a gym would be ever so slightly more special if I did a label with Geoffrey's name on [Music] and then I think I'll make a little hot chocolate - good for Jeffrey let's comment so Geoffrey's coming home soon and the brioche that I'm making him is pretty good now and I'm gonna put it in the refrigerator to rise overnight and then I'll bake it off tomorrow morning so be hot the brioche in the morning boy is he gonna be pleased I'm just gonna make a ball this ball has been buttered so when I take the brioche out it won't stick to it like everything else okay I'm gonna cover it with plastic wrap and into the fridge overnight and then tomorrow I'm gonna put it into little cups and make an individual brioche so Jeffrey's on his way home he should be home any minute and since I'm sure he's had some horrible dinner on the road I thought I'd make him something I can feel good hot chocolate two and a half cups of milk two cups of half-and-half this is a rich hot chocolate I mean the truth is you can probably buy a powder and make it really easily but nothing tastes as good as the real thing this makes a lot of hot chocolate about five cups and turn the heat on and just heat that up until it's simmering and I'm gonna add all the chocolate so I have two types of chocolate four ounces of milk chocolate and also four ounces of semi-sweet chocolate chocolate chips are finally if you have good chocolate it's even better tablespoon of sugar teaspoon of vanilla extract and because it always gives chocolate a real depth of flavor a teaspoon of instant coffee powder because it's night time I'm using decaf and then I'm just gonna stir it all in just until the chocolate melts doing this off the heat cuz I don't want that milk to get too hot I think I need a whisk just get all the chocolate listed well it smells great now if it's not the vanilla and the coffee and milk chocolate OH Jeffers here I always have something special with me beside me yeah what do you got all right so you need a little hot chocolate wouldn't she say no that looks good huh that looks delicious like you're getting friends your favorite but I think I'm gonna whip it for how's this stand back I'm dangerous and they sit up front they want that it's an immersion blender been amazing I've never seen everything and it just makes it wonderful ready for a hot shot sure [Music] oh that's fantastic since I'm not making you dinner tonight was a sneak preview of breakfast tomorrow I can't wait it's early gotta make the brioche okay I've had a little coffee I'm ready to do it so I've got the brioche dough I took it out about a half an hour ago when I made my coffee can you believe how much that rose it's amazing so first thing is I'm gonna put a dough hook on the mixer this is what's called a dough hook and it's used for making breads I'm gonna put the dough right back in it's still really sticky get back in there okay got the dough in there now of course I'm gonna add butter it's part of the process of making brioche tablespoon at a time it's really important for it to be room temperature otherwise it'll never mix in so one and a half sticks it's 12 tablespoons let's get a little bit of flour so it comes back into a ball okay now I'm going to form it into a little brioche okay just dump it out on the board what I'm gonna do is my 20 little brioche so I'm just gonna Pat it out in a square this is a great little tool it's called a bench scraper it's a sort of professional tool you can either use this or a knife it's just fine so I'm going to cut it in quarters you cut each one of these sort of vaguely in fifths as much as possible just form a little ball you put it into the tin it's not so easy to eyeball these if you have a little scale it's great then one in 3/4 ounces each so soon as I'm done with this I'm gonna cover them with a cloth and let them rise until they're double in size and then I'm gonna bake them until they're golden brown and delicious and it gives me just enough time to go to the store to get the ingredients for my breakfast [Music] so Jeffrey thinks the morning just like any other morning a cup of coffee a few pieces of toast I'm gonna make him a really special breakfast I think you'll be surprised just need a few things at the grocery store [Music] that's my breakfast fruit crunch I need pineapple I love golden pineapples they're really sweeter than regular ones there are all kinds of tests for how to tell whether pineapple is right people pull the leaves out there's really only one test that works for me smell it it smells like a pineapple that's right I need some fresh strawberries and you can smell them to fit right don't stick your nose in it though and blueberries that's what they tell you what does these are ripe it's a taste one but I don't think they'd be very happy with me if I did so I think I'll trust they're good I was thinking of making blood orange mimosas so these peaches smells so wonderful I think I'll make blinis instead it's a peach puree with Italian sparkling wine called Prosecco it's really good and the way you tell whether peaches are ripe is don't press it'll only make a mark all you want to do is smell it and if it smells like a great peach it is and these are [Music] I better hurry up otherwise it's gonna be lunch not breakfast [Music] so I'm gonna make some dry old toasts maybe some leftover coffee for breakfast I got you the newspaper little live fire he's a fuckin the fire department around your breakfast okay that sounds good first I'm gonna make it vanilla so I can take a cup of oatmeal half a cup of coconut half a cup of almonds any kind of sliced blanched almonds there's nothing better than a really nice cold wine I'm just going to do three tablespoons of oil and take every spoons of honey it's good to put the oil and first cuz that honey instead of the tablespoon easy [Music] okay onto a baking sheet [Music] spread out with your hands in one layer into the oven 350 degrees until it's nice and golden brown and potential here we go a ritual as old as man himself that one has some fresh fruit mmm exactly what pineapple should smell like next two strawberries five strawberries should do it and I'll just do barest [Music] and I can smell the corn all I think mmm it's browned and golden and gorgeous and I can smell the coconut and almonds that's gonna be really delicious [Music] the moment of brioche truth they're great I'm always surprised so the only thing I want to do is do a little bit of an egg wash for the top so they get nice and golden brown on the top I have about a tablespoon of water in the dish and one egg it's gonna whisk them together I can actually already smell the yeast in them you don't want to dribble down otherwise it would be hard for them to come out of those little pans just a quick brush on the top these guys are gonna bake at 350 for about 20 minutes and they're gonna make the whole house smell wonderful okay this one [Music] time to assemble the breakfast fruit crunch I torture it's gonna be like an ice cream sundae so first I'm gonna put on the bottom with fresh fruit so plain yogurt you can use flavored yogurt but I think plain yogurt is better for this cuz the fruits so sweet and then sprinkling of granola more fruit you look like an ice cream sundae isn't thinking these a little sprinkling it for no at the top little crunch yes I flute look pretty good breakfast is almost ready all I have to do is make the peach Bellini so Jeffrey still on the study I'm sure he suspects nothing I've been banging pots together all morning well we'll see so the next thing I'm gonna make is a fresh peach Bellini Jeffrey took me to Venice wants and they're very famous for their Bellinis it's fresh peach juice mixed with Prosecco which is like champagne I'll show you how easy it is to make so I've got two peaches in here this ends everything I just took the seeds out and I'm just gonna puree it the riper the peaches are the better I'm gonna add a tablespoon of lemon juice 1 tablespoon of sugar and then just puree it again make sure this fall gets pureed boy that looks great I love the color of it so I'm gonna give it and that'll take any of the bits of the skin out I actually pureed it with the skin on both for the color and also the flavor but it's also easy hate peeling peaches I'm just gonna push it through the sieve and then the juice that comes out of this I'm gonna put it in a glass whoa what guys [Music] why [Music] toast and coffee for breakfast I don't think so breakfast is delicious hey this is a Bellini to start with peach juice and champagne Wow the blinis are from Venice my breakfast fruit crunch I saw in Belgium and from France I made fresh brioche and for America your own strawberry jam Oh Geoffrey strawberry I like having ice cream sundae for breakfast well I'll tell you what this is the best ice cream sundae I got entertainment I'm good for you unusual that is you made the jam jam yeah you make the place yeah cheers for international breakfast [Music]
