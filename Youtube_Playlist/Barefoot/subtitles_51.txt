[Music] remember new kid and a family moved into the neighborhood the first thing you would do is run down the street to see if any kids your age and then your mother would bring a cake now they probably needed more help moving furniture than they needed cake but it was a really nice gesture my friend Valerie Smith is move next door and I thought instead of bringing her cake I'm gonna bring her entire party for six friends I'm making french cheese puffs which she can just heat up in her new oven then tender juicy loin of pork with a spicy green peppercorn sauce buttery small whole potatoes tossed with lots of fresh green herbs asparagus roasted with olive oil and coarse salt and for dessert an upside-down apple cake cotta with delicious cake and caramelized apples it'll be great way to welcome Valerie to the food so I thought for my friend Valerie's housewarming party would be really nice assembly very elegant but very simple to serve so what I'm gonna make is a roast loin of pork with green peppercorn sauce it's a beautiful pork loin I've left it out of the refrigerator for about 30 minutes I mean actually cooks better if it's not really cold through the refrigerator right into the roasting pan [Applause] so first thing is two tablespoons of good olive oil I use two kinds of mustard I use coarse grain mustard both for the flavor but also I love that it looks like mustard two teaspoons against my the mustard already and two teaspoons of Dijon mustard which has the spice two teaspoons of salt I use kosher salt half a teaspoon of black pepper and the last ingredient is fennel seeds you can buy them whole like this it's got an anise flavor and I think it's gonna be really good with a pork but what I'm gonna do is grind them first I'll show you how I can do it really fast I use a coffee grinder it's a really easy way to grind spices pepper anything like that it's gonna make a lot of noise I need 1 teaspoon of ground fennel seed you can really smell it when it's freshly ground wonderful okay into the oven so I'm gonna roast it for about an hour and 15 minutes at 400 degrees until the internal temperature is exactly 140 degrees I've got to be really fun to make cheese pasta Valerie's party they look a little complicated but they're really once you get the hang of it they're not that hard to make so let me show you how to make the pastry it's called patashu or choux paste first I have a cup of milk and a quarter of a pound of butter that is everything on the quarter pound of butter in it a teaspoon of salt about an eighth of a teaspoon of pepper just a little pinch of nutmeg we're just gonna heat that up and then I'm gonna have flour too but first I want to show you about Parmesan cheese so this is really good Parmesan cheese it's Reggiano parmesan and it has a rind on it you always want to cut the rind off and there are lots of ways to grade it but I think the best way to grade it is by cutting it up in little pieces keep your fingers away cuz it's really hard it's easy for a knife to slip and just put it in the food processor with a steel blade just like that instead of grading it you're really grinding it but it's really good and fast that's no sweat grated Parmesan and I actually always store it in the container in the refrigerator it lasts for a really long time or if you're not gonna use it quickly you can always put it in the freezer okay so the next thing is a cup of flour and this is the key you want to dump it in all at once and this can make a total mess and you're gonna get really nervous about it because I did when I first did this but once you've done it once or twice you sort of get the hang of what it's supposed to look like and then eventually actually pretty quickly it all pulls together into one paste okay off the heat and into the food processor while it's hot you just want to dump in for extra-large eggs just like that a quarter of a cup of grated Parmesan and we know it's freshly grated Parmesan half a cup of grated Gruyere cheese the two cheese's really have very different flavors so the two of them together good Parmesan is a little punchier greer has a rounder flavor so they bickered together just process it until become smooth and that's it so I'm gonna take baking sheets with parchment paper but this way to fill pastry bag is to roll the top down just like that there's a plain round tip in the bottom its movie about a half an inch I'm just gonna feel this bad Pat touch you see how nice and thick it is that looks gorgeous okay so now I just want to make pull this up so it's neat and I just wanna make little mounds Missal depending on how big you make them this will make about a 35 or 40 little puffs dip your finger a little bit of water and just press down that little tip you don't want it to burn when it bakes okay little egg wash which is egg mixed with a little bit of water or milk just lightly egg wash makes it browner just a little bit of gray air right on the top I'm gonna bake these at 425 for about 15 minutes and they're gonna be puffed and golden and just delicious or Valerie's party [Music] and then I'm gonna start working on the apple cake town [Music] so for dessert I'm gonna make an apple cake to town which is very simple version of a French Apple take town so first I'm gonna make caramel which is cup of sugar 1/3 of a cup of water and I'm just going to cook it you can do thermometer to make sure I don't overcook it until it sort of brown and caramelized about 360 degrees that I can do the monitor excellent okay next we need the apples so just cut the apples cut out the core and cut them in wedges and I think for this probably three wedges so you'll have 1208 wedges per Apple okay just take the apples and put them in a greased pan a glass nine inch pie pan is perfect you can find one in a hardware store and just run the apples around the outside and then when you turn it over all those caramelized apples are going to show it's going to be great [Music] three right there want to get them in tight okay now for the gorgeous syrup and it looks like it's perfect it's really just turned beautiful golden brown smell it smells great I'm just gonna pour it right over the apples [Music] that look great now I'm gonna make a sour cream cake still on top and bake the whole thing together so good so it's a really simple cake 6 tablespoons of butter 3/4 of a cup of sugar just cream that together two eggs it's really important to have room-temperature eggs okay next ingredients are a third of a cup of sour cream okay half a teaspoon of lemon zest half a teaspoon of good vanilla extract and mix it all up it's a mouth for the dry ingredients I need a cup plus 2 tablespoons of all-purpose flour you need a half a teaspoon of baking powder quarter of teaspoon of salt let's go sift these all together and that way if there's a little piece of flour or something in the bottom you can either sieve it or just take it out so make sure that you really have smooth dry ingredients so with the mixer on low whose been slowly add the dry ingredients okay now just take the batter and just spread it out over the apples and the caramel and it's gonna be puffed and golden and just gorgeous when you turn it out upside down with the apples on top okay just spread it out what a knife would be helpful spread that smoothly on top of the caramel the apples and then I'm gonna bake it at 350 degrees for about 30 to 40 minutes until the cake is done and a cake tester comes out clean right into the oven [Music] I'm so happy I made you cheese puffs tonight we're making dinner too but the cheese pasta to start so why don't you heat them up like 350 degrees out five minutes perfect and then you guess I'll have wonderful food secret drinks can our be over later with dinner thank you I'll wait to see you tonight okay next thing is herb new potatoes watch how easy this is literally cook themselves so put some butter in a pan just gonna melt that and I use Yukon Gold potatoes they're just scrubbed don't peel them just make sure they're nice and clean put them right in lots of salt and pepper so when the butter melts and I put the lid on the top the steam from the butter and the potatoes are gonna cook the potatoes all by themselves and then later on the professor rubs on it put the lid on for about 30 minutes in the steam will I turn out the Apple cake you mmm this is the apple cake tech town that I made for dinner at Valerie's house it's gonna be really great with a loin of pork so this is the hard part is turning it out it's caramelized apples on the bottom a nice light cake on the top so wish me luck oh look how great that walk so you just have to loosen it a little bit and I think I did it Wow that's really great okay and a little bit of powdered sugar on the top and I think that's perfect for housewarming at Valerie's house certainly is a lucky thing I never a neighbor [Music] nobody does it better than she does I think the loin of pork is gonna be done it's gorgeous now I'm just gonna come to make sure it's the right temperature needs to be 140 degrees internal temperature which is why one of these instant thermometers is really useful just takes a second 140 degrees exactly okay okay put this on the tray to let it rest while I make the sauce this way keeps it warm and all the juices get back into the one of course oh it's moist and delicious and perfectly cooked okay for the sauce I need about a quarter of a cup of fat in the pan need three tablespoons of flour just let that cook for about a minute it's really like making a gravy okay next thing is a cup of white wine put white wine something you drink three cups of chicken stock okay get that nice and hot and I'm going to add some great flavors this is really the marinade that we put on the top of the pork two teaspoons of coarse grain mustard two teaspoons of Dijon mustard 2 teaspoons of salt 1/2 teaspoon of pepper maybe give it lots of flavor green peppercorns they're in a brine you want to drain off come in a jar okay just about a quarter of a cup let's go really flavor the sauce so I'm just going with this simmer over a low heat for about five or ten minutes until all the flavors really fun to eat delicious [Music] and this is a good thing to do you can't hurt time the house smelling nice it's really nice to have something green so I decided roast asparagus would be great you always want to balance the flavor in color and texture so these are great asparagus I love when asparagus is a little thicker but you want to peel them so they're not so tough I think they have much more flavor than those sort of pencil asparagus you can find okay great very quick olive oil salt and pepper 400 degrees in the oven at 25 minutes and they'll be nice and browned on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside a little salt little pepper how is that I'm gonna wrestle the Balor's and now I think these potatoes are done oh they smell great no chops and pressure but on top so what do I have I have parsley the exact just a bunch of each one and I have some ties to my garden that's great because they're sort of a very mild onion flavor and so just run your knife along the stem so you get more dill thence down okay so now great combination of flavors and it's go with terrific on the potatoes fine absolutely divine and what did she tell me five minutes right okay how many of those I can eat before everybody moves here I don't know have an awful lot to carry but good news is I have a really good looking guy coming to help me what do we got here well we have asparagus and potatoes and maybe I'll carry this and you can get everything else a big heavy pot so we have a cake oh this looks fun we're gonna take this guy listen to you thank you apple cake by the terrace and I'll take with it whoever can I keep you take that okay I got it I'll take this I think we're talking about two trips I'll be back right let's go [Music] all right you're in charge of the cheese but don't have too much fun until I get back okay we need to get everything together for dinner one of the pork that was perfect just slightly pink on the inside it's gonna be so good with a green peppercorn sauce and they have these nice little handles makes it easy to put it on the platter okay I think that should be enough for now I can always come back and get more okay now I've got the potatoes oh it's perfect with the fresh green herbs and parsley and dill and chives just mix it all in it smells so good all this with potatoes and butter we green herbs and gorgeous right on the platter okay last thing asparagus perfect versus very simple really simple salt pepper olive oil so much more flavor than boiled a little bit of sauce green peppercorns and it smells great all right Fowler you're first considering up your party queen for a day Valerie for you in honor of you
