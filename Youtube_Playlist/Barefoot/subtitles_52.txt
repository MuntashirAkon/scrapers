[Music] my friends come for dinner during the week and they're expecting take-out pizza I love to Surprise them and make something really elegant like filet of beef with gorgonzola sauce it's absolutely delicious so what's more elegant for dinner than caviar dip and the truth is there's nothing easier either I'm going to just put a few ingredients together it's my kind of dish no cooking at all I've got eight ounces of cream cheese and half a cup of sour cream I'm just going to blend it all together let that go until it's nicely mixed and then I'm going to start adding my flavorings first thing is lemon juice for one lemon I'm not going to mess up the juicer so I just do it with this little reamer which is terrific kitchen tool so two teaspoons of lemon juice into the cream cheese and sour cream sauce and the next thing is dill and the easiest way to do the dill is just take the leaves off like that I need two tablespoons of chopped dill this is going to be so good with making filet of beef with a gorgonzola sauce it's so easy you won't believe it and roasted cherry tomatoes and clean wedges of baked potatoes and then I made one scallion chopped a lot of recipes just called for the white part of this guy but I love the green part like that you can see it in the dip this guy and is it's really wonderful for the pungent flavor spicy so one whole scallion chopped took in and one tablespoon of milk half-and-half just to thin it just ever so slightly I'm going to turn it on just to lift it up that just one nice factual I'm going to fold in the cavity I don't want to break those little grains I'll show you what I use it's salmon roe and I just love the way it works in this recipe it's so much less expensive this is so great because when you bite into these little grams of caviar they just pop in your mouth so worship of course use a little silver dish if you have one something elegant like this [Music] so good [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] I'm going to make roasted cherry tomatoes and all of these are gorgeous there are yellow pear tomatoes and these wonderful yellow grape tomatoes the sort of shape of a grade so I think tonight I'm just going to use ground red tomatoes and they're all organic so they're good I love the combination of strawberries and cream and I thought it'd be really fun to make a cake that had those flavors so I came up with a strawberry country cake it's a wonderful through simple white cake and I cut it in half and then I feel it with whipped cream and fresh strawberries I'm going to start with one and a half sticks of butter and two cups of sugar and cream these together it's nice light color it's really fluffy it's wonderful and now on most feeds I'm going to add the eggs I need four eggs I was crossing me to a bowl so there's a bad egg I haven't ruined everything I've made I'm going to add these eggs one at a time okay now it's all incorporated so next thing I want to add is dental cream so it's three quarters of a cup of sour cream and that goes in and the sour creams room temperature to it so it all gets incorporated nicely so first I'm gonna do a little orange zest but I have a teaspoon should do it so that's about a half a teaspoon half a teaspoon of lemon zest my favorite rasp so great okay I should do it that's going to go into the batter mix those in and a little vanilla these flavors are really subtle because I don't want them to overpower the strawberries and whipped cream after I sell the cake okay I've got all the wet ingredients now I'm going to do the dry ingredients I need two cups of all-purpose flour and quarter of a cup of cornstarch teaspoon of baking soda which is the leavening to make it rise and 1/2 teaspoon of salt and then on low speed just have the flower really slowly this is the point where you actually can over beat the batter so I do it on a low speed and mix it just until it's done and then into the pan divide them up evenly you have a little scale it's actually a great help but we'll just do it by eye so that's great so when a bake these both now once for the party tonight and what I'm going to freeze another party another time I bake at 350 degrees for about 45 minutes until it's a cluster comes out clean everybody loves french fries but not all that boy so I have a great way to make big potato wedges that are so delicious and they're baked in the oven this would be so good with the filet of beef and gorgonzola sauce okay so these are like chips without to be fat Franks I don't even peel the potatoes so each potato cut in half and then I cut each half in thirds so each one has six pieces what this size is pretty even but it doesn't have to be exact they're going to get really crisp on the outside and really tender on the inside put them at high temperature and people won't believe that they want fried okay that's a potatoes I'm going to drizzle it with olive oil toss it with salt and pepper and then you can use any kind of seasoning you like what I just I love garlic I'm just going to use a little bit like a teaspoon for the whole thing and maybe some fresh rosemary maybe another teaspoon just chop it up quickly I'm going to toss it all together good smell the rosemary it smells great and then to the line them up one side cut down then I'm going to put them in a 400-degree oven bake them for about 35 minutes and I'm going to turn them over to the other side so once one side Browns the other side will for about 20 minutes until they're brown on both they're going to be really good [Music] just because the food is fancy doesn't mean that flowers can't be really earthy I think flower ranges are really hard to do so I pick one kind of flower like this dahlias and I do lots of them it's elegant and it's easy aren't they gorgeous so much it should be done these are the strawberry country cakes and then fill with whipped cream and strawberries perfect cake doctor comes back to me that's great so I'm gonna let those cool for awhile I'm going to make a filet of beef a whole roasted tenderloin it's great and I'm going to show you the easiest gorgonzola sauce to go with it years ago when I was catering a party the chef gave me everything I needed for the party and she went oh my god I forgot to give you the sauce she'd forgotten to make it she handed me a quart of heavy cream and all the flavorings for the sauce and said just boil it I thought she was out of her mind but in fact it makes the best sauce so we put a quart of heavy cream in a pan and just boil it get it up to a high heat and then you just will lower the heat so it simmers for about 45 minutes and it'll thicken just like a white sauce and then we're going to add cheese I'll show you what kind this is going so you can get really two ways this is the best way we go is Italian it's just wonderful this gorgonzola Dolce and then this gorgonzola Mountain gorgonzola that has much more blue in it Dolce means sweet so it's creamier and sweeter but this is the kind that I want but also when you go to the grocery store you can also get gorgonzola that's like this it's not quite as good but it's fine and since I have the really good Italian one after all you someone explicit boil for a little while and so it gets nice and thick and then an advocate result could be really good the way this is sometimes called a beef tenderloin or a whole filet but when you get it like this it's called trimmed and tied and you want to ask the butcher for that it's got all the sort of silver taken off and it's all tied very neatly so it bakes in a very nice form around and it'll bake evenly though this is a big filet of beef it's probably between 50 and $100 to buy it but I have to tell you it feeds ten to twelve people and it's so easy to make every once in a while it's really worth doing so I'm going to tap the si dry so the seasonings stick to it and then I'm going to take about two tablespoons of room-temperature butter needs to be room temperature otherwise it won't read this is the messy part and just spread it all over the outside of this this is just going to keep it really moist and it's going to make a nice space for the salt and pepper I'm going to put on so you need about one tablespoon of salt seems like a lot but it's really the only seasoning and a tablespoon of pepper it's going to be really spicy but it's going to have wonderful flavor when it bakes so now this is going to go on a roasting pan and it's going to roast at 500 degrees now the key to this is you have to really clean up and otherwise you're going to smoke everybody out of the house 500 degrees for exactly 22 minutes it'll be rare for exactly 25 minutes it'll be medium-rare and it's going to be so good you won't believe it [Music] it doesn't get any easier than this for us to cherry tomatoes I've got a whole boulder from here you can use any kind these are just regular cherry tomatoes sometimes when I can get them great tomatoes are wonderful or yellow cherry tomatoes or pear Tomatoes whatever you can find and mix them it's really colorful if you can drizzle them with olive oil kosher salt freshly ground black pepper and I'm going to roast these in the oven at a high temperature 400 degrees for best 15 to 20 minutes and you won't believe how delicious they are and now for our favorite cake I'm going to cut it in half and fill it with strawberries and whipped cream if they don't come out really easily one of the things I do is just bang it on the board a little bit let's just let it feel whether it's loose enough to turn out turn it out take the parchment off and always lay down on the flat side that one's good pull the paper off tough small Sokka the vanilla in the zest so now the cakes are nicely cooled and the first thing I do is put one of the cakes in the freezer okay and now for our favorite cake then we're going to have tonight I'm going to cut it in half and fill it with strawberries and whipped cream they'll show you check I'm feeling shaky I'll take to fix and just put them halfway through and then I'll cut just above the toothpicks and I know my knife will cut it exactly in half and now it's perfectly sliced in half so it smells so good now the first thing is we have to do whipped cream that a cup of heavy cream and then while that's looking on the flavor is vanilla but it have to be spoon and some sugar so this is really see okay perfect so this is when the whipped cream is whipped it can go too far you end up with butter but it's really soft peaks and it's just gorgeous just like that and the next thing strawberries it's really like a strawberry shortcake but it's got cake instead of a biscuit place a little bit of cream on the cake big thick slices of strawberries place them with a point tipping out so you can see them peeking out inside the cake all the way around I'm going to find one gorgeous one for the top maybe two to save these guys for later now the top goes on big dollop of whipped cream on the top I love about this is sort of a country kind of dessert but it's still very elegant at the end of the day it's a simplest things that are really the most elegant it's a big strawberries on the top select only the stems on because it look more strawberry like [Music] the best relation is just ready gorgeous so good pitch looks so fabulous I'm going to put it on the board and let this rest so important to let me read it's going to reabsorb all the juices and cover it in foil keep it nice and warm and be perfect I'm already for dinner oh this looks great this is a heavy cream that I've reduced for the gorgonzola sauce and just silky and smooth and just sort of coats the wooden spoon just wonderful and now I'm going to add all the wonderful flavor so this is that gorgeous Italian gorgonzola that I had it's a mountain gorgonzola it's not Dolce it's a really pungent flavorful gorgonzola and I'm going to put about 4 ounces of gorgonzola right into the sauce sort of break it up a little bit and it's going to just melt into it it's gonna be really creamy oh so good and then I found another 3 tablespoons of Parmesan cheese really gives it a good flavor this is Parmesan that I already graded you don't want to use the stuff from the box in the grocery store get really good parmesan and grade it yourself it's so much better it was just left in refrigerator for weeks and weeks and then just 3/4 of teaspoon of salt a victory Cruz a teaspoon of pepper stir that up and see it all just melts together and the last thing on a Duke is playing a little chopped parsley which will give a really fresh flavor I actually think parsley is really under used as an herb so that's gonna be wonderful with roasted Salafis those big wedges of baked potatoes and the roasted tomatoes really good [Music] and now I have a minute to get ready before everybody gets here [Music] okay we're good we clicked xane right it
