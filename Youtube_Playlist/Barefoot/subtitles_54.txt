[Music] my friends are coming for a barbecue tonight it's gonna be gorgeous night we're gonna have hamburgers on the grill turkey sausages and I'm gonna make vegetable coleslaw to go with it it's gonna be delicious I've already sliced cabbage is white cabbage and red cabbage and I also like to slice the green part of the outer leaves because I think it really adds a lot to the salad and I'm just gonna slice the carrots and it's so easy to do in a food processor just put the carrots in actually sideways how fast is that just two more this is all the vegetables and what I do is in order to keep the colors from running the red cabbage from making everything else pink I just leave it in layers like that and then we're gonna make the sauce I can combine the whole thing together onto the sauce they're really traditional coleslaw ingredients I like it with a volume turned up cuz I don't like that sort of gloppy mayonnaise flavor I like to add something to thin it either chicken stock or in this case I'm gonna do a little bit of cider vinegar now Kevin's two cups of mayonnaise two tablespoons of cider vinegar a tablespoon of sugar just to make sure it's really nice and sweet the cabbage and then some good Dijon mustard quarter of a cup all of this is about giving it lots of good flavor okay I'm gonna put in 2 teaspoons of celery seed just gives a really good sort of fresh celery flavor 1 teaspoon of celery salt and a half a teaspoon of kosher salt half a teaspoon of good black pepper it's gonna mix that up now one of the good things about this is I can make it really early in the day and I leave the vegetables and the sauce separate and then just before going to serve it I can put it all together in fact I could even make it a few days in advance it's great love things that don't have to be made just before the party and that's it so when you go into the refrigerator and I'm ready for the party find a coke lemon sauce and smoothie delicious [Music]
