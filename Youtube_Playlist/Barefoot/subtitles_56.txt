we make uh cover which is a French chicken and wine with mushrooms and bacon the first thing I need is four ounces of bacon or pancetta I think just good smoked bacon aside put a little splash of olive oil on the pan just going to cook it for about eight to ten minutes until the bacon is really crisped okay while that cooks I'm going to get the chicken ready so what I've done is I've asked the butcher to cut a chicken up in ten pieces I'm salt and pepper it really well on both sides okay so that's salt and pepper and I think the bacon is done perfectly I want it taken out with a slotted spoon and just leave the fat that's left behind for browning the chicken just put on a big plate so the chickens going to go in I want to do it in batches so Brown's really nicely if you put too much in actually ends up steaming rather than browning I'm not cooking it completely I'm just browning it and all the flavors from the Browning we're going to get into the sauce I need half a pound of carrots I actually use really big thick slices one yellow onions two sliced into the pan one clove of garlic minced right in okay next is good stuff quarter of a cup of cognac this is going to give the flavor of the cognacs and it deglazes the pan get all those delicious crusty parts into the sauce okay now I put the chicken and the bacon all back into the pot and all the juices that select on the plate to have a bottle of Burgundy you can use Pinot Noir which is something really good that you would drink cup of chicken stock and the last thing big sprig of fresh thyme don't even pick the leaves off you can just take the stem out after it's done okay into the oven 250 degrees for just about an hour and it's going to be so good so I have a half a pound of mushrooms these are cremini you can use for Cheney the only thing you don't want to use are those sort of button mushrooms that you find the grocery store I don't have a lot of flavor so I'm just going to cook these in a little bit of butter let's get them browned these a big saute pan so they Brown nicely you don't want them to steam you want them to really steer a little bit fantastic now I'm going to the cock event out of the oven oh good okay so now I'm going to make a little bit of a roux which is flour and butter to second out so I need one and a half tablespoons of flour and 1 tablespoon of softened butter just mash it all together and then add it back into the pot and it pickins really nicely I'm just going to thicken the sauce beautifully and the last really important ingredient for cago fat little baby onion so right into the pot I'm going to add the mushrooms in actually leave the mushrooms to the last ingredient so they don't disintegrate and they're really great when they're just quickly sauteed give it a stir cook for about ten minutes so the sauce is nice and thick and take out the stems of the time y'all going to cook together so we're so good this is really this is just delicious
