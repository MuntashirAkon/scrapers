[Music] it's such a gorgeous day my friends are here for the weekend I'm gonna pack a picnic and we're all going to the town [Music] my picnic by the pond I'm gonna make grilled salmon sandwiches old-fashioned carrot salad and for dessert lemon bars this is really the carrot salad that my mother used to make when I was a kid it's very old fashioned but I'm gonna make it faster the food processor I like to grate the carrots you'll see how fast it is that's pretty fast and I put them inside way so you get really long shreds rather than if you stand them up you get short shreds I think it looks so much nicer that's it two bunches of chopped carrots I think the top carrots are actually sweeter than the ones in the bag so that's really good okay and then I'm just gonna add lots of old-fashioned ingredients a cup of mayonnaise cup of pineapple this is actually golden pineapple just so much sweeter than regular kind of all just delicious tastes like it was just picked got a cup of races isn't this old-fashioned salt and pepper mix it all together you can really do any combination you if you want more raisins less raisins more pineapple do it the way you like it but not too much mayonnaise you just want to moisturize I'm also making buffalo chicken wings with blue cheese dressing mmm so good and Caesar salad with pancetta how's that for a picnic by the pond and do something I think I'll be really pretty is I'm gonna take a pepper half cut this in half and use that as the bowl for the carrot salad so it'll be really colorful too and then we can eat the balls that's got to be really good I [Music] love Caesar salad it's great on its own but it's also great with additions like grilled lemon chicken but today I'm gonna make it with pancetta and roasted cherry tomatoes it's really good foundation so two plates of cherry tomatoes a little olive oil salt and pepper I'm just gonna roll them around gonna roast these at 400 degrees for about 15 minutes until they're really juicy and tender into the oven really messy too then I'm gonna add Italian bacon which is called pancetta and that's the Italian store to cut it very thick it's really about a half an inch thick and then I'm gonna dice it it's really like adding bacon to a Caesar salad which is great but it has much more flavor I think but if you can't find pancetta just use bacon this is gonna cook on the stove for about 15 minutes until a lot of the fat comes out and you're just left with really delicious bacon okay into the pan [Music] break it up a little bit and cook it over medium heat okay that's the pancetta now I'm gonna make the dressing one egg yolk two cloves of garlic chopped up two teaspoons of mustard that's so much flavor anchovies I know you think they're hairy fish they're really good and Caesar salad dressing you can leave them out if you want to but I think they're really important so maybe six or eight anchovies half a cup of lemon juice fresh lemon juice 2 teaspoons of kosher salt half a teaspoon of pepper Tapan and puree this and while it's on like making mayonnaise I'm gonna pour one and a half cups of olive oil in Gordon slowly and it gets very thick just like mayonnaise [Music] then the last thing is half a cup of freshly grated Parmesan cheese and that's the dressing its tasted to make sure it's perfect it's delicious Parmesan and little anchovy flavor it's really important okay so next for the salad greens so I have two heads of romaine lettuce just slice it across remains great for this because it really stays firm when you put the dressing on it it won't wilt okay into the bowl so I'm gonna combine the lettuce and the pancetta and the tomatoes and then later just before I'm gonna pack it up for the picnic I'm gonna pour the dressing on so let's see how that tomatoes are doing these look great they're really tender and they're still firm right onto the top of the lettuce right and then the pancetta I'm just gonna drain make sure they're not too oily [Music] just trying it for a second you wanted to be crisp not soggy edit on top now I'm just gonna pack up the dressing and we'll be ready to combine later for my party that was pretty easy [Music] I'm looking for disposable tableware for my picnic because who wants to drag all those dishes to the pond see I've got grilled salmon sandwiches grated carrots out this would look great dark blue I think they look fabulous on that I'd be a little bit of a print for the lemon bars and I love these striped napkins all I need is cutlery all these large white knives and forks would be great it's Continental sighs everyone's gonna have their own bag so all I need is the bags now simple is always better isn't it [Music] my picnic by the pond I'm making all kinds of portable food including lemon bars for dessert so I'm gonna start with two sticks of butter 1/2 a cup of sugar why do all my recipes start with two sticks of butter it's for a party though I'm just gonna cream those together and then with the mixer on low add 2 cups of flour and Nathan teach themself great this is really a shortbread dough it's so much easier to make it doesn't require a rolling pin I'm just gonna Pat it right into the pan okay put it right into a 9 by 12 pan don't even have to grease the pan coz there's butter on the dough I'm just gonna fly with my hands and press this out I mean chill it for about 15 minutes and then later on it wouldn't make a wonderful lemon curd filling and pour it on top of the baked dough and then cut them out in squares for my party okay just chill for 15 minutes good so the first thing I want to do is make a sauce it's a fresh green herb sauce 1 cup of mayonnaise 1/4 of a cup of sour cream and then I always like to thin it with a little bit of flavoring so a little white wine vinegar will do it so it's not so thick and lots of fresh green herbs of basil leaves mmm the smell of basil and lots of fresh dill I'm just gonna run my knife along the edge take off some fronds just a good dressing for the salmon sandwiches but it's also a good dip for vegetables it's a really fresh great tasting dip so big handful of fresh dill and some chopped scallions not too much because you don't want the flavor of the scallions to overwhelm the salmon so just enough to give it a little spice salt and pepper and because I like a little vinegary thing with it with the salmon it's nice maybe about a tablespoon of capers goes right in okay and then just puree it all together that's the sauce I'm just gonna put the sandwiches together so I've got brioche rolls cut them in half just gonna put a little bit of sauce on both sides just make sure that bread stays moist and then I either put basil leaves or sometimes some mescaline which is this wonderful fresh salad mixed greens and a nice piece of salmon I've actually grilled this for about five minutes on each side just going to take the skin off and took it off before it was entirely cooked and then covered it with foil and it actually continues to cook and that's how it stays incredibly moist and that's the cemetery and then to the fridge my call for picnic is easy cleanup everybody's gonna have everything they need in one bag and it's all disposable we have plastic wine glass breaking plates disposable silverware large-size gorgeous blue napkin and everything has to match even though it's a picnic it has to be gorgeous so when the food's ready everybody's gonna have all their food everything they need for the picnic right in the bag and since the Swans have to eat to bread for everybody in their bag and the one thing that's not disposable I don't want to forget the corkscrew [Music] so I've chilled the dough for my lemon bars and now I'm gonna bake them 350 for about 15 minutes and later I'm gonna make the filling my picnic by the pond I'm making lots of portable food including lemon bars for dessert I've got the crust all baked and cooled and now I'm making the filling so I've got 6 eggs 3 cups of sugar I'm just gonna whisk it all together these are really lemony lemon bars I've got lots of lemon juice and lots of zest and them a great flavor okay next thing is 2 tablespoons of grated lemon zest which I've already got right there a cup of fresh lemon juice you can already smell the sharpness of the citrusy lemon and the last thing is 1 cup of flour just put the flour in slowly so it doesn't get lumpy and when this is done I'm going to pour it onto the crust put it in the oven 350 degrees for 30 to 35 minutes until it sets and when they're cool I'm going to cut them in big squares and definitely confectioner sugar it's gonna be so good with my picnic of the pond okay just pour it right in that's dessert but first we need a main course and I thought with the Caesar salad and pancetta be great to have buffalo chicken wings with blue cheese dip take off the wing tip and then cut the rest of it in half so the wing tip is really not used I reserved it for chicken stock and then these two pieces I'm gonna make buffalo chicken wings out of so onto my sheet pan usually a buffalo chicken wings are fried but I hate dealing with a big pot of boiling oil never mind how dangerous it is so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna brush these with really spicy butter and then broil them and I think they're just delicious so give the spicy butter I've got four tablespoons of butter melted I'm going to add two teaspoons of fat sauce it's really hot one teaspoon of salt and a half a teaspoon of cayenne pepper even hotter but remember we're just brushing it on I'm just gonna mix it together and brush on the chicken wings so I'm serving really spicy chicken wings with a really cool blue cheese dressing as a dip and as always traditionally served with celery which is sort of cool and crunchy it's such a great combination and since it's finger food it's great for a picnic with lots of napkins so I'm gonna borrow these for eight minutes and I'm going to turn them brush them with more spicy butter and broil them for another four and they'll be delicious great and while that's happening I'm gonna make the blue cheese dip so I need three quarters of a cup of gorgonzola crumbled right into the food processor okay have a cup of mayonnaise half a cup of sour cream just a splash of milk to thin it a little bit some Worcestershire sauce some salt and pepper and just puree it up [Applause] this is a great tip not just for buffalo chicken minds but also for fresh vegetables no it's wonderful great blue cheese flavor and the Worcestershire sauce does a lot for it and I think the buffalo chicken wings are ready how good do those look I'm just gonna turn these and brush them again with its spicy butter and four more minutes in the oven they'll be done countdown to the picnic all I have to do is pack everything up so first thing is carrot salad I'm gonna do a little container for the carrot salad and a pepper it's the own little edible ball I take the seeds out and just as my fingers take the rib out and watch this a little bit of carrot salad in the red pepper great colors delicious into a Chinese takeout container [Music] okay the next thing is our grilled salmon sandwich with mescal and herb dressing just wrap it up in parchment paper so you two salad with pancetta and roasted tomatoes I'm just gonna put the dressing on also good I think a little extra Parmesan cheese just right it's the container okay the next one is buffalo chicken wings I think what I'm going to do put a little bit of a blue cheese bit in the bottom of the container and then put two buffalo wings and some celery sticks right on top and then it has its own little bit and the last thing is to serve lemon bars I'm just go Dustin with a little bit of powdered sugar this is so lemony I can't wait for dessert and I've just I've cut 12 of them in this pan so the first one that's hard to get out okay I'll wrap it in parchment paper [Music] [Music] off to the pond to me my friends [Music] you [Music]
