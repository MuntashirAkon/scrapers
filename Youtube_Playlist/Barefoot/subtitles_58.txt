[Music] when the sun's out the last place I want to be is in the kitchen I'd love to jump in the car put the top down drive around and let local ingredients inspire my menu I stopped at a specialty food store and buy something I can serve as is I have a friend coming for lunch Jeffrey's coming for dinner and I'm gonna be cool and relaxed when they arrive on the menu shrimp linguini a delicious dish of shrimp and lemon with parsley and garlic for dessert store-bought meringues and raspberries with deceased whipped cream and then Jeff would be home just in time for a moonlit snack in the garden they'll get to sample the winner of my little cocktail contest the contenders are classic Manhattan a mai tai and the unbelievably strong Long Island iced tea and then we'll have his favorite smoked salmon spread with toasted baguette followed by fresh peaches and sputtering I think you'll love it perfect summer food [Music] Jeffery's is coming for a short time this weekend so I want to make every minute count so I'm gonna make a few things ahead and in addition to that I'm having a party tomorrow so I really want to have everything done so I can be out of the kitchen I'm gonna make smoked Salmons bread and peaches and Sauternes it's gonna be delicious since it only has two ingredients peaches and Saturn you want to make sure they're both really good and the only way to tell whether peach is good is if it smells like a peach I'm gonna dunk them in boiling water just to take the skins off what you don't want to do is go to the store and squeeze it because wherever you squeeze that you're gonna leave a brown spot so depending on how soft the peaches are it's gonna take between 30 seconds and maybe two minutes for the skins to come off easily and the only way to know is just try one okay they should be done now just test it put it nice water and then just see the peel comes right off what you don't want to do is cook the peaches so we're gonna take them all out now okay this one's peeling beautifully see how the skin just sort of falls right off when it's right [Music] look at that one can see perfect okay [Music] okay smells so good it's our fresh summer piece now great so so I turn which is that sweet dessert wine that's so wonderful I'm just going to pour it over it so that's right enough so it marinates in it a little bit of sugar really depends on how sweet the pages are these are pretty sweet so I don't need too much and a splash of Grand Marnier just to give it a little depth of flavor so I'm gonna make a little snack for Jeffrey when he comes home tomorrow night smoked salmon spread and then we'll have some fresh peaches and Sauternes afterwards that's not a bad snack but the cream cheese out at room temperature I'm just gonna put it in the mixer eight ounces of cream cheese got a half a cup of sour cream this is great as a dip with crudit√© but it's also good as a spread on what slices of baguette and about a tablespoon of lemon juice freshly squeezed lemon juice and then from lots of flavor some fresh dill would be really nice and just chop it up big rough chop okay that tablespoon of fresh dill right into the mixer and a little bit of salt and pepper and teaspoon horseradish forget grating your own horseradish it makes me cry right into the mixer and finally smoked salmon can of smoked salmon dip with that smoked salmon I tend to like Ural region salmon because it's a little drier and not quite so salty okay four ounces of smoked salmon right into the dip turn the mixer on mix it up that's not salmon dip done and to a nice ball just because it's just a snack for Jeffrey doesn't mean it can't be gorgeous okay into the fridge I've got a really busy day tomorrow so I've got to get my beauty sleep [Music] my god it's always yeah berries from the Rings I think these raspberries gonna be perfect you're gonna put these on my charge I don't need a bag like that thanks so much good to see you [Music] shop with some amazing as always right now what I need is one bed gap for my smoked salmon spread all right nice and crack I know they're always nice and fresh hot out of the oven Oh fantastic and I need some meringues I'm gonna do whipped cream and berries in it okay hello of us yeah this is so good thank you so much will you charge it for me sure yes thank you it's gonna be delicious I'll call you for dinner soon thank you [Music] my philosophy is you don't always need to make something to have a fabulous dessert so I've gotten meringues from loaves and fishes and they just gorgeous the fresh raspberries from the farm stand I'm just gonna whip up a little whipped cream to fill them how bad can that be so I'm just gonna put some heavy cream in it ball and I've got the mixer fitted with a whisk attachment what really cold cream a little sugar everybody likes to flavor whipped cream with vanilla but I like to try different things like rub or this is cassis it's a currant liqueur and wait to see turns mole and the good news is you have to taste it to make sure it's the right combination it's so good it's like berry flavored whipped cream who wouldn't want that done so now I'm just gonna assemble them I love a combination of whipped cream because it's creamy and the meringues which are sort of dry and crisp top with really sweet berries was that for dessert that's pretty great isn't it I can't wait for dessert I think I hear the bell and Michael incredible for attempted florist these are everything look at these own a sweet person fabulous so are you in charge of arranging the flowers I'm in charge of flowers I'm making dinner fabulous you need anything buzz the nurse we're right in the kitchen I'm making linguine with shrimp scampi it's a great summer dish I can't oil the pasta pot so that the pasta doesn't stick together and salt for flavor okay that's gonna cook for seven to ten minutes according to the directions on the package so I'm making a set of these with hydrangeas I use a knife because a scissor will seal the stem and we want as much water in the flowers as possible [Music] okay that the three tablespoons of olive oil about three tablespoons of butter I do the olive oil because it is a high burning temperature and the butter because there's lots of flavor I know this looks like a lot but it's the sauce of the entire dish and about one and a half tablespoons of garlic with garlic you really don't want to cook it too long for just about a minute nothing worse than the flavor of garlic so one minute while I get everything else ready so the first thing is shrimp and what I buy is a peeled and deveined shrimp bluefish store if you can't buy it you can always peel and devein it yourself I'm gonna add the pound of shrimp you just cook it for a very short time like three to five minutes and all that flavor of the garlic is gonna get into the shrimp so first thing I do a salt and pepper the shrimp I'm going to have lots of flavor because when you add the pasta the sauce has to flavor the pasta also it's a really strongly flavored just turn the shrimp so they cook evenly on both sides it's so good all that garlic and butter and oil how bad can that be Michaels so great with flowers I can't wait to see what he's doing at the table [Music] it looks good I hope Anna likes it so just rain from the drain the water from it and then it's gonna go right into that pan with the shrimp and the garlic and butter and oil it's gonna bizarre ball that great flavor okay just like that two spoons just toss it all together essentially great way to make any pasta Italians do it even when you're making pasta with tomato sauce as you cook the pasta and the sauce together for the last few minutes and it really absorbs the flavor okay and then the last ingredient so lemon zest lemon juice I like a little bit of heat so just a sprinkling of red pepper flakes okay just toss that together and then have two more things to put in parsley okay right on top and then because I want you to you can't really see the lemon but I want you to know it's lemon what I do is a few thin slices of lemon people aren't gonna eat them but they'll they'll see that it's lemon so I'm gonna add a few slices of lemon to the whole thing before I finish it's tossing this really great summer lunch I think Michaels gonna [Music] [Music] we never customers who once is in at six o'clock in the morning yeah so that hurt houseguests feel and think that she has done all these flowers buyers so save room for dessert so it's meringue with whipped cream and fifties and fresh raspberries I mean how summary is that cheers every Friday night when Trevor comes home and make him a scotch and the roast chicken well it's time to shake things up a little bit I thought wouldn't it be great when he walks through the front door to have some cocktail for him so I'm gonna try three different cocktails first a Long Island iced tea and it has nothing to do with - okay so here goes ice cubes into the glass now the liquor lots of it all in the same quantity start with gin quarter of a cup quarter of a cup of vodka and a quarter of a cup of white rum and there's still more next a quarter of a cup of tequila and a quarter of a cup of Cointreau the orange flavored liqueur from France you don't want to drive after you drink this and you want to make sure you guess now how strong it is next time lemon juice 1/2 a cup and a teaspoon of sugar syrup give it a stir drop in some ice cubes in a long tall glass and then pour the Long Island iced tea over the rocks tap the glass with a splash of Cola and a slice of lemon on the rim can't wait to try it imagine this on a hot summer day okay so far so good my next experiment is a my time which is that summery cocktail you have in the Caribbean on vacation you know the one that's all loaded up with pineapples and maraschino cherries I do draw the line at those little paper umbrellas though okay here goes so lightly beaten egg white and pour it into a flat plate and then dip the rim of the glass in the egg and then into the sugar my ties make me feel like it's summer on a beach looks great already doesn't it okay the liquor white rum half a cup into the shaker next a quarter of a cup of triple sec it's another delicious orange flavored liqueur and then some fresh orange juice at a quarter of a cup and for the zing quarter of a cup of fresh lime juice now some ice cubes about six okay now the energetic part starts shaking and then pour the might I enjoy glass over ice and now the decoration it's a little old fashioned but it's required drop the cherries right into the cocktail then a juicy chunk of pineapple on the rim and some orange so there it is strictly for summer and very tropical I can't wait to taste it one more cocktail to go and it's a classic it's a Manhattan always reminds me of the roaring 20s it's made from bourbon and sweet vermouth how bad can that be okay so for the Manhattan start with the ice cubes next remove quarter of a cup and bourbon a whole Cup and give it all a stir so chill glasses make this perfect just chill them in the freezer for that 15 minutes and then a maraschino cherry the crowning glory no wonder people have been drinking this cocktail for more than 100 years now comes the fun part I have to taste these cocktails first minute hat looks great doesn't it [Music] whoa that's lethal Jeff you'll never make it through dinner if I serve him that hmm then the Long Island iced tea looks like iced tea actually tastes like iced tea which is amazing and the last one is a mai tai it actually really looks like the Caribbean isn't it that's it it's a really good it tastes like fruit juice it's a little more lethal than that but it's gonna feel like a vacation to Geoffrey and it's gonna be a great weekend [Music] we could do the sweet peas but I think is her color she never seems to find yeah that's nice that's nice what else have or if we can do the pinky oh yeah nice big arm yeah that sounds great the sliced has left over Baghdad and make croutons out of it to see what easy this is someone take the bread just line it up on a sheet pan a little bit of olive oil just a brush each one on the top with olive oil it's gonna Brown it and it gives it lots of flavor lots of salt you want to have really good flavor pepper and into the oven 400 degrees for about 10 to 15 minutes I'm gonna have nice crisp baguette slices Geoffrey should be home any minute [Music] coffee machines I think that I think this is this is exactly what she would love oh these toys look great nice and crispy I've got lots of flavor wait I think I hear Geoffrey any sweetie I'm back oh you're gonna make me a person maybe later okay but right now come with me okay I brought look what I caught you have no idea how many drinks I had to try in order to get these mai tais it's a tough job but somebody has to do it I hope you like it hmmm delicious so what's in it [Music] so I also made just a little smoked salmon dip already fresh peaches and Saturn so what's in it smoked salmon sound a little girl few other things so why actually don't we the garden I don't know but you know every time if you bring this stuff here you'll be in the car [Laughter] [Music]
