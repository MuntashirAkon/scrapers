it's that time of year when there's a little snap in the air and I'd love to make a really cozy dinner by the fire so I thought I'd make it a roast loin of pork with roasted vegetables and maybe for dessert rum raisin rice pudding I actually use a big Spanish onions there's so much easier to slice and dice okay and next I think I'm going to do some potatoes I'd love to use these Yukon Gold potatoes you'll see the inside they're just this gorgeous yellow color and I just find them the flavor sort of buttering really great but you can use red new potatoes or you can use white ones whatever you can find so the next thing I think I'm going to do is carrots when carrots cook they really cook down they get smaller so just be sure you use really big chunks okay into the pan with a Karin and now for my favorite vegetable general this is what fennel looks like when it's in the bulb because it has big tops on it but you usually buy it like this and you can really find in the grocery store pretty frequently now I want to cut the top off like that these are really sort of tough so you don't want to eat them but interesting thing is when it's raw it has a very strong anise flavor which is good but I'm not that crazy about it but when it's cooked it's sweet and delicious and believe me it's wonderful and then just slice the whole thing in half and you'll see there's a core here which is just fine to eat so I'm just going to cut right through the cord or keep the fennel together when it roasts just cut it in big wedges just like that and now I'm just a season it a little bit of butter a little bit of olive oil lots of salt you'd be surprised how much you need for a big pot of vegetables like this that's a freshly ground black pepper good it ready and then clean hands just toss them all together got a really beautiful loin of pork from the butcher what I'm going to do is I'm gonna make a marinade that's going to go on the top of the pork and all the flavors are going to get into it it'll sit for a little while while I worst the vegetables it's going to be really moist and delicious there's two cloves of garlic tablespoon of salt tablespoon of fresh thyme into the food processor and sumit mince it all up and the last thing I need is a quarter of a cup of mustard mix it all up I'm just going to rub it on the outside of the pork it's really like a rub that you put on top and let it just soak in okay so I'm just going to put this aside for about 30 minutes and let this gorgeous marinade get into the meat and in the meantime I'm going to roast the vegetables they smell so good all the fennel and carrots and potatoes it's really starting to get brown whoo easing two-step pork with it now I'm going to take this whole loin of pork and just put it right on top just like that and they're all going to cook together so it's going to cook at the same temperature 425 for about 30 minutes if the one of pork is this size sometimes they're much bigger something I take about 50 minutes but for this one it's 30 minutes at 425 until the loin of pork is exactly 138 degrees in the middle and it will be perfect [Music] so good so I'll have to just get the cabbage ready and dinner served
