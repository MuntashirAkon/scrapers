[Music] isn't choosing holiday gifts the worst friends of mine believe that all present should be things that disappear gather have to be used or consumed in one sitting like theater tickets or food I've decided to surprise my friends Joanne new bald and Maureen Mullin we call him Joe and Moe by leaving all kinds of wonderful edible gifts under their tree first a welcome home cup of steaming white hot chocolate with a shot of Grand Marnier then cranberry harvest muffins that are packed with dried fruit and spices and big bags of delicious homemade cherry almond and cinnamon granola and I've packed the basket with more treats than they can imagine but that's not all I've asked my friends Michael Grimm and TR pest got to sneak in during the day and decorate their house for the holidays I hope Joey and my lovin something about the holidays that calls for really special treats and I think of truffles chocolate truffles as one of those and you won't believe how easy it is then take a half a cup of heavy cream and just heat it up what you don't want to do is boil this because there's nothing worse than the taste of boiled cream okay can't make chocolate truffles without lots of chocolate I'm using bittersweet and semi-sweet I think bit up sweets a little too bitter and semi-sweet a little too sweet so I like to combine the two and get it sort of halfway in between so that's three net bounces of semi-sweet chocolate chop it up fairly fine because what I'm gonna do is pour the hot cream over it and I'm gonna melt the chocolate this is surprisingly easy candies America and I'm gonna chop up three new fences of bittersweet you know true chocolate aficionados only like bittersweet chocolate but I have to say a little bitter for me so the key to this is to add flavorings that really complement the chocolate I find vanilla and coffee really make chocolate taste more chocolaty and then I like to add one other flavor so there's sort of a back note to it very often I use Grand Marnier but this time I think I'm gonna do it with hazelnuts so I'm gonna do chopped hazelnuts on the outside and Frangelico with which is hazelnut liqueur on the inside so the next thing I'm gonna do is pour this warm cream it's actually hot it's just under the simmering point through a strainer onto the chocolate and the cream is gonna melt the chocolate you want to do it through a strainer because there's always a little bit of sort of a skin of milk it's not pretty in chocolate and just stir this a good thing about the system is you can't overheat the chocolate the cream just gets under the simmering point and it'll just melt the chocolate so we'll let that melt and add the other flavorings so the first thing is why don't ask tablespoons a Frangelica will occur which is a hazelnut liqueur but any kind of a nut liqueur be really wonderful with this one tablespoon of coffee prepared coffee which I have from this morning and if it's hot it's even better helps melt the chocolate and half a teaspoon of good vanilla extract and if I fold my cards right the chocolate should be melted by now so just stir it around if for any reason the chocolate doesn't melt you can always put it over simmering pan of water for a minute but I think it should be good I can't wait to go to Joey and Moe's to put these treats under the tree but I understand that there are some elves they're already putting things together can't wait to see it [Music] chocolates all melted it's nice and smooth and I bet it's pretty good so good I love the balance of bittersweet and semi-sweet and you can really taste the Frangelico so I'm gonna chill to serve at 45 minutes and then make little balls and roll them in hazelnuts they're gonna be great as a surprise [Music] should we unwrap it yeah and then then we can see if it's you know even holy Wow yeah right right okay I'm gonna get started at the table and I'm gonna do my favorite decorating so Michael bouncing off of your gold silver and red theme and I'm doing silver and white and so it's time to scoop the truffles so what I've got is a chilled mixture of semi-sweet chocolate bittersweet chocolate and all kinds of delicious flavorings like hazelnut liqueur Frangelico vanilla coffee and cream they've been chilling in the refrigerator you can scoop this with spoons the old-fashioned light but a small ice cream scoop makes it really lovely it's easy and you get every single ball exactly the same and I'm gonna roll each one and chopped hazelnuts that I've toasted in an oven for about 10 minutes at 325 now that looks good enough to eat I think Joey no we're gonna love these remember you don't want perfect little circles you want them to look like wild truffles that's great for the holidays just pack them up in a bag and it's a great hostess gift okay last one no and the hazelnuts so these are perfectly delicious at room temperature on a plate but since I'm gonna pack them in a bag from Joey and Moe I'm gonna chill them for a little bit until they get nice and firm so they can pile up beautifully I think they're gonna be very happy at Christmas morning [Music] next I think I'm gonna make cranberry harvest muffins and maybe a cherry almond cinnamon granola that's gonna be good [Music] cranberries are one of the classic holiday foods because they're only in season from Thanksgiving to Christmas this recipe for muffins comes from one of my favorite cookbooks open house cookbook by Sarah Chase Sarah you said this wonderful specialty food store in Nantucket called que sera sera and of course that's where cranberries are going so the first thing one do is chop cranberries not easy to do they roll around on the board like mad just like that really coarse and then we also have figs so these are dried figs just take off that little stem and then just dice those these muffins are really easy to make all you do is combine the dry ingredients the wet ingredients and all these good chunky ingredients okay now to make the muffins so I've got three cups of all-purpose flour just lighten it with your cup it's make lots of muffins and then tablespoon of baking powder baking powders always double-acting the first time it starts going is when it gets wet and the second time is when it hits the heat in the oven and I need 1/2 a teaspoon of baking soda 1/2 a teaspoon of salt a lots of spices tablespoon good cinnamon ground cinnamon mmm that's the most very holiday ish and 2 teaspoons of ground ginger which is a great flavor okay so sift these together and then actually combines them they make sure there are no little particles in the flour and there aren't perfect so there's the dry ingredients just combine the flour and the cinnamon and ginger it smells great just make it well right in the middle now we need one and a quarter cups of milk just gonna make about 18-month ins ran the milk 2 eggs I use actual extra-large eggs just needs a little bit right in the middle and two sticks of melted butter and then just stir all this together until it's just combined don't over mix it you'll end up with tough muffins with it okay next thing is the cranberries all the chopped cranberries and chopped figs and then two kinds of sugar 3/4 of a cup of light brown sugar that gives it a really sort of caramel flavor very holidays 3/4 of a cup of white sugar no the cranberries are really tart so needs a lot of sugar and then just stir it all together Joey just finished renovating her house she designed it herself can't wait to see how they're decorating it so many tips for decorating a tree just does a great job thank you I like to use white light green cords of course that blend in with the tree then I'd like to do a mixture of different sizes and shapes and I also like to take ornaments and put them deep into the tree because it's just to give it that fullness and I actually like to use great florist wires to hang the ornament because you can cut them at every different lengths that's such a great idea like because it gives you the illusion that they're just floating that's great it really does okay would you change too much so I'm just scooping cranberry harvest muffins into the pans I'm just gonna bake them awesome to be nice and fresh Joanna mo okay and you know my pickups make that 18 muffins these cups are great you can just buy them anywhere I particularly like the plain white ones [Music] is battered fabulous you can actually store it in the refrigerator [Music] I'm gonna bake these 375 for about 20 to 25 minutes until they're nice and puff would be really sweet and tart and perfect for holiday breakfast [Music] and next I'm gonna make wonderful granola with dried cherries almonds and cinnamon something to the next treat I want to make for a good holiday breakfast is granola you can make it all different kinds of flavors but I'm gonna make granola with coconut cherry almond and lots of cinnamon so I'm gonna start with 4 cups of old-fashioned oats you don't want quick-cooking 2 cups of sliced almonds they're blanched sliced ons and 1 cup of coconut it's sweetened shredded coconut this is great cuz it you can eat it right away but it also sits in the pantry really well and then for this one I'm gonna use dried cherries they're really good they're sweet and they're tart and they'd be great in this we need 1 and 1/2 cups just really roughly chopped just so they get distributed and for Nolan okay one and a half cups of dried cherries right into the granola it's a big batch what's the next thing is vegetable oil I need 1/2 a cup let's put right on top and 1/3 of a cup of honey and this is the secret to honey if you put the vegetable oil in the container first the honey I'll just pour right out look at that instead of sticking to the container perfect I know lots of really good Grand Central huh that doesn't smell like the holidays I don't know what does two teaspoons of ground cinnamon you don't want the stuff that's been sitting in your spice drawer for 10 years we want it to be really fresh okay just mix it all together and then I'm gonna bake it for a bit 20 to 30 minutes at 350 degrees you know it's just fabulous to have around the house because it's good Krauser it over ice cream or for a little snack with yogurt but for breakfast it's perfect [Music] they just spread it around that's gonna bake at 350 for about 20 to 30 minutes I'm gonna toss it in the middle make sure it Browns evenly until it's really crisp and golden and that's gonna be good for holiday breakfast very harassed muffins smell like they're done [Music] if it comes out clean they're done go put them on the top let them go [Music] gorgeous [Music] Oh fantastic [Music] I've got a little bit more green to put on the table and then I think we are finished so I thought the minute Joey and Moe walk in the door wouldn't it be nice to have a big steaming cup of hot chocolate I'm gonna do it with a twist I'm gonna do hot white chocolate with a little Grand Marnier it is the holidays after all so I pour in hot cups of milk 4 cups of half-and-half I'm gonna heat that up slowly you don't want it to get boiling and then I'm gonna chop up 1 pound of white chocolate this is really good white chocolate no like chocolate bars don't use chocolate chips they have stabilizers in them and won't B's luxuriously smooth I actually tried all different kinds of liqueurs in this thinking what would be the best I tried Frangelica which is hazelnut I tried a coffee liqueur but I really think Grand Marnier is the best complement to the white chocolate sort of vanilla and orange together okay that's all chopped up oh this is perfect you want the milk and the cream to be simmering which is little bubbles around the outside okay in goes all this gorgeous chocolate I think there's enough chocolate here I can smell the vanilla the chocolate and just stir it until it melts okay I have to add a few more flavors to this and then I'm going to pack everything up in a big basket and take it over for a great surprise for Joey and Moe I can't wait well it's gorgeous perfectly melted I'm gonna add some great flavor first thing is vanilla bean I'm just gonna take two vanilla beans and slice them up and these are really expensive but it's the holiday so it should be fabulous try and do it without cutting myself these are the seeds just because the holiday I'm going to do two of them I use it for vanilla custards anything that you wanted to have really intense vanilla flavor and also when you want it to look like vanilla that's how it's gonna do I'm gonna add two teaspoons of good vanilla extract this is not the place for artificial in anything and maybe a quarter to a third of a cup of Grand Marnier orange liqueur and the vanilla so good together [Music] okay that's nice and frothy and light I'm just gonna keep it warm and then I'm gonna put a thermos to bring over to their house in the meantime I'm having a big basket with all kinds of holiday goodies chocolate truffles with hazelnuts [Music] should let them all here [Music] cranberry harvest muffins cherry cinnamon granola the champagne is always a good gift little scheme might be nice and it's wintery white hot chocolate find that under their tree I just need to work these ribbons in a little more and I know it's a it looks bad Oh
