[Music] shrimp bisque I love it but every recipe I've seen is really complicated I decided to see if I can make a really simple version it's just delicious I bought fish stock and I've added the shrimp shells to it to give it even more flavor I'm going to strain the fish stock I need 3 and 3/4 cups so if I have a little less I'm just going to add some water yeah just a little water okay so first thing I've done here is sauteed 2 cups of leeks and 3 tablespoons of olive oil make sure the links are really really clean before you cook them okay I'm going to add some garlic about a tablespoon of garlic just saute it for about a minute actually love shrimp bisque and like that rich shrimp flavor and a little bit of sherry so the next thing I need is a little bit of cayenne pepper just a pinch not too much you don't want to overpower the shrimp and just cook that together ok and then a pound of shrimp is where the shells came from and just cook the shrimp for about three minutes until they're perfectly pink and just tender and the shrimp's cooked I'm going to add the rest of the ingredients and a really rich delicious shrimp it I can't make good shrimp bisque that sherry but I've actually decided little cognac would help it too so let me start with a quarter of a cup of cognac and pour it right into the shrimp and leek butter cook from it and that smells good and a quarter of a cup of dry sherry and all that's just going to really get into the shrimp and flavor the soup now that smells like shrimp bisque shrimp and sherry so classic look I'm going to puree this now I'm going to just put it right into the food processor and I'm just in puree until it's really chunky and I like it wanted to see [Music] okay that's perfect and now I'm going to make a white sauce that's going to be the base of the soup [Music] this white sauce is really the same kind of white sauce that makes for the lasagna I'm starting with half a stick of butter and a quarter of a cup of flour I'm going to cook it over medium low heat for about a minute just to cook the flour then I'm adding two cups of half-and-half please consider this as what happened half gets hot and it sickens with the flour so far it's been pretty easy okay the next I'm going to put in is a pureed shrimp and leeks really smells good smell the cognac and sherry that's not so much flavor the fish stock strain three-quarter cup third of a cup of tomato paste two teaspoons of salt and one teaspoon of pepper and that's it it's going to start up and just let this simmer all the flavors are going to go together it's going to be rich and delicious [Music]
