in Paris I take inspiration everywhere when I come to the boulevard rest by market I love to see these rotisserie chickens going around and all those gorgeous juices falling on the potatoes so that was fabulous and when I went home I thought wouldn't it be great to have bread cubes underneath and that's how roast chicken with croutons was born it's so delicious chicken with croutons work for a crown or simple lunch like today when my friend on ER shows up and I'm gonna stuff the inside with lemon just put them right inside it's kind of really good flavor salt pepper and into the pan great so I'm going to roast at 425 degrees for about an hour and 15 minutes until it's just perfectly done and then I'm going to saute bread croutons and when the chicken is roasted I'm going to slice it over the croutons so it just absorbs all that gorgeous chicken juice and the flavors so for the croutons I'm going to use a sourdough bread like this you can get them all over the country but it reminds me so much of those wonderful breads from Paul on bakery that I love in Paris this is Paul on it's probably the most famous bread shop in the world they famously huge loaves of sourdough bread and they are so delicious you can buy them in lots of places the United States you could also have them shipped overnight to your door wait to see the bread ovens downstairs they can put 48 of these incredible loaves in at one time nothing close checking to make the house smell good so I'm just gonna cover this with foil that that's all the juices back into the meat mix really moist about 15 minutes which is just enough time to make the croutons so croutons let's go slice the bread and big cubes I think half a loaf is enough for two people and I don't mind it with a crust on if you prefer it without the crust just cut it off but I love the earthy way it looks it's a great way to use up leftover bread just a little film of oil in the pan get it really hot and then just put all the bread cubes in you want them in one layer just saute them medium heat just keep turning them until they're nice and browned on all sides and then when I slice the chicken over the bread cubes on the platter all that gorgeous juice from the chicken and the lemon is gonna get into the cubes it's gonna be really good can really do this with any kind of bread like a baguette or sourdough bread or a big white bread just make sure it's really good bread good to see such a marinated that smells so good okay well it's a French inspired meal so I'm making roast chicken on a bed of croutons and it sounds like shell sounds a little liner twist on a French meal and for any string beans and it's with you in mind here come on okay I left a little glass of wine and some Tartine for you I'm gonna go get the chicken ready I sounds great yeah I'll be right back okay I just love onna I think she's inspired me more than anybody else I know but now I'd get lunch ready serious stuff so I'm just gonna cut this up put it right on top of the croutons and then all the juices from the chicken are going to get into the croutons you can smell all the lemon the chicken juices move for the breasts so I'm going to do is I'm going to cut it all off in one piece and then slice it and that way everybody gets a little bit of the neat and a little bit of the skin I'm just going to put the roasted lemons on the platter to and the beans i blanch for about three minutes and then i have the roasted vegetables put them right on top okay well that's it up I'm going to get the shallots in the bowl we're just around town on the lodge these are they're gonna be so good with the chicken everything's ready for lunch mama lunch is ready please place it right dad yes okay fabulous it'll be fine I hope this is just a beautiful who would like it Oh help yourself this looks so wonderful these little chicken pieces and croutons what a surprise and some caramelized shell oh they look so wonderful yourself I know you feel exactly the same way I do I can't go to Paris Oh that'd be inspired by something food the flowers just the warmth and the style the people and of course the Rhine cheers to powers
