[Music] I've had a very good friend since high school and I've known his daughter Phoebe since she was born Phoebe's in college now how did that happen so fast I've invited her and some of her school chums for brunch tomorrow the good news is making lots of things in advance so I can have fun at the party too first I'm making gravlax which is cured salmon I'm gonna slice it really thin serve it on brown bread with mustard sauce then delicious blueberry coffee cake muffins that I can mix in advance and bake off just before they arrive and a spectacular fruit platter and to drink feel good orange banana smoothies that will get them started for the day I imagine these girls live on peanut butter and crackers at school so it's going to be really nice for them to have a home-cooked meal first thing I'm going to make for my brunch is gravlax which is the sweetest specialty it's cured salmon and it's cured with sugar salt and fresh dill lots of it it's a great thing for entertaining because I can make it really far in advance and it requires no cooking at all my particular favorite so I've got about three pounds of fresh salmon you know generally for brunch very often serve smoked salmon and I thought well why not serve gravlax which is a cured salmon so instead of smoking it to cook it it actually sits in the sugar and the salt and it actually cures it so it's just wonderful it's so delicious so first I need one piece of salmon and now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna cover it with lots of fresh dill so this is all washed just shake it out make sure it's dry and just put it right on top how's that for easy so the next thing I needs 1/2 a cup of sugar I know it sounds like an enormous amount of sugar but it really needs it to cure and you have 2 cup of kosher salt I really would use kosher salt for this really has sort of a softer flavor and since you're using so much what's gonna happen is this is gonna sit in the refrigerator or night and it just marinates in its juices and its really gonna just cure it which is wonderful take 2 tablespoons of white peppercorns white peppercorns are sort of slightly less ripe and black peppercorns and they're a little milder so they're really good and one tablespoon of fennel seed it's the whole fennel seed but I'm just gonna crush them up so you really release the flavour of them this is actually called a mortar and pestle and it's great for sort of cracking pepper and grinding things up but if you don't have one you can always use one of those little coffee grinders I save one just for spices you don't want to find taste or fine grind you just want to sort of crack pepper it really flavors the salmon and you get a little bit of a workout at the same time when I first thought Barefoot Contessa from Cayenne Estrada who's still my friend came with a wonderful collection of recipes and this is one of them gravlax with a mustard sauce and lots of fresh dill okay this is good I just want to crack so it really releases the oils mmm can really smell the fennel and pepper so the next thing I want to do is take the other piece of salmon and put it right over the top just like that you know just gonna cover it with foil and now here's the fun part I'm gonna wait it and that's gonna bring some of the juices out of the salmon not easy to do see if I can balance all of this perfect so I'm gonna leave it for about 12 hours to flip it over and it's gonna be ready in 24 hours but the good news is the longer you let it sit the better if I can get it this in the fridge [Music] from French tomorrow I thought Phoebe and her friends would enjoy smoothies so I'm gonna make an orange banana smoothie the good news I can make it in advance so I need one and a half cups of fresh orange juice I mean you can certainly buy it squeezed but it's always so much better when you make it yourself they're really a million ways to make smoothies but I like putting different combinations together and I think classic is orange and banana that's just one and a half cups perfect and to the blender and then the next thing is I'm gonna put in either one or one and a half bananas the more banana you put in the thicker it gets it's really about balancing the flavor so it tastes really good but one flavor doesn't predominate and then some strawberries got a cup really don't have to chop them up just cut them in half they're gonna get pureed you can use anything you can find in the refrigerator that would go good with this blueberries raspberries so I bet a cup of strawberries okay and then because I don't want it too sweet I'm gonna add a little bit of lime juice to it so I'm just living one the juice of one lime [Music] just as it's about the depth of flavor of use just it really makes a difference okay juice of one lime perfect and since I'm serving them tomorrow I'm just gonna put them in a container the banana keeps it from separating it's gonna be so good for brunch tomorrow next I'm gonna make blueberry coffee cake muffins I love them [Music] last thing I want to do is get up at five o'clock in the morning to make blueberry coffee cake muffins so I'm gonna make the batter tonight and then tomorrow just scoop them out and bake them I need one and a half sticks of butter this makes a lot of muffins makes about 16 according to half cups of sugar and just beat that until it's light and fluffy I need three extra-large eggs okay I'm gonna add the eggs one at a time okay that's some great flavors one and a half teaspoons of good vanilla extract love the way it smells eight ounces of sour cream this is what makes the muffins really moist and a quarter of a cup of milk okay that's the wet ingredients now for the dry ones I need two and a half cups of flour it is unbleached flour but any all-purpose flour is just fine perfect I need two teaspoons of baking powder 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda this mixture has the acidity of the sour cream so it's good to have baking powder and baking soda and half a teaspoon of salt [Music] I'm just sift it together try and get it in the bowl and I'm on the counter like I did and then a very low speed just mix the dry ingredients into the wet ones particularly with muffins you don't want to over beat it otherwise they end up being very dense so I'm just going to mix it in just until it's combined okay it's gonna give it one turn with the spatula I think with a mixer you always want to be sure that the bottom is really well mixed I saw and just turn the bottom make sure it's really well combined but not over next and I'm just going to have lots of blueberries two kinds of blueberries just fold them in we're gonna refrigerate the batter overnight in the morning all I have to do is scoop the muffins into the pans and bake them off and I've got three gorgeous smart girls coming for brunch we can have a really good time I've done everything I need to do today I'm gonna pack it in for the night [Music] four years of African test I used to make these gorgeous fruit platters and I started making them at home too they're wonderful for parties you can do them in advance and they're just delicious the most important thing is make sure you're really good fruit so for example like with Kiwis you want to make sure they are soft and they smell wonderful when you pick them up at the grocery store that they smell like Kiwis Kiwis I like to slice cuz I love to see the black seeds and they're incredibly good for you too next thing I have is a pineapple and looks like an ordinary pineapple but but it's actually a golden pineapple which is really fabulous they're so sweet you can find them in any produce store around the country so when to cut off the top I don't really like to you is that it's decoration on the platter it's not so pretty just cut it in half go this one's perfect something save that for another time just cut it right down the middle and the core of its delicious but it's really kind of hard so I'm gonna cut it out save it for the cook and then the small knife just run it right around the the rind of the pineapple let's take the whole piece out you know I just like to slice it right across you look really pretty fanned out on the platter smells so good and you can really tell when it's ripe because it really smells like pineapple okay now I'm just gonna take the core out again stand it up and then slice this to really is a Becca line of the store and seeing what's ripe and what's in season and what's delicious at all times that you can always find things that are just wonderful I don't even go with an idea of exactly what I want I go knowing I want fruit and I'll find the most flavorful the things that smell the most fragrant I usually like from melons I like a Galia melon which is it a green melon from Israel or Kevin or melon which is orange from France but this cantaloupe was the most fragrant I found so that's what I got so I'm just gonna do the same thing when I cut this cut the rind off I just want to take all the green off it's really not very pretty just need to scoop the seeds at this melon smells so ripe it's wonderful and it was nice I sit all the way across big big slices and that'll be beautiful on the platter okay the Nexus mango I'm gonna cut it on its side and just cut the edge off you have to cut right around the seed you know this this one's gorgeous and then I'm gonna peel it I think I'll do it in like big wedges okay just a few more things to do and the some of the fruit platter put the muffins in the oven and slice their gravlax I can't wait to see Phoebe this is going to be really fun [Music] so I'm going to start building this platter I really rely on that old Japanese design principle which is sky earth and water so there's something tall something solid in the middle and something flowing forward it's amazing it works every time something solid that comes up grapes well I think I put the strawberries here around the edges are flowing forward like the water and the berries blueberries okay the last thing is lemon leaves okay I'm just gonna put this in the fridge and get on with the rest of brunch so I'm gonna bake off the blueberry sour cream coffee cake muffins one of the tricks I learned at Barefoot Contessa is if I just greased the top of the muffin pans they don't stick to the top no point in making muffins if you can't get them out of the pans this batter will make about 16 big muffins okay that should do it and then I used white paper muffin cups I just think they're a little more elegant than the colored ones anything that ensures you can get the muffins out of the pans okay the next trick is ice cream scoop nice big ice to discover rounded one makes the perfect sized muffin there's gonna be more than enough for brunch but I'm gonna give the girls leftovers to take back to school I always have the feeling they live on mac and cheese so it'll be nice to have good muffins sixteen exactly I'm good okay until the oven 350 degrees for 25 to 30 minutes and we're gonna have fresh blueberry sour cream coffee cake muffins [Music] [Applause] let's see how this looks now no it's beautiful it's beautifully cured you can see all the flavouring on top I'm actually gonna scrape some of this off some of the seeds perfect okay now I want to show you what I'm really good at slicing salmon when I first bought Barefoot Contessa it was the toughest thing that dan Estrada had to show me he's had a slice salmon but I've really learned how to do it since then I can't imagine how many thousands the sides of smoked salmon I've sliced and slicing gravlax is pretty much the same thing so this is a smoked salmon knife if you have a small flexible knife like that it makes it so much easier I start back here and in the beginning I couldn't do a whole slice so I do one side first and then the other side and that's okay too so I'm just gonna line it up here and then I'll arrange it on the platter so you want to slice it so it's really sort of translucent and it just takes time to figure it out but a little practice and you can do it so now I'm gonna do one big slice just do it really slowly and just the key is to let the blade work it's not about pushing it it's just about letting a nice sharp blade do its job I'm just do it very casually on the plate it really looks like smoked salmon but it's got the wonderful cured flavor of fennel and peppercorns a little bit of dill we're gonna make mustard sauce I'm almost ready for the party [Music] Scandinavians traditionally served mustard sauce with gravlax I'll show you how quick it is so I need quarter of a cup of mustard Dijon mustard I'm just gonna whisk it all together in the bowl and to give the mustard even more flavor I'm going to use dry mustard one teaspoon three tablespoons of sugar remember the gravlax was marinated in sugar and salt so it's sort of sweet and salty at the same time two tablespoons of white wine vinegar so it's sweet and vinegary the third of a cup of olive oil and so what I'm going to do is whisk these ingredients together and then slowly pour the olive oil in then I'm gonna add some lots of fresh dill just pour it in slowly so it gets incorporated it's creamy as with mayonnaise the egg yolks emulsify the oil but this sauce the mustard doesn't okay I'm gonna chop up lots of fresh dill this is really the time to use fresh dill since it's such an important flavor I need about three tablespoons okay right into the sauce just whisk it in oh this looks really good mmm really taste all the mustard from dill little vinegar it's gonna be wonderful I'm gonna let everybody make their own little sandwiches with brown bread Sam and this gorgeous mustard sauce I think it's a really fun who needs a centerpiece when you have a platter fresh fruit I'm so glad you're here totally at home so just dig in help yourself with fruit its fingers and there's salmon can I help you - salmon so the grog bucks is its raw salmon and then it's covered with salt and sugar most mostly sauce a little bit of sugar and lots of dill then you put the other piece on top and you weight it and then it goes into the refrigerator it like cooks in the refrigerator actually cures and they refrigerate it so do you like to cook I love to gluten that's kind of hard yeah oh yeah that's right I did know that I forgot and everybody want to come over right yeah so I think I want to send you back with to college with all the muffins what do you think I can go back to college you can say forever I'm answering to you but you can stay forever yeah sorry too much fun [Music]
