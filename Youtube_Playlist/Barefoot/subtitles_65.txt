you I'm going to the movies with friends tonight we're coming home for dinner afterwards I'm not about to start cooking that so I'm gonna have everything done in the fridge and all I have to do is heat it up when we get home penny with five cheese's is one of my favorite things to make for a party it actually comes from friends of mine who own a fabulous restaurant in Providence Rhode Island called Al Forno you won't believe how easy it is to make so the first thing I'm going to do is grate some fontina for dinner tonight we're going to start with an antipasto and then have a salad with balsamic onions and this pinning with five cheese's it's so delicious and it's really easy okay that's the grated fontina so I'm going to make the sauce now let's start with two cups of cream a cup of tomatoes that are actually crushed in tomato juice and then we're going to add all kinds of cheeses cap a cup of pecorino which is like Parmesan but it's really stronger and has lots of flavor half a cup of the fontina which I graded and this is the good stuff this is gorgonzola it's Mountain gorgonzola and it's got lots of flavor and it's creamy and it's gonna really be good in the pasta this a wonderful dish because it's really a great way to use up leftovers if you have chicken just put it in if you have salmon leftover just chuck it in and it all tastes wonderful together two tablespoons of ricotta and a little bit of fresh mozzarella maybe about a quarter of a pound this is good homemade mozzarella you can use buffalo mozzarella which is really soft and delicious just be sure it's good mozzarella this is looking good and fresh basil leaves this just gives it a really good flavor and sort of add something fresh to it which I love so that's everything for the sauce and now I'm just going to add the pasta I've cooked a pound of penne Rigate penne Rigate actually got it's this shape and its got ridges on it really holds the sauce well I cooked it for about four minutes which is not long enough to cook it it's very al dente but it's gonna cook more when I bake the pasta just gonna dump this whole thing in toss it all together this actually doesn't even require salt or pepper because the pasta is really well salted in the water that I boiled it in and the cheese is like the Romano and the gorgonzola they have a lot of salt in them so I'm going to fill these dishes individual gratin dishes for the pasta and then each person will get their own serving of pasta and when it's baked this way I just find that it's really creamy inside and crusty and browned on the top it's a great combination then we're just gonna take a little bit of butter and dot it on the top so the Tuck gets really nicely browned that's it this is gonna go in a really hot oven 500 degrees for about 7 to 10 minutes and it's gonna be brown and crusty on the top and just delicious roasted some cashews just for about 10 minutes until they get a little crisp great but you can't make rosemary caches without rosemary every year I plant rosemary it's a really stronger but sometimes it's just the right note for rosemary roasted potatoes or as marinate the lamb it's perfect and in the winter when I want to save the flavor a stupid Nala Voyles so I have the rosemary olive oil all winter but for now rosemary cashews love the way it smells this recipe actually originally came from Union Square cafe it's their bar nuts they do it with mixed nuts but I love to do it just with cashews but you can do it any way Mike so I'm going to make this mixture with lots of fresh rosemary and then I want to put the hot cashews into it and it will absorb all that fabulous flavor okay so two tablespoons of fresh rosemary chopped up then I'm gonna make it a little sweeter by having two teaspoons of brown sugar tablespoon of kosher salt and 1/2 a teaspoon of cayenne pepper to give it real spice the last ingredient is tablespoon of melted butter just toss this all together and then we're gonna add the hot nuts and it's gonna be sorb all the flavor it's me so good we're gonna have these with a really old-fashioned cocktail called sidecars its klein yak Cointreau and lemon juice how bad can that be okay then hi cashews that a pound and a quarter of hot roasted cashews I'm just gonna mix these together until the cashes absorb all that flavor little brown sugar salt cayenne pepper mmm and we have rosemary roasted cashews penny with five cheese's smells like it's ready and it is that's great she's gonna let it cool a little bit and then I'm gonna heat it up after the movies yeah I'm going to the movies with some friends tonight and I've invited them home for dinner afterwards so I want everything done in advance for dessert I'm making stewed fruit with ice cream I'm gonna cook the fruit now and then I'm gonna heat it up a little bit later and serve it over ice cream be really good so the first thing in my stewed fruit is pineapple but it's not just any pineapple it's something called golden pineapple and you really find it in the grocery store now and it's so much sweeter you can just smell it's really sweet and juicy oops just like that and into the saucepan a slippery I'm going to take two half pints of blueberries and put them in and two half pints of raspberries so far so good one and a half cups of sugar it's going to make a little syrup so that the juices and the fruit and the sugar all mixed together and 3/4 of a cup of water I'm going to bring it all up to a simmer over medium heat and then cook it for about five to seven minutes and to all the fruit gets really tender and the juices all combined it's going to be really good with ice cream and while that's cooking I'm gonna get the table ready having a dinner party I was trying to create a really intimate setting so people can really connect with each other I mean these are my friends I really want to spend time with them so I do lots of things to make that happen the first one is and I've talked about this a lot that having a really small table so everybody sort of elbow-to-elbow I think it creates a better dinner party the next thing I love to do is serve family style and I'm gonna do a huge end of pasta right in this plate in the middle of the table everybody counts themselves they can help each other it really makes a shared experience for everybody I love that feeling last thing I love to do is serve dinner in the kitchen there's something about the pasta coming out of the oven and the berries being warmed and it's all part of the experience I never have to leave the party and I think it really keeps it as a cohesive whole makes a much better party and everything's ready for dinner after the movies wine for dinner parties perfectly lovely but kind of boring I think anything in a martini glass makes a party so I'm gonna make an old-fashioned drink sidecars and serve them in martini glasses so the first thing I want to do is make a rim with lemon juice and sugar and it'll be really delicious for the drink so I'm gonna put lemon juice in the first dish and sugar in the second just plain grandma and sugar I'm take both glasses dip it in lemon juice and then dip it in sugar that makes a great rim I just think it makes the drinks with a little more festive okay now I'm going to make the drinks so the first thing I need is cup of cognac a whole cup of Chania that feels like a party already half a cup of triple sec a quarter cup of fresh lemon juice so that's sidecars that's the whole thing I'm just gonna shake it up with some ice and I think I might have to try one myself port of the shaker check it out let's try this guy we can't have an old-fashioned sidecar without maraschino cherry right right Cheers that's gonna be a good party there are only two more things to do for the stood for first one is another half pint of raspberries really to give a great texture I'm going to turn off the heat for this and to give it real punch two tablespoons of friend Waze which is raspberry brandy mmm that's gonna be good so I'm just gonna chill this and later we're gonna reheat it and serve it warm over ice cream and they all melt together it's just delicious in the meantime I'm going to my favorite Italian store to buy ingredients from I into pasta hi Bryan oh shit good I want everything so I'm doing it on defrost oh I need some salon is what do you recommend sopressata however sopressata that's great and maybe a hard salami how about the supper sided slice really thin the hard salami slice thick okay let's do something sweet right yeah that'd be great that's gonna be really good great perfect I saw some gorgeous looking artichokes there I think I'll have to have Monsanto pasta I love the ones who stands about how many doing um maybe about six or seven I'd love some roasted peppers I've got since ice container yeah that'd be great I'm gonna do them with basil and I think I'm gonna serve them with your focaccia they were great they've rosemary yeah we bake them every day I was wonderful anything else and olives what are these black ones those are the guy Etta's Hey look I love a taste okay sure thanks there's so many thank you oh so delicious they're the Grateful flavor and not too salty that's what I'd like okay when you go to a store the only way to know whether you're gonna like the ingredient is taste it people really expect it so this Taleggio looks delicious can I have a little taste sure that's great Colette has a soft ripening cheese so it's good idea to know exactly where it is in that stage here you go oh thank you that's a big taste perfect wonderful I'll take a piece okay okay I think that's it okay thank you so much you see you again soon great day bye friend bye bye so for my peppers with basil these are the peppers that I got at the Italian store but you can also buy them in the grocery store these have pesto in them but even plain ones are just fine and then to give them lots of flavor and add two tablespoons of olive oil tablespoon of balsamic vinegar just like making a vinaigrette capers to give them a little spiciness salt and pepper kind of have salt and pepper stir that up and the last thing is lots of fresh basil I love the flavor of base on it give a really nice fresh flavor to this just gonna stack them all up roll them up do a nice julienne and that's it it's gonna let the sit at room temperature and it's gonna be delicious with the antipasto so with penne and five cheese's how that'll be delicious to have a salad with balsamic onions so I've got lots of red onions I think red onions work for this really well because they're sort of sweeter than yellow onions lots of flavor and I'm gonna roast them so all the busts on like vinegar really gets into the onions it's really good I'm going to combine a quarter of a cup of olive oil quarter of a cup of balsamic vinegar and just pour it right over the onions salt and pepper and then clean hands toss it all together I'm gonna roast these at 375 for about 15 minutes and then splash them when they're hot with a little more balsamic vinegar and when they're cool like a nice red leaf salad with vinaigrette and they're going to be really good my friends are coming for dinner after the movies and I want to be sure everything is done before I go then make a red leaf lettuce salad with balsamic onions and it's gonna be great with a penne with five cheese's so imma show you how to make a vinaigrette I've got two chopped shallots two teaspoons of Dijon mustard quarter of a cup of red wine vinegar salt and pepper so those are really all the flavorings at the bottom of the bowl and then I'm going to add 3/4 of a cup of olive oil and just whisk these together and then add the oil slowly sort of I can if you man is the Dijon mustard will mull safai the olive oil so it'll all stay together that's perfect the trick to making a salad in advance is I'm gonna put the vinaigrette on the bottom of the bowl I'm going to take all the lettuce and just put it on top do these gorgeous balsamic onions on top of that vinegar and the onions is really great great together I'm just gonna leave it exactly like that and then just before I serve it I'm going to toss it all together and should be delicious with a pasta so into the fridge until dinner so the last thing to do for my party is assemble the antipasto and this is really about pulling together your favorite two telling ingredients it can be anything you like so I want to do fresh mozzarella the kids are doing a beautiful platter has have big blocks of color the tomatoes are red that mozzarella is white really interesting colors drizzle the mozzarella with some olive oil a little cracked pepper okay the next thing is focaccia miss an Italian bread I'm just going to put it right here facing panel so the next is the roasted peppers that I made with basil and gorgeous capers and people can help themselves with the focaccia so good what's next okay I have salami x' which are really gorgeous I'm going to do julienne pieces of Genoa right there next to the mozzarella some olives have nice big green Sicilian olives with some black olives and I have some nice spicy salami with lots of pepper roll it up and put it in between this looks really good and then because every platter really needs something green it really sets it apart I'm gonna have a big bunch of basil leaves just tear them off and put them right in the middle and it's done brave enough to pass doc patter into the fridge so I've got everything in the fridge for dinner sidecars drinks onto pasta the pasta with five cheese's salad with balsamic vinaigrette and for dessert stewed fruit with ice cream it's in the fridge and I'm going the movies
