[Music] my husband Jeffrey worked really far from East Hampton and when he comes home on Friday night I like everything to be really special I usually make him roast chicken but tonight I'm gonna surprise him with a tex-mex dinner and has tequila lime chicken it's really good but hey it's still chicken I feel really strongly about guacamole I know you don't hear that a lot but I just think usually it's a puree of avocados that doesn't have a lot of flavor and I just think it's got to have lots of flavor and be really chunky this is how you take the pit out of the avocado just like that plunk well if guacamole to start then the chicken some corn pudding and a delicious key lime pie for dessert these are perfectly ripe I want them so that they're bright green and they're ripe enough so they come out of the show really easily if they're too ripe you'll find they're really Brown these are just perfect it's a green around the outside and yellow in the middle he's gonna be so good when Jeffrey gets home with chips and margaritas while the tequila lime chicken cooks gotta have something special when he walks in the door okay one more half see when they're ripe it comes out really easily it's beautiful okay now with a season know people ask me all the time what's the best way to keep the guacamole green and there's really one key ingredient lemon juice they're all these theories about having the seed in it forget it it's really about fresh lemon juice and it's got to be freshly squeezed lemon juice okay got that and then all kinds of delicious things to season it with hot sauce I like when it's really spicy you can decide how hot you want yours I like garlic in it so chopped garlic red onions it's gonna be so good lots of salt and freshly ground peper and this is the secret to really good guacamole I don't puree it all I do is cut into it just like this so it's a really chunky it mixes the ingredients together and it stays really chunky this way just run your knife through the avocados okay just mix it up and make sure the flavors are well good and the last thing is tomato so I've chopped tomatoes I take the seeds out I put the tomatoes in last cuz I don't want it to color the guacamole just toss it lightly I'm sure it needs more salt we want to cook the right balance of avocado lemon juice salt and pepper little salt that's pretty good I think Jeffrey's gonna love it with corn chips yellow corn chips blue corn chips or you can even get red corn chips how crazy is that that's gonna be really good I'm going shopping I just need a few more ingredients I need some tequila for my Tex Mex barbecue but who knew there were so many kinds all right Tom I need your help okay well so I know I'm gonna get this for the tequila lime chicken oh so I wish you well what I'm gonna get for margaritas this house is an excellent choice for motor Easter why don't I start with that how's that okay thank you so much oh that's just great and now I need a jalapeno pepper for my tequila lime chicken this is what gives my chicken attitude when I think of tex-mex I always think of lime so I thought wouldn't it be fun to make Jeffrey's favorite frozen key lime pie for dessert so say how easy it is and we have to start with a graham cracker crust that's the fun part and I'm just gonna puree them in the food processor [Music] that's it so it's about nine or ten graham crackers depending on how many are in the package sort of a cup of sugar and 3/4 of a stick of butter I know it's more butter but it's really good all you have to do is mix the butter and the sugar and the graham crackers and then press it into the pan no key limes are those tiny little limes that you can find in Florida but they're so hard to find anywhere else that I just make this with regular limes it's really good so this goes into the pie pan 9-inch pie pan press it in no rolling pins even the kids can do this oh just a form it like this lightly maybe nice little edge I'll show you a little trick about how to make the corners really crisp is take the measuring cup and just run it along the edge [Music] how easy is that 350 degrees for ten minutes and it would be ready for the filling I think one of the hardest things about entertaining is trying to figure out a menu I just try and balance flavors against each other so I thought with the spiciness of the tequila lime chicken be really nice to have creamy Sagaponack corn pudding so what I've done is saute about five cups of corn kernels I just cut them off the cob with a cup of onions I'm gonna cook this for about four minutes until the starchiness and the corn has gone and now I'm gonna make the custard for the pudding it's really a traditional custard with eggs and milk or a little cream and some lots of added flavor for eggs I have a cup of half-and-half and a cup of milk gonna whisk this all together in a second to give it lots of corn flavor half a cup of stone-ground yellow cornmeal I'm gonna whisk that all together this recipe is actually inspired by a corn pudding that a friend of mine on a pump makes at her store loaves &amp; Fishes which is in Sagaponack has similar ingredients and lots of flavor I'm gonna add a cup of ricotta which gives it really good body tablespoon of sugar just to give it a little sweetness tablespoon of salt so it tastes good three-quarters of a tablespoon of freshly ground pepper and then the two West ingredients are cheddar and basil I'm gonna grate some cheddar this is really important to have really good cheddar pick something that's that's a sharp on it or extra sharp something like that half of this is going to go in the pudding and half of its gonna go on the top to make sure it gets nice and brown so good okay and the last things fresh basil love corn and basil together so I'm just gonna take some basil and just chop it up really roughly it doesn't have to be perfect okay that's it right in and I'm just gonna whisk this whole thing together so this is the pudding and I'm just gonna add the sauteed corn and onion this will be thick and delicious so you want this to have cooled a little bit so it doesn't cook the eggs immediately so that's just the way it is and that's it into the dish a sprinkling of cheese to make sure it gets nice and brown into the oven 375 for 40 to 45 minutes in the water bath so it bakes evenly [Music] and it's gonna come out all puffed and golden brown yeah [Music] so next to the key lime pie this is my kind of cooking no cooking at all I've whipped six egg yolks in the mixer with about a quarter of a cup of sugar and now I'm going to add sweetened condensed milk this is a really traditional recipe but I think this has more flavor than most yeah and a fish that lid out so I'm going to pour it in on low speed just so it mixes in make sure you get it all I even got it on the mixer that's nice the next thing is lime zest I always use lime juice but I think the zest has more flavor than the juice so I make sure that I get a lot in this is my handy dandy rasp I love it so that's about two tablespoons of lime zest just goes right in and the last ingredient is freshly squeezed lime juice it's about 3/4 of a cup oh this looks so great you can see all the zest and the filling and that's it I'm just gonna pour it into my big pie shell remember I bake the graham cracker crust for about 10 minutes so it's just a little firm make sure it's really well mixed into the freezer I'll decorate it later with whipped cream oh just the time hi sweetie you're early I got the keyline pipe then just in time I spent many years making welcome Oh spectacular I'm so glad you like it so I think the grills ready okay I get the chicken okay tequila lime chicken it's like Geoffrey's favorite Friday night roast chicken but with the volume turned up what I'm doing is I'm gonna make a marinade for the boneless chicken breasts and it's gonna make them taste so fabulous so the first thing is 1/2 a cup of tequila always helps and the next is freshly squeezed lime it's really important none of that bottled stuff you really do need freshly squeezed lime juice it makes all the difference in the world so 1 cup of freshly squeezed lime juice that actually also tenderizes the chicken half a cup of orange juice to give it a little sweetness chili powder to give it heat 1 tablespoon if you want more heat you can use more chili powder that's also good tablespoon of chopped garlic give it spice and this is the key ingredient jalapeno pepper it's really hot I'm going to show you how this works so slice right in the middle and what's really hot is the seeds so I'm just going to take the seeds out and while you're working on this pepper be sure that you don't touch anything you really care about before you wash your hands because it's incredibly hot don't rub your eye what I'm gonna do is just chop this finely I like the tequila lime chicken to have a little bit of heat but I don't want to have third-degree burns when we're done so that goes right in would be so good two teaspoons of salt teaspoon of ground black pepper and then the license chicken so I've got six boneless chicken breasts I actually like them to the skin on us think they stay moister so I asked the butcher to take the bone off but leave the skin on and I'm just gonna put them in the marinade the great thing about this is not only is it good to leave it overnight but it's actually the more it sits in the marinade the better it tastes so it's a wonderful thing to do for entertaining so that's tequila lime chicken it's gonna be so good on the grill [Music] hey there goes I just want to decorate my Cuban palette so I think with whipped cream and lies it's gonna be wonderful about a cup of heavy cream wearing part of it quarter of a cup of sugar and some vanilla while that's going I'm just gonna slice up some lines I just think it's really important for something to be decorated with a flavor that it is so when you look at it you know exactly that it's lime you want it so it's really firm but not but it hasn't turned into butter yet so that's perfect and sometimes we're not feeling up to it I'll piped in a decorative way but I think now it's gonna be really casual Americans right in the middle just so you can see the frozen key lime pie around the edges but you have the whipped cream in the middle just like that it's easy it's earthy and then with some fresh lime and that's it doesn't that look great and it can sit in the freezer for a really long time but we're gonna have it tonight and then we're better go see what Geoffrey's up to with a barbecue so don't have to call the fire department fire department look at this is a great this is a will a few extra matches there's a whole box in that world all right I'm gonna go finish dinner okay and I leave you here on your own [Music] okay that's your one and only grill let me do that okay just over the top of my girl you're doing a great job okay one chicken going on you want to do the next one make sure okay okay have him keep it keep his brother comfort okay wanna get the salt and pepper yeah okay and a little bit on top on top a little more are you you think you're cooking over here are you doing now you promised me this is gonna be as good as my roast chicken I don't know I think it might be better all right so I'm gonna go set the table are you in charge of the chicken I'm in charge the chicken what do I do I turn it over every once in a while no wait until it's cooked on one side for about 10 minutes and then you turn it over so I wait ten minutes yeah okay okay even though it's dinner just for Jeffrey and me I wanted to be really special or make sure he always wants to come home on Friday night I always look for something in the meal that inspires me for the table and since it's tex-mex I thought limes why not margaritas tequila lime chicken so a big ball of limes is the beginning and I thought tex-mex hot colors I thought orange these are gerber daisies they're great and of course the lime green of the clock really picks up the the center's and the stems and the limes so that's good Sagaponack corn pudding it's gonna be so good with the tequila lime chicken very pleased and very surprised and my virtuosity here looks great good for you I hope that's not the high point it's acute of lime chicken on one little line line I'll have some of that point putting a little Sagaponack corn pudding maybe a little so some watercress to go on your plate it's a little spice you'll never be too spicy corn putting it back is it good oh good is it is the corn a little crunchy like I like it it's crunchy and what else is in here well has basil and cheddar in it there's a little punch all of this that's good so what do you think of the chicken chicken is sensational well good news to our combined effort ready for key lime pie sweetie I sure AM great keeping with the tex-mex theme I will have had lots of lime right well I'll tell you what I'm not tired of it yet no good this is good just wonderful really superb good how many have you been making probably 35 well I have to tell you this is the best one yeah thank you sweetie [Music]
