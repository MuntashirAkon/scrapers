so the first thing I want to make my working lunch it's chocolate cupcakes with peanut butter frosting so I need one and a half sticks is 12 tablespoons of unsalted butter at room temperature and then I use two kinds of sugar brown sugar because it has a little bit of a molasses flavor I need 2/3 of a cup like that and I hope to use granulated sugar because it makes it lighter and a cream moves together okay two eggs extra large eggs and you want them at room temperature that way they mix in that just until they gets completely incorporated two teaspoons of vanilla okay now for some wet ingredients I need a cup of buttermilk actually I would like to shake it a little because sometimes separates this is really good for baking it's actually low-fat there I say it's half a cup of sour cream it actually makes the batter really thick and keeps the cake very moist and two tablespoons of coffee you don't really notice the coffee share but it really makes the chocolate taste delicious just stir that together going to combine this until smooth okay after the dry ingredients once recorded cups of flour I use unbleached all-purpose flour one cup of cocoa powder this is what gives it all that chocolate flavor and now you see why I sift everything because the cocoa powder has lumps in it one and a half teaspoons of baking soda and half a teaspoon of salt myself is really surprisingly important when you're baking really brings out the coffee and the chocolate and the peanut butter flavor okay just sift those all together I'm mostly going to add the dry ingredients now for some wet ingredients smells amazing really chocolatey and then just finish it up with a spatula to make sure it's really well mixed okay into the muffin cups okay into the oven 350 degrees for 20 to 25 minutes and then I'm going to work on the icing mmm so I need one cup of confectioner's sugar one cup of peanut butter smooth or creamy okay five tablespoons of unsalted butter at room temperature it's really important so it blends in really well it's going to start mixing that on low speed so you don't have confectioner sugar everywhere three-quarters of a teaspoon of good vanilla extract and lashing is 1/3 of a cup of cream to make it nice and creamy just want to mix it I don't want to with it because I want to do like a fluffy ones have great flavor okay that's it that's the frosting and the last one [Music] and then when I sprinkle it with chopped peanuts because make it even better it's actually wonderful because it gives it texture but you also know that it's subpoena from the peanuts on time
