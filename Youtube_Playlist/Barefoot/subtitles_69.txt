I've got the Apple they look gorgeous in the farm and now we're just going to make minecraft I don't know why but I think people find pie crust more daunting than anything else that we make I'm going to show you the secret of really good pie crust and it's about very cold ingredients I'm going to start with three cups of flour just regular all-purpose flour sugar 1 teaspoon song a song for the shortening so all kinds of debate that will kind of shortened into use for pie crust but I actually combine vegetable shortening and I do it very cold to consider the refrigerator and butter and then you get all of the flakiness of a vegetable shortening and all the flavor of the butter the third of a cup of vegetable shortening I have one and a half sticks of cold butter that I've diced and I actually put it back in the refrigerator until I was ready so it's really cold put that right in and that comes the critical part what you want in the dough is little bits of butter and shortening through the dough you don't want to totally pureed and that's what makes it so a key when the heat from the oven hits the butter it causes steam to evaporate and that's what makes it really flaky so when you're doing this make sure it's not totally pureed in the flash I'm just going to pulse this about 8 times until it's like the size of peas maybe 10 times so you can still see bits of butter and shortening in the flour and that's what's going to make really flaky pastry I'm going to do maybe one more second ok so the next thing is ice water and I needed that a table to win such as about 1/2 a cup for as the ice so I'm going to turn this on and just let it go right until it forms a ball okay we're there so now we're going to refrigerate it for about 30 minutes it's a really important part of making good pie pastry okay now for the filling teach - apple pie four pounds of apples cut up in big chunks and I'm going to flavor it with a little bit of orange zest and lemon zest one tablespoon of orange juice and two tablespoons of lemon juice this not only flavors it but it keeps the applicant going Brown 1/2 a cup of sugar it all depends on how sweet the apples are these are pretty tart quarter cup flour and teaspoon of salt okay now for the spices three careers of the teas for the good cinnamon 1/2 a teaspoon of good nutmeg love the way it smells smells like apple pie spices already okay eighth of a teaspoon of allspice just really a pinch then just gonna mix it all up and then right into the crust it's a lot of apples for this tigress but I like it when it's piled high mile-high apple pie okay now for the top crust thirty Philip I roll it up on the rolling pin and lit really gently over this there's so many different ways to crimp a pie I think everybody wants to do with the way their mother did it but what I like to do is just roll the top crust underneath the bottom one I want to make this a really old-fashioned looking okay once that's done you can either to crimp it with a fork crimping is about keeping the two crests together so it seals in the juices or you can do it with your fingers I think I'll do it with my fingers okay crimped now I'm going to do an egg wash going to make the crust really nice and brown which is one egg beaten with about a tablespoon of water or milk or whatever you have just brush the whole top okay a little bit of sugar make it nice and shiny and then just a few holes in the top to let the steam escape so the crust is sentient this sort of old-fashioned okay into the oven 400 degrees for about an hour an hour and 15 minutes now that's an apple pie my favorite part is at least the house smells fabulous
