[Music] I love to entertain every once in a while I have to say this day is for me a little exercise lots of pampering and some really healthy food this is good for me day [Music] I'm being really good to myself today I'm having a really healthy day so instead of having the usual bagel and cream cheese I'm going to make a tropical smoothie first thing I'm going to take this half of papaya and it's perfectly ripe so it's going to be wonderful to take these little seeds out and then I'll kill it and just check the whole thing into the blender so the most important thing for this is that the fruit is really ripe and it's just delicious you put flavorless fruit in you're just going to get a flavor with smoothie out it's that simple I'm going to cut it in big chunks and into the bladder that smells so good and I'm going to put 1/2 a mango in mango has a huge stone in the middle so if you want to just cut the edges off and one banana actually a banana is really important because it makes the smoothie really thick delicious some skim milk no fat some fresh orange juice and as long as I'm doing it to nonfat yogurt and a little bit of water and some ice to make it thick and maybe a little honey to make it sweet but just a little bit perfect [Applause] that looks delicious all the nutrition I need for my walk so good something having a really healthy day good food what's your favorite healthy food so it's even more oh that's what I'm doing actually that's great this movie to start with yeah that was the month so I'm gonna make myself grill tune with mango salsa for lunch that healthy it sounds pretty good I think it's a little salad with that you can get much better that's great [Music] we're going to take a quick shower and then I'm going to make my seared tunas mango salsa let me start with a tuna just one steak just for me and I'm going to season it with salt and pepper both sides this is gorgeous and you let it sit and the key about the tune is I'm going to get a pan very very hot before I put it in so it Sears the outside and while I'm doing that I'm making mango salsa I sautéed some onions and ginger about two onions and two teaspoons of ginger and olive oil just until the onions are translucent and I'm going to add some chopped garlic there's some really interesting flavors in this and I was trying to add the garlic at the last minute because I don't want to burn it so cook that for a second and then I'm going to add two mangoes that I've peeled seeded and diced oh just a wonderful little orange juice except sort of tropical flavors which is great the little brown sugar sweetened it now being healthy doesn't mean you have to deprive yourself you can have really delicious food and it's important to have a good meal otherwise you feel hungry all day so I want to do a little jalapeno which is wonderful I be careful of these guys you want to take all the seeds out it's the inside that's really really hot I'm going to chop this up I'm going to take out all the seeds and the rib and whatever you do don't rub your eye while you're doing this it's really hot and have the food and then I'm going to dice it and put it in I like a little bit of heat if you like a lot you can use the whole jalapeno if you don't like it at all leave it out okay so that's going to go in a little closed orbit I'm just going to cook this for a few minutes into the orange juice is reduced and the mangos a nicely cooked and meanwhile I'm going to sear the tuna so the key to this is this pan is really hot before you put the tuna in and it really Sears the outside it would be so delicious so maybe two minutes on each side while I stir the mangos awesome just about done and then I'm going to take it off the heat at the end and just add fresh mint into it it's going to be delicious so I'm going to just flip the tuna over you can see it's just starting to cook on the bottom and I'm going to chop some fresh mint I think sauce is sort of like chutney I like when it's sweet and the top and it's spicy I love it mint oil it releases it no this is looking gorgeous great and the tune is ready turn off the heat and just put the mint in just because it's lunchtime on diffusion the incredibly delicious the seeds it's really seared on the outside and raw on the inside it can be incredibly beautiful thanks googled mango salsa we turn the spices with fresh mint and once it's ready [Music] I mean so delicious nobody would ever believe it's good for you I think I'll just hang out here for a while and afterwards I'm going to accept a key that's so easy you won't believe it so the next thing I want to make is said C key which is a classic Greek yogurt and cucumber dip this takes a minute to make as long as you've done the preparation in advance so what I have here is 2 cups of low fat yogurt that I've drained and the liquid comes out of the bottom and it becomes more like a cheese you'll see when I dump it out and here I have one cucumber that I graded salted and allowed that to drain too so all the liquid is out and I'm just going to dump that in together so we've got cucumber and yogurt it's really important to drain both of them because I want a really thick delicious dip so now I'm going to add back lots of flavor so the first thing I do is that 2 tablespoons of lemon juice and so olive oil and some chopped garlic because Greek food always has to have chopped garlic and lots of fresh dill since we're being very healthy low-fat sour cream and mix all this together it looks great this is so wonderful as a dip for vegetables sort of stuff in pita bread and I'm just going to keep it in the fridge all week so whenever I reach for droplets of cookie I'll have said Zeki instead and I think the last thing is inspector so this looks great I have some crudité to have it with a little icicle radishes and purple strain beans and some sugar snap peas just because it's low-fat doesn't mean it can't be delicious fabulous [Music] [Music] just because something's healthy doesn't mean it have to look like a bowl of oatmeal so I'm making beet salad with orange and I think it's just gorgeous and delicious and good for me this is one of the wonderful things with canned beets are just as good as fresh beets and there's so much easier you won't believe it so these are three cans of baby beets that I'm just cutting in half and they're really delicious and they can be really messy so be careful don't get them on yourself so now I'm going to make a vinaigrette with a little bit of raspberry vinegar I love the sweetness of the raspberry vinegar with the beets and some olive oil don't even need another bowl for the vinaigrette just do it right on the beat lots of salt and pepper the good thing about this is you can make it put it in the fridge and it just gets better as it sits so I'm going to make some today and then I'll have it all week whenever I want a refrigerator look for something bad to eat I'll see the beets and I'll know it's time to eat something really good so the next thing I'm going to do is it's orange I try and get as much flavor out of the orange as I can by zesting the outside and then I'm going to put the whole orange segments into the beet salad it's gonna be just delicious zest of the outside and now I'm going to peel the rind off and put the orange segments right into the salad I think there's something about the sweetness of the beets and the acidity of the orange that are really great together never mind I think the colors are fabulous I sound like a client of mine who one time the interior design client who came into the store and said I want one Brown saying one red thing and one green thing to serve for dinner and sometimes the color is really important but the flavor is important too I'm just going to squeeze the rest of this and then one more orange okay lots of death and then more orange segments just want to be sure you take all the white part off it's called the pith absolutely is that okay that's it more juice and the last ingredients to chopped red onion which gives a little spice aren't those colors fabulous and just toss this all together and that gorgeous just taste it to make sure it's seasoned right how easy with that so good really the orange really brings out the beach flavor and it's just delicious it's going to be good for me all week long [Music] next one next Mercer tomato basil soup and think a little retail therapy might be good for me I'm having a really healthy day and one of the things I love to do is have things in the refrigerator so when I'm reaching for chocolate-chip cookie there's something good for me there so making roasted tomato basil soup which is easy to make absolutely delicious first thing I did with roast tomatoes I just took plum tomatoes cut them in half toss them with olive oil salt and pepper and cook them for 45 minutes at about 400 degrees and they get really sweet this is actually a great vegetable too but I'm going to make soup out of it so what I have in the pan is I've cooked two onions and six cloves of garlic lots of garlic with a little bit of olive oil for about 10 minutes until they're translucent and start to brown and now I'm just going to toss a lot of other delicious things in the roasted tomatoes roasting this way even in the winter gives them really good summer tomato flavor it's 3 pounds of roasted tomatoes just put them right in there and they just get it such great flavor you love the smell of that I'm going to add some fresh thyme let's take it off so stem next thing is a little crushed red pepper place give it a little heat a few tablespoons of olive oil to give it a little richness and then one of the key ingredients with fresh basil and I mean lots of fresh basil so I'm just going to take the leaves off the stem and just throw the whole basil leaves right into this pot tomatoes and basil is such a classic combination okay that's 4 cups of fresh basil leaves I'm just going to toss them right into the pot fabulous two more key ingredients whole can of tomatoes with the juice and the puree and everything in it and a quart of homemade chicken stock but you can also use canned chicken stock if you have a good one and if you vegetarian you can always use water I like a little chicken stock last two things a salt and pepper and that's just going to simmer for about 45 minutes on low heat and it's going to just be absolutely delicious in the meantime I'm going shopping with my friend Miguel he loves to shop and he's got great taste my idea of a great day nothing to take a job how about this for you oh this is lip balm virgin and flood music perfect Christmas what do you think about this Miguel I actually love it come together very well my name on an epic Isis I think I'm not letting it go how about money - vodka [Laughter] I'm having a really good for me dated a little exercise a lot of pampering and some delicious food I've got a roasted tomato basil soup cooking away on the stove and I'm going to make an absolutely guilt-free lemon angel food cake so here I have sifted together 1 and 1/3 cups of cake flour and 1/2 a cup of superfine sugar the cake flour is going to make this a really light cake but the basis of this cake is one and a half cups of egg whites I'm going to beat them with 3/4 of teaspoon salt and one and a half teaspoons of cream of tartar and I'm going to let that beat until they get really firm there are two main flavors you just Anila and freshly grated lemon zest so first thing I'll do is the lemon zest this gives it a really fresh lemon flavor so that's one and a half teaspoons of grated lemon zest and three-quarters of a teaspoon of vanilla they use really good vanilla extract this is what you want them to look like really firm so that when you take the whisk off they actually stand up by themselves that's perfect and now I'm going to add one and a half cups of superfine sugar beaten into this this is what's going to make the cake so light great so remember I have 1 and 2/3 cups of sifted cake flour and 1/2 a cup of superfine sugar and I'm going to fold it in with the spatula so what I'm going to do is I'm going to sprinkle this over the cake next and just fold it in carefully the other wonderful thing is this cake is so we're going to make so it's just folding this in to make sure it's incorporated and I'm going to put it in my pan this is a tube pan and it's what angel food cakes are classically baked in and you don't want to grease it because it will stop it from rising and it has a hole in the middle so that the heat can get into the middle and it bakes evenly I'm just going to pour this whole thing right into a tooth pan through the top and then put it in a 350 degree oven for 35 to 40 minutes and it's going to be the delicious [Music] I've got a really healthy day and now I'm making myself a really healthy sandwich so I've got 8 ounces of low fat cream cheese and 10 ounces of Montrachet which is a low fat goat cheese I'm just going to mix that up and then I'm going to add all kinds of delicious things I've got fresh garlic chopped up and put it right in just because it's low-calorie doesn't mean it has to be bland I like lots of flavor and lots of fresh thyme to be really good enough that happens teaspoon of thyme and then 3 tablespoons of chopped parsley great install and pepper and just to make it a little thinner I'm going to hit it with a little milk so being at my bread delicious I love bread like this that's really dense and has a wonderful flavor it's got seeds and nuts in it so a little spread of herb goat cheese and since likes cucumber fresh parsley and this is going to be really good with my rest of tomato basil soup this is my delicious and healthy roasted tomato basil soup all I did was rest tomatoes together through them lots of fresh basil simmered it I'm going to do is puree it I know this looks like a contraption that came down from Mars but it's a it's called a food mill and it's just wonderful because as opposed to making baby food out of something it actually just pureed it with lots of texture one of the great things about the soup is I can serve it room temperature the way I'm doing it now but you can also serve it hot or cold with the dollop of yogurt or if your being dead creme fraiche it's like an early food processor okay that's it I'm not arrested tomato basil soup so supper in front of a good movie it's one of the great pleasures in life I third goat cheese sandwich little roasted tomato basil v and I'm ready for a great movie I'll come back later for dessert we'll be intermission I came back for my guilt-free lemon angel food cake it's a cake but it's so good for you it's just egg whites and lemon zest little vanilla and this is light as a feather and delicious nice big slide mm promise of Chelsea [Music]
