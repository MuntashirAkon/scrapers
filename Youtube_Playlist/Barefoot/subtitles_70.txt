[Music] I was playing bridge was my cardshark friends the other night we decided it's time to do something different why not dinner in a movie so I've gotten a fabulous French movie and I think I'll make a fabulous French dinner to go with it first my favorite chicken with 40 cloves of garlic the garlic has cooked for a long time and it gets so sweet a really quick couscous with toasted pine nuts and currants to soak up all those garlicky juices and for dessert an ice cream bomb with layers of mango sorbet raspberry sorbet and strawberry ice cream and for cocktails twist on an old favorite blood orange margaritas I've never had a bad night with these friends but I'd say this dinner in a movie will make a particularly funny [Music] when my friends come to dinner during the week I'm gonna make something looks impressive but you and I know it's gonna be really easy to make so I'm gonna make an ice cream bomb which is layers of ice cream and sorbet frozen together and it looks just gorgeous I need five cups of mango puree which is about five mangos so this is the last mango just cut the peel off and since I'm gonna puree just cube it really roughly um smells so good it smells very tropical so the ice cream bomb is gonna have mango sorbet on the outside raspberry sorbet next inside and in the very center of it is gonna destroy the ice cream okay so that's the mango and then report into the food processor and puree it mango can sometimes be a little stringy so you want to be sure you puree it well it's an amazing color isn't it it's gonna be gorgeous with the raspberry sorbet okay that looks good now I'm gonna add a little sugar syrup that I made so what this is is three-quarters of a cup of sugar and a half a cup of water and I just melted it so it's a syrup I'm gonna add that to the mango quarter of a cup of fresh orange juice orange juice really brings out the flavor in a mango and about a quarter teaspoon of salt I know salts an unusual thing to put in a sorbet but it really brings out the flavors and just be ready and that's pureed it's beautiful and I'm just going to refrigerate into gets really cold and then I'm gonna put in the ice cream maker [Music] so when my friends come to the bridge we always have cocktails tonight we're not playing bridge but we're definitely gonna have cocktails so I actually asked them what they wanted to drink and Jack Pearson suggests a blood orange margarita I thought that sounded really good so that's what I'm making can we start with half a cup of blood orange juice blood oranges originally came from Sicily and they're sweet but they also have a little bit of sort of tartness to it that I really like [Applause] and the color is amazing you can see why they call blood oranges so I need about a half a cup next thing I need is two tablespoons of fresh lemon juice [Music] it just makes it a little tartar and I need a cup of triple sec which is an orange liqueur [Music] blend it all together [Music] we love the color this needs to be delicious and report into picture [Music] cup of tequila that's gonna do it and I think because this is so beautiful know why it's serving highball glasses but I think I might have to serve with martini glasses into the fridge and blood orange margaritas are ready whenever we are which is always [Music] so the manga puree is chilled so I'm going to my ice cream maker it never gets really really hard to make the sorbet it'll finish freezing in the freezer that looks gorgeous so that's gonna take about 20 minutes and then I'm gonna freeze it into the ice cream bomb with the other layers of ice cream in the meanwhile start on the chicken before two cloves of garlic [Music] Wow so the first step in making the mango sorbet into an ice cream bomb I want to take a frozen bowl and put the mango sorbet right into the frozen bowl show you how this works so then what I'm going to do in order to have the next layer the same shape I'm gonna put this bowl inside that bowl so this is an 8 inch Bowl and I'm gonna put a six and a half inch bowl inside a little bit of plastic wrap will help me get the ball out inside and you see I'm gonna press it down and it's gonna make exactly the shape I want great I'm gonna put it in the freezer for at least 30 minutes until it gets frozen hard and the next thing I want to do is put the layer of raspberry sorbet in and since this is a movie party I put Jack in charge of buying popcorn [Music] there's the pop one microwave easy always good and now for the main course chicken with 42 garlic sounds like a lot of garlic doesn't it but it's really delicious the girl that gets really sort of brown and caramelized and sweet so instead of peeling every single one of these cloves of garlic it's so much easier if you just put them in hot water boiling hot water for about 60 seconds and then the peel just comes right off so what I did was I salt-and-pepper the chick and dry it off a little bit so it Browns nicely Brown it on both sides for about five minutes on each side and these guys look beautiful they're perfectly done just browned on the outside cuz I'm gonna cook it completely later a little bit of oil a little bit of butter so you get the flavor of the butter and the high burning temperature of the oil great so what I have left in the pan now is the oil and butter and all this gorgeous chicken flavoring I'm gonna take 40 cloves of garlic and put them right in I want them to confer back five maybe ten minutes until they're nice and browned on both sides I can already smell the garlic wonderful so there are two kinds of alcohol in this cognac and white wine they really have totally different flavors cutting acts a really full sort of strong flavor and the white wine has a mellow round flavor and I'm going to put in two tablespoons of Chania and what the cognac does is it scrapes up all the brown bits in the pan so it becomes part of the sauce so not only flavors it actually works for it it's wonderful huh I can smell the cognac and the garlic and the chicken this is gonna be really good chicken with 40 cloves of garlic it's a real guy dish and I have three of them coming for dinner tonight they're gonna be very happy and then I need one and a half cups of white wine pick a wine you want to drink I wouldn't put anything in the sauce that you wouldn't want to drink and then if there's leftover you can drink it got some white wine and then I'm gonna put the chicken right back into this and the white wine and the cognac and the chicken are all gonna cook together in about 30 minutes so I'm gonna bring this up to a boil put the chicken back in just pile it up in this pan this is a great Dutch oven and it's real I use it for everything from soups to stews but it's wonderful for chicken with 40 cloves of garlic tongs are actually great for this because then you don't pierce the skin and lose all the juices just pile them up in the pan okay and then there's some juices in the pan you want to just add them so they end up in the sauce okay now I'm just doing some fresh thyme so you just take doesn't have to be exact just take some time smells so good I can smell the garlic it's getting sweet chicken time just wonderful okay lid on it's gonna cook for about 30 minutes but its simmer and all the juices and the flavors are gonna get together it's gonna make chicken and a sauce [Music] now for the next layer of the ice cream bomb its community raspberry sorbet you take this little Bowl out and the plastic wrap really helps and now I've got softened raspberry sorbet just spoon this right into the mill colors are gorgeous the flavors are great that's a really summery combination just smooth it in a little bit of plastic wrap do a separate later right in the middle just smush it down into the freezer about 30 minutes and then later I'll put in strawberry ice cream and I'll have all three layers through the grate and that gives me just enough time to finish the chicken with garlic and make the couscous so to go with the chicken with 40 cloves of garlic I thought couscous would be perfect because it'll absorb all the wonderful flavor of the chicken and the garlic so I'm gonna start out by saut√©ing about 3/4 of a cup of shallots and some butter shallots are great because they have sort of button like a more delicate flavor than onions and they'll be really good with this and then I'm gonna add 3 cups of chicken stock 1/2 a teaspoon of salt 1/2 teaspoon of pepper this may be the easiest dishes imaginable now you're gonna see the magic of couscous why don't have cups of couscous [Music] give it a stir turn off the heat put the lid on and the couscous is just gonna blow up all those wonderful flavors and in about ten minutes I'm going to fluff it with the fork add some toasted pignoli nuts and currants and it'll be done that's pretty easy and it's gonna be absolutely delicious chicken with 40 cloves of garlic and this looks like it's almost done I'm gonna do it take the chicken out a little bit so just put the chicken on the plate Oh smell the garlic it's really sweet it's amazing how it changes when it cooks for a long time I can smell the cognac and the wine I'm gonna have some very happy friends tonight I think I'm gonna put it down and I feel the good news is the whole dish can really be made a day or two in advance so it's great for entertaining okay now I'm gonna thicken the sauce a little bit so I'm gonna take about a half a cup of sauce doesn't matter if the girl that gets into it it's fine now I'm just gonna add two tablespoons of flour just thicken it up a little bit it's a good idea not to put the flour directly into the sauce because I don't like gravy it'll get lumpy so just whisk this together it doesn't matter if there's garlic in it'll just get mashed up with it even better just whisk this together until it's really smooth okay and then I'm just gonna pour this right back into the hot sauce slowly whisk it in yeah tablespoon of cognac actually adding this later in the sauce because then it'll have more of a bite the way cognac that hasn't been cooked so long has two tablespoons of heavy cream just to give it a little richness so just cook this for a minute so the flour doesn't have any uncooked flavor in it all the flavorings get together so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put the chicken right back in into the sauce now it's really thick and gorgeous and then I'll leave it in a 200 degree oven until we're ready to serve dinner all right let's do this the fast way slide it all in with all the juices on the plate lid on and into the open whoa that's a heavy pot and finally the last stage with the bomb we put strawberry ice cream right in the middle it actually looks like a lot of steps but they're really easy ones and so let's see how this comes out and I have softened strawberry ice cream but right in the middle you just fill it right up you know you can really do this with any kind of ice cream and then when it's turned out each slice is gonna have raspberry sorbet mango sorbet and strawberry ice cream it's just gorgeous perfect when put it in the freezer and let it freeze hard for about 30 minutes and now I'm just gonna finish the couscous and we're ready for dinner and a movie [Music] it so I'm gonna have two more flavors to the couscous the first ones toasted pignoli nuts they're pine nuts I think I've I've been you always is I think they really don't have any flavor until you toast them and then there are just nutty and delicious good right into the couscous quarter of a cup of dried currants that's what sort of like ways these but they're smaller a little tartar so the key to couscous is you don't want to stir it you want to fluff it with a fork and it gets all light and fluffy it's delicious just looks so good [Music] mark who's coming tonight called me and bet me five bucks that I'm is cooking with garlic I said of course she's cooking with garlic it's a French film but the good news is I brought my poker chips in case it's the boring French [Music] all right who wants a blood orange margarita this was Jack's idea so Jack gets the first one it's a very good idea margarita with blood orange juice instead of lime juice ready Noah Cheers chicken with 40 cloves of garlic [Laughter] so how about if I give everybody a plate don't help yourself jack because cuz with cannolis and currants [Laughter] [Music] Appetit fine how many cloves of garlic are actually actually for to close ago we counted every one 41 it's three hits of garlic no way comes you know mark bet me that you would be cooking the garlic tonight no I didn't take the back so I know you're gonna give us a hint about the movie no it's a surprise then so is dessert for dessert an ice cream bomb I just have to dip in in hot water now the key is to take it out in one piece hopefully without wearing it at the same time I think it's gonna come out and nobody will be more surprised than me turn it upside down unbelievable ice cream bomb and that's for you huh [Music] and you you're being good right you don't want me all right so we have a French movie but we can do what we usually do to play bridge well your poker chips oh my god do you have any cash I think we should play poker what do you think yeah okay French food is great but French movies in say Bob [Music]
