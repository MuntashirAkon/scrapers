I'm gonna make my favorite roast turkey dinner oh that's a big turkey I don't understand why our mothers used to get up at five o'clock in the morning to roast a turkey I can't figure it out I think they have this thing about bacteria a 12 pound turkey should roasted about two and a half hours and it'll be moist and delicious oh that's a beautiful bird so the first I'm gonna do is take out the giblets like the neck and the oh it's cold it's wet and I'm gonna save it for stock later and this looks beautiful and then I'm gonna Pat it dry so I'm gonna put some salt in the middle and some freshly ground pepper just make sure it's really well-seasoned we're not gonna do stuffing you know it's enough for the stuffing I'm gonna put all kinds of things in the cavity that are gonna give it lots of flavor so I'm gonna stuff it with onion forget peeling it forget just chop the whole thing up and just put it right into the inside of the turkey great and then they made big sprigs of thyme and then we're gonna have lemon I'll just put big chunks of lemon in just like that it's gonna be so delicious and then maybe the last thing is a big chunk of garlic put a big chunk of it right in the middle of the turkey and then the last thing is I'm gonna just take these little wings and tuck them under just so they're not flapping around in the pan and that they they burned before the turkeys finish cooking you're basically just doing that well the turkey it doesn't mind so I've got about four tablespoons of butter i melted in here just brush it nicely on the outside of the bird and then salt and pepper remember it's a big bird so solved it really well and some pepper in the pan so about two and a half hours at 350 degrees and we're another fabulous turkey oh love it's not look gorgeous so I'm just gonna wrap it up with a woman in foil really makes a difference if you let it rest for about 20 minutes just like the juices get into the meat the whole thing will taste fabulous I carve a turkey the same way I carve a chicken so I'll show you what I do I take the legs off looks perfectly cooked cut the dark meat a little bit okay regard the dark meat first on the side okay and then I'm going to carve the turkey breast I'm going to do is take the whole breast off actually in one piece just the way I do with a chicken it looks perfectly cooked I'm just going to slice it so much easier to do this way and I like when the slices aren't so incredibly thin that they fall apart so just like that okay maybe a sec of hair here doesn't look at that
