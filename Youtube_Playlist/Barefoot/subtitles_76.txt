[Music] well if there's one thing I make over and over again its roast chicken it's a great thing for Jeffrey on Friday night but if it's a really good roast chicken it's special enough for company so this is a story of one roast chicken made lots of different ways the first it's gonna be really nice summer dinner in the garden so this is the story of a chicken it's going on a very long journey and we're going along for the ride so the first thing I want to do is make a roast chicken and then I'm gonna use the bacon then we're gonna gross the chicken with for a salad be nice and crisp in the salad then I'm gonna use the carcass of the chicken to make chicken stock and even after that I'm gonna use the leftover chicken to make chicken with tabbouleh but first the roast chicken so I'm starting with a big roasting chicken first thing I want to do is salt and pepper the inside of the cavity I've already washed and patted it dry lots of salt inside to give it lots of flavor and lots of pepper want this to have a great flavor and I'm gonna take a whole head of garlic I'm not even gonna peel it just cut it right in half and all that garlic flavor just gets right into the chicken really delicious and the next thing I wanna do is lemons because I love the way lemon tastes and chicken I'm just gonna quarter this and put that right into the chicken just that way and then some fresh thyme big sprig of fresh thyme right in the middle all this is really just to give the chicken more flavor as it roasts if you have other herbs around like oregano or rosemary or something like that you can also use that but I particularly like time now okay now I'm going to show you how to trust a chicken it's really simple I just want to do two things and then tie the legs together a little bit of kitchen string just tie these guys together this is really about making sure that the chicken cooks evenly if the legs are flapping around in the pan they're gonna cook faster than the rest of the chicken and the wings are the same thing you don't want them flapping around in the pan so what you want to do is just turn them backwards and tuck them right underneath the body of the chicken but it keeps them closed just like that I'm just gonna brush the whole tap with butter just to make sure that it has lots of flavor and that it Browns really nicely in the pan I'm going to sprinkle it with lots of salt and pepper and now comes the surprising part I'm going to put strips of bacon over the top which is gonna actually give it lots of flavor and then later I'm gonna crumble the crisp bacon into the salad so it's gonna be a combination of dishes this is the usual friday-night chicken but dressed up for company now I'm going to add more flavor to the sauce too by putting in garlic in the pan another whole head of garlic just cut right in half I'm gonna roast it in the pan and then this juices from the chicken are gonna make a sauce with the garlic and I think I'll put in two lemons so these are the flavours in the chicken but it's also going to add to the sauce cut off the ends and then just cut it in half and do big wedges and you'll see the lemon is gonna brown and it's gonna have great flavor right in the sauce just right in the pan it's sort of instead of vegetables my friend Greg Gail is coming for dinner it was internationally famous garden lighting designer and I think he's gonna do something incredible in my garden his so much style and he's so much fun and it's been really interesting to see this so we'll have a nice dinner in the garden with his lighting okay so I think it's already 425 degrees for about an hour and 15 minutes and before it's done we're gonna take the bacon off so that chicken Browns really nicely and it looks like Greg's up to something really interesting out there love coming out and funny on my card for took cold beer thank you just what you needed right absolutely well this is amazing what is it well there's something local yeah there's something from another continent oh really theirs and their handles sort of all over the garden you know I can't wait to see it and I have a great fire okay great I'm cave alright I'm in the middle of cooking chicken you're still in charge of the garden absolutely I'm in charge of dinner good and mustard for my salad dressing so they'll make a salad dressing that's kind of thick but it's gonna be really good it's kind of lots of flavor the first thing I'm gonna do is have an egg yolk it's actually raw egg yolk so just be sure your guests don't have a problem with that but what its gonna do is emulsify the dressing so it's nice and thick one room-temperature egg yolk in the food processor 2 teaspoons of good mustard I like Dijon mustard two cloves of chopped garlic if that doesn't give it a lot of flavor I don't know what will half a cup of freshly squeezed lemon juice 2 teaspoons of salt salt everywhere F teaspoon of pepper all I'm going to do is I'm going to turn this on and emulsify it all and then very slowly pour olive oil into it and it's going to make it like a thick mayonnaise all the ingredients need to be room-temperature made one and a half cups of olive oil poured slowly and you'll see it's gonna start to thicken that should be just about right I'm gonna add half a cup of Parmesan cheese for even more flavor this makes a lot of dressing but it's kind of lasts about a week or two in the frigerator just mix that in and that's it I think it's gonna be delicious so it's thick but not like mayonnaise it's perfect consistency so good got a lot of lemon and garlic parmesan is really delicious and it it's gonna be really good on the salad with a crispy bacon on the top my friend Greg is gonna be very happy [Music] what does that look good Wow someone take the bacon off put it aside let it get nice and crisp and then I'm gonna crumble it on the salad later wonderful okay I'm just gonna baste it a little bit so it Browns nicely and the lemons and then back in the oven [Music] where's the smoke good these guys [Music] slightly higher and that in a little lower looking around I think that's about it - hopefully is inside cooking some chicken or something delicious and I think our work is done here now that looked like a chicken that looks go ahead eat just put this on a platter remember it's filled with all that time and lemon and garlic so when the juices run out it's got all that flavor now I'm just gonna take the lemon and the garlic in the pan laughs put on the platter with the chicken great get all the lemon nice big piece of aluminum foil let's gonna rest at room temperatures we stay really hot under the foil now for the sauce just going to take this whole roasting pan put it right on the flame high heat and now about half a cup of chicken stock or chicken broth but it's really looking good so I'm going to turn the heat down to simmer let that cook for a few minutes while it reduces and it gets a really really wonderful flavor and while that's going I'm going so just before the dressing over the salad just enough to moisten it for parmesan adds more flavor and now the bacon that was cooking on top of the chicken I'm gonna cut it up right into the salad it's great to have something crispy great and that's done okay I see how this little guy is doing wonderful it's still hot and the juices have all gone back into the chicken it's really juicy it's just not pink it's perfectly done it's not the first thing I do is take the leg off I'll just pull the leg up and then cut right through the joint are you about carving up a chicken is if you can't quite get your knife in just wiggle it a little bit and you'll find out where it goes okay so you cut the leg into a few pieces around the bladder cut off the wing some wonderful way to carve a chicken is cut the whole breast off in one piece and then slice it straight across every portion there's a little bit of the meat and the skin it's so much easier than slicing really fits nice and I think it tastes much better little pays final platter anything on the other side now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put some of the gravy right on the chicken big bunch of fresh thyme it may be a lemon since there's lemon in it so now my friend Greg is gonna know that it's thyme and lemon that looks pretty good and dinner [Music] my friends Mandy and John got married last year in Sri Lanka yeah and while I was there I found these in a small shop yeah but it's actually really natural earthy material help yourself Thank You lemon chicken my favorite it is so good would you like a leg and actually what I did was I I cooked some bacon with a chicken and then put it in the salad so help yourself to the salad ladies first thank you so what you don't know is this is only part one of the chicken story I'm gonna make chicken stock out of the bones that are left from the chicken so since I'm over to your house okay perfect okay you got it so there's part two to this dinner well that was really fun wasn't the garden amazing he's so creative so with the chicken carcass that was left over I'm gonna make chicken stock and it was a similar way while I clean up after the party so I've got the carcass of one chicken two big stalks of celery and you know you don't even have to peel them and throw them right in the pan two onions just cut this in big quarters don't even have to feel it parsnips great for this it's sort of like a cross between a carrot and a turnip I'm just big chunks right into the pot chicken stock so great to have them around for soups or stews but I need a little bit for the chicken with tabbouleh for lunch tomorrow so the next thing when I put in is a whole head of garlic it's really like making a chicken just cut it in half and just throw it right in some dill some parsley some fresh thyme and I actually just use whole peppercorns tablespoon or so of whole peppercorns and a tablespoon of salt no salt is so important for chicken stock if it doesn't have enough salt it tastes like dirty dishwater and then cover everything with water it's about four quarts of water so just bring it up to a boil and then we're gonna lower the heat and let it simmer for about three and a half hours and it's gonna be really rich wonderful chicken stock it's just the right amount of time to watch a movie so I'm just redoing the chicken stock so I can strain it oh it smells so good other vegetables cut gorgeous that is so it was basically just a leftover chicken carcass and some vegetables for my vegetable bin so I just need a cup and a half of chicken stock for the chicken was tabbouleh I want it nice and hot when I put it over the tabbouleh so I'm gonna just heat it up just like that so we'll just bring it to a boil meanwhile I'm gonna get the tabbouleh ready tabbouleh is actually a Middle Eastern dish and it starts with bulgur wheat which is a really good healthy grain and I'm gonna start with a cup of it just right in the bottom or a bowl we're gonna add the juice of two lemons this is actually going to be the end of the journey for this chicken because what I'm gonna do is use the leftover chicken and put it in the tubulin it's gonna be lunch so the chicken stock and the chicken but so that's two lemons just go straight it right into the bulgur wheat so I'm going to show you then pits in it great a quarter of a cup of olive oil 1/2 teaspoons of salt 1/2 teaspoon of pepper and then the one-and-a-half cups of hot chicken stock just simmering and pour it right over the tabbouleh okay that's just going to sit there on the tube bulu she's going to puff up and absorb the oil and lemon juice and chicken stock [Music] so we're gonna cover this with plastic wrap to keep the heat in it'll let sit for about an hour and we've got to chop up all kinds of great vegetables something leftover chicken if I can't wait for lunch I love tabbouleh it's not only delicious but it's actually also good for you so it's the bulgur wheat that I've been soaking for an hour with lemon juice olive oil and some chicken stock and I'm just gonna add lots of great vegetables these are hothouse cucumbers that are great because they're they're sort of sweeter than regular cucumbers and you don't have to peel them lots of scallions you see this is really nice grain with lots of fresh vegetables in it scallions go right in and then I've got a cup of cherry tomatoes they're really just a nice big cherry tomatoes cut in quarters or cut in half if they're small right in and then fresh mint great for this now mint unlike other herbs you really do have to pick the leaves off because you don't want to eat the stems so I'm gonna make a huge bowl of tabbouleh and I'm gonna have a really good healthy lunch all week I want to chop them in pretty well because you don't want to eat big pieces of mint leaves it's about a cup of chopped mint then I need a cup of chopped parsley so good and healthy this is that was easier than the meant I'm gonna put the leftover chicken in this but you can really have it as a side dish or main dish without the chicken just plain cup of chopped parsley and the chicken I'm just gonna take the skin off and then chop it in big cubes and just toss it right into the Devoy I mean if you have salmon left over you can really be creative ok 2 teaspoons of salt teaspoon of pepper I'm just gonna trust all together remember the lemon juice and the olive oil in the tabbouleh so it's gonna make the sauce my lunch and now I've got the rest of the chicken stock keep in the freezer [Music] for soups or stews but that's chicken story the sequel
