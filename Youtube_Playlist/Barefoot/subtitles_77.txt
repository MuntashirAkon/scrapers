[Music] my friends are coming for breakfast I love to do breakfast because it's not the traditional Saturday night dinner which is such a major deal most of the things I've done the night before which is great but the main centerpiece of the meal is a potato basil for Tata so in the pan here I've cooked about two cups of boiling potatoes they're the firm round ones rather than the baking potatoes and I peeled them and just cooking a little butter for about ten or fifteen minutes until they're really just tender and browned and that should be perfect right now now I'm going to make the basis of it which is this gorgeous omelette all mixed together I'm going to start with the second element eight eggs and I actually find that you can use whatever is left over from dinner if you have chicken and broccoli the night before makes a delicious frittata counting one more we just scramble them a little bit and I'm going to add lots of great flavorings but 15 ounces ricotta which is one whole small container and then 3/4 of a pound of green cheese careers it's wonderful like Swiss cheese I know it's eggs cheese and butter it's delicious how bad can that be and then a little bit of butter the last major food group I'm not suggesting to you this every day but once in a while for a treat it's wonderful and then basil I think Bayes was just such a great flavoring so we'll just take the leaves off the stem and chop them very roughly I love the smell of fresh basil and then the last two ingredients our third of a cup of flour to give a little substance and 3/4 a teaspoon of baking powder to make it rise just stir this all together make sure it's nicely blended Jesus and the basil and eggs and that's it I'm just going to pour this right over the potato and then this whole thing goes in the oven from sending individual almost for everybody I have one big omelet world and share it so it goes in the oven at 350 degrees for about 50 minutes to an hour this can be puffed and golden and delicious just is your old still hungry oh I have a potato basil for tau tau I've listed this - its potatoes and basil Italy air and ricotta ricotta your what always always we are here thank you I think that one for this is an idea of a great way to start the day breakfast with my friends
