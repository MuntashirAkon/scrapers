[Music] you can't have an all-american grill without that macam burgers but of course I want them to be the best hamburgers I can make so I'm going to show you how to make really great hamburgers I actually like to combine two kinds of beef I do ground chuck so that it stays really moist in the bowl and this is the ground sirloin it's got a little more flavor than the ground chuck it's a little drier and the fun thing about this it's all about getting your hands into it next thing I have is two tablespoons the steak sauce how messy is that but it's really good and six egg yolks and the salt actually look like kosher salt it just has a little softer flavor than regular table salt use it and everything three-quarters of teaspoon of freshly ground black pepper and this is the messy part clean hands really important in cooking and I just find if you use a fork this all gets mashed together but if you use your hands you can keep it really nice and light oh it's so squishy and cold this is the only way to make really good hamburgers and now for the real secret inside each hamburger I've put a little pad of butter so hamburger and just taking like a half of this bit of butter and put it right in the middle and when it sits on the grill it's gonna keep the hamburger so moist just wanna make sure it's totally enclosed in hamburger it's like hiding a secret in the middle of the hamburger isn't it like the Cracker Jack in the Box fabulous hamburgers ready for the grill so my friends are here on pending all-american grill and that requires hamburgers okay everybody hamburgers and turkey [Music] [Music]
