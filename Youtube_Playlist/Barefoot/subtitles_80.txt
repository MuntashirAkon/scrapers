[Music] I love a beach picnic but I hate dragging all that stuff to the beach so I'm going to pack my salads and lemon cake and Chinese takeout containers and we have a very good time I having a beach picnics and I'm going to bring shrimp salad pasta pesto and T's and my favorite lemon cake transports really well to the beach so I'm going to show you how to make this if you can make it fun and cake you can make any cake I've got room-temperature butter half a town and two cups of sugar that I've been mixing in the mixer until it's really light and fluffy then I'm going to add four room-temperature eggs I'm going to add the eggs one at a time and just let them get incorporated into the butter and sugar okay the next thing going to put in is a third of a cup of grated lemon zest and that's goes in wonderful okay then I have to put together my dry ingredients and wet ingredients first the wet ingredients I have a quarter of a cup of fresh lemon juice that I've squeezed buttermilk which is great it's a low-fat milk that's got a culture in it so quarter of a cup of lemon juice plus 3/4 of a cup of buttermilk and the next thing vanilla I love the smell of vanilla I figure out how to put it into almost every big product so teaspoon of vanilla now the dry ingredients so that's three cups of flour half a teaspoon of baking soda has a piece from the baking powder and a teaspoon of salt salt surprisingly important in baking things really brings out the lemon and the lemon cake Adam just in the fifties together sifting really combines it but it also make sure that there's nothing in the bottom so I want to put them in alternately starting and ending with the dry ingredients just until it's mixed and then add the wet ingredients this keeps the batter from getting too thick or too runny and it keeps it really light great thing about this recipe is it's in fact better the next day so if you're having a party it's really great to make it in advance and then the last flour so that's it I've got the dry ingredients the wet ingredients and I'm just going to give it one more mix with a spatula make sure it's really well mixed and all the fresh one wonderful just one more mix with a spatula okay right over here I've got two baking pans that I've greased and floured and a little piece of parchment paper on the bottom so there's no point in making a delicious cake if you can't get it out of the pan divide this up evenly that looks good even right looks good so they're going to bake 350 degrees for about 40 to 45 minutes and after they come out I have a simple syrup made of lemon juice and sugar and then the drizzle on the top and it's soaked in and it just has such a fresh lemon flavor and it keeps it incredibly moist [Music] I'm making a shrimp salad and this little celery is going to be just perfect for it put that lovely I'm going to take two pounds of shrimp they're still in the shell I think they say moister if you cook them in the shell and I'm pouring it into a pot of boiling water that's got lemon and salt in it and that will flavor it while they cook so the key to really good shrimp salad is to make sure that you don't cook the shrimp for more than three minutes it doesn't seem like a long time but if they cook for more than that they will definitely be overcooked what I'm looking for is to know that the shrimp are firm and hot and they're really done so I'm going to take them out and put the nice water stop the cooking immediately see how fast I was that almost wasn't even three minutes okay so now that it's an ice-water I can actually peel them right away so you take off the tail and then take off the shell and there's a little vein that goes right down the back of the shrimp that I want to take out just take it out with your knife that's done excellent so for the sauce it's a mayonnaise sauce but what I'd love to do with mayonnaise is skin it with some kind of flavoring I'm going to start with 1 cup of mayonnaise I don't like that sort of gloppy mayonnaise thick mayonnaise taste so I always send it with something I'm going to do it with white wine just to my head in the fridge just tablespoon or so so that that's good that sort of the texture of it which is so much nicer than manager and then we're going to add all kinds of flavorings let's see how that's a mustard let me have a teaspoon and salt once itself to be really well flavored because the shrimp are fairly bland and you wanted to really season this off nice pepper so we've got lots of fresh dill that I've cut up here just enough about three tablespoons of dill in there I'm just going to taste it and see how the sauce remember it has to be really highly seasoned because it's going to mix with the shrimp it's delicious got lots of flavor okay and then the shrimp I'm going to pour the sauce right over the shrimp mix that all together and then I'm going to add some fresh vegetables just think some celery which is really traditional and some red onion which will give it a little spice are really good I'm going to put on one and a half cups of chopped celery and I'm just going to use half an onion mix it all together so this looks great it's got a nice creamy dressing and all the fresh vegetables the celery and onions and the shrimp with dill I was just perfect just clip it enhance the flavor of the shrimp my friends are going to love it mm-hmm and that that's my lemon cakes now I'm going to make a lemon syrup that's going to soak into the cake 1/2 a cup of lemon juice and then you'd have a cup of sugar this syrup is going to make this cake so moist and also it keeps it for a long time so it will stay moist for days in fact I think it's moister after it sits for a day or two so it allows you to make the cake a day or two before the party which is great I'm just going to cook this long enough so that the sugar dissolves and it becomes a really simple syrup and this'll take about two minutes so while that's happening I'm going to take the cakes out of the pan so these are cool enough so that it starts to pull away from the pan just run my knife around the edge and remember there's parchment paper on the bottom so if I'm lucky they should come out perfectly well and they did peel the parchment off I'm going to leave it I like to leave it upside down on the pan because it soaks in better there and then I'll turn it right-side up later perfect fill the parchment off just put it down on the pan great what you have syrups doing one of the things I believe is that you don't need a million different recipes if you have 10 good recipes that you're really comfortable with and three variations you really have a huge repertoire this lemon cake is one of those things so what I'm doing now is spooning this syrup right over the cake and it's just going to soak in and it's going to have all that flavor of the fresh lemon juice so the acidity of the juice and the sweetness of the sugar will be really delicious so I'm going to do is let the syrup soak into these cakes and then I'm going to make my pasta pesto and peach salad for my picnic a first trick it's frozen peas because I think they're actually delicious and when they're picked they're blanched and then frozen so they're just as good as shelling them yourself which could take forever to pour them into a colander just run them under hot water and just let them sit in to think for a minute so I cook the pasta ready i actually made two different kinds bowties little bow ties and fusilli these but you can use any kind of dried pasta so first thing i'm going to do is make pesto which is wonderful it's just basil and garlic really old-fashioned Italian thing and a little bit of walnuts and the food processor got a quarter of a cup tablespoons pignoli which are pine nuts that's was usually made with one of the other but I like to flavor when you make make it with both next ingredient is garlic with three big pieces of garlic and salt and pepper so lots of pepper I like it really spicy lots of pepper and then one and a half cups of basil jump right in and I'm going to try this and then while that's going on a pour in about 1/3 of a cup of olive oil right through the seafood you so it's basic pesto and then I'm going to add a few more ingredients to make a sauce for some Parmesan cheese I actually add spinach it's frozen chopped spinach that's been defrosted but a half a package and about three quarters of a cup of mayonnaise and squeeze of fresh lemon it's a really great sauce on pasta because it's spicy and it's flavorful there we go nice lemon lemon and the spinach and we keep the pesto from turning brown [Applause] okay so to make sure it's perfect remember the sauce has to be really flavorful the pasta doesn't have much flavor mmm garlic and spicy a little more salt salt so important for pesto really bring out the basil flavor so that's my sauce I'm going to toss it with the pasta and add some final ingredients so that's the pasta and the pesto we toss this together so you can really smell the garlic and you see the spinach has kept the pesto really green so now we have pasta pesto we need peas so I the frozen peas that I defrosted I'm just going to add some on behalf of package and for lots of flavor I'm going to add more Parmesan cheese a little more salt and pepper and the last ingredient is pignoli nuts I think these really add just a great flavor to the salad and they look great so it's green and white so let's make sure this tastes right oh it's got so much flavor parmesan and basil and garlic we love that garlic so that's already all I've left to do is make my tomato feta salad and ice wine lemon cakes also for my beach picnic I already have shrimp salad pasta pesto and peas and now I'm going to glaze these gorgeous lemon cakes and turn them right side up remember they're all infuser that lemon syrup so it's going to be wonderful now I want to make a fresh lemon glaze for the job so the first thing is confectioner sugar dump about two cups in the bowl and more fresh lemon juice so the squeeze it in here so I'll get seeds in the glaze I just love the flavor of the fresh lemon juice and this makes it tart and sweet with the sugar okay that should do it I'm just going to pour enough in so that it makes it runny but not so much that it's too thin it's really a matter of the balance between the lemon juice and sugar you'll see what I mean just keep adding a little bit of lemon juice at a time until it gets thin but still running getting there I'm going to pull this on and as it sits for a little while it gets a little harder and it just so delicious on the top okay that's about right now okay watch this this is a good part just want to just make it so that it drizzles over the edge what does it look great so I'm just going to leave that to set a little bit so that's like gorgeous lemon cakes can't wait to dessert but first I'm going to make a cherry tomato salad I'll show you how easy that is it's the kind of composed salad that you can really just throw together I love the combination of tomatoes and said it's sort of a Greek combination so I thought well why not make a cherry tomato feta salad I always find people don't care with you for dinner they always remember dessert so dinner has to be good okay last tomato and the next thing is the feta Ashley would took my basil at two it's got lots of fresh herbs in it the key to the feta is to slice it but not crumble it so I'm gonna use a slicing knife just kind of slice right through it and cubes I want them about the same size of the cherry tomatoes just for the symmetry of it there are different kinds of SATA and it's really important since there are so few ingredients in this recipe that it's really good setup so there's grease SATA and French feta are really good set it I'm just going to put it right on top now and make the vinaigrette I'm not even going to bother making except religiously pour it right over that three tablespoons of white wine vinegar I use champagne vinegar and olive oils then to give it a little spiciness some red onions I chopped up and then I'm going to add fresh basil and fresh parsley and it'll be all done just toss it together my gourd is so fresh colorful and we hope delicious I'll find out in a second so good those tomatoes are wonderful into the fridge so my beach picnic is ready I'll have to do is pack everything up in Chinese takeout containers and we're ready to go time to pack up and go to the beach got beers pack up my salads so I've got this great Chinese takeout containers I'm going to put the salad in it each one goes so I'll have enough salad so each person I'll have one container of each salad lots of detainers lots of goodies okay that's trim salad I've got pasta pesto and peas I want to take this all in one big bag but it can also make small bags for each person so everybody has their own picnics pasta pesto tomatoes with feta and basil fresh parsley okay that's good next a lemon cake big six slices and take each piece and put it in a piece of parchment paper then I use this gravy you can any kind of straw or strength something natural we like all natural and tie it up like a little gift so everybody has a piece of lemon cake add and and then when they're done they can just throw all this paper ass just like that so I'm going to take these guys and wrap up chopsticks and a nice orange napkin and a big bag pack it all up and off to the beach [Applause] [Music] okay great everybody have it here or break down everybody some would be like a pasta pesto or like pasta pesto and shrimp salad mushroom filler okay and I have tomato salad with feta and everybody just sneak right in how's that oh you're not supposed to point your chopstick to somebody right is it good oh thank you it's just the perfect day on the beach or what it's unbelievably rash is that great with a little racier a little parchment paper which is you might look at a garden it's a lemon syrup it's so thin so it gets incredibly moist and of course fresh lemon juice you know so it's just wonderful we're going to let me make sure I said that in the beginning of the summer we all say oh this summer I'm going to the beach of all summer right you go to the big one and you spread wood and
