[Music] I've been working really hard and I need a day off so I asked my friends Don a carpenter and Antonio Bellanca to come play with me I'd made us a quick breakfast in the garden and for later a light lunch in between I think there's gonna be a lot of shopping this is gonna be really fun for breakfast making a sour cream coffee cake that's drizzled with real maple syrup and a sunrise smoothie to go with it made with fresh watermelon strawberries mango and some raspberry sorbet and for lunch I'm making my favorite warm goat cheese salad that's light and tangy plus delicious grilled fresh peaches with crisp amaretti cookies great friends good food maybe a little gossip and lots of shopping this is my idea of a great day off first thing I want to make for Antonia and Donna is a sour cream coffee cake it's a really moist sour cream cake with a streusel in the middle I'm going to start with one and a half sticks of butter we're gonna have cups of sugar and I'm gonna cream that together until it's light and fluffy and then I'm gonna start on the dry ingredients okay so the first ingredient is cake flour cake flour I found it's a little lighter and fluffier so that's what I use two and a half cups of cake flour if you don't have cake flour you can use two and a quarter cups of regular all-purpose flour and a quarter of a cup of cornstarch two and a half great two teaspoons of baking powder [Applause] makes it nice and fluffy half a teaspoon of baking soda half a teaspoon of salt zip that together [Applause] okay so this is all nice and fluffy the sugar and butter I'm going to add three eggs I'm gonna add them one at a time I scrape down the bowl to make sure it's really well next no baking is one of those things it's really specific with cooking you can just throw stuff into the pan see how it is but when you're baking it has to be exactly the right ingredients and the right measurements okay it's a good vanilla really important in this morning to have teaspoons and one and a quarter cups of sour cream this is what makes it really moist one yeah got it all over the mix or two okay now I'm gonna turn on low lowest speed and just slowly add all the dry ingredients just with your hand and beat it just until they're really mixed okay last thing I always do is just mix the batter with a rubber spatula make sure really get the bottom sometimes the mixer doesn't get exactly the bottom and all the sides so I'm just gonna just stir it with a spatula make sure it's really well mixed it's not about beating it's just about folding it okay now for the streusel the good part so I'm gonna just combine it in a ball a quarter of a cup of light brown sugar half a cup of flour this is the crumbly part of the [Music] 1/2 teaspoons of ground cinnamon quarter teaspoon of salt and three tablespoons of butter which I'm gonna just crumble into the streusel clean hands best tools so what's surprising to me how important salt isn't a recipe like this I think we always think of salt as a savory thing but for baking really brings out the flavor the cinnamon the brown sugar sour cream I don't have traditional walnuts are for a streusel cake but I'm gonna add some because I think turns up the flavor so that's requisite a cup of chopped walnuts you can just buy them already chopped if you don't like walnuts just leave that it's still delicious and just crumble all of that together okay now we put the cake together clear the decks a little I can really make a mess I always think creative cooks are not neat cooks so I'm gonna do this in a classic tube pan if you don't have something like this you can always use muffin pans it makes great muffins but I've buttered and floured this I'm gonna do is put half the batter on the bottom Oh smells so good I can really smell the vanilla in it the sour cream actually doesn't look like a lot in the pan but it really rises up so I'm just gonna spread it out with my spatula so it's even I'm going to take 3/4 of the streusel and just spread it evenly on the top of the batter so there's gonna be streusel in the middle of this cake as well as on the top I'm gonna take the rest of the batter put it on top I just want to place it on top and then I'll smooth it out later I'm so looking forward to seeing the Antonio and Donna we have such a good time together okay let's move this out and then more streusel on top it's amazing how much this gets really moist and great so into the oven 350 degrees for 50 to 60 minutes and we're going to have a really good cake [Music] so my philosophy is too much is never enough so I'm gonna add a maple drizzle to this to make it even better and it's really easy I have a cup of confectioner's sugar and two tablespoons of maple syrup I really like good maple syrup not the stuff that says syrup like Orser flavored or it's really Knable syrup and the best kind is gone grade-a amber that's sort of smoky flavor so it's not just sweet it has real depth of flavor this is pretty casual if it's a little too thin you can add a little more confectioner sugar if it's too thick you can add another drop of maple syrup or even warm water okay that looks just about right so it's runny but it's there and I think spoons gonna be the best way to do this so just take it and just drizzle it over the time it's a little thicker than I wanted and another drop [Music] okay that's perfect just like to drizzle down the side a little bit this is actually not about being perfect it's about being a little messy I'm next I'm gonna get a head start and dessert for lunch I'm gonna make grilled peaches with em already grilled peaches and amaretti it's a wonderful dessert to make ahead what I've done is brush them with a little bit of oil and I just grilled them for about three minutes until they get sort of a nice smoky flavor you can also do this outside under Grove but inside just fine and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to drizzle them with all different kinds of like amaretto rum vanilla sugar give it lots of flavor and then later before I serve them I'm gonna crumble amaretti cookies on top maybe even a dollop of creme fraiche that sounds good actually love the combination of the juicy peaches with a crunchy I'm already cookies it's a great flavor and texture combination I'll just work that perfectly okay now I'm gonna sprinkle them with vanilla sugar about a quarter of a cup I actually make this and I keep it in the pantry it's just a jar filled with sugar with a vanilla pod stuck in it I'm gonna take about a quarter of a cup you can really smell that wonderful vanilla flavor and just put it right on top of the peaches this is a great thing to make ahead because I want to serve them at room temperature that's when they have the most flavor okay the next thing we do is a quarter of a cup of amaretto that'll occur I'm gonna combine with the quarter of a cup of rum I like to use good dark rum mmm love always smells like the islands Caribbean rum drinks and then we're just going to drizzle this over the peaches and so that it really gets infused into the flavor of the peaches so good I'm just gonna put these in the oven 375 for about 10 minutes in the meantime doing with some great smoothies I'm gonna make sunrise smoothies to go with the sour cream coffee cake I think it's gonna be really good you can really make smoothies with all different kinds of combinations beckoning the flavors just right so the first thing I want to start with the strawberries I was like if something healthy with something decadent that a cup of strawberries cup of mango about one mango one make sure all the fruits really ripe and because you're blending it it doesn't matter what the pieces look like I'm gonna do a cup of watermelon obviously you can't buy a cup of watermelon so what I do is I just buy pieces and warnings you can always buy kind of watermelon when it's in season so a cup of watermelon it's gonna fit in and a little decadence cup of raspberry sorbet all smoothies need something to thicken them bananas are great in this case the raspberry sorbet is going to do it so one cup of raspberries are been okay and the last thing is a little orange juice at 1/4 of a cup [Music] perfect it's a mix of breakfast it's gonna blend it all up [Applause] just until it's really smooth and sunrise smoothies are ready he's gonna be so good with sour cream coffee cake [Music] okay have I got a treat for you Tony and for Donna Cheers girls day off this is just what we feel like doing absolutely nothing all right do we have energy for shopping all right we're out of here [Music] hey guys look at these okay great okay are you trying these on yeah I'm gonna go finish lunch don't get too much fun without me wonder what kind of trouble they're getting into but I'm gonna make a salad with warm goat cheese and the easiest way to slice goat cheese is with a piece of dental floss I'm gonna slice it about half-inch thick you can use a knife but this really makes a nice clean slice and I'm gonna do is I'm gonna make a salad with a nice vinaigrette and then I'm gonna heat up these goat cheese slices just see how easy it is when it's like that now what I'm gonna do is dip these in a little bit of egg white and then some fresh breadcrumbs okay I'm just pull through her a second in the food processor this just makes the breadcrumbs adhere to it and then dip it into bread crumbs and then chill it for about 15 minutes and then after it's cool I'm gonna saute it and the bread crumbs are gonna get really nice and crisp and the goat cheese is gonna be really warm it's gonna be so good on that creamy vinaigrette this actually salad I had in a cafe in Paris with Jeffrey and I ran a home and made it again that's a good test of how good it is having a good time in town at such a lovely little town that's two blocks long that's really special I love East Hampton okay into the fridge I'm gonna chill them for about 15 minutes which gives me time to make a dress [Music] so while the goat cheese is chilling I'm gonna make the vinaigrette when he has two tablespoons of champagne vinegar 2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar I think it's nice to mix them you get sort of the best of both worlds your salt pepper remember vinaigrette has to be really strongly flavored cuz it's gonna be tossed with all of that lettuce a little pinch of sugar really brings out the sweetness in it and a raw egg yolk actually if you don't want to use a raw egg yolk you can always use a little bit of mustard or a little bit of mayonnaise but I really like a rye oak and then I'm gonna pour very slowly pour olive oil in until it gets really thick and creamy the egg yolk will emulsify it about a cup of olive oil [Music] if you do it really slowly you'll see it sort of pulls together like a thin mayonnaise and then it'll really adhere to the lettuce leaves now okay that's perfect so now I'm gonna heat up a little butter and oil to saute the goat cheese so I'm gonna use about a tablespoon of butter a tablespoon of oil get the best of both worlds I have the flavor of the butter and the high burning temperature of the oil and I'm gonna get the goat cheese its chilling in the refrigerator [Music] just want to keep an eye on these guys so they brown nicely on both sides it's really fast just a minute on each side okay girls are gonna be here any minute I'll have to just finish the salad push up the grilled peaches I'm gonna have a wonderful lunch [Music] nothing like shopping to work up an appetite so I've got the nice mess bun mix creamy dressing toss it up [Music] let's taste it just to make sure it's really good doesn't it salt that's perfect a little bit of sweetness and the mescal mix is great because I find it kind of really interesting never mind it's already water so I don't have to wash it [Music] now that won't grow cheese I'm doing a side salad I would only do two but I think for a main course it's nice to have three this looks great it's a big salad but it's a main course so it should be this looks great nice pencil and warm goat cheese and lunch is ready okay Donna salad was warm goat cheese Antonia I know you're exhausted from a long day of shopping it's tough work but somebody's gonna keep up the economy of East Hampton honey I'm not that crazy about goat cheese but I love warm goat cheese there's something about the texture and you can do it with herb goat cheese too [Music] you guys ready for dessert okay talk among yourselves now all I have to do is finish up the grilled peaches with amaretto this is definitely my kind of day all playing no work so I've got the roasted peaches they've been grilled and then roasted with amaretto liqueur and rum this time already are wonderful they're little almond cookies that you can find in grocery stores or in Italian specialty food stores okay a little dollop of creme fraiche and everybody can serve themselves [Music] this can be wonderful dessert my heart [Music] so what do we think about girls stay off once a week that works for me is there anything we didn't eat today so I want to see what we got what we get I want this whoever bought it I want it look how great that is fabulous
