[Music] [Music] I was worried that when I'm away Jeffrey lives on milk and cookies let's be way tonight so I thought I want to stock the fridge with all kinds of delicious things for him to eat and maybe it'll keep them out of the cookie jar first I'm making a delicious beef stew it's easy for him to heat up for dinner whole meal in one pot and because dessert is the best part of the meal I'm making this favored espresso ice cream then for breakfast the next day I'm leaving them homemade cranberry orange scones you can have with this coffee in the morning well helping it doesn't freeze the stew and heat up the ice cream but I'll be calling to find out what he's up to [Music] since Jeffrey's having dinner on his own I thought I'd make some of his favorite things and one of them is definitely ice cream so I'm going to make espresso ice cream it's really good and it has real espresso in it I need three cups of half-and-half she's going to heat the melt until it's called it which means that there's a little lot of bubbles around the outside and there's steam starting to come from it but it's not boiling so I need six egg yolks into the mixer two thirds of a cup of sugar pinch of salt check on the milk looks good you can see line of bubbles around the outside and some steam rising from it okay again sir john i'll show you what it looks like it's amazing to me that egg yolks end up getting so thick like this is that fabulous just egg yolks and sugar a little bit of salt and now on low speed I'm just going to pour the milk slowly into the egg yolks and you want them to keep moving so that you don't cook the egg yolks I got most of it on the counter okay and now i'm going to put all of this back into the pan and cook it very slowly until it thickens this is one of those times you want to stir it constantly until it really thickens then I'm going to flavor with all kinds of delicious things cuff fuel occur and ground espresso and then freeze it and I'm a really good ice cream for Jeffrey this really is one of those things you just have to stand here and stir it the minute you walk away the whole thing just curdles just keep doing this until it gets thick enough to cut the spoon and when you run your finger oh that was hot run your finger down it really leaves the line so it's perfect it's done and now I'm just going to sit it just make sure there's nothing in it that got to thickened that looks gorgeous okay now for the flavorings first one is espresso it's actually ground espresso it's not instant espresso so two and a half tablespoons of ground espresso you can use either regular or decaf tablespoon of coffee liqueur it smells so good and a teaspoon of good banal and just whisk that all together okay that's good I love the way the espresso lips on it okay I'm going to chill it and then later I'm gonna make espresso ice cream I want to make a great big beef stew for Jeffrey and I need rosemary and bay leaves I both in my garden Rosemary's one of my favorite herbs I've always been small fan inside but I want a big plant I've got one outside it's great with lamb and marinades gonna be really good miss beef stew [Music] and now I just need a few bay leaves we're going to marinate the meat for the beef stew and they leaves red wine to be just delicious I actually call this beef stew Parker's beef stew because it was originally made by the chef of barren desert oh so wonderful Parker Hodges so what I've done is I have two and a half pounds of beef it's chuck and I've cut it in cubes you can always have the butcher do it but I prefer to do it myself say end up with sort of regular sized cubes otherwise you have a tiny little pieces and big pieces but you can do that so I'm going to marinate it and that's really what makes Parker's beef stew so delicious three cloves of garlic I'm actually smashed in the cloves of garlic I don't chop them up cuz I don't want to cook them with the beef I wish the map flavor over cooked garlic is not pretty mmm it really releases all the oil okay that's one and I'm going to put in maybe two or three fresh bay leaves and this is the good part a whole bottle of red wine something like a Cabernet Sauvignon so I'm going to marinate the beef in this red wine but I'm also going to use it when I took the sauce okay just stir it all up you I can already smell the flavor so that's a red wine flavor and the garlic so I'm gonna marinate this for a few hours but you can certainly do it overnight it only gets better [Music] so I'm ready to make the beef stew i marinated the beef for a few hours now what I'm going to do is drain it but I want to save the marinade cuz when these later for cooking roll it around that seasoned flour and then saute it in olive oil okay so I've got lots of great vegetables I've taken onions and chopped them up and I have a pound of carrots just going to cut big chunks I like what it looks like big chunks just cut the carrots evenly so that they cook and exactly the same amount of time okay so that's the carrots I'll get carrots onions garlic sun-dried tomatoes potatoes which I'm going to cut them quarters these are great they're Yukon Gold the data so they're sort of that buttery yellow if there's small potatoes cut them in half if they're big cut them in quarters and you don't even have to peel them and the last thing is a half a pound of mushrooms just cut the stems just slice them in half this is a great thing to make for parties first of all I think people really expect something more elegant for a party and they're just thrilled to have beef stew but the second thing is it really sits very well it just tastes better it the longer it sits okay that's all the vegetables that looks great wonder how the beasts doing Oh perfect just going to turn each piece so brands evenly used to have to be that you cook stew for four or five hours until it was really tender because the chuck was very tough but I think meat is much tenderer now that equality and so two or three hours in the evidence will be delicious okay that's done it smells wonderful you really smell the wine that the marinade and view than the sea okay I'm just a little more oil and I'm going to cook all the vegetables and potatoes it's really hot be really careful it's hot the onions it's too large onions just saw TVs for about 10 minutes so they start to brown sautéing the vegetables gives them so much flavor and also because they're going to pick up the beef flavor from the pan so this is the marinade that the beef k matta so strain it vegetables are done so I'm going to put the garlic into the sauté pan and sauté the garlic I put it in the last minute so it doesn't burn this smells so good the carrots and onions and potatoes and now the garlic just wonderful just don't want to hurry you want the onions to be really thoroughly cooked and then take this whole thing and pour it into the pot that's going in the oven just dump it mmm what is that some oak red ok now I'm going to deglaze the pan two and a half cups of the marinade and it's so wine that's going to do that and just scrape up any brown bits that are in the pan because that's really what's going to flavor the sauce ok just going to pour that into the our pot kinda nice and clean the kidnap mmm that's what make a really nice sauce ok now more things to flavor the sauce two cups of chicken stock I always have some in the freezer two tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce gives it real depth of flavor one tablespoon of salt sounds like a lot but it's a lot of beef stew two teaspoons of pepper and then to give it lots of flavor half a cup of sun-dried tomatoes and one sprig of fresh rosemary well this goes really wonderful the rosemary into the stock and then just mix it up a little bit this is gonna be so good all the flavors are going to Mel together potatoes and carrots and onions sun-dried tomatoes and the sauce and be so delicious into the oven 304 two to three hours and the beat is going to be so tender vegetables are going to be cooked in the sauce is gonna be so wonderful time to freeze the espresso ice cream that looks so good it's nice and called and this is the insert for the ice cream machine comes out of the freezer so it's really cold just going to pour this in and love that you can see the espresso went out and I'm going to chill this in the ice cream machine until it's almost frozen with this insert in secret mission turn it on it's going to freeze until it's almost hard and just before I put it into the freezer I'm going to turn up the flavor with chopped chocolate covered espresso beans how good does that sound [Music] I'm crushing a chocolate-covered espresso beans to put in my coffee ice cream for Jeffrey he's going to really love this these are actually very cool because it's chocolate it's going to hold espresso bean right in the middle so good if you can't find them you can always find coffee flavored beans that you chopped up but something that has a little crunch like that it's really wonderful and the chocolate and the coffee together is particularly great and I'm just going to put it right in it'll mix in with the ice cream who is that going to be good okay it never freezes really hard in the ice cream freezer so I was like to put it into the freezer to freeze completely it needs at least an hour in the freezer to get the consistency of ice cream okay so I'm going to put it into a container and put it in the freezer does not look gorgeous which everybody save some of this for me it looks really good okay into the freezer and he's gonna have espresso ice cream for dinner well I'm almost home and mine is the wait for the evening he will typically leave me a ton of food in the refrigerator it's really tough being mr. Gordon some of that two or three hours the Sioux should be ready it smells so good in here oh that's a lot oh that looks just fabulous we're just going to make sure the meats done justjust it with a fork if it's tender it's done and when this sauce looks looks freedom is he actually I'm going to put one package of frozen peas in I'm just going to let them defrost and just cook in let us do the next thing i want to make for him is a little something for breakfast so i'm from the oven from 300 to 400 degrees then i'm going to make cranberry orange scones he's going to be really spoiled i'm going to start with 4 cups of flour according to cup of sugar 2 teaspoons of baking powder it looks really nice little mind kitschy spoons of salt makes a lot of scones mix it together chip is pearl orange zest it's just cost great can't make scones with that butter so it's got three quarters of a pound of butter just want very very cold butter what a cubed reason why you um cold butter is because you wanted to stay together so when it goes into the oven and the heat hits the butter the water makes this going pop up and get nice light flaky scones okay three comes a pound of butter I'm just going to turn the mixer on low and just mix it until the butter is really about the size of peas okay next thing I need is for eggs it's going to beat them up we want to make sure all the ingredients are really cold so the butter stays called and a cup of heavy cream ok it's just the size of people it's going to make it very wet dough but a good ok now I'm going to add some cranberries but I quarter of a cup of dried cranberries quarter of a cup of flour to make sure they mix nicely through the mixture dried cranberries are better than fresh cranberries fresh grandpa's old too hard for this ok and then slowly put them in so they get mixed into the dough Thanks it's alive oh just a good thing about these scones is they can sit in the refrigerator for a while before I baked them and I can freeze the dough and bake them off as I need them ok it was great I can smell the orange see the cranberry ok I like she's rolling silver flower it a little bit roll it out to Beth well maybe about three quarters of an inch to an inch thick and handle it as little as possible so the butter doesn't melt I'm going to do around so that's about three quarters of an inch sheet pan lined with parchment paper and just are just brush the tub quickly with lightly with a little egg wash it gives them a really nice brown color just sprinkle a little sugar just a nice shine okay into the oven 20 to 25 minutes 400 degrees and Jeffrey's gonna have a really good breakfast [Music] and I'm going to make the rest of the stones of free [Music] so the cranberry orange goes are cooled more is looking for ways to give everything more flavor so I thought why don't I make an orange glaze for them it's really simple half a cup of confectioner's sugar a little bit of orange juice and lifters al on top [Music] probably about three teaspoons and before just want to thick enough so it's a glaze but thin enough so I can pour it if you get it too thick you can have a little more juice if you get it to the fins you can just add a little more confectioner sugar actually love the way it looks it's on so it should be just about that consistency thick but you can pour it ok little drizzle of the scones I some scones left over I'm going to freeze the dough and then I'm going to bake them off before I want to serve them and then once they're cooled she was living with orange plays extra these are cool spoon just like that I take Jeffers can have very nice breakfast okay I'm off no for Jeffrey why do I think he's gonna start on the ice cream gotta go hello hi sweetie oh just great are you
