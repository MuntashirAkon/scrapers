[Music] it's Saturday and Geoffrey's coming home from a long trip so I'm gonna plan dinner for tonight and tomorrow night so we can spend the rest of the weekend just having fun for tomorrow's dinner I'm making everyone's favorite comfort food mac and cheese with a mescaline salad to us with creamy mustard vinaigrette and to finish a delicious lemon tart but for tonight we're having big steaming bowls of mussels in white wine [Music] when it comes to comfort food I'd say mac and cheese is pretty high in everybody's list so for dinner tomorrow night I thought I'd make a grown-up mac and cheese with bacon and blue cheese how bad can that be so the first thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna just cook the bacon and instead of doing it in a pan with it's spattering all over the place I like to do it on a baking rack in the oven okay into the oven 400 degrees for about 15 to 20 minutes until it's nice and crisp and browned [Music] [Music] okay next to cook the pasta and that's gonna cook for about ten or eleven minutes now I'm going to make a white sauce throw the same white sauce you'd make for any bread tan or pot pie once you've mastered it it's really easy okay so I need one and a half cups of milk and I'm going to heat it up and then another pot two tablespoons of butter [Music] turn on the heat two tablespoons of flour so I'm just gonna cook these together for about two minutes you don't want the butter to burn whisk them together so this cook butter and flour is gonna act as a thickener for the sauce now when add the hot milk to it and it's gonna thicken it okay I'm just gonna cook that over low heat until it just gets a little thicker looking good though okay and the meantime gonna get the cheese is ready so I'm using three different kinds of cheeses videos Greer first cuz it's got a nice nutty flavor it's not great it can actually do this in a food processor - it's really fast but it's not a lot of cheese so I'll just do it by hand okay I need about it half a cup so that's fine and the next one is cheddar putting English cheddar nice sharp okay I need about 1/3 of a cup of cheddar that's perfect and the last Jesus Roquefort and what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna crumble about two ounces into the sauce it's gonna give it a really nice piquant tangy flavor okay let's see how this is doing oh the white sauce is just perfect now it's thickened it's not incredibly thick but what it does is just coat the spoon so now off the heat I'm going to add all the cheese's so 1/2 a cup of Greer third of a cup of cheddar and about two ounces of Roquefort you can really use any kind of bleu cheese but Brooke for it has a particularly wonderful flavor a little bit of nutmeg it's a really classic spice that's used in gret ounce you sort of won't know what's there but it'll make everything else taste better give it a stir so the cheese is all melted [Music] that's a much better way to do bacon so it's not splattering all over the place just chop it up just put it right in okay have to drain the pasta [Music] so I'm just gonna put this break back into the sauce to stir it around [Music] this is so easy to make in a large quantity but it's just Geoffrey names making it for two and the best thing is I can make it today and bake it off tomorrow night I can spend tomorrow with Geoffrey instead of cooking ok a little bit of a topping so it's sort of crunchy on the top so take just take two pieces of white bread cut off the crust and just chop them up put them in the bowl of a food processor with the steel blade and just a little bit of fresh basil a couple leaves let's put it right in the food processor with a bread just pulse it until its crumbs okay and just right on top of the mac and cheese so it's creamy on the bottom and crunchy on the top okay into the fridge I'm gonna bake it tomorrow knife for cozy and comforting dinner for Jeffrey me [Music] for dessert tomorrow night I'm gonna make a lemon curd tart usually you have to make tarts just before you eat them but I'm going to show you how to do it a day in advance so I need 12 tablespoons of butter and then absolutely positively need to be room temperature I have a cup of sugar I'm just gonna cream that together 1/2 a teaspoon of vanilla this is really a shortbread recipe very very simple and it's absolutely delicious okay those are blended and now I need 1 and 3/4 cups of flour and I'm gonna sift it just because I think it's a great way to make sure the flour doesn't have any lumps in it perfect pinch of salt instead of rolling it out like traditional pastry I'm gonna press it into the pan so that's the flour and the salt I'm just going to put very slowly into the butter I'm doing this on a low speed so it doesn't get whipped [Music] let it get combined until it starts to pull together that's ready so spread it around the pan and then just with with a little bit of flour on my hands I'm just gonna press it right into the pan and this is why it's so important that the butter is at room temperature I actually make all different kinds of tarts like this I make fruit tarts a little bit of raspberry jam raspberry tart with Jeffrey love lemon tarts okay now here's my other little trick is use the edge of the cup measure to make a nice crisp edge so that's the pastry shell done I'm gonna chill it before I bake it and next I'm gonna make the lemon curd for the filling Jeffrey's gonna love this [Music] time to bake the pastry for my lemon curd tart I'll show you how I do this so it's called blind baking and what you do is you put the cold pastry shell on a sheet pan and then take aluminum foil so I'm just going to butter this so it doesn't stick to the pastry and then just put it right inside the shell and then just take a container of beans I just have some red beans that I had in the pantry and pour them right in and this is gonna keep the pastry from sort of puffing up and losing its shape and a bake it this way 350 degrees for about 20 minutes until it just starts to bake and then I'm gonna move the beans and finish baking it until it's nice and browned actually love dahlias whichever comes home tonight I'm gonna make a steaming pot of mussels but somehow fresh flowers from the garden always make it look special that's perfect for a Boz on the counter okay their flowers are done I'm going to finish tomorrow's dinner and then I'm gonna make mussels in white wine for dinner tonight first baking of the tart shell should be done I'm gonna take out the beans so now if I'm lucky this will come out easily that's why you greased it so it comes out I'm just gonna put them back in the container so I can store them in the pantry for the next time I make it tart okay then now the next thing I need to do is just take a fork and prick holes all the way through this tart shell and that'll prevent it from puffing up in the middle all the way around okay into the oven for another 20 minutes until it's nice and browned and delicious [Music] Jeffrey's on his way home I want to finish the lemon tart so I can get started on tonight's dinner so I'm gonna make lemon curd to fill the tart show with I like really tart lemon curd so lots of lemon zest okay so that's the peel of four lemons I'm gonna put it in the food processor one and a half cups of sugar and then I'm just gonna process it with the steel blade just until the lemon zest is really finely chopped they've got lemon infused sugar okay that's it so now the next thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna cream some butter let's take a butter and then add the sugar and lemon zest I'm gonna get all of it so now I'm gonna do four eggs one at a time [Music] okay I'm just gonna scrape down the bowl make sure it's really well mixed so I need a pinch of salt half a cup of freshly squeezed lemon juice there's no substitute for freshly squeezed lemon juice don't even think about using the stuff in the bottle perfect half cup of lemon juice mix it up okay that's perfect now what I want to do isn't gonna cook it until it's thickened pour it into the into a pan the key to this is to cook it slowly so it doesn't boil cuz otherwise it'll curdle truly like a custard lemon curd it's great to have around the house actually because it's good for breakfast on toast instead of jam and it lasts in the refrigerator for weeks at the end of this cooking you really want to watch it very carefully because it can curdle pretty fast I think the pastry shell is done perfect nice and brown a little let it cool here I'm going to leave it out on the countertop overnight and then I'm going to chill the lemon curd and tomorrow I'm going to put these both together so this is just perfect now cut gorgeous does it [Music] and it should be just the right amount for the tart shell but I won't be disappointed if there's any leftover into the fridge I'll have a lemon tart for Jeffrey tomorrow and no chicken tonight I'm making Jeffrey's favorite mussels marinara [Music] mussels in white wine it's one of Jeffrey and my favorite things to have when we're in France so I thought it'd be really fun to make them for Jeffrey so for two of us I've got three pounds of mussels I'm just gonna fill the ball with water and then put a little bit of flour in the water and what this does is it takes gets the mussels to give up any sand that's in them okay it smells like to see so while these are soaking I'm gonna make a wine broth with lots of garlic and shallots heat up two tablespoons of olive oil and two tablespoons of butter I'm gonna chop up lots of shallots just roughly chop them this is a great dish it's just served huge balls of steaming mussels with lots of wine broth or shallots and garlic big chunks of French bread okay one cup of chopped shallots right into the oil and butter and then I need like five or six cloves of garlic just chop them up it's a really garlicky dish it's wonderful okay I'm just gonna cook these for a few minutes until the shallots are translucent and the garlic's cooked in the meantime I'm gonna get some tomatoes ready I need about 1/2 a cup of canned tomatoes I'm just gonna chop them up in them and the measure they don't have to be perfect just a rough chop [Music] okay now I need a little saffron which I love it's stamens of crocuses which is why it's so expensive just comfort about a half a teaspoon of saffron it could smell saffron already need some fresh parsley chop it up [Music] okay right in it's a fresh time [Music] not the stat was just the leaves that's about a third of a cup of parsley a bad tablespoon of thyme okay that should do it okay now I need a cup of white wine I've picked a really nice dry white wine something I drink for dinner and this is what's gonna steam the mussels mmm now I'm gonna see how the mussels are doing so they've been soaking in the flour and if you feel a little bit of sand so it was good that we did it because my brother all closed really tight so this one doesn't seem to want to close so I'm gonna discard that just gonna take them out of the water drain them into the dog just toss a little bit with the bra we put on the lid eight to ten minutes and dinner's ready [Music] fine hello you are dreamy when these two I know hey when you're away well it's Saturday night yeah it'll be like Friday night there's no chicken involved yeah I made somebody really special for you oh I can't wait [Music] so what do you think we should do tomorrow you know I was thinking let's just really take a little vacation go to say garber okay I walk on the dock yeah we look at the boat back walk down Main Street push what a wonderful that's Saturday night dinner but I have a question what we're gonna be so busy how we're gonna work in dinner at home you know babe I got that covered I love our weekends together right we [Music] [Music] we're hanging out here we're having a great time and I don't understand how you're gonna make it I can't tell you all my secrets you know but I just don't understand how you're gonna do that's my purpose in life is making you a good dinner mm-hmm [Music] Jeffery's not gonna believe how fast I can make dinner I've got mac and cheese with blue cheese and bacon the lemon curd tart mac and cheese gonna bake 400 degrees for 35 to 40 minutes it's gonna be bubbly and crunchy on the top it's gonna be really good and now I just have to finish the lemon curd tart so to put the lemon curd in the tart since it's been in the refrigerator for a while I'm just gonna heat it up a little bit and then pour it into the cold shell just a little just enough so it's really runny and then it'll cool in the shell that looks delicious just for a second you can really see the lemon zest and this just looks wonderful just needs to warm it up just enough so that it can pour it into the shell and then while the mac and cheese bakes and we have dinner this'll just set now how simple is that okay so while that cools I'm gonna make a nice salad to go with the mac and cheese so I need a little bit of olive oil that half a cup tablespoon of red wine vinegar maybe half a tablespoon of mustard just a little drop of honey just to give it a little sweetness salt and pepper okay I'm just gonna whisk that together and then I'm gonna add some shallots okay just a little bit of shallot give it a little spice some mescaline mix just great cuz already washed and dried and delicious little lettuces and then just enough vinaigrette to moisten it see how that mustard really Mull suffice it toss it all together gonna be wonderful honey dinner's ready how did you whip up this unbelievable dish when we were together all afternoon I have a secret and I'm gonna tell me your secrets after all these years of marriage you can hold the secret from me well that it's really good technic this is mac and cheese like I've never had so what do you think of lemon tart it just looks so good [Music] hmm I would say there was a perfect end to the perfect day I would

soaking in the flour and if you feel a little bit of sand so it was good that we did it I'm just make sure they're all close really tight so this one doesn't seem to want to close so I'm gonna discard that I'm just gonna take them out of the water drain them into the club just trust me with it just a bra we put on the whip eight to ten minutes and dinner's ready [Music] fine hello you are my name

the mac and cheese bakes and we have dinner this'll just set now how simple is that okay so while that cools I'm gonna make a nice salad to go with the mac and cheese so I need a little bit of olive oil about half a cup tablespoon of red wine vinegar maybe half a tablespoon of mustard just a little drop of honey just to give it a little sweetness salt and pepper my cream just gonna whisk that together and I'm gonna add some shallots okay just a little bit of shallot give it a little spice some mescaline mix just great cuz already washed and dried and delicious little lettuces and then just enough vinaigrette to moisten it see how that mustard really mull suffice it toss it all together gonna be wonderful honey dinner's ready how did you whip up this unbelievable dish when we were together all afternoon I have a secret and I'm gonna tell me your secrets after all these years of marriage you're gonna hold the secret from me well that it's really good check then this is mac and cheese like I've never had so what do you think of lemon tart it just looks so good [Music] hmm ah let's say there was a perfect end to the perfect day I would say absolutely right and there's nowhere that I'd rather be than home with you meet you wherever just roughly chop them this is a great dish it's just served huge balls of steaming mussels with lots of wine broth or shallots and garlic big chunks of French bread okay one cup of chopped shallots right into the oil and butter I'm gonna need like five or six cloves of garlic just chop them up it's a really garlicky dish it's wonderful okay I'm just gonna cook these for a few minutes until the shallots are translucent and the garlic's cooked in the meantime I'm gonna get some tomatoes ready I need about 1/2 a cup of canned tomatoes I'm just gonna chop them up in there and the measure they don't have to be perfect just a rough chop [Music] okay now I need a little saffron I love its stamens of crocuses which is why it's so expensive it's going to put about a half a teaspoon of saffron in could smell saffron already need some fresh parsley chop it up [Music] okay right in the fresh thyme [Music] not the stems just the leaves that's about a third of a cup of parsley I just have some red beans that I had in the pantry and pour them right in and this is gonna keep the pastry from sort of puffing up and losing its shape and a bake it this way 350 degrees for about 20 minutes until it just starts to bake and then I'm gonna move the beans and finish baking it until it's nice and browned actually love dahlias whichever comes home tonight I'm gonna make a steaming pot of mussels but somehow fresh flowers from the garden always make it look special that's perfect for a Boz on the counter okay their flowers are done I'm gonna finish tomorrow's dinner and then I'm gonna make mussels in white wine for dinner tonight first baking of the tart shell should be done I'm gonna take out the beans so now if I'm lucky this look I'm at easily that's why you greased it so it comes out I'm just gonna put them back in the container so I can store them in the pantry the next time that make it tart okay then now the next thing I need to do is just take a fork and prick just chop it up put it right in okay time to drain the pasta [Music] so I'm just gonna put this break back into the sauce to stir it around this is so easy to make it a large quantity but since it's just Geoffrey names making it for two and the best thing is I can make it today and bake it off tomorrow night I can spend tomorrow with Geoffrey instead of cooking okay a little bit of a topping so it's sort of crunchy on the top so take just take two pieces of white bread cut off the crust and just chop them up put them in the bowl of a food processor with a steel blade and just a little bit of fresh basil a couple of leaves let's put it right in the food processor with bread just pulse it until its crumbs okay and just right on top of the mac and cheese so it's creamy on the bottom and crunchy on the top okay into the fridge I'm gonna bake it tomorrow night for cozy and comforting dinner for Jeffrey and me okay I'm just gonna cook that over low heat until it just gets a little thicker looking good though okay and the meantime gonna get the cheese is ready so I'm using three different kinds of cheeses news Greer first cuz it's got a nice nutty flavor it's not great it can actually do this in a food processor - it's really fast but it's not a lot of cheese so I'll just do it by hand okay I need about it half a cup so that's fine and the next one is cheddar putting English cheddar nice sharp okay I need about 1/3 of a cup of cheddar that's perfect and the last Jesus Roquefort and what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna crumble about two ounces into the sauce it's gonna give it a really nice peak comp tangy flavor
