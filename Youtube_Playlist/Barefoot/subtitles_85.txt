[Music] one of my dearest friends Patricia wells is coming for the weekend she's an incredible cookbook author actually we have such a good time together my husband Jeffrey is always threatening to send the fun police after us what's amazing about Patricia particularly is over the last few years she's gotten very fit she's lost 40 pounds let me tell you I'm impressed so we're gonna have a weekend of good food and healthy living and we're gonna be great time together my friend Patricia is coming after a really long trip from Paris and I thought wouldn't it be nice to just greet her with like big steaming bowls of chili but since she's being really good I thought maybe I instead of making beef chili I'd make chicken chili so I've got about four cups of onions and two tablespoons of olive oil and they cooked until you can really smell them about ten minutes and I'm gonna have lots of good stuff two tablespoons of chopped garlic this is gonna be really good want to cook garlic for just a minute so it doesn't get really bitter and two yellow peppers and 2 red peppers this is a really quick way to cut peppers just straight down and then what's left over you can use for snacking and I'm just going to big chunks that chili should be big chunks of good stuff so peppers good thing about chili is you can make it days in advance and it's just delicious in fact it's even better so the flavors blend together so well how does a big party stew lots of vegetables chicken okay now all the good spices first thing of course is chili powder so I've got he's for chili powder teaspoon of cumin which is a really essential ingredient all Chili's and then these are the things that make it hot red pepper just sort of a pinch of it maybe quarter teaspoon and then cayenne pepper which is really hot so use it at your own risk I like when things have a lot of flavor and a little bit of heat but if you like it really hot just add more okay then lots of salt it's really critical for bringing out the flavor and the spices so two teaspoons of salt this is great and I'm gonna cook that for about a minute while I get the tomatoes ready show you about the tomatoes I always with canned tomatoes life's too short to peel a tomato so just go chop them up really quickly put in two 28-ounce cans of tomatoes try not to get it all over the kitchen like I do give this stirrer so most chili has cilantro in it but I personally hate cilantro so I'm gonna put basil in instead it gives it great flavor just take the leaves off I'll just give it a really rough chop so maybe about a quarter of a cup should be good I'm different so it's gonna cook for about 30 minutes chicken smells like it's just about done you can tell when the chickens done when springs back when you touch it oh that's hot do you think this is enough chicken for Patricia and me so I'm gonna let that cool I'm gonna add to the sauce and Patricia and I are gonna have two wishes chicken chili my first role of overnight gas is only invite people you really love so I want to make them incredibly comfortable so they stay for a long time first things fly just one big buzz of tulips one color it's really simple and it's gorgeous and I know we're being good but chocolates on the pillow it's really important [Music] and a great bathroom with lots of little beauty treats great soap I don't know about you but I always forget my toothbrush and toothpaste and I always like to have nice fragrances for her she can try them all out and some bath gel and body lotion and it's Patricia's home away from home [Music] already it smells so good I can smell it all the way upstairs all the flavors and everything's cooked perfectly so now I'm gonna add the chicken it's not so hot anymore so this is a chicken that I cooked on the bone with the skin on it and it really keeps it moist I just tested all different kinds of ways of doing this and I found it's so much better roasting it than it is to boil it with the way you normally do it for a chicken like this Patricius on a book tour for her new book Provence and I can't wait to see it so just sort of tear off the bone with your hands it's the best way to do it so big chunks I want it to be really delicious and chunky right into the pot I'll just stir it around just gonna cook for about 20 minutes all the flavors get into the chicken and chili and cumin basil tomatoes [Music] and that's the topic it's a good part of the Chile and you may get few that are really good for you and a few that are naughty good sharp cheddar sour cream good salty corn chips so I just want to really rough great on the cheddar that should be enough for the two of us Saturday knife is really great for cutting Tomatoes your fingers and a quarter [Music] good sour cream for anybody wants to be really naughty lots of red onions toppings are done and now all I knew is Patricia the fun okay let's say you're in charge of choking great let's set the tables all set Oh beautiful got chicken chili Wow really hot oh I don't know what time zone you're in but I hope you're right curry I know - it's a very honored dishes ok good ok and let's have fun so we got all kinds of toppings cheese a little sour cream yeah sour cream some chips did you just create this like in the shower healthier if I made chicken chili so I just particularly instead brilliant it's been been one of Jeffrey's favorites I'd say we're gonna have to stay one step ahead of the fun police I agree I know it looks like Patricia and I are having martinis for breakfast we're not not a bad idea but today I'm gonna make her very berry fruit salad and put it in martini glasses so I'll have something great and love Patricia's recipes they're really easy and they're really delicious so this is three berries and I'm gonna marinate it in balsamic vinegar with a little mint on top so this is totally flexible recipe you can make it for two you can make it for 50 and because it's marinating you want to sit a little bit in the fridge so but since it's just for two I'll juice like half a pint of strawberries half a pint of raspberries don't never wash raspberries because they absorb water and half a pint of blueberries just make sure they're good with what before they go in there great fantastic okay and then the sonic vinegar this is really great balsamic vinegar is vinegar that's aged in oak barrels and it has great flavor and it's like great wine the longer it sits the better it is this is a really old balsamic vinegar and it's like syrupy it's sort of like the consistency of maple syrup and it's just great so just one tablespoon on all these berries looks so good quarter of a cup of sugar just to sweeten it up a little bit I don't me do a little less toss it all together you have to admit that was pretty easy and then I'm just gonna let it sit for a little bit and the vinegar and the sugar is going to draw some of the juices out of the berries so into the glasses perfect we're gonna ride him out to Patricia good morning help yourself to fruit salad and anything else do it and I'm off to the grocery store [Music] look at all these flowers are incredible really hard for me to pass up arms to us but I'm gonna have to focus I'm here for herbal iced tea [Music] - left me notes saying I'm a charge in the kitchen so I'm gonna make a dessert for tonight one of my favorite desserts yogurt sorbet which is a very very simple recipe it starts with three egg whites that we're gonna beat slowly for about a minute until they're frothy and then we're going to add slowly add 2/3 cup of sugar letting it get a little faster [Music] I think I'm gonna have a little bit of breakfast first I love this kind of stuff left over here's the tea let's see what would be good ginger a red zinger would be good and I think lemon zinger together would be fabulous I'm using low-fat yogurt here three cups of yogurt and France would actually use something called fromage blanc which is very similar a little more tangy flavor Oh apple juice that would be good instead of sugar and then we're just gonna fold this in so of course if you're pregnant or elderly or have some fragile issues you probably don't want to use we're all egg whites just keep a little bit of air in there Garcia I'm doing great I'm 80 I love easy desserts like this [Music] okay I'm just gonna make a note to ina to turn off the machine in about thirty minutes and let her know that I'm off to the fish market there's a note turn off the machine I can do that oh she's got something going on here oh this looks like your yogurt survey I've never tasted it makes your mind so good it's like frozen yogurt yeah okay into the container I bet it was easy to knowing Patricia's recipes for a meal but I don't it doesn't get settled until I go to the market and see what's fresh because there's nothing nothing nothing worse than saying oh I want salmon and the salmon doesn't look very good so we'll see what we find at the market [Music] into the freezer and I think there might be some berries left over for breakfast and there are mmm that's my breakfast I love when Patricia comes to visit we have such a good time cooking and shopping who knew balsamic vinegar and berries could be so good together [Music] look at these crap beautiful meat herbal iced tea it's delicious and it's good for you how unlikely is that so it's really simple I'll show you it's for red zinger tea bags two four four lemon zinger tea bags two for my husband and I had a drink like this and asked him we were skiing once it raised home to make it and I'm just gonna pour hot water in so I'm just deep this for about 10 minutes and I'm gonna mix it with apple juice it'll be naturally sweetened it would be just delicious really special I got some real nice double up that is gorgeous you don't have a great recipe for crab selling so I think I'll take a pound of that [Music] that's great perfect necessary today wonderful okay over here up front okay that's a great choice [Music] okay this should be steep enough I'm just gonna fix the tea bags out I always make sure I get a lot of this team made everybody loves it okay apple juice don't even have to measure heads apple juice [Music] that's it that's gonna be good with dinner Wow look at all that crab meat thank you guys you didn't pick it yourself okay as opposed to usual you're the boss of me now I do a prep for you you want to set this line okay and I like to use this ester just right into the right answer they're ready to bear and then we're gonna juice it and we're gonna add some mayonnaise maybe a little salt to taste we'll see how that goes and I thought we'd also do a Shifa not a mint to go in there without end I'll show you why I like to do a sheikh fahad there's a 20 okay baby I can have that and juice that okay then I'll start out Italian aise all right I'm gonna juice these I'm gonna have another feast tonight oh this is unbelievable crab meat wobbly overboard yeah I would add all that cuz I think this is so nice it's wonderful because it makes it really fresh - it's not great yeah so let's do the Shifa nod okay the way I like to do it okay we'll take about four or five leaves like what is this in for Tricia I know what you do is you roll it up like a cigar yeah nice and tight and then just the nice okay that's great you have any green herbs isn't that great basil and mint and that's it and that's it this is really easy it's all we have to do is mount it on the plate I think I need to taste it though don't leave it any good I don't know I'm not so sure that lovely no it's wonderful the mint and the lime it's just all the dozens I got the cramp hey you know what I love about visuals like that when you're looking at it they're so similar if you don't know what's gonna go in your mouth so then it's likes to surprise a little bit of lime a little bit missus right how about you put it on the plate um and if everyone know people are gonna think all we ever do is sit around and eat are they wrong a little mint maybe a slice of lime and I would say dinner served Ryan terrific a little herbal iced tea to go with it that what do you feel great I love you why'd you bring now yogurt sorbet right oh it looks so good lovely I might have tasted it while it was still in the machine did you really yeah I might uh oh that's great it's like the perfect texture so good yummy so refreshing thank you for teaching man and make this I'll be making anyone and this is so light I know but why do I think we're gonna be at the refrigerator later so good but this smells great okay cinnamon sugar for you right oh yeah and if you don't sit down at your table it doesn't count right that's right [Laughter]
