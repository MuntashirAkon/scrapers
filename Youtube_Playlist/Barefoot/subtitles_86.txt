[Music] my friend Michael grooms having a really hectic day today so I've invited him for dinner tonight this is the time for good old-fashioned comfort food Michael actually grew up in a farm in Pennsylvania I understand as long as a fabulous cook so I know it's exactly what he's gonna want to eat I think I'll make oven fried chicken which is all crispy on the outside and juicy inside mashed potatoes with sour cream old-fashioned hearts of lettuce and tomatoes with blue cheese dressing and for dessert good old deep-dish apple pie it sounds pretty comforting to me [Music] so traditionally there are two problems with fried chicken one is all that grease i'm the second one is you have to do it just before you serve it I'm going to show you how to do it the oven solves both those problems first thing you sit it up on this little rear end take your knife and there's a backbone here that I'm gonna take out and you want to run your knife right along both sides of that backbone keep your fingers out of the way okay that's the backbone not great in fried chicken fabulous and soup so I'll save it for later so then you want to have the chicken flat out like this and there's this little part in the breastbone just want to make it with your knife and then run your fingers down both sides of this little bone and then pull it right out just should come out in one fell swoop okay and now it's really easy to cut up just run your knife right down the back flip it over cut the leg from the white meat cut the legs on the side just pull it back it's easy to see where the bones connect so I've got 8 pieces I'm ready for fried chicken now I'm gonna put all the chicken in One Bowl and I'm gonna pour buttermilk over it and it's gonna tenderize it the acid and the buttermilk really makes the chicken very tender and a poor quart of buttermilk over it this is good for two chickens but I only have one so what you want to do is get the buttermilk in them around the chicken parts okay wash up [Music] okay I'm gonna marinate this for a few hours but if you have overnight it's even better I have such a busy day today so many places to go the rain since to do the saving grace is dinner at Ines tonight all I'm gonna do is sit down and eat they're set to go [Music] in the world of comfort food I don't think there's anything more comforting or deep-dish apple pie so I've got the apples and look gorgeous from the farm and now I'm just gonna make pie crust I don't know why but I think people find pie crust more daunting than anything else that we make I'm going to show you the secret of really good pie crust and it's about very cold ingredients so I'm going to start with 3 cups of flour for the shortening there's all kinds of debates all kind of shortening to use for pie crust but I actually combine vegetable shortening and I do it very cold to consider the refrigerator and butter and then you get all of the flakiness of the vegetable shortening and all the flavor of the butter so that's a third of a cup of vegetable shortening and I've wanted to have sticks of cold butter that I've diced and I actually put it back in the refrigerator until I was ready so it's really cold put that right in and now comes the critical part what you want in the dough is little bits of butter and shortening through the dough you don't want to totally pureed and that's what makes it flaky when the heat from the oven hits the butter it causes steam to evaporate and that's what makes it really flaky so when you're doing this make sure it's not totally pureed in the flour I'm just going to pulse this about 8 times until it's like the size of peas maybe 10 times so you can still see bits of butter and shortening in the flour and that's what's gonna make really flaky pastry I'm gonna do maybe one more okay so the next thing is ice water and I need about eight tablespoons which is about 1/2 a cup so we pour out the ice excellent so I'm going to turn this on and just let it go run until it forms a ball okay we're there so now I'm gonna refrigerate it for about 30 minutes it's a really important part of making good pie pastry really careful this thing is sharp put it in the fridge for 30 minutes which gives me time to make my really old-fashioned blue cheese dressing with tomatoes and hearts of lettuce my friend Michaels having a really hard day and I thought I'd make them a very old-fashioned dinner starting with lettuce and tomato with blue cheese dressing so I have four ounces of Roquefort blue cheese 1 cup of mayonnaise this is gonna make a lot of blue cheese dressing but it's good to have around a cup of cream since the blue cheese is kind of sweet a little vinegar 2 teaspoons of tarragon vinegar are gonna give it a little bit of a bite which is good 1 teaspoon of salt and 1/2 a teaspoon of pepper how easy is that can just puree it you don't want to pureed a little chunky nice I just got a phone call from a client last-minute dinner party so she needs flowers and I'm trying to rescue her I feel like the flying doctor of flower [Music] okay now for the filling and teach - apple pie four pounds of apples cut up in big chunks and I'm gonna flavor it with a little bit of orange zest and lemon zest one tablespoon of orange juice and two tablespoons of lemon juice this not only flavors it but it keeps the apples were turning brown half a cup of sugar it all depends on how sweet the apples are these are pretty tart quarter cup of flour and teaspoon of salt I know it's surprising to put salt in a pie but it really brings out the flavor of the spices in the apples okay now for the spices three Carozza bautista the good cinnamon 1/2 a teaspoon who couldn't up Meg hmm I love the way it smells smells like apple pie spice is already okay eighth of a teaspoon of allspice we're just really a pinch I'm just gonna mix it all up now if that doesn't look like old-fashioned home cooking I don't know what does I'd say this is gonna make Michael feel all better [Music] obviously these here perfect hi Peggy everything [Music] this is the key to rolling out dough is you start from the middle and work your way out I also keep it moving you don't want to roll out a perfect circle and then you can't get it up off the stone not a good idea this is a really great pie dough for any kind of pie pecan pie pumpkin pie apple pie okay that should be good so the easiest way to get into the pie plate let's take the dough roll it right up around the rolling pin and then just ease it in this is next really important step don't stretch the dough if you stretch the dough if you pull it into the pie pan when it hits the heat it's going to shrink right back so push it and sort of press it in into the form so you don't stretch it at all and just in case of tears just take a little bit of water on your fingers and press it right back together again it'll be just fine okay that's the bottom crust and then right into the crust it's a lot of apples for this pie crust but I like it when it's piled high mile high apple pie okay now for the top crust [Music] ready for the pie roll it up on the rolling pin [Music] and I'll really gently over you there's so many different ways to crimp a pie I think everybody likes to do with the way their mother did it but what I like to do is just roll the top crust underneath the bottom one I want to make this really old-fashioned looking okay once that's done you can either to crimp it with a fork crimping is about keeping the two crusts together so it seals in the juices or you can do it with your fingers I think I'll do it with my fingers yeah okay crimped now I'm gonna do an egg wash it's gonna make the crust really nice and brown which is one egg beaten with about a tablespoon of water or milk or whatever you have just brush the whole top okay a little bit of sugar make it nice and shiny and then just a few holes on the top to let the steam escape so the crust gets nice and crisp sort of old-fashioned okay into the oven 400 degrees for about an hour and hour and fifteen minutes really good with oven fried chicken and sour cream mashed potatoes time to fry the chicken so I've got my chicken there's marinating in buttermilk which is gonna make it moist and really tender it's that first thing I'm gonna season some flour to make the coating it's gonna make it really crisp 2 cups of flour 1 tablespoon of salt and 1 tablespoon of fresh pepper like I'm just gonna mix it all together and then put the chicken in so the secret of this recipe is instead of frying the chicken while everybody's standing there waiting for dinner I'm gonna fry it really quickly get the coating really crisp and then I'm gonna bake it in the oven so it's gonna be crisp on the outside an incredibly tender and juicy on the inside it's a messy job but really worth doing okay last piece you're really messy okay now let's get some oil really hot need the oil about 360 degrees use a candy thermometer which really save hangs on the pot think it's almost there okay chicken in just about three minutes on each side just remember where you finish cooking it in the oven they're browned on one side I want to turn them for another three minutes and then put them on a sheet pan to bake in the oven no one likes fried chicken snip for the flour I just use salt and pepper cuz I like it simple but you can always use something spicy like fan pepper whatever you like little chili powder okay three minutes ready to come out and go on the sheet then I'm gonna fry the rest of these up then I'm gonna put them all in the oven together for engine 50 degrees for about 30 to 40 minutes until they're incredibly crisp on the outside and really juicy inside okay they're ham can you get through Oh gotta go now that's an apple pie my favorite part is it makes the house smell fabulous so next thing I want to make is sour cream mashed potatoes I peeled them and cut them in big chunks I put them in salted boiling water for maybe about 10 to 15 minutes okay next thing I want to do is heat up a little bit of milk and butter I only have two cups of milk 6 tablespoons of butter and meanwhile I'm gonna get the potatoes pureed so this is called a food mill you can really find it in a hardware store or any kind of a cookware store and it's not very expensive so I'm just going to put the potatoes in I'll show you how this food mill work so just turn the blade and you can turn it backwards just to clean the blade and then turn it again see how light and fluffy it doesn't bother I can use any kind of boiling potatoes but Yukon Gold which are a little yellow which these are are the best ones done okay I'm just gonna whisk this into the potatoes just do it slowly don't do all of it at once want to make sure that you have enough so that's creamy but not so much that it's soupy you know a potato soup okay now for a little depth of flavor better half a cup of sour cream two teaspoons of salt [Music] really good Michael's gonna be very happy camper this is going to be really delicious without them for our chicken so all I'd love to do is plate up the salad so I've got blue cheese dressing and I'm gonna make a really nice salad so I mean traditionally this is done with a wedge of iceberg lettuce which is totally tasteless so I've taken a really nice head of lettuce just gonna take the outside leaves off save them for another salad so I think I'm just gonna cut this whole thing in I'm just gonna rinse it so there's no sand shake it out and since this piece is really too big to get into a salad spinner and you want it pretty dry I'll show you how how else to do it wrap it up into the kitchen towel and make your own salad spinner if you do this outside you won't get the kitchen so wet but it's just water okay let me get some plates I mean plates are great for a salad in it look it look terrific okay so instead of the usual sort of plastic tomatoes that you get in the grocery store I'd love to find heirloom tomato so it's sort of old fashioned see it's so much more flavor so few Tomatoes the bigger ones cut in half or quarters just an assortment of yellow and orange and green tomatoes and blue cheese dressing and I'd be all ready when Michael gets you [Music] are you gonna be happy just like your mother's cooking oven fried chicken sour cream mashed potatoes and to start blue cheese salad with heirloom tomatoes yes [Music] perfect [Music] first piece in my house smells wonderful but cooked apples and nutmeg and cinnamon I could smell the orange zest and lemon zest I don't know anything a little vanilla ice cream doesn't improve [Music] [Music]
