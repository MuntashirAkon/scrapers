[Music] I'm having some friends for dinner next week and I have a really hectic schedule so what I'm gonna do is make everything today stash it in the freezer and then next week all I have to do is heat it up and have party so when my friends come next week the main course is gonna be lasagna with turkey sausage let's see I think I'm gonna make frozen mango daiquiris to start and then maybe with the lasagna I'm gonna serve a pesto peace out like that would be really good and for dessert frozen berries with white hot chocolate it's so good and then maybe afterwards coffee with some pom yeas that sounds like a good menu so what I have in this pot is I've saut√©ed some onions and garlic and then broken up some sausage that I got at the store and this is turkey sausage you can get hot you can get sweet but I actually like to combine the two so it's half and half it's got a pound and a half of sausage and it's well cooked in a little bit of olive oil then I'm gonna add tomatoes a 28-ounce can of crushed tomatoes in puree if you use whole tomatoes you can just put it in the food processor and crush them up yourself and a six ounce can of tomato paste the whole can I'm gonna lots of flavoring some fresh basil just pick off some leaves and chop it up of course it's all gonna cook together anyway I love basil tastes so good with tomato some turkey sausage it doesn't have to be perfect okay so right into the tomato and turkey sausage and then I think some fresh parsley you can use flat leaf parsley like this or you can use curly parsley I think this has a little more flavor but really depends on the parsley right into the pot I think we need salt and pepper 1/2 teaspoons of salt why does this depends on how salty and peppery the sausages so you want to taste it half a teaspoon of pepper and then just stir it up I'm just gonna let this simmer for about 15 to 20 minutes over low heat until all the flavors blend together in the tomato and the basil and the turkey sausage all tastes like one ok now I'm gonna get the cheese's ready I need 15 ounces of ricotta cheese which is usually 1 package and then I'm gonna put lots of flavors in it first thing is goat cheese I know it's unusual in a lasagna but I think it really gives a great flavor so this is a 4 ounce package we've have a 4 and a half ounce package or 5 ounce package just too casual about it just fine just crumble it right up into the ricotta it's sort of a little more punch and kind of flavor it's good 1 cup of grated Parmesan just mix that in and then one egg you know when you're putting an egg into a mixture I always put it into another glass bowl because you never know when you get a bad egg so one egg extra large etic just mix that in and I'm just gonna a little bit of flavor with some chopped parsley that 2 tablespoons and of course salt and pepper you don't need too much because the parmesan is pretty salty quarter of a teaspoon of pepper and now what I'm gonna do is show you how I did the noodles and then I'm gonna layer the whole thing together with mozzarella it's gonna be fabulous what I do with the noodles is instead of boiling them I pour a really really really hot tap water into a bowl and let the noodles soak for about 20 minutes and they soften up just enough to go into the baked lasagna okay now I'm just going to drain it by the time they're drained I'm gonna be ready to layer them [Music] just spread it out along the bottom of the dish mush it around just want to do one layer of pasta [Music] I don't have to be perfect just cut me with it just take about half the mozzarella and layer it on top and then the next layer is this cheese so we're cut about half the cheese I'm risk the ricotta and goat cheese and Parmesan more sausage okay another layer of noodles more mozzarella dressing the cheese it's amazing how fast this builds up I'm just going to cover it in foil and then let it sit for a while then we're freezing for my part in XP then I'm gonna make some communes to go with coffee pommie eyes are made with puff pastry and believe me if you had to make it yourself you would never make pommy ice but fortunately they come frozen in the freezer department of your grocery store so I'll show you what it is it's actually layers of dough and butter and it makes really really flaky cookies what you want to do is defrost it in the refrigerator so it stays really cold so I'm gonna combine two cups of sugar and I know this is gonna sound strange but an eighth of a teaspoon of salt and it really makes a difference in how it tastes so just like a big pinch of salt so I'll take a bit half of the sugar and spread them you can do it on a board on a marble whatever you have just like that so you pulled these guys apart it's folded in three I'm gonna sprinkle the top with sugar just like that stick blowing pin and just lightly roll it out just so the sugar adheres to the pastry okay now what I'm gonna do is just fold it it's kind of like folding a letter I'm gonna fold it like that and then fold it to the middle fold this to the middle and then fold it over itself just like that press it lightly and now I'm just gonna slice it what's great is when they bake they're gonna puff out and they're gonna be all kinds of swirled sort of like elephant ears or pom yeas just like that just slice them about a half an inch thick you can really keep these in the freezer and if you want to bake off one or two with a cup of tea in the afternoon it's not half bad so I'm just going to put these in the plastic bag and then they can be in the freezer until I need to bake them off [Music] push the last batch of pong yes [Music] my friends are coming for dinner at night I've got everything done in the freezer and ready to bake off this is seriously easy entertaining so this is the turkey was on me I made last week I defrosted it overnight in the refrigerator I think that's a better way of defrosting something than at room temperature it doesn't change the texture so much so it's nice and defrosted we put some grated Parmesan cheese on the top just give it extra flavor and Parmesan will melt on the top will be delicious and how easy is this into the oven 400 degrees for about 30 minutes until it's bubbly and hot and delicious [Music] I can't wait for dinner so I've got everything my party either defrosting their frigerator or already set up in the freezer and I think a lot of people put things into their freezer but they never actually take them out I really use it for pantry so I've got vodka coffee ice cream cookies pound cake and for dessert tonight berries that I froze last week in the summer when berries are really delicious and inexpensive I freeze them I spread them out on a sheet pan put them in the freezer and when they're frozen a place in the plastic bag Marikina fairies all year round bet you're wondering what this is it's a frozen mango daiquiri in individual servings for party or there's always that personal emergency okay so here goes first make the sugar syrup heat up a cup of sugar and a cup of water over low heat just until it's dissolved [Music] and then set aside to cool I sliced and peeled one mango pouring the juice of two limes a teaspoon of sugar syrup and stickers a cup of white rum turn on the blender until it's really smooth turn it off and pour four servings into freezer bags I've put these into glasses so it's easier to pour plenty for my party and plenty left over for emergencies so I've got them sealed in a bag and stashed in the freezer and in no time we're in a frozen grown-up Slurpees I bet you're wondering what this is it's pesto and I'm gonna use it on the salad tonight but it's wonderful to have a really quick separate pasta pesto and made this several days ago but it'll last for months and the freezing this is what I call a quick recipe these are really good flavors together quarter of a cup of walnuts a quarter of a cup of cannolis [Music] and none close a chop garlic that's a lot of garlic process it for about 30 seconds until they're all combined with the food processor off add five cups of basil and know it seems like a lot of basil butter we really chopped up a teaspoon of salt teaspoon of pepper turn it on for two cups of olive or the feed tube this is when the sauce was really starts to look good keep going until it's finely pureed okay turn it off and now add the parmesan which gives great flavor and texture according to a court [Music] after the pesto's in the container for a little film of olive oil on the top it'll keep the pesto from turning brown actually to vegetables I think you're just fine using a freezer corn for corn pudding small whole liners is there great look for tonight in a mixie set and these are gonna be great that's one full freezer pesto pea salad then at five times quickly and the secret is frozen peas so I'm gonna take boiling salted water just a lot of salt in it really gives it great flavor Turner for the peas in and this happens really fast so keep an eye on it and while that's happening one of the ingredients is cannolis and they're perfectly fine right out of the container but they just don't have great flavor you'll just go put them in a dry saute pan for a few minutes until they get sort of nice brown and incredibly nutty flavor so let's see how the peas are doing it only takes about a minute or two and I think they're fine into ice water stop the cooking fast I think I can smell the pignoli spoon they smell great I think they know we done just let them rest there so main part of the salad is actually the spinach and it's this really gorgeous little sort of baby spinach leaves I'm a really delicious is great with pesto so into the bowl and then I'm gonna put the peas on top just draining drain them really well you don't want wet peas in your salad doesn't sound too appetizing does it and then I'm gonna put pissed on the top is a pesto from the freezer lots of good pesto really keeps so well in the freezer for months but also in the refrigerator for about a week toast fall together okay last thing is but can you only say toast it look great they're really nutty brown right on top [Music] I'm ready to serve with my turkey lasagna [Music] now comes the good part frozen mango daiquiris and I'm gonna make calm yes and I served after dinner with coffee let me show you what I've done is I've made the daiquiris actually an individual serving so I'm gonna pour three into the blender right into the blender and then just blend it up if it's too frozen and it doesn't go around a little more rum always helps it's my solution to everything more rum that should do it that looks pretty good I think I needed taste [Music] it's so thick and gorgeous that's really good really taste the fresh ripe mango and the lime juice and the rum and it's not too icy it's just really creamy this is gonna be really good but first I want to finish the Pommier so it can happen with coffee so these guys came right out of the freezer they can be baked frozen these are all covered in sugar so they'll be beautiful caramelized while they bake so they're only three of us so I don't think we need that many for a few extras okay that's great so into the oven 450 degrees for about eight minutes and I'm going to turn them half way through so they caramelize on both sides I can't wait so what are we having tonight there might be a turkey lasagna involved good but that's outweighed by dessert which is frozen berries with white hot chocolate oh my god okay while we're on the subject of dessert I have one more thing to do so don't have any fun until I get that okay for dessert I'm gonna do this I've got pound of white chocolate chips this is so easy you won't believe it and a cup of heavy cream nice low-fat dessert and I'm gonna melt them together with a little bit of vanilla cuz I love vanilla flavor he's really good vanilla cuz they're only a few ingredients in this just stir this is really like a chocolate ganache that you'd put on a cake except it's white chocolate you know when you see cake with a very shiny glaze it's the same thing we're just gonna use it for a sauce and I'm gonna turn the heat off just before it's melted I'm just going to sit there and that's gonna stay warm so it's ready for dessert [Music] who wouldn't want that for dinner okay everybody dinner is ready okay a little turkey lasagna it's light as a feather because it came with the turkey sausage how's that true is that cheesy or Y and we have pesto pea salad Frank you wanna do the honors so it's fresh spinach baby spinach pine nuts peas and pesto ina this is so good how did you get the time to do this today no I did it last week actually that's the dirty little secret because I made everything once we can put in the freezer and it tastes absolutely forever never knows something something's free Shirley well and some things don't okay I'll be right back I'm a surprise [Music] frozen tears I remember through the berries that I frozen one layer my putting plastic bag so that don't stick together the raspberries blueberries blackberries whatever you like and now the good stuff white hot chocolate just make sure it's well stirred I'm just going to pour some over each so it's hot and it's called and it's sweet and it's tart and I'd say they're gonna be very happy the lovely hot chocolate melts the berries just enough so they're still really cold but not really frozen how gorgeous is that included is there I like the frozen in the warm chocolate is amazing and the white chocolate is delicious but who or what wouldn't taste good with there's just one thing missing from this what is the second so what are you giving up coffee and palm viennese in the garden how many times I have to say that thank you you know the key is really really time to sugar stop otherwise it has it just it's just sweet it doesn't have any serve like a round flavor yeah it's earth business and I helped my secret is safe with you as long as were invited back [Music]
