food it's a very big treat this morning because the Barefoot Contessa Ina Garten is here got a brand new cookbook out today it's called cooking for Jeffrey it's filled with recipes her husband requests most often ina always great to have no hair how are you yeah after 40 what years of marriage 48 48 Jeffrey finally gets a cook buddy he death that's his food one of the secrets to a long happy marriage you know I think what it's really about is that cooking for him really is what my career was about he loves what I cook and in Kurt he encourages me and that's how I started cooking and I just love doing it wonderful after 48 years does he tell you when he doesn't love something so far he hasn't told me doesn't like anything I think it makes cooking for her but we're making filet today we're making with a wonderful sauce let's quickly look at the ingredients what jumps out this is great filet of beef mushrooms mustard big those are the important things all right yeah and shallot you can't just throw a fillet on the grill or on the stove you have to have a little technique what do you do so what I do is I take the filet beef it's tied so it keeps it an even compact little package so it cooks evenly you dry with a paper towel because you want to try and then what I do is I brush it with a little oil just like this and then I'm doing it the way steak houses do it which is what you do is you sear it and then you put it in the oven and explain why searing is so important if it keeps the juices in and it makes a nice kind of crust and then I have sea salt and black pepper that's it and just dip it in and then it goes right in the pan really the way I want to be generous with that you really that's what gives you that great crust exact and also the flavor that's exactly right so just I just do it just like that the edges I just I do the top and bottom okay and it's just fine remember the salt the sauce has a lot of flavor in it so great take this here so just about two minutes on each side and then we've got some that are seared okay I'm gonna turn this down doesn't sizzle the whole time let's take a look at this these are these are all seared and they're gonna go into the oven this is what steaks houses do put it in the oven 400 degrees for about 8 to 12 minutes having it go perfectly cook how do you do 20 degrees put a thermometer in the side okay perfect every time all right so that's gonna go in the oven pearl put it right there okay let's make our sauce when we take this the and that they made the steaks ends got all the flavor in it and now what I'm going to do is deglaze it was just fun yet by the way we've got our tasters downstairs come in down oh my god oh really and then I put in shallots so you want the sauce to have lots of flavor this is great it's not great yeah and then I put in cream and just let that simmer a little bit and it'll thicken up and then I use two kinds of mustard I use regular Dijon mustard and I use coarse mustard I love when something looks like what it tastes like so you know it's got mustard in it so just put those in and that's going to simmer away for a few minutes while the steaks are in the oven okay look at it over here and then we can we have some weight at me this is so easy yeah nice one I know camera for you and this is what the sauce is like and that's gonna go right on the steaks and then what we do is we have sauteed mushrooms which is what rooms did you say your cremini mushrooms they're really good just a little bit of butter kamini mushrooms and voila I did it all by myself this is because of the cream in the sauce this is a little bit here and of course we have ready and I want to talk about what you pair this with in a second you slice it thin or thick I like to slice it thin and actually we have some already sliced for you to taste uniformed and there's a fork here and you might need a knife no no we are cooking although these are big because I made a salad a kale salad with Caesar dressing and it's got pancetta in it it's got croutons and it's got Fabio's Parmesan cheese all right got a little bit into it oh this is about as good as it gets I guess it's I love the sauce but the filet is so guys have you don't even need it you don't it's so flavorful because it's personal pepper really makes all the difference in the world it's delish imagine ina just said you probably need a knife I cut it with the fork that's all right oh that's great mmm so weird congratulations cookbook thank you congratulation to Jeffrey as well haha she's
