roasted trunk doors I was great dish for crowd best part of it is the longer it sits the better against so it's Chris I'm doing throw some shrimp a little olive oil salt and pepper it's actually surprising way to cook shrimp on a sheet pan in the oven I just find it really gives it more flavor it's 2 pounds of shrimp about 32 shrimp okay into the oven high temperature 400 degrees for exactly six minutes and they're going to be really delicious and succulent and I think the orzo is just about ready so I took three quarters of a pound of orzo in boiling salted water deflesh of a whole alone good and hot whoa okay that's great we're going to go right into a big bowl so I'm going to grab the first thing I need it has a cup of freshly squeezed lemon juice and I have a cup of olive oil [Music] this is all 1 teaspoon of pepper it'll whisk it all together and just pour it right over the pasta I'm going to cut up some herbs and vegetables with salad so first thing I need is a cup of chopped galleons and then I'm just going to run my knife right down the middle ok just rough chop the scallions and later red onions are going to give this lots of sharp flavor right into the salad next thing is cup of freshly chopped parsley the show I use flat leaf parsley I think that's my flavor but it's get curly parsley it's just fine right in that one cup of chopped fresh dill so I'm going to chop it roughly now it's really important to use fresh herbs especially when it's a salad like this but if you have some leftover and you want to chop it up just put it in little containers freeze it and then just to frost it when you need it okay one cup of dill right into the salad next thing is to cumbers so just run it down the middle and just do the cubes right into the salad I have a cup of diced red onion into it I just wanted to flavor the salad okay the next thing is the surest you get perfectly cool [Music] okay get all the flavor in so toss it all together and then the last thing one of my favorite ingredients good feta and just put it in as gently as possible so it doesn't get all broken up toss it in it's perfect for sitting on the dock watching the boat contemplating life
