[Music] for years and years and years every time Jeffrey came home on Friday nights I would make birth chicken and then one day I got to be a little more creative from this want the house to smell great and of course I want to make chicken so each time I challenge myself to make something new I'm making chicken piccata which is wonderful when it start with two chicken breasts and when do a coating for them so they're sauteed and a lemon and butter sauce are so good so the first thing I need is 1/2 a cup of flour it's all for this flour Pepa teaspoon of salt 1/4 of a teaspoon of pepper and mix that all together that's the first part of the coating and it can be dipped into one egg just mix with a little touch of water put it all together the next part of the coating is bread crumbs you seasoned bread crumbs that's recorded in the cup okay a little oil in the pan just a few tablespoons and while that guests time I'm going to take the chicken breast [Music] just on the net so they get really thin chicken breast this or thicker parts and the senator and other parts and the sway the cook more evenly and they cook really quickly roll into the good Vassar some people have need pounding things but everybody has a rolling pin I like them between a quarter and a half inch thick and just do it in two directions so it ends up smooth doesn't in them and ridges okay so the first one goes into the flour just make sure it's coated all over shake off the excess into the egg and the flour drives it out and then the eggs make it so that's a break consulate here and then we're using drive break rub right in just two minutes on each side until it's golden brown [Music] okay that guy's done perfect you have a next one royal right it's it man two minutes on each side one of these replace Geoffrey's favorite roast chicken for Friday night chicken dinner [Music] perfectly done okay I put this on the sheet pan keep it warm in the oven 400 degrees for about 10 minutes right alongside the red onion and then I'm going to make a nice lemon butter sauce to go with it Oh perfect timing I just heard Jeffrey the weekend starts now typical stairs changing the red onions are roasting in the oven but erm of mashed potatoes are done and now I just have to make the sauce for the chicken piccata so first I'm going to do is just wipe out this pan that I cook the chicken in and I'm just going to heat up tablespoon of butter [Music] the chicken is warm in the oven is to be warm in the oven I just make a nice sauce for it okay now I need third cup of freshly squeezed lemon juice probably two lemon to pour it right into this butter okay now tech cup of white wine really nice dry white wine and something I drink for dinner okay half a teaspoon of salt quarter the piece for the pepper and this is what I'm going to do with the limit right in the top to get the flavor of the vet took comes together yeah the best eight bits a minute while I travel to far places like Lima some chicken for the onions a little bit of vinaigrette left over on the marinating each I always like to put on the end toss them all together it's just so good to do wonderful okay them chicken [Music] to the cottage saw slices of lemon significance lemons become a little bit of parsley Jerusalem is also good and love the way they look [Music] who doesn't love master tailor but erm of mashed potatoes your timing is perfect as always guess what's for dinner let's see it's Friday if you think you chicken but what kind of chicken is chicken piccata and it's right sister the physics is it up there with a roast chicken you know I used to think that roast chicken was the only thing I could have on Friday night but this chicken piccata this is just this day
