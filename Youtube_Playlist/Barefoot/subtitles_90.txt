[Music] I'm having a baby shower I'm going to make two huge platters of some and the suave and everybody can just help themselves I'm making a marinade for the salmon to sit on it for a little while and then the rest are really high temperature it's delicious so the first thing I need is the zest of four lemons okay that's good so I'm just going to put this all in a big bowl next thing is a quarter of a cup of olive oil quarter of a cup of mustard I'd love to use Dijon mustard I think has great flavor and then I'm going to put in lots of garlic and a four cloves of garlic chopped right into the marinade make sure it's really flavorful one and a half tablespoons of salt half a tablespoon of pepper I'm going to whisk this all together and then spread it on the salmon now this is a great flavour to smell it or brandy simply put all this on top of the salmon and let the flavors get into the meat of the salmon it will sit for about 15 minutes and there's a roasted a very high temperature perfect what I have a four and a half pounds of these Erica very french stream beans you can really find them anywhere and put them right into how to boiling water a little bit of salt especially blanching is a great way to cook a lot of vegetables put it in a hot boiling water cook it for 3-4 minutes depending on the vegetable until it's crisp but still tender and then you shock it by putting in ice water stops the cooking sets the color and make sure they're stay crisp to the wonderful so just take the beans out they don't cook very long at all into the ice water stop the cooking time to cook the famine I'm going to cook it at 500 degrees for about 12 to 15 minutes and the high heat really sort of creme lies at the top it's so much flavor okay I'm going to cook 12 eggs and turn on the heat and here's my foolproof hard-boiled egg trick bring the water up to a boil turn off the heat leave the eggs in for five minutes exactly and then take them out and let them cool at room temperature for two minutes and then peel them it's perfect every time no dark circles around the yolks okay I think the salmon is ready so that's perfect it's nice and browned on the top wonderful now comes the fun part assembling the salmon this wise platter so I chilled the salmon so it flakes really nicely I'm just going to take big pieces of it and put it right on the platter salmon is perfectly cooked it's sort of medium-rare and you can see all the flavors on top the garlic and just wonderful just big bold flakes of salmon piled up the main course is the salmon so I'm just going to put it right down the middle okay so the next thing is the potatoes so they've steamed they've cooled and I've sliced some big thick slices I'm going to do two platters so many people I just want to make sure everybody has lots to eat and then tomatoes I took medium size tomatoes and cut them in 6 and the area vert which we steamed and blanched everything's room temperature the key about a big platter is just big blocks of color you know what a little here in a little there you want big blocks of color okay next is hard cooked eggs this really classic salad nicoise it's just done with roasted salmon so rather than to and I just think it has so much more flavor so I'm going to do a big bunch of water crab instead of little bits of it around just one big bunch it really sort of balances the green I have olives can have a salad nicoise of that olives so instead of black olives which we have in the gazpacho I'm going to use green olives and for those of us that love anchovies just a few lanch ovaries but I wouldn't put it all over just in a few places so anybody that loves them can help themselves okay the last thing is the vinaigrette really quick quarter cup of champagne vinegar teaspoon of mustard good Dijon mustard is essential salt and pepper make sure it's really well flavored and half a cup of olive oil I like things we vinaigrette in the world I love the way the mustard emulsified this vinaigrette okay I'm just going to pour it over the vegetables particularly the potatoes make sure they have lots of flavor a little drizzle and everything else oh I think I hear girls voices I think there's a party about to start I can't wait to see Sinead phase [Music]
