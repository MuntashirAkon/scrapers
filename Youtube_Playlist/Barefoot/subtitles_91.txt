[Music] my friend Frank has invited some friends to dinner tonight and I'm testing soup recipes all day so I said what are we join forces I'll bring soup to your house for dinner that way he doesn't have to cook and I can ro test my recipes the first tip is a really hearty lentil soup with spicy sausage and it's sprinkled with freshly grated Parmesan cheese the second recipe is a seafood stew that's full of shrimp and chunky fish just like the classic bluey bez but it's so much easier to make and to go with the soups I'm testing lighter-than-air chive biscuits with chives from my own garden it's funny how you can get yourself invited for dinner when you bring the dinner I wish I'd known that when I was 20 [Music] so for my lentil soup first thing is lentils and what I'm gonna do is soak them in boiling water intercept for my 15 minutes it just softens them enough and then I'm gonna make a big pot of soup and put them in and cook so I was with most soups I start with onions and this is a really important process and you want to do it carefully and slowly so you really get the most flavor from the onions four cups of onions it's about three large onions that's four cups of leeks there's a lot of soup I have to say most of my soup recipes are huge amounts of soup because you can freeze it so easily and then you have soup for months when tablespoon of chopped garlic there's been three cloves of garlic okay how about a tablespoon of fresh thyme leaves who's gonna do approximately just hold it by the end and just run your fingers down the stem next thing is a teaspoon of cumin there's actually sort of classic combination they're really good together lentils and cumin tablespoon of salt and 1/2 teaspoons or half a tablespoon of pepper I'm just gonna cook this for about 20 minutes until the onions and the leeks are tender and translucent and then and lots of good stuff to the soup that already smells great can really smell the onions and the leeks and the cumin and the time it's gonna be wonderful hearty soup okay so while this cook I'm gonna chop up some vegetables so the first thing is Karis keep it the vegetables you want to have them chopped and roughly the same size so they cook evenly so I tend to like things not too fine I actually like it to look like it's homemade okay just big dice more carrots so these carrots aren't quite so big so I'm just gonna cut them like this I do find that carrots that you buy with the tops on tend to be a little fresher tasting a little sweeter okay so that's the carrots and celery it's gonna do it right down the middle I'm Barefoot Contessa we used to have recipes for lentil soup but like called for a 40 pound bag of carrots or case of celery you need to end up with like 200 quarts of soup it was really good okay so that's the carrots in the celery let me see if onions are ready no they're just simmering away here yeah perfect everything's cooked really nicely together the onions are really tender leaves okay now we're gonna add all the vegetables lots of celery four cups of celery and then four cups of carrots it's gonna be really hard a soup okay just saute those for a minute someone drain the lentils and I think Wendell's got a really bad rap in the 70s that was considered like hippie vegetarian food but I think they're really good and what I like is the green lentils I think they're firmer than the brown have more flavor next a chicken stock how many chicken stock you can use canned chicken stock but I have to say it's one of those things I really like homemade chicken stock and it's so easy to make so I have three quarts you'll go right in somehow I find veal stock beef stock there's so much more complicated but chicken stock you throw a couple of chickens in a pot with some carrots and celery thyme whole peppercorns it's so easy and I'm always in the kitchen for a couple of hours and it just boils away and then got a really good stock to make soups with I just keep it in the freezer and it's ready whenever I want to make soup okay so that's three quarts of chicken stock and then a quart of a cup of tomato paste gives it a lot of flavor it's surprising and last but not least lentils so this is a pound of lentils that I've soaked for about 15 minutes just pour them all in this is a big pot of soup so we're just gonna simmer this for about an hour all the flavors are gonna blend together and then it Franks has something to add spicy cabassa sausage and I'm gonna serve it with a drizzle of olive oil red wine and some Parmesan cheese delicious [Music] chive biscuits I thought they'd be wonderful with my soups making biscuits really is a lot like making scones the same sort of process so first I need two cups of flour and two my mixer [Music] the key to both of them is the butter you weren't really cold and you want it in big chunks so that they stay nice and light and fluffy one tablespoon of baking powder one teaspoon of salt [Music] put a sugar just a little bit of sweetness in them okay the next thing is butter so once take a very cold butter and we're going to dice it and then put it in the mixer and the mixers can do all the work [Music] okay I'm just gonna mix it until the butters about the size of peas okay in the meantime I need 3/4 of a cup of half-and-half who really make scones with any kind of savory herb like time would be wonderful or sage maybe for Thanksgiving make them let's say it's gonna be good with Turkey until that's ready only chop some chives line them up nice sharp knife who smells great it's a really delicate onion flavor it's gonna be good in the biscuits okay got a half a cup who's gonna put it in at the end so it doesn't get all smashed up have really fresh chive flavor okay that looks good I couldn't pour the cream in slowly with a mixer on it's a really wet dough but it's really delicious and the chives okay they're ready to roll out half a flower the board this is a really nice dough you really smell the chives too it's great good that's sticky this should make better eight biscuits just keep moving around on the board you know just want to make sure it doesn't stick and you can pat them out or you can roll the mat I was like you roll it up looks nice smooth even this I just think it's nice if you have something as simple as soup to have something a little special like homemade bread okay two and a half inch cutter just come out my pan these are great served on their own but they're also absolutely delicious sort of as a little sandwich like a forty or something I bet than that thing that's great exactly eight okay now I'm going to do a little egg wash make the tops nice and brown and a little bit of half-and-half just whisk it together that easy to do in a small bowl okay I'm just gonna brush the top slightly well these are gonna be just delicious with soups okay nothing like the smell of biscuits it's a 400 degrees for about 20 minutes and we're delicious chive biscuits with our soup I love a classic French boy abyss but it takes forever to make so instead I'm gonna make a sequence do with all the same flavors shellfish shrimp fish and it's gonna be so delicious I nail hi how are you I'm good Wow so I'm making a seafood stew can you get me a few things actually there are a lot of kinds of shrimp but why don't I take the clean ones all right so a pound of clean shrimp please then I could always peel them into vain them myself but why not get them already done there's a lot of work take some time exactly [Music] 24 muscles all right it's a great you're wonderful and I need a pound of halibut delay I need a pound of sea bass please all right you know there are a few things to look for when you're looking for fish and I think they're pretty standard one is that it doesn't smell very fishy and this I mean there's no fish smell here it's amazing and the other is that the eye of the fish is really bright that was really fast thanks so much Neil well it's gonna be great they do thank you oh joy bye-bye [Music] the second soup I want to test is a seafood stew so the first thing I'm gonna heat some oil and then cut up some onions two yellow onions oil is hot it's going to put the onions right in next I'm gonna do potatoes I need two cups of potatoes and these are you can go they have lots of flavor next the fennel I love bell it's got that wonderful anise flavor and when it's cooked not that crazy better it raw but when it's cooked and just there's a really delicate flavor so I'm just gonna chop this up this is a very proven√ßal flavor and into the soup okay that's it for the panel two teaspoons of salt one teaspoon of pepper stir it all together let's gonna cook about 15 minutes so the vegetables and the potatoes are all tender in the meantime I need some seafood for the seafood stew [Music] lots of great seafood seafood stock so first thing I want to do is soak the mussels a little sand in the mussels and nobody needs stand in their seafood stew so fill it with water and then a handful of flour in the water just mix it around and what happens is the mussels break the water with the flour and they discourage any sand that they have inside so leave these to soak and I think seafood stood ready for a little wine two cups of a nice dry white wine you never cook with anything I wouldn't want to drink and seafood stock you can make it organ by it I need four cups which is a quart it smells good and one twenty ounce can of plum tomatoes pull them right in okay next I'm gonna add some garlic you got to have garlic and seafood stew sounds gonna chop it up three cloves 3 big cloves of garlic actually add this later in the stew so it doesn't burn okay three cloves of garlic right into the stew and then the truly Provencal ingredient is saffron it's the stamens of crocuses anyone she was really good whole saffron not the powdered kind and I'm gonna add one teaspoon which is all of this hill of saffron it really gives a full flavor and a little bit of spice to this do so this kind of just simmer for about 15 minutes while I get the seafood ready so I owe this great fish first I'm gonna start with the halibut just slice it in big chunks [Music] you always want to choose sort of firm flesh fish it's not gonna just disintegrate let's do the second one is the sea bass I'm just going to slice this across - so you want big enough chunks so they don't disintegrate but small enough ones I still actually cooking this doing pretty quickly okay next I'm gonna rinse the mussels first I'm just gonna check and see if any of them are open permanently since they're not alive and they all look gorgeous so they're fine a few times to make sure there's no flour perfect okay the last things the shrimp what am I glad I got this peeled and deveined so much work okay I think the students just about ready for the seafood this looks pretty good okay lots of fish [Music] dirt and it's gonna cook really fast now thanks to the shrimp this time so chunky and delicious full of flavors okay and last the mussels I love the color and the texture this makes but along the flavor it's gonna cook in about five minutes all the fish and the shrimp and mussels are gonna be done and then when I go to Frank's house I'm gonna add the two essential for your best ingredients there know and are obsessed so [Music] Frank's guests are arriving he's giving you the nice glass of white wine and I'm gonna just finish the soups love cooking in this kitchen so the seafood student he's a little bit of orange zest and some pear know I love those two flavors in the [Music] okay that should be about a tablespoon with the orange zest it's the soup this clash of Prayer no liquors flavor that really brings out the flavor of this film just mix it together this looks so gorgeous [Music] well that's ready they better be hungry they better not be having too much fun without me I'm gonna feel like Cinderella in the kitchen now okay one soup down one to go so I made lentil soup often but I just thought I'd experiment by putting sausage in it so I'm putting in kielbasa which is a cooked Polish sausage it's really good it's got some nice spice to it but this is really easy because you don't even have to cook it it's already smoked and cups and okay let's see how this lentil soup is doing Oh looks pretty good still this guy out [Music] wonderful so it's good but the sausage and all I have to do is just heat it through which will happen pretty fast it's a really hearty soup and I think adding the Cabasa really makes it like a meal both of these soups can meal themselves curious which one people are gonna like more a little splash of red wine or red wine vinegar and then I'm gonna serve it with a drizzle of olive oil cheese good and this is the stove could you kind of do this every night [Music] sausage sausage expand it's really good anything you said anything what would like a child Fiske and help yourself yes I'm testing recipes so I hope you like them on your beds depart Sunday like bottles who protests thank you for bringing guinea pig
