[Music] 25 years ago when I used to work an energy policy in the White House I used to dream of a job where all I had to do was cook all day long I've got a really busy day today and everything involves cooking how great is that first I'm making toasted coconut marshmallows for a friend who's having a bake sale then two women in my office are coming for a lunch meeting and I'm making delicious croque monsieur and a really refreshing french drink ice-cold cassis with water I have a brand new recipe to test fresh tuna salad that I think will have avocados red onion and a blend of Asian spices and then at the end of the day I'm gonna use some leftover roasted vegetable and make a delicious soup for myself for dinner sure is a different kind of day than when I used to write energy issue papers for the president I've such a busy dinner today but the first thing is I've promised to make something for a bake sale I'm sure they've got lots of cookies and cakes so I've decided I'm gonna make toasted coconut marshmallows so the first thing is 1/2 a cup of cold water and three packages of gelatin I'm just gonna let them stand until the gelatin dissolves and in the meantime I'm gonna make a sugar syrup 1/2 a cup of water one and a half cups of sugar make sure to serve with that sugar one cup of corn syrup corn syrup is like a concentrated sugar syrup it's gonna be really intense quarter teaspoon of salt [Music] I'm just going to cook this on high temperature until it gets to 240 degrees and the way to tell is a candy thermometer just stick it right in at the bottom of the thermometer right in the bottom of the pot and just cook this on high heat until that's right up to 240 degrees [Music] 240 degrees exactly so watch what I'm going to pour the sugar syrup into the gelatin slowly and swimming marshmallows [Music] be careful pouring this it's incredibly hot turn this on high speed for 15 minutes while I get some other flavors here's the coconut it's sweet inflate coconut I'm gonna toast it and then it's really great on the toasted coconut marshmallows toasted coconut all you need is coconut and a dry pan and you have to pay attention because it burns really fast I'm cooking it gets hot really smells wonderful just keep it moving around until it's looking like a nice light brown color these marshmallows are so good just by themselves just vanilla but toasted coconut really adds a great flavor you can see it's just starting to brown and it smells fabulous that looks perfect it's just a golden brown okay now I need to add a tablespoon of vanilla this marshmallow mix what you see that's amazing what went in was gelatin and sugar and what came out is marshmallow that great so I'm gonna take half the coconut and put it in the bottom of this pan 8 by 12 inch pan but whatever size pan that's closest on lightly the marshmallow mixture I just think it's like magic and with wet fingers just smooth out the top dirty marshmallows now I'm going to take the rest of the coconut and just sprinkle it lightly on top all over [Music] so I'm just going to let this sit unwrapped at room temperature until it dries out enough so I can cut it in squares [Music] my lunch meeting I'm gonna make croque monsieur which is a french ham and cheese sandwich it's so good I thought as long as I'm having a French theme why not continue it then we make SC solo for drinks which is cassis which is a black currant liqueur with water it's not too alcoholic but enough [Music] [Music] in about a tablespoon of kippis the same liquor that's French use for kir Royale with champagne but today we're just gonna do it with water I don't want any drunken meetings it's so refreshing and I know it is it's gonna be so good with Christmas here so one help yourself to a pussy solo Oh Cheers she did good times in the office okay done that's for you Shanae thank you I'm gonna don't have any fun till I get back [Music] first one into business I made a rule for myself that I would never hire somebody I didn't want to have dinner with and the end result is I love the people I work with so I'm gonna make them really nice lunch so I think I'm gonna make crook miss cheer which is like a French ham and cheese sandwich so the first thing I need to do is make a roux which is a white sauce I need two tablespoons of butter melt that three tablespoons of flour and you just dump the flour in all at once cook it over low heat just for about a minute or two until the flour is a little bit cooked white sauce is a really convenient thing to know how to make it's great for thickening things like chicken pot pie it's great in grams now what I'm gonna do is add two cups of scalded milk let's make the food just below the boiling point I'll just cook that until it thickens just stir it the whole time so it doesn't burn okay it's thick just below the boiling point so now I'm going to add teaspoon salt half a teaspoon of pepper and a pinch of nutmeg it's classic and white sauce 1/2 a cup of Parmesan cheese and half a cup of grated Gruyere and it's all just gonna melt together in the sauce so it's really nice cheese sauce the lots of flavor because the parmesan in Korea tastes very different it gives her a real depth of flavor it looks good okay now I'm going to assemble them so what I've done is I've toasted the bread taken off the crust and I bake them at 400 degrees for about 5 minutes turn them in baking another two minutes and they're ready to go now what I'm gonna do is put a little mustard on one side [Music] purpose here is a classic French lunch and any good cafe and friend has croque monsieur or crook madame which has it's exactly the same thing with a fried egg on top so get it thinly sliced a really good either baked Virginia ham or a black forest ham something like that and then sprinkle some Gruyere right on top [Music] and put the other slice on top of that little bit of a cheese sauce really cheesy brie on top so to bake these at 400 degrees for five minutes and then I'm going to broil it for three to five minutes it'll be nice and brown and crusty on the top hide from the broiler I don't what bad do they lunch is ready this is my idea of what a business meeting should be this year just a French ham and cheese sandwich after this I'm gonna test a tuna salad recipe fresh tuna so if it's any good I'll bring it to the office for you so why don't we do this every day we'll need to Siesta that's why we don't do this every day I'm trying to figure out a new recipe sometimes I start with an old favorite and update it in some way so I wanted to make a fresh tuna salad and I thought I would start with tuna tartare which is raw tuna but I think I'm gonna grill it and add some vegetables like avocados and red onions we'll see how it goes Deanna people ask me all the time how do I develop a recipe I'm gonna do one right now what I generally do is take an idea of something that's very familiar in this case I'm going to do tuna salad but I make it better than you can imagine by taking fresh tuna instead of that canned stuff so I'm gonna make a fresh tuna salad I've got Center cut fresh tuna from the loin just brush it with olive oil salt and pepper meanwhile the pans gonna get very very hot we leave it on high heat for about a minute so I can really sear the tuna into the pan [Music] oh it's smoky but that's the right way to me about two minutes on one side two minutes on the other side and then don't let it cool slightly these are gonna cook really fast looks like it's ready to turn yeah that was actually faster than I thought it's done in one minute on the second side Wow okay I'm just gonna let it cool slightly [Music] perfect I don't know that on the recipe too great okay now for the vinaigrette so four tablespoons of olive oil two and a half teaspoons of kosher salt half a teaspoon of pepper the great festival I'd 1 teaspoon of wasabi powder wasabi is like a Japanese horseradish it's really hot six tablespoons of lime juice which is a little more than a third of a cup and a little soy sauce give it an Asian flavor let's see two teaspoons of soy sauce a lot of flavor something though check in the pantry and see if I'm inspired let's see I've got crushed chillies Chinese chili paste but I think Tabasco is gonna be perfect for this that's it [Music] I'm quite enough I think it's the right ingredient though think of that Tabasco is you can always add it but you can't take it out so I do it slowly perfect I'm always looking for that know when it goes but ten dashes of Tabasco it is wow that's good okay no that's it the tunas perfectly cooked see how it's raw in the middle or very very rare and cooked on the outside it's great yeah I think dicing is gonna be the way I'm gonna go big chunks this is not your mother's tuna salad I just put them on the plate good thing about this salad I think it's gonna get better as it sits as the flavors get into the tuna gonna add some red onion diced and some chuck scallions I use the white and the light green parts it has lots of color and also flavor and avocado with avocado you want to put it in something acidic like the vinaigrette so doesn't turn brown so I'm just gonna put it right into the vinaigrette and then pour the vinaigrette and the avocado one over the salad I think that should do it it's really good I'm gonna write this up on the computer before I forget it I was actually really interesting I always learned something when I'm testing a recipe I thought it was so interesting that the tuna cooked much faster than I expected and the other one is that one ingredient can make such a difference and I think the ten drops of Tabasco sauce really brought out the flavor and the other ingredients I'm gonna test this many more times before I'm done but first start I thought it was pretty good [Music] so the next thing I want to do I'm gonna take out these toasted coconut marshmallows great they're a little gooey but they dry enough to cut so it's perfect I can actually sit at room temperature for a day or two when a dust that the sides with confectioners sugar pack them in bags with ribbon another thing on the mega mole soup leftover vegetables for my supper just packing up the last of the toasted coconut marshmallows for the bake sale tomorrow I hope they're a hit you can find these bags sometimes at party stores craft stores or online nice piece of ribbon you just hold the bag open so it flares at the top pull it tight and they're all ready for the morning well I've had a really hard day I can see myself on the sofa good movie and a really easy dinner and the secret to a really quick meal is leftover vegetables I'm gonna make a vegetable soup from vegetables that are leftover from last night's dinner parsnip carrots potatoes go right into the blender they were all rested at a high temperature a little olive oil salt and pepper very simple and this is the other secret leftover salad with garlic vinaigrette who would put that in soup but it's all the ingredients you would have anyway oil garlic a little vinegar and greens just get them all in there and then I'm gonna put hot chicken stock that I had in the freezer in its pour some in we're gonna puree it and then see how thick it is no more chicken stock you can really do this with any kind of vegetables you want to have in soup [Applause] and not too pureed I like a lot of texture I'm just gonna reheat it and I'm gonna have soup for dinner perfect a friend of mine says this is a great way to get vegetables into our kids they don't even know they're vegetables and I think it's a great way to clean out the refrigerator but for right now that's a great quick dinner and good for it [Music] it's a good crusty bread and that's a really busy day there's nothing like a nice quiet night at home [Music] [Music]
