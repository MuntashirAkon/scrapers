[Music] everybody needs to know how to make a roast chicken even my friend Susan Stroman so I'm going to show her how to do a really easy roast chicken I didn't get lots of flavor that's beautiful how's that for a chicken the first thing I do actually is I salt it in advance when it comes home from the store I put the salted put it in the fridge and all that salt gets into the meat so it gives it lots of flavor okay I'm going to salt and pepper the inside you're taking goodness I am on the inside now what kind of salt do you use actually is kosher salt which i think is a little softer than table salt okay so you know those big boxes you can find in the grocery store salt and pepper the inside it's all about getting flavor into it okay so going to take a head of garlic a whole head of garlic don't peel it don't do anything I'll just cut the whole thing right in half and it goes right on the inside and I think a lemon really does a lot for it and we cut it in quarters and just shove that little lemon in there so you tie up its little legs just like that so that keeps it close to the body okay and then what I do is just tuck the wings under itself instead of tying it up like the chickens in bondage it's just so much easier to just do that oh one of the key things is you want to make sure the pants are too big because if it's too big the vegetables in the pan are going to burn so first I'm going to put in the pan is onions okay carrots into the pan for carrots and the last thing is potatoes and I love these Yukon Gold potatoes and now my chicken so it's a five to six pan chicken it serves three people probably people and now in order for the chicken to Brown really important you want to dry it okay paper towel just going to go wash my hands and I'll show you the next part I don't have any fun until I get that I will wait okay little butter just going to brush the outside of the skin and what does better really do labor flavors it but also the milk solids in the butter actually burn a little bit so that actually Browns the chicken it looks and there is a little bit on the potatoes and onions and the carrots just mix it up a little bit lots of salt and pepper on the chicken and on the vegetables and that's it so into the oven 425 degrees okay so between an hour and 15 an hour 30 minutes and take the chicken out and cover it with aluminum foil I take the vegetables in the pan and put it right back in the oven for 15 minutes let them keep cooking right and that way the juices and the chicken get back into the meat and it's unbelievable how different it is then what happens then we have to carve it how's that for a chicken that's it is long
