I think there's a restaurant in America that doesn't have a chicken Caesar salad on the menu I could take something really traditional and do it with a twist and I thought wouldn't it be fun to take the croutons and put it on the outside so I'm going to make a chicken Caesar salad sandwich so I'm going to start with ciabatta and I'm going to put it on a sheet tray and bake it at 350 for about five to seven minutes until it's just a little toasted next thing is the pancetta I'm going to take eight slices of pancetta and just put the map in a single layer oh shoot tray I'm going to bake at one with the ciabatta until it's nice and crisp like bacon okay last two pieces into the oven 350 degrees this one for five to seven minutes this one for 15 [Music] I cooked some chicken for the sandwich actually I find this is such a great way to do it it's on the bone with the skin on olive oil salt and pepper 350 degrees 35 minutes it's really moist perfect so the best part of this sandwich is that garlicky Caesar dressing that I'm going to make for it first I want to start with garlic right into the food processor okay next two tablespoons of chopped parsley okay that's about two tablespoons try it in the food processor next thing is anchovy paste critical for Caesar dressing one and a half teaspoons anchovy paste gives this really great flavor one teaspoon of Dijon mustard just process that until the garlic and the parsley are minced great okay now some lemon juice got one head tablespoons no okay half a cup of mayonnaise okay just make a nice smooth sauce [Music] and that's he's addressing first slab of this sandwich and the toasted bread really is going to absorb all this great sauce okay time to layer the sandwich first I'm going to start with a layer of Navy rule if you can find it nice and peppery it's great with us okay the next thing is sun-dried tomato this is going to make that five or six sandwiches next thing is Madonn cheese I think it's so much nicer if you have like a whole slice of it right on top next is the cooked pancetta right down the middle so the next thing is chicken so I'm just going to take the skin off and then slice it right on this sandwich okay right I'll give it sandwich right down the middle okay a little salt and pepper on top of the chicken pepper last thing is some arugula right on top put the top on and just slice it exemptions it's going to be really good I don't know if we'll get any work done it'll be delicious we're going to need a nap instead of getting any work done hmm we can get this one on [Music]
