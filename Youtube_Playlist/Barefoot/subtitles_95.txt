[Music] even though my professional life is about cooking the truth is I hate cooking non-stop it's just too exhausting I've invited friends for dinner two nights in a row so I'm making a plan and to make the first dinner in advance I'm making a loin of pork with fennel stuffing it's so delicious and for every one of the things they don't like vegetables a cauliflower gratin that's surprisingly out-of-this-world and crisp green green vegetables sauteed with lots of shallots and for decadent finish pumpkin mousse parfaits creamy layers of pumpkin and whipped cream with spicy ginger cookies in between it's a party that's a holiday celebration but it's great for a celebration any time of the year but I'm entertaining I'm a few really important rings one of them has always served cocktails but the second one is I always try and make things that I can make an advance so I can prepare them refrigerate them and then just throw them in the oven before dinner not easy to find vegetables that you can make in advance but gratins are terrific potato gratin like to make zucchini great an for this dinner when I call a flower Gretchen so I've got a three pound cauliflower I'm just gonna cut it up into florets now okay big pot of boiling salted water that's a slow boil for about five or six minutes until the cauliflower is just tender in the meantime I'm gonna make a delicious white sauce first thing I do is I'm gonna heat up two cups of milk in the meantime grate some cheese I need about 3/4 of a cup of green air about half of the cup is gonna go into the sauce and then I'm gonna put some on top it's all brown and delicious okay so about two tablespoons of butter okay three tablespoons of flour all at once so I'm just cook the flour and the butter together it actually becomes like a paste just gonna pour the milk right in whoa really hot and then just stay this and you see it really thickens up so it's a really good white sauce no it's really nice and smooth now actually you can see it really coats the back of the spoon nicely okay it's thick enough I'm just going to turn it off the heat and add some great flavor first this salt and a teaspoon of kosher salt half a teaspoon of pepper and the next thing is really classic French spice so quarter of a teaspoon of ground nutmeg and then lots of delicious Gruyere cheese about a half a cup and I had parmesan it's not so classic for French Greta knows but it gives it a nice nutty flavor better half a cup of grated Parmesan and then just stir together smells so good you can really smell the nuttiness of the gray air and the spicy parmesan and even nutmeg okay that's done I think cauliflower is ready [Music] and I steam bath this is the Grattan dish I'm gonna use it's about an 8 by 11 but it doesn't have to be exact so the first thing I do is put about a third of the sauce in the bottom it even looks like it has a lot of flavor doesn't and then the cauliflower and then the rest of the sauce that actually looks good already but I'm gonna make a nice crumb topping so it gets brown and crusty it'll be so good okay so I need a little bit of butter so it's a quarter cup of breadcrumbs quarter of a cup of Greer just gonna mix this together I'm just gonna sprinkle it over the top and then just drizzle it with a little bit of butter never hurt anything I'm just gonna leave that to room temperature and refrigerate it and bake it just before the party [Music] okay so the next vegetable I'm gonna make it's also great to make an advance I call its green green spring vegetables so first I'm going to do is cut off the ends of the asparagus and just cut them on a diagonal the ends are pretty hard so you don't eat those and then put it in the boiling water and blanch them really quickly you want them crisp tender next thing I'm going to do was french stream beans these are called Eriko vert what I do maybe quarter a half a pound of each vegetable it doesn't really matter it's just cut off the ends of the string beans and by now the asparagus should be done this is a great thing it's a Chinese strainer and it's great for lifting vegetables out of hot water I'm just gonna put them in ice water to set the color and stop the cooking you want them a little tender but not completely done okay then the stream beans go in same water and the next thing I have is broccolini I find it really tender and delicious now okay string beans are done happens fast right into the same ice water and then the broccolini and the last vegetable is sugar snap peas the good news is they already come with the end snap so you don't have to do it yourself now get broccoli nice really fast it's done right into the same ice water I'm gonna go the sugar snap peas just about 60 seconds perfect I'm gonna drain these I'm gonna put them in the refrigerator and they'll be ready to saute with showers but enough of the vegetables it's time for pumpkin mousse parfait [Music] this is so wonderful it's a parfait and a tall glass and it's got pumpkin mousse and layers of whipped cream and crumbled cookies it's just delicious the first thing you need though it's quarter of a cup of good dark rum I love this it just smells like the Caribbean to me and we're gonna do is dissolve one packet of gelatin right into the rum just gonna let that soak for a minute and then I'm gonna heat it up and add it back in so first thing I need is one can of pumpkin you can make it from a real pumpkin or you can use this this actually tastes better pumpkin can be really stringy and right out of the can it's just delicious so it's a 15 ounce can of pumpkin puree and I need 1/2 a cup of regular sugar half a cup of light brown sugar just lightly packed is the way its measured okay that's it half a cup of light brown sugar I need two egg yolks and now to get lots of good flavor I'm gonna put in 2 teaspoons of orange zest right in I need half a teaspoon of cinnamon half a teaspoon of salt quarter of a teaspoon of nutmeg I'm just gonna stir it all together mmm this already smells good I love the orange and cinnamon together that looks gorgeous color okay gotta make a mousse out of it I'm gonna take the gelatin I'm gonna heat it up and then add it back in so you'll see that it's a little lumpy when it's softened but when it's dissolved with heat it's really liquidy so that's perfect okay so I'm just gonna pour this right into the pumpkin mixture such a great it may smell the room when it gets hot and what this is gonna do is when it's refrigerated the pumpkin mousse is gonna set just mix it in okay so I need 1/2 cups of heavy cream we want it to be cold before you start because it'll whip so be careful at the end perfect so I'm just gonna take this whipped cream and fold it in for the pumpkin mixture and that's gonna really lighten it and make it sort of like moosie okay now the best way to fold something is to put your spatula through the middle and then fold it over and then turn the bowl and fold it over and that way you don't deflate the cream and you get really light mousse so now what I want to do is I'm gonna layer the pumpkin mousse whipped cream and cookies ginger cookies so the next thing I need to do is make more whipped cream but this time I want to make sweetened whipped cream so I'm gonna have one cup of cream doesn't have to be exact one tablespoon of sugar and one teaspoon of vanilla loves good vanilla I'm just gonna whip that up [Music] so this is what I'm going to put the new thing don't over with it otherwise I mean liquid butter I've actually found if you use a pastry bag it's clear sweeter so I put the muesli bag if you have a pastry bag with a round tip just a plain round tip or even any kind of a big tip I'll show you how quickly it goes just put about a third in the bottom okay so that's the first layer of mousse a little layer of whipped cream now because I love things that have different textures so the most creamy the whipped cream sweet I'm gonna have some crumbled ginger cookies so when you bite into it you get something that's creamy something that's smooth and something that's crunchy it looks great too doesn't that one on the layer of pumpkin [Music] now another layer of whipped cream a little bit top of each one more ginger the last layer of pumpkin well that worked out perfectly [Music] and just so everybody knows we stock it what's in it little ginger cookie decoration on the top and doesn't that look like the party just fridge right that and then I'm gonna make quad of pork with smell stuffing it's gonna be really good [Music] so I want to make a special meal but it doesn't mean it has to be complicated so for the main course I'm gonna make loin of pork and stuff it with fennel show you how to make it so I've cut up about 2 cups of onions just rough chop okay now I need 2 cups of sliced fennel I'm just gonna take out the core I love the anise flavor of this can already smell it it's wonderful and then just slice it thinly so that should be about 2 cups just gonna let this cook for about 15 minutes until the onions and fennel attender and then the fennel gets really sweet wonderful flavor in the meantime let me get some garlic ready and fresh thyme give it lots of flavor some chop the garlic no the thing about garlic is I don't want to put it in too early because it burns really quickly so just let the onions and fennel cook and then put the garlic and at the last minute just a rough chop and then fresh thyme I really prefer to use fresh herbs when you can alright let's see how the onions and fennel just toss them we don't want them to brown too much oh this is beginning to look good I just want to add the garlic add the fresh thyme just chop it up a smidge just release all the oil from the time teaspoon of salt 1/2 teaspoon of pepper okay now I'm just gonna add a little bit of wine and what that's gonna do is to glaze the pan it's gonna scrape up all those brown bits that lots of flavor hmm this looks great smells even better okay I'm just gonna turn the heat off and let that sit it'll cool off while I make fresh breadcrumbs so fresh breadcrumbs I'm just going to take white bread cut off the crusts I'm just gonna dice it it's gonna be nice fluffy bread crumbs crumbs [Music] okay now I'm gonna unroll the pork so what I've asked the butcher to do is to butterfly it like a letter so it's in three parts and it's gonna open like that so just see let's see yeah that's perfect okay in a salt and pepper it season it well because you want to make sure it has lots of flavor fresh pepper so now I want to put the bread crumbs into the stuffing so about three cups of fresh breadcrumbs into the cooled fennel and onions and that's gonna really bind it and hold it together so when the loin of pork is sliced the stuff and won't fall out them okay so it's nice and cool now I'm just gonna put it right on top of a loin of pork if I'm gonna bake this right away it doesn't matter whether the filling is cooled but since I'm gonna put it in the refrigerator and bake it another day I want to be sure kind of like the Thanksgiving turkey but the stuffing is really cool and I'm gonna roll it up like a jelly roll just like that and you want to end fat side up like that doesn't have to be perfect okay now just gonna tie it up with butchers string you can find this in any cookware store there are all kinds of fancy ways to tie this but just not at the top is totally fine because I'm gonna take it off before I serve it anyway and what this is gonna do is keep the wanted work in a really nice shape they'll keep it nice and round and keep the stuffing in and that way also it cooks evenly and okay now I'm just gonna rub the top of this with a little olive oil oops I put a lot of olive oil salt pepper okay into the fridge and it's gonna be all ready to go into the oven for my dinner party [Music] what a day lots of shopping the good news is dinner's ready it's in the fridge I'm going to put it in the oven saute three vegetables and dinner's done okay that's gonna roast 425 degrees for about 20 to 30 minutes and then we're gonna lower the temperature to 350 and it's gonna go for about twenty to thirty minutes until it's exactly one hundred thirty seven degrees [Music] the cauliflower got tan I'm gonna bake at 375 for about 25 to 30 minutes and you know great ends aren't that sensitive if you leave one of them put it in with the loin of pork so I'm just gonna chop up three shallots how you doing over there the string is done but I need to just show me how you had a car do that yeah so I'll show you I'll do one or two how's that that's perfect so the knife should be pretty sure what you want to do is use the blade back and forth see the family do it too soon because I want the filling to fall out easy okay back to the vegetables inside the oil and the butter all melted I'm gonna put in three shower sort of chopped up it's a great way to make vegetables when you have company because all I'm doing it's gonna reheat them with a shower [Music] [Applause] okay I'm done are you doing over there I am done that's it a dish of the time it doesn't it can really smell the fennel can check looks great a little parsley always helps right okay are you in charge of this I am thank you and can you take this - absolutely I'll be very much calls like four at ten it smells so good it's a party [Music] [Laughter] you know there are people do you think [Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Music]
