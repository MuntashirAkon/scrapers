so for the turkey meatloaf I've already sauteed two large onions and some olive oil salt and pepper and some fresh thyme that I got out of my garden I love the smell of fresh thyme I love it in the turkey meatloaf just take it off a stem like that so I cooked it all together for about 10 minutes until the onions are translucent and they're just cooked through but not browned and then I'm going to add some other ingredients to make it flavorful I'm actually you can do this off the heat Worcestershire sauce chicken stock and some tomato paste so about a third of a cup of Worcestershire sauce 3/4 of a cup of chicken stock I have homemade chicken stock but you can use a good canned chicken stock and he's good to mate app it's really thick it'll add a lot of flavor that 1 and 1/2 teaspoons I'm just going to mix that all together this is the kind of meatloaf even your husband won't believe it's not beef it's delicious so this is ground turkey it's actually better for you than ground beef and it's not you can get get it at the butcher he's going to say to you you want white 5 pounds of ground turkey it's a lot you can always cut the recipe in half but I think why not make a large quantity and you can always have it for sandwiches I want to take all the wonderful flavoring dump it into the turkey meatloaf put in one and a half cups of plain breadcrumbs I just use package breadcrumbs they taste just as good in this recipe as homemade ones and there's so much easier and then three eggs and that's going to hold the mixture together this is great in the winter served hot but it's also wonderful in the summer served cold with a green salad and of course when there's lots of turkey meat left my husband's very happy because I make a meatloaf sandwiches for lunch so I'm just going to pour this on top and now comes a really squishy part clean ham I'm going to just mix all this together I want to do a really lightly I don't want to pack it down so I'm going to do a really fingertip II just mix it together it Whitely until all the onions and the Worcestershire sauce and the breadcrumbs are mixed in with the turkey okay that's it nicely mixed and now all I'm going to do with really messy hands is dump it out on this pan and shape it into the meatloaf this is a really freeform meatloaf shape so I'm just going to make it into a meatloaf I'm going to put ketchup over the top of it to keep it really moist and delicious how homey is that great okay so this goes in the oven 325 for about an hour and a half
