and he thinks we'll have fun together so I'm doing the food and Michael's hosting the party I'm making a delicious roasted sea bass with shrimp and mussels with couscous and pine nuts on the side and for dessert crisp meringue shells filled with stewed berries and whipped cream [Music] like that I made a deal that I would do dinner and he's gonna do the table setting so we each get to do exactly what we want to do so the first thing I'm making is meringues and make meringue shanty which is meringues with fresh berries and whipped cream how bad can that be so I need six egg whites just the whites okay into the mixer then turn it on and whip it up quarter to teaspoon of cream of tartar which gives them volume big pinch of salt for flavor one cup of sugar at it slowly okay those go on high-speed and while those with I'm gonna put the pants ready so I'm gonna make individual meringues for each person so even take a measure I'm using three and a half inch measure I'm gonna draw circles a piece of parchment paper and a half she can and then what I'll do is I'll pipe each of the meringue disks inside the circle so I know that they're all three and a half inches so just to make sure that the meringue doesn't end up with pencil marks on it I'm turn this piece of paper over and just pack them on the top okay let's see how the minds doing I they look great they're very high volume they're whipped their firm need a little bit of vanilla half a teaspoon just to give it lots of flavor okay well the only thing I've put in now is a half a cup of sugar I put some sugar in the beginning but I'm gonna put this in the end it makes a much tenderer meringue if you fold the last half a cup of sugar in okay half a cup of sugar just bring it on I'm just gonna fold it in with a spatula it's actually surprising what a difference this makes I actually love meringues after a big dinner it's a really nice sort of light dessert I like to make them individual meringues like this filled with berries I like to make pavlovas their big disks filled with whipped cream and fruit or chocolate okay I'm just gonna fill a piping bag the biggest bag you have with a big star tip is great and guess what if you don't have a piping bag you can just do it with a spoon and just form those little shells but I'll show you how to do it with a piping bag Akili great it's a really messy job let's start on the edge make a circle around the edge and then come straight inside so I'm making a flat disc and then I'm gonna make an edge around the outside that's it actually maybe I'm gonna start from the center and go around the outside that's even better and then just keep building up the edge so you end up with a nice shell and the good news is if you do one that you don't like and just put it right back in the bag you turn over the ends so that when you turn them back it's nice and clean right Han this is something you really don't want to do on a rainy day the meringues end up you find that everybody's had meringues that are sort of chewy it's cuz they they it was too much humidity in the air really makes a huge difference surprising but it's true but you can store them for a really long time in an airtight container so find a really nice day and you can make them in advance okay I'm gonna be covered in meringue by the time I'm done with this okay just start the circle I'm going to fill these with whipped cream and berries at the party so they don't get soggy okay into the oven 200 degrees for two hours it's a cool oven so they get nice and crisp but not browned and I can't wait to see what Michaels doing the table is such a fabulous florist so instead of doing a flower centerpiece I decided to just do a big mass of green grapes and this way if the girls get hungry which I doubt they will they can just steal a grape which I think I'll do hmm and then just to make the centerpiece a little more special so it doesn't look like a big bowl of grapes I just went and picked some vines out in the garden and just tuck them around meringues are only as good as what you put in them so I'm gonna make stewed berries and some whipped cream so in order to make the stew berries I'm gonna take a half a pint of fresh blueberries have your kind of fresh raspberries third of a cup of water six tablespoons of sugar what's a quarter of a cup it's four tablespoons so I need one and a half I think I'm gonna do some orange zest because they'll give the raspberries and blueberries a little depth of flavor about a quarter of a teaspoon a freshly grated orange zest I like when something has a little extra flavor sort of like an under flavor that it doesn't overpower it just to sort of hit you quietly so quarter teaspoon of freshly grated orange zest I'm just going to turn this on so this just needs to come to a boil and then I'm gonna lower the heat and cook it for about eight to ten minutes until a little syrupy and I'm gonna add some more fresh fruit I think it might need a little hit at the end to something like cognac or liqueur little bit that's gonna be I think I'll just check out the pantry lower thee so I'm always looking for that one thing that like brings out the essence of a dish you don't really know it's there but it just tastes incredible so for the stup berries black currant liqueur cassis a little too bitter oh I know front woz it's raspberry liqueur and it's really gonna make the berries come alive so this looks done it's been simmering a little bit it's a little syrupy a little Framboise about two teaspoons just enough to give it a hit again just a little flavor but not to overpower it and now off the heat I'm gonna add two pints of fresh raspberries so it's gonna be mostly fruit with a little bit of sauce on it and I'm gonna fill those wonderful meringue shells with it it's really more fruit than it is sauce but just enough to sort of make it wet and delicious okay I'm just gonna pour it into a little bowl and then I'll have the meringues and the berries and I'll make whipped cream at Michael's house and now I need to just turn them ranks off I'm gonna leave them in the oven and they're gonna get really crisp [Music] an X for the main course going to make roasted striped bass with shrimp and mussels so delicious [Music] roasted striped bass it's a really easy thing to make and it actually looks fantastic so know what Michael's friends are like I wouldn't worry about friends of friends but I don't know they're good cooks oh I'll bet they're fun first I'm gonna make a sauce with lots of Mediterranean flavors saffron garlic tomatoes and then we're gonna bake the striped bass in the sauce so first for the sauce I need two tablespoons of olive oil add a cup of chopped onion two ounces of pancetta give it a little smoky flavor just dice it you can use bacon if you can't find pancetta but an Italian deli would have pinched at it you want to ask them slice it really thick Lee for you but a half an inch thick okay so the pancetta just goes in and we've cooked the pincette and onions together for about 10 minutes until the onions are translucent when the pancetta is cooked it's actually great sauce for any kind of like a thick meaty fish like swordfish or halibut but I particularly like with striped bass I can't wait to see the table Michael's doing he does amazing table settings so as an icebreaker I decided to put the girl's favorite flowers in front of their place setting and these orange tulips are for you-know-who boom the onions for the striped bass are looking good it's the beginning of the sauce pancetta and onions and now I think we need a little garlic give it a little spunk so just about a tablespoon of chopped garlic it's about three large cloves of garlic right in just cook it for a minute just until the garlic starts to cook okay now I need some Tomatoes one can of chopped tomatoes I want to drain that tomatoes I'm just gonna take them out with a slotted spoon right into the sauce just like that okay just stir them in okay give it even more flavor a little saffron very Mediterranean teaspoon teaspoon of salt please use kosher salt half a teaspoon of pepper and some wine about a half cup of white wine always use a good wine that you would drink and just to give it even more flavor about a quarter cup of Pernod which is a fennel flavored look her just enough that's a real Provencal flavor so the sauce is gonna simmer for about five minutes I'm gonna get the fish ready so the first thing I need is the bass and I'm one bass fillet an incredibly large bass fillet which I want to cut in half so it'll fit in the dish just cut it right in half turn around okay that looks good just like that I have about 24 mussels that it's that have been clean put them right on top and a pound of shrimp but actually peeled and deveined but I just left the tails on because I think it looks great just like that it's pretty lit with salt and pepper I love it's a whole seafood dish and the sauce looks like it's perfect it smells wonderful can actually smell the fennel from the Perrineau and the garlic tomatoes hmm it's gonna be good okay right on the top okay I'm gonna bake at 350 degrees for about 20 to 30 minutes until the fish is just cooked and the mussels are open and next I'm gonna make a delicious couscous with pine nuts to go with it I'm almost ready to go to my friend Michaels to meet some friends of his that he's got over I'm bringing dinner so I'm making striped sea bass which is done and all I have to do now is make some couscous so I'm just gonna heat some butter chopped up some shallots so it's four tablespoons of butter and about 3/4 of a cup of shallots couscous is about as easy as it gets basically make a broth that's got lots of flavor in it and just let the couscous steam in it about 3 large shallot should do it got to do it quickly before they make you cry huh okay 3/4 of a cup of chopped shallots right in cook them for a few minutes until they're translucent I actually love to do this kind of party with France where Michael's doing the table setting I'm doing the food it's really a shared effort and it's much more fun I can add 3 cups of chicken stock I really prefer especially for this homemade chicken stock but if you don't have it a can would be okay right into the shallots and butter I'm just gonna bring that to a boil and then make the couscous have TSP of salt Carter salt half a teaspoon of pepper okay now off the heat I'm gonna add the couscous I need one and a half cups couscous is a like a dried pasta semolina just pour it right in and the good news doesn't require any cooking at all give it a stir put the lid on and let the couscous steam it's gonna get really fluffy and just full of the the flavor so I'm just gonna toast some pine nuts they're also called pin yoli's I'm just gonna keep an eye on those but I'm gonna chop up some parsley in the meantime okay I need about two tablespoons of chopped parsley so this is just cut off the leaves gave the most flavor and just give them a rough chop you can use curly parsley flat leaf parsley I think flat leaf has a little more flavor okay that's good let's yeah that pine nuts are doing oh they're perfect nice and brown and toasted evenly perfect okay let's see how the couscous is doing it should be nice

meringues and dinner you take two you get it off I got sure yep I got it fantastic just a few things to do before the girls arrive I'm just gonna make whipped cream for the meringues and stewed berries and then everything's gonna be done so very cold heavy cream about two cups two tablespoons of sugar three spoons of good vanilla nothing really special your degrees for two hours it's a cool oven so they get nice and crisp but not browned and I can't wait to see what Michaels doing the table is such a fabulous florist so instead of doing a flower centerpiece I decided to just do a big mass of green grapes and this way if the girls get hungry which I doubt they will they can just steal a grape which I think I'll do hmm and then just to make the centerpiece a little more special so it doesn't look like a big bowl of grapes I just went and picked some vines out in the garden and just tuck them around meringues are only as good as what you put in them so I'm gonna make stewed berries and some whipped cream so in order to make the stew berries I'm gonna take a half a pint of fresh blueberries have a pint of fresh raspberries third of a cup of water six tablespoons of sugar this is a quarter of a cup it's four tablespoons so I need one and a half I think I'm gonna do some orange zest because they'll give the raspberries and blueberries a little depth of flavor okay give it even more flavor a little saffron very Mediterranean teaspoon teaspoon of salt please use kosher salt half a teaspoon of pepper and some wine about a half a cup of white wine always use a good wine that you drink and just to give it even more flavor about a quarter cup of Pernod which is a fennel flavoured look her just enough that's a real Provencal flavor so the sauce is gonna simmer for about five minutes I'm gonna get the fish ready so the first thing I need is the bass and I'm one bass fillet an incredibly large bass fillet which I want to cut in half so it'll fit in the dish let's cut it right in half turn around okay that looks good just like that I've about twenty four muscles that have been cleaned put them right on top and a pound of shrimp but actually peeled and deveined but I just left the tails on because I think it looks great just like that sprinkle it with salt and pepper Thanks and the berries and I make whipped cream at Michael's house and now I need to just turn the meringues off I'm gonna leave them in the oven and they're gonna get really crisp [Music] an X for the main course I'm gonna make roasted striped bass with shrimp and mussels so delicious [Music] roasted striped bass is a really easy thing to make and it actually looks fantastic so know what Michael's friends are like I wouldn't worry about friends of friends but I don't know they're good cooks so I'll bet they're fun first I'm gonna make a sauce with lots of Mediterranean flavors saffron garlic tomatoes and then we
