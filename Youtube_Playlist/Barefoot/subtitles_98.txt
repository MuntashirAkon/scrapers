[Music] now my two rules of entertaining are particularly important in the summer keep it simple I use fresh local ingredients that don't require an enormous amount of cooking to make them taste good and to make it ahead of time so I can have fun at my party I've got a weekend ahead my friends are coming it's good food and I'm ready to have some fun firming shrimp linguini so easy so delicious and assemble dessert that I'm going to buy from the store I'll be experimenting with some cocktails so Geoffrey has fun the minute he walks in the door a classic Manhattan a mai tai that screams summer vacation and a Long Island iced tea which tastes like iced tea but it's really a killer of a drink to go with the drink a great smoked salmon dip peaches and saw tuned for deserved really easy and so delicious Sunday afternoon I'm throwing a beach party with some friends on the menu some delicious barbecued chicken Szechuan noodles broccoli with garlic and soy sauce and taking us back to our childhood s'mores on the fire how delicious is up all that melting chocolate and marshmallows there's so much going on I hope you stay for the whole weekend Jeffery's is coming for a short time this weekend so I want to make every minute count so I'm gonna make a few things ahead and in addition to that I'm having a party tomorrow so I really want to have everything done so I can be out of the kitchen I'm gonna make smoked salmon spread and peaches and Sauternes it's gonna be delicious since it only has two ingredients peaches and Saturn you want to make sure they're both really good and the only way to tell whether peach is good is if it smells like a peach I'm gonna dunk them in boiling water just to take the skins off what you don't want to do is go to the store and squeeze it because wherever you squeeze that you're gonna leave a brown spot so depending on how soft the peaches are it's gonna take between 30 seconds and maybe two minutes for the skins to come off easily and the only way to know is just try one okay they should be done they'll just attempt to put in ice water and then just see the peel comes right off what you don't want to do is cook the peaches so we're gonna take them all out now [Music] okay this one's peeling beautifully see how the skin just sort of falls right off when it's right okay freshest on the piece now great so so I turn we're just that sweet dessert wine that's so wonderful I'm just gonna pour it over it so that's right enough soap marinades in it a little bit of sugar really depends on how sweet the peaches are these pretty sweet so I don't need too much and a splash of Grand Marnier a little depth of flavor so I'm gonna make a little snack for Jeffrey when he comes home tomorrow night smoked salmon spread and then we'll have some fresh peaches and Sauternes afterwards it's not a bad snack but the cream cheese out at room temperature I'm just gonna put it in the mixer 8 ounces of cream cheese about a half a cup of sour cream this is great as a dip with crudit√© but it's also good as a spread on what slices of baguette and about a tablespoon of lemon juice freshly squeezed lemon juice and then for lots of flavor some fresh dill would be really nice and just chop it up big rough chop okay then tablespoon of fresh dill right into the mixer and a little bit salt and pepper and teaspoon of course radish forget grading her own horseradish it makes me cry right into the mixer and finally smoked salmon can't I smoked salmon dip with that smoked salmon I tend to like a region salmon because it's a little drier and not quite so salty okay four ounces of smoked salmon right into the dip turn the mixer on mix it up that's more salmon dip done and to a nice ball just because it's just a snack for Jeffrey doesn't mean it can't be gorgeous okay into the fridge I've got a really busy day tomorrow so I've got to get my beauty sleep hi guys I think these raspberr is gonna be perfect you're gonna put these on my charge thank you so much [Music] [Music] right now what I need is one bed gap for my smoked salmon spread no they're always nice and fresh out of the oven Oh fantastic and I need some meringues I'm gonna do whipped cream and berries in them this is so good thank you so much will you charge it for me sure yes thank you this is gonna be delicious I'll call you for dinner soon thank you [Music] my philosophy is you don't always need to make something to have a fabulous dessert so I've gotten meringues from loaves and fishes but they just gorgeous the fresh raspberries from the farm stand I'm just gonna whip up a little whipped cream to fill them how bad can that be so I'm just gonna put some heavy cream in the ball and I've got a mixer fitted with a whisk attachment what really cold cream a little sugar everybody likes to flavor whipped cream with vanilla but I like to try different things like rum or this is cassis it's a black currant liqueur and wait to see turns mole and the good news is you have to taste it to make sure it's the right combination it's so good it's like berry flavored whipped cream who wouldn't want that done sometime just gonna assemble them I love a combination of whipped cream because it's creamy and the meringues which are sort of dry and crisp topped with really sweet berries [Music] for dessert that's pretty great isn't it I can't wait for dessert incredible for attempted florists these are look at these only sweet person fabulous so are you in charge of arranging the flowers the turtles flowers I'm making dinner fabulous you need anything buzz the nurse we're right in the kitchen [Music] I'm making linguini with shrimp scampi it's a great summer dish I add oil the pasta pot so that the pasta doesn't stick together and salt for flavor okay that's gonna cook for seven to ten minutes according to the directions on the package so I'm making a centerpiece with hydrangeas I use a knife because a scissor will seal the stem and we want as much water in the flowers as possible [Music] okay three tablespoons of olive oil about three tablespoons of butter I do the olive oil because it is a high burning temperature and the butter because there's lots of flavor I know this looks like a lot but it's the sauce of the entire dish and about one and a half tablespoons of garlic with garlic you really don't want to cook it too long for just about a minute nothing worse than the flavor of garlic so one minute while I get everything else ready so the first thing is shrimp and what I buy is a peeled and deveined shrimp fish store if you can't buy it you can always peel and devein it yourself I'm gonna add the pound of shrimp and just cook it for a very short time like three to five minutes and all that flavor of the garlic is gonna get into the shrimp so first thing I do is salt-and-pepper the shrimp I'm going to have lots of flavor because when you add the pasta the sauce has to flavor the pasta also something really strong with flavor just turn the shrimp so they cook evenly on both sides it's so good all that garlic and butter and oil how bad can that be Michaels so great with flowers I can't wait to see what he's doing at the table [Music] so just draining from the Train the water from it and then it's gonna go right into that pan with the shrimp and the garlic and butter and oil it's gonna absorb all that great flavor okay just like that two spoons just toss it all together this is actually a great way to make any pasta Italians do it even when you're making pasta with tomato sauce as you cook the pasta and the sauce together for the last few minutes and it really absorbs the flavor okay and then the last ingredients are lemon zest lemon juice I like a little bit of heat so just sprinkling of red pepper flakes okay just toss that together and then have two more things to put in parsley okay right on top and then because I want you to you can't really see the lemon but I want you to know it's lemon what I do is a few thin slices of lemon people aren't gonna eat them but they'll they'll see that it's lemon so I'm gonna add a few slices of lemon to the whole thing before I finish tossing this is really great summer lunch I think Michaels gonna love it it's got so much garlic we never customers who once is six o'clock in the morning yeah so that hurt so save room for dessert so it's meringue with seeds and fresh raspberries I mean how summary is that it cheers to a great summer I'm gonna have to stop eating every Friday night when Jeffery comes home and make him a scotch and a roast chicken well it's time to shake things up a little bit I thought wouldn't it be great when he walks through the front door to have some cocktail for him so I'm gonna try three different cocktails first a Long Island iced tea and it has nothing to do with tea okay so here goes ice cubes into the glass now the liqueur lots of it all in the same quantity start with gin quarter of a cup sort of a cup of vodka and a quarter of a cup of white rum and there's still more next a quarter of a cup of tequila and a quarter of a cup of Cointreau the orange flavored liqueur from France you don't want to drive after you drink this and you want to make sure your guests know how strong it is next time lemon juice half a cup then a teaspoon of sugar syrup give it a stir drop in some ice cubes in a long tall glass and then pour the Long Island iced tea over the rocks tap the glass with a splash of Cola and a slice of lemon on the rim can't wait to try it imagine this on a hot summer day okay so far so good my next experiment is a mai tai which is that summery cocktail you have in the Caribbean on vacation you know with the one that's all loaded up with pineapples and narashino cherries I do draw the line at those little paper umbrellas though okay here goes so lightly beaten egg white and pour it into a flat plate and then dip the rim of the glass of the egg and then into the sugar my eyes make me feel like it's summer on a beach looks great already doesn't it okay the liqueur white rum half a cup into the shaker next a quarter of a cup of triple sec it's another delicious orange flavored liqueur and then some fresh orange juice at a quarter of a cup and for the zing quarter of a cup of fresh lime juice now some ice cubes about six okay now the energetic part starts shaking and then pour the mai tai into a glass over ice and now the decoration is a little old-fashioned but it's required drop the cherries right into the cocktail then a juicy chuck a pineapple on the rim and some orange so there it is strictly for summer and very tropical I can't wait to taste it one more cocktail to go and it's a classic it's a Manhattan always reminds me of roaring 20s it's made from bourbon and sweet vermouth how bad can that be okay so for the Manhattan start with the ice cubes next remove quarter of a cup and bourbon whole Cup and give it all a stir so chilled glasses make this perfect just chill them in the freezer for about 15 minutes and then a maraschino cherry the crowning glory no wonder people have been drinking this cocktail for more than a hundred years now comes the fun part had to taste these cocktails first minute hat looks great doesn't it [Music] whoa that's lethal Jeff you'll never make it through dinner if I serve him that hmm then the Long Island iced tea looks like iced tea actually tastes like iced tea which is amazing and the last one was a mai tai it actually really looks like the Caribbean isn't it that's it it's really good it tastes like fruit juice it's a little more lethal than that but it's gonna feel like a vacation to Geoffrey and it's gonna be great weekend [Music] we could do the sweet peas the hot pink is the color she never seems to buy yeah that's nice what else we can do the pink peonies the slices left over Baghdad and make croutons out of it just see what easy this is someone take the bread just line it up on a sheet pan a little bit of olive oil just a fresh H one on the top with olive oil it's gonna Brown it and it gives it lots of flavor lots of salt you want to have a really good flavor pepper and into the oven 400 degrees for about 10 to 15 minutes and we have nice crisp they get slices if we should be home any minute [Music] coffee machines I think that I think this is this is exactly what she would love oh these tests look great nice and crispy I've have lots of flavor wait I think I hear Jeffrey hey sweetie I'm back oh you're gonna make me as present maybe later okay right now [Music] keep our cocktails I brought look what I brought you have no idea how many drinks I had to try in order to get these mai tais so I also made you a little smoked salmon dip oh that looks great fresh peaches and Saturn so why I actually don't we eat in the garden more often I don't know but you know every time if you bring this stuff here [Music] I'm always looking for new ways to cook chicken but nothing says some are more than cooking chicken on a grill and I'm gonna marinate it in barbecue sauce the history of this barbecue sauce is pretty amazing years ago at Barefoot Contessa I asked the chef to make three different kinds of barbecue sauce so we could test them I thought well one should be sort of mustardy one should be tomatoey and one would be maybe chinesey and I don't know when they came out one was to mustardy one was to tomatoey and of course one was to chinesey so I took them home and I thought well let me play with it a little bit and I took all three of them I dumped them in one pot and it was a fabulous barbecue sauce and that's what I've been using for 25 years so it's got a lot of ingredients but it's really worth making so what I've done here is I've saut√©ed 1 and a half cups of onions and vegetable oil with lots of garlic for about about 10 minutes until the onions are translucent and then I'm gonna add all these ingredients 1 cup of tomato paste just like one and a half of these small cans and one cup of cider vinegar it's good it's got some sweetness to it a cup of honey this jar is 16 ounces so I need about half and none if this has to be exact just close one cup of mustard I use good Dijon mustard this is 8 ounces so that should do it one cup of hoisin sauce which is the Chinese part of the recipe and the hoisin sauce is like a plum sauce it's very often used for duck and it's great in this and this jar is 8 ounces so it's just a cup that's the hoisin sauce and then 1/2 a cup of Worcestershire sauce oh I hate these little things that they put on the top so this is 5 ounces so I need most of this jar 1/2 a cup of soy sauce and all this can be just approximately just until it tastes great to you and then lots of great spices so I'm gonna put in 2 tablespoons of chili powder it's gonna add lots of spice to it 2 tablespoons of chili powder not quite that much 1 tablespoon of cumin which is sort of a tex-mex Spike's and half a tablespoon of really hot red pepper flakes and you can make this as hot as you want but it's sort of hot but not really huh so I'm just gonna simmer this for about 30 minutes until all the flavors blend together - bet Jeffrey has to go to work we know how much he loves chicken how I am about buying things for party rather than making them ice creams a perfect example why bother making it I'd love to start with good vanilla ice cream lots of toppings and I end up with a dessert that everybody loves so I'm taking vanilla ice cream with great simple toppings it turns grown-ups into fun stirs it works every time I thought I'd make fresh raspberry sauce over vanilla ice cream it's four ingredients and it takes less than ten minutes to make how good is that so start by cooking the raspberries pour them into a pan half a pint of luscious ripe berries is just the right amount and then the sugar half a cup now some water quarter of a cup in the pan turn off the heat okay so that's boiling now now lower the heat and let it simmer for four minutes so while that cooks pulling out a cup of raspberry jam you want seedless raspberry jam because the fresh fruit will have enough seeds in it but after the bowl of the food processor it's been fitted with a steel blade knife Renoir's it's a clear raspberry flavored brandy that you can find in the litter store so now pour in the raspberries and switch the machine on once the sauce were really smooth great that's perfect when you're ready to serve dessert just spoon some of the sauce over scoops of vanilla ice cream and I promise you everyone will be in heaven and no one will know that it took you just 10 minutes to make this sauce is also great with the rags it's wonderful for entertaining because you can make it a day or two in advance here's another idea and it couldn't be easier it's Italian it's called affogato it's a scoop of vanilla ice cream with hot espresso poured over it it's hot and it's cold and absolutely delicious so first things first make the espresso everyone's got their own machine - now how yours works I'm using one Jeffrey got me follow the instructions and the amounts for your machine but make sure you use espresso coffee art won't be unduly authentic if you don't have an espresso maker you can just buy prepared espresso from the coffee shop and then just heat it up before dessert so get your ice cream ready when the clock is hot work right over the ice cream it's as simple as that boom the mix of cold vanilla ice cream and piping hot espresso they melt together it's absolutely sublime well it's too early in the morning for ice cream but Geoffrey like it definitely is a cup of espresso I can't believe you're gonna miss our party I know it's gonna be really fun we save me something yeah I'm having barbecued chicken your favorite Oh I'll save you some where are you gonna cook it on the beach of course oh I'm sorry I'm gonna miss all that sand in here right [Music] can't wait to get to the beach everybody's there lighting the grill getting everything ready I'm just gonna marinate the chicken so I'm just gonna put it in the bowl I always smell chicken to make sure it's fresh so just gonna pour some marinade over it one thing you want to do though is make sure it's cold can actually combine the chicken and the marinade overnight and see these data so I'm just gonna layer it all together smudge it all around it's a technical term smudge so that's the chicken in the marinade okay chicken hands definitely want to wash these okay into the fridge with a chicken we're gonna have a great barbecue later [Music] so to go with a barbecue chicken I'm gonna make Szechuan noodles sort of tex-mex meets Asian fusion so the first thing I do is cook the pasta and actually instead of using Chinese noodles I use Italian dry pasta really it sort of works better this is fettuccine you can use spaghetti any kind of pasta like that was just great this has lots of great ingredients but it also has lots of flavor first thing is six cloves of garlic all chopped up right into the food processor okay next thing is ginger this is what ginger looks like it's a very sort of gnarly but what you want to do is with a sharp knife peel it and then chop it up and it's got great flavor I need a better quarter of a cup chopped up okay just chop this up sort of roughly it's gonna get really pureed in the food processor so it doesn't have to be perfect chopped up nice okay about a quarter of a cup into the food processor okay now all these things from the pantry mostly we probably already have half a cup of vegetable oil half a cup of tahini which is sesame paste it's sort of middle-eastern you can find it you can't find it the grocer sure you probably can you can certainly find in a specialty store okay have a cup have a cup of peanut butter I mean how bad can a sauce be if it's got peanut butter in it so about a half a cup of this this looks like really good peanut butter half a cup of soy sauce this is really all the salt in it plus lots of other flavor and then a quarter of a cup of honey that's about a quarter of a cup let's see it doesn't have to be exact quarter of a cup of dry sherry this is from the liquor store that should do it quarter of a cup of sherry vinegar mmm I love the smell that it's great and vinaigrettes too that should do it two tablespoons of sesame oil you don't want the clear one you want the one that smells like really roasted sesame seeds it's a dark sesame oil there's so much flavor and now comes the heat I'm gonna add cayenne pepper just a pinch just enough to give it some heat Asian chili oil which is really hot whoa and some black pepper and that should do it that's it it's thick it looks so delicious I can smell the ginger and the garlic it's gonna be great but I think the pasta is ready just done [Music] okay save me something later and then toss it together with the hot noodles it's actually great to have the sauce on the hot noodles it really absorbs the flavor and every little extra sauce because as the noodles cool or the pasta cools it's gonna absorb more sauce and now we're gonna add some other great Asian ingredients sliced scallions as much as you like yellow peppers red peppers so it's great because it's pasta and it's wonderful sauce and it's vegetables and it's gonna be so good with barbecued chicken I think a little extra skin ions I'll do it perfectly on this so I'm just slicing on the diagonal and ready for the beach [Music] anybody want a drink so my friends are at the beach I've one thing left to do broccoli with garlic broccoli is cooking away and what I've done is I've cooked garlic whole cloves of garlic and oil for about 15 minutes the garlic is perfectly tender and then the oil is infused with a garlic flavor it's great you add a little heat to it some red peppers this is great for a picnic and just put it in containers and everybody can eat it at the beach okay that's gonna sit for a minute so the broccoli should be just about done just gonna blanch it for about 2 or 3 minutes so it's really just tender but still crisp like a salad and it should be just done right now so it's gonna go right into ice water I want to stop the cooking immediately it's called shocking and what its gonna do is stop the cooking and also set the color so it's gonna be bright green nobody wants to eat brown broccoli salad okay just for a minute until it's cool then I'm gonna drain it and then put a sauce on trying it really well coz when the broccoli is dry it will hold much more of the sauce okay right into a bowl and now what I'm gonna do is just add some of the garlic oil a little bit of the world tossed around it just enough to flavor it the whole cloves of garlic which are actually really sweet when they're cooked like this that looks pretty good and since we have an Asian thing going I thought maybe instead of salt I'd use a little soy sauce on it just a few tablespoons toss it all together and how easy is that already for the beach [Music] [Music] anyway you go to a beach party and everybody is on their own blanket I don't feel like I'm at the same party I think it's so much nicer to all be together at one big party so I've gone out and gotten sort of straw window shades all kinds of wacky things inexpensive pillows that I got on sale and we can all be together at the table in the middle and we're really comfortable hey it's a great way to have a party [Music] so he's marinating this for Oh a couple of hours and you don't have to cook the chicken at all before you feed em I just put it on the grill you know the key is not making sure that the grill is far enough away from the coals the outside doesn't burn before the chicken cooks the friend of mine says it's not a barbecue until the fire department shows so we have some Szechuan noodles and broth so we have that welded chicken cooks Szechuan noodles and broccoli guess where I got it the Chinese takeout place they're very social I see the chickens ready it's just cooking away here we need something put it right there plates napkins just put on one big play [Music] anybody want barbecue [Laughter] [Laughter] as in anytime you have marked out people will follow you anywhere right that's true right okay so I'm gonna have to make some more okay so we have you can just use regular stick so we have fancy sticks okay so everybody gets large manila do you do one or two so two marshmallows on the fire which really that's the only thing you learned in girls standing up refusal right [Laughter] I'd say this awards are great there's not a picnic without the sand
