I think of holiday wreaths I think of how they read you can eat because I'm always thinking about things to put my mouth for the holiday baking championship the Baker's were asked to tap into a seasonal trend create edible holiday wreaths cool right so here's when you can try at home my Madeline wreath was sour cherry mousse it looks like a holiday wreath but instead of weaves we're using green-tinted Madeline's here's how you make up so Madeline batter is typically as jinhua or French butter cake you start out by whipping some medals whatever your whipping age you're usually whipping egg whites here you're whipping the whole egg it's gonna whip up it's gonna get really frothy and really really like a light buttery color once you start getting some foam on top that's gonna start adding the sugar okay see Jose is getting really nice and fluffy in there just added really really slowly and you basically tempering the eggs and letting them know that they're about to get sweet God pinch of salt now we're really nice and fluffy here turn it down a little bit and just two teaspoons of vanilla there's a teaspoon of lemon zest now we're gonna bake Madeleine's for breakfast leave them as they are since we're making a wreath we got to make them green listen man food coloring is fun you can put food coloring in something like a Madeleine and make something really cool people like eating food that's a beard color if it makes sense like you don't want to eat a green steak but green Madeleine's think that's okay okay now we got nice fluffy whipped eggs let's make a Xinhua so you have to do is a lot of very very gentle folding 20 of these eggs we're gonna fold two cups of all-purpose flour here I have a cup of melted butter I'm gonna slowly and gently fold from the top because you're taking your time with this cake this is what's gonna give you that beautiful texture of a Madeleine Madeline's are really special cooking if you read proofs to know I'm talking and you really take your time with Madeline's and you're gonna get a delicious texture tell you many things are pre to make the pre to look at in the preview that is a good-looking batter now think about Madeline's you got a pipe into the molds and get them in the oven right away okay and then gently without a lot of force you don't need a lot of Madeleine's to make this reef you're also gonna need a lot about on two feet everybody these things go fast 375 for about 15 minutes okay so let's talk about cream cheese mousse now the cream cheese is room temperature really really important if it's cold this will take forever and you'll get big old chunks cream cheese is a great base for a mousse because it's super super stable you start adding some sugar now you can use a stand mixer for this the thing is it's always gonna be a kid around the kids always gonna want to lick the beaters I like the beaters you slipped up here we'll turn this up a little bit now you're cooking with gas teaspoon of vanilla and there you put us all now we're all incorporated let's deal with our chairs these are sour cherries sour cherries are an awesome holiday flavors pull out a bunch of cherries but I'm also gonna use about two tablespoons of the cherry juice the syrup itself is really sour so what I'm gonna do is taste as I go so these cherries are doing triple duty here they are color their texture and the flavor it's no it's good some nice chunks of cherry okay let's give it a whirl get it give it a whirl they're gonna add some quiche it's really gonna make the flavor League deep that's gonna be delicious to make this into a moose gonna fold in whipped cream again with the folding you're using this is a very delicate dessert all these things take a really light touch this is a really fun recipe to do when you're really trying to practice your baking skills that's like a really nice let's give this a little what fer okay so we're all set moose is nice and cold all my cookies have cooled and they're nice and bright green now we're ready to build a wreath the Moose is a glue that's gonna hold the whole wreath together my wreath is about this wide cool and now I can start placing cookies now all that's left is decorating and put a nice big bow on here I'm gonna put a couple of maraschino berries and we're gonna make it snow okay so the first decoration we're gonna make for the wreath is going to be a modeling-chocolate bow so here I made big block of modeling chocolate and then I dyed it red working with modeling chocolate you want to make sure it's warm enough that you can use it but it's not so one that's gonna melt there's a sweet spot you got to find it when you're rolling out modeling chocolate with the rolling pin which one to do is start out with no parchment paper on top just to get it nice and fine cut it into strips and wrap it around this paper towel tube and that's gonna be our boat you can make the boat stick together just use a tiny tiny bit of water you guys you can totally do this at home I need his household items and modeling Chuck super easy that's ready for the fridge these are maraschino cherries I got a whole bowl here that I've drained out all the liquid is gone I'm gonna use the cherries as the little berries inside the wreath cool thing is you got Madeline's with a sour cherry moose adults are gonna love that then you'd out these little maraschino is all over there and all the kids are gonna eat the maraschino cherries there's something for everybody you know the color of these cherries really pops you don't want to
