okay let's say you get a gift basket for the holidays it's got some stuff in there and you just don't know what to do with it can take that stuff and repurpose it and make other things with for the holiday baking championship the Baker's receive holiday food baskets and had to create an amazing dessert made from their gift items so I just got a gift basket had some brandy in it and had some candied pecans I was like okay what can I do with these things what I can do I can make some candies I'm gonna do is I'm gonna make Brandi and maple cream jelly I'm gonna dip it in chocolate and I'm gonna roll it around and smash candied pecans it's gonna be delicious all right so to make these jellies first thing I have to do is prep your pan take a regular cake pan just like this wrap it in plastic wrap make sure you get the plastic all the way down into the corners here then take some parchment paper cut it to size and stick that in your pan also when you're prepping your pan you want to make sure that the plastic wrap goes up the side and out this way once your jellies are done you can grab the plastic wrap and pull the whole thing out makes it really easy so you're not digging around in here and messing up the edges okay so first let's make the maple cream you're gonna bloom some gelatin okay so i have here for envelopes of gelatin and a poor in just enough water kind of get it going Shelton's really fun stuff pour the water in there make sure all the gelatin gets nice and wet and it just kind of turns into this stuff okay so while the gelatin is blooming we're gonna heat up the cream one make sure they happen half is nice and warm is that's gonna melt the gelatin it's just about to boil so let's turn the heat down gonna add this gelatin and you go the hot cream will start to melt it like we're almost all the way melted going to add the sugar we get add the maple syrup real maple syrup come with a like a tin can with a rust on it has a picture of a tree and a snowy landscape a little tap sticking out of it mm-hmm okay so just give this a stir make sure all that sugars melted all that gelatin is infused I think we're good to go so now I'm gonna do is pour this into my prepared cake pan put it in the fridge to set up should take about 40 minutes okay let's let this set up okay so 40 minutes have passed it looks like our jellies are looking good that's our maple cream now let's make the brandy jelly what I have is one cup of simple syrup let's bloom this gelatin just about there the trick here is you want to keep the alcohol in the brandy so I'm gonna make sure that the gelatin is all the way melted you know poor the brandy in and take it off the heat right away if you don't all the alcohol will evaporate these are like gummies for grown-ups I love gummies okay I think we're in good shape add the brandy now for this on top of the cold maple cream as you do that just make sure that you're moving the stream around so you're not pouring in the same exact spot you do you'll melt a hole in your other guns there you go all right go back in the fridge for another 40 minutes ok so my gelatin is all set up my jellies look really nice now I'm ready to make these candies gonna unmold the jellies and cut them so they came out really nice you can see bottom layer is a maple cream the top layer is the brand new this looks so cool alright I'm going to take a really sharp knife let's give me alicious so I do is I chopped up about three pounds of chocolate put it over a double boiler I never turned into this beautiful stuff now we're gonna temper it so to temper the chocolate poured out onto the table tell me that doesn't look cool so what you do is you just start spreading out the chocolate this is agitated as a chocolate schooling it's crystallizing and you want to make sure that those crystals are really small when you get really small crystals you get really smooth tempered chocolate that snaps when you bite into it you need to feel the chalk is starting to thicken up a little bit so the way that you know that you're done is really it's just by feel you could take a little bit of the chocolate just like this take a little bit of this stick it over here and just watch what it does does it solidify you get shiny does it solidify and get dusty if it's dusty it's not tempered if it's shiny it is temporary this is starting to feel really nice okay I'm gonna go back in the bowl all right tempered chocolate okay so now you have a huge mess in your kitchen the way you want to do just want to scrape all this chocolate up put it back in the bowl and then anything else that's left soap and water that's it totally take care of the chocolate or you can just this is a very sophisticated piece of equipment it's the chocolate dipper 6001 I made it myself out of a fork take the jelly drop it in the chocolate getting a little chocolate on top and pick it up with the fork we want to do is touch the bottom of the jelly to the top of the chocolate the surface tension will grab all the extra chocolate and pull it off there we go looks good lips to fold you're looking at like a box of chocolates you're under like oh how do they get that little design on top that's how they do it and some pecans kind of have a feeling these are gonna be delicious okay so I'm gonna finish the rest of these and get them in the fridge to cool okay so these guys have been chilling in the fridge cannot wait to taste these things it's a nice temper on there that was delicious here's the thing you get a gift box it's got a bunch of weird stuff in there take that stuff mix it up cook it do some fun things to it and you can make it amazing so to get my recipe for chocolate covered maple brandy jellies with nuts go to
