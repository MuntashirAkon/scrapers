ooh how to shoot as the dough that you actually cook on the stove before you put it in the mixer and add eggs to it then when you put it in the oven the outside gelatinizes the inside starts to steam and it goes and it pops up like a popcorn the cool thing is the inside is totally hollow so we can do is take a little stick poke a little hole take a pastry bag full of something yummy I have a creampuff you okay so we just finished filling all the cream puffs we got chocolate orange chocolate peppermint caramel cinnamon now we're gonna make a croquembouche to build this tower we use a mold now you can buy really fancy croquembouche molds and they're really expensive I went to the craft store and I got a styrofoam cone I would cost about dollar 99 and I wrap foil around it's gonna be just fine you put so much work into this croquembouche make it look awesome you want to make sure that your sugar is really warm right because if the sugar is too cold it's gonna be too thick on your cream puffs there's a lot of ways to do this I like using chopsticks it's just easy to get in there easy to grab and easy to let go too I'm just gonna go one at a time and be really really careful when you're doing this hot sugar is like napalm it just won't come off okay so now all you need to do is have a little bit of patience and build all right a couple more and done now we're gonna decorate it so I'm gonna make some spun sugar snowballs this is gonna be really cool okay so let me show you how to make spun sugar first thing I did was I cut the end of a whisk off that's gonna make a bunch of times I'm gonna dip the ends of my adulterated whisk here I'm gonna run it over some chopsticks and the sugar that's trailing off is gonna make these super fine threads you take those threads and gather them up we're gonna make little snow balls okay so take the whisk get a bunch of sugar on there wait till they're all fallen off of the times just like that you want to make sure that your sugar is still liquid but it's cool enough that it's got some viscosity to it if it's too hot you're not gonna get threads like that mix up the sugar and pull it off you just start going back and forth so it's back in the sugar you holy song he was very very gentle Nick snow block so for a croquembouche this size I'm probably to make about 12 or so snow balls now let's make some tinsel all right so to make tinsel what I did was I took two sticks stuck him under my cutting board about a foot apart we're gonna do is I'm gonna drag the sugar over top of them I'm gonna make a really long rope when you do this at home you want to make sure you put down the towel that you don't like parchment paper or something to protect your foot as it sugar goes everywhere I'm gonna take that rope kind of make it into a tube I'm gonna start wrapping it around the croquembouche one more little tinsel so what we've done is taking the Crocker bush we turn into a Christmas tree so this big tall croquembouche and wrapped in so all the way around it now looks like a tree now let's add some snow awesome good job all right there it is my croquembouche it's not a beehive hairdo it's dessert for my croquembouche recipe and all my other recipes go to foodnetwork.com slash duff sweet spot
