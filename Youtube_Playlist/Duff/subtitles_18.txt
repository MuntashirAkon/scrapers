for the holiday baking championship we asked the Baker's to celebrate the season and bake a dessert with a fall harvest ingredient so here's what I would do for a fall harvest dessert using wait for it wait for it butternut squash I'm gonna take this squash I'm gonna turn it into a diplomat cream and I'm gonna make little meringue gift boxes fill the boxes with the cream and it's gonna be awesome now if the meringue takes a long time so let's start with that I'll start out whipping this on relatively slow speed just until I start getting some bubbles in every meringue you want to do a tiny pinch of salt next your cream of tartar and I you see the eggs are starting to get nice and fluffy so start adding this sugar a little bit at a time it's going to get really frothy and then you're gonna stop when you have stiff peaks and it's really shiny you know my rings are awesome they're super light in your mouth and a new not super rich but then when you dry them out you can build stuff with them that's pretty stiff it's not even a sparrow it's like a Finch so this meringue is ready to go so I cut out a stencil just a piece of cardboard just like that put a little handle on there so it's easy to use have a silicone mat I'm gonna spread the meringue on too it's a meringue on there and just gently spread just to the edges there you go do that a few more times five more times to be exact I have six sides we ever do a whole box okay so there's my 6 i'm gonna make a few extra okay i think that should be enough so now i'm going to put it back onto the sheet tray and put it into the oven three hours at 150 degrees let's make some diplomat cream diplomat cream so pastry cream with whipped cream fold it into it it's kind of like a moose so I took a butternut squash I peeled it then I roasted it and put in a food processor and now I have cooked butternut squash puree you could totally buy this stuff if you don't want to deal with a butternut squash but they're really fun and they're cute okay so taking the butternut squash puree egg and add this to the eggs I'm gonna whisk all this good stuff together I want to make sure you have any lumps of cornstarch oh that smells like fall okay just about to boil okay hot milk cold eggs gotta go slow don't want to scramble those eggs just get them used to the idea that they're about to get one go back on the heat I just want to make sure nothing's sticking to the bottom we get burnt just starting to get real thick it's gonna happen real quick cause the cornstarch and the flour thick hang up okay back into this bowl nothing's burnt okay you take the butter and vanilla stir that around till it melts the butters gonna make that page cream nice and smooth you add the vanilla at the end of the Patrian process you don't wanna cook it the more you cook vanilla it loses its flavor you can smell it now while the page cream is still hot take some plastic wrap lay it down you're going to go all the way to the surface of the pastry cream to make sure that you don't get any skin okay so now let's put the pastry cream in the fridge ok so my diplomat cream is chilling in the fridge it's been about three hours so let's check on this meringue looks pretty good first things first gotta get them rings off the sheet pan when you're getting the Rings off of the sheep in make sure you have a nice small offset spatula so you can very gently just get underneath these are very fragile it way absolutely nothing when you pick them up like this and with the edge of your offset just knock loose any little piece that you don't want on there because this has to form a really nice box all these little guys here all gone and say this is probably the ugliest one so there's gonna be the bottom gonna make little piping bag fold flip took me about a month to learn how to do that just practice practice practice you'll get it now here I got some royal icing and put just a skosh here's a plate cut just a little tiny hole just like that move the royal icing down it's what you can do now is do a fun little design on the side of the box you anyway make a snowman make an igloo reindeer ending 1 i'm gonna do a snowflake when you're piping something that's really really small you want to use a really small piping bag because you have so much more control so this is the third side of the box i'm gonna do the four side and the top now we got to build the box lay down a little bit of royal icing right here just took our first side down cock it in case when i saw the signs and get all these corners so the box doesn't fall apart take a little extra time and just pipe some beads along the border it's gonna look really really really nice so the box is looking really good now it's time to fold the diplomat cream so what I'm gonna do is take a little bit of this whipped cream and fold it into the pastry cream that's kind of lighten up the texture they're gonna take that and fold it back into the rest of the whipped cream and that's gonna give me a nice light airy diplomat cream I really getting under there so you gonna take a nice big spoon you need to fill up your box very careful you don't want to mess up all that nice work you just do okay it's looking pretty good you take a little tiny bit of cinnamon put that on top just to give it some color now I need to get a lid on this box and prop it up with a cinnamon stick you want to fill the boxes and serve them immediately so how's that for an edible work of art it's precious but it's perfect to impress you don't want to eat this with a knife and fork to get that meringue crunch with that decadent cream from my meringue a diplomat cream recipes and more go to foodnetwork.com spot
