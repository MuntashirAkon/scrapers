the holiday is that pie right the holiday baking championship Baker's made some awesome pies but I never stopped thinking about what I would do for the perfect holiday pie my mind goes immediately to a pumpkin pie that's actually two desserts in one a good pumpkin cream pie is pretty easy to find and that's great but I like to up the game by adding a whole nother dessert I taught my pumpkin pie with a cheesecake topping this is a balanced beautiful pie that will definitely win awards this recipe i hit the kitchen with my favorite Baker sara gonzalez so start off by making the basic pumpkin cream pudding for the film basically it's milk brown sugar cornstarch and eggs what you're doing if you really think about it is making a pumpkin pastry cream when you're making this just like in a pastry cream slowly add your hot milk you don't want to scramble the eggs that's for breakfast next add the konkan feeling you want a thick almost pudding like consistency that'll help that pie set up a lot better but then just pour it into a prepared gingersnap pie crust
