pi is like the holidays con job classic memories for me for the holiday baking championship we asked the Baker's to create a decorated pie based on a personal holiday memory so I wanted to make a cool decorative portrait on top of a traditional custard pie my cinnamon chess pie is a classic custard pie that face almost all the way in the other then I stopped the baking then top the pie with a color cookie dough put it all back in the oven and everything finishes together all right so let's start with the crust what I have here is one recipe of my pie dough that's been blind baked baked it for about eight minutes at 400 degrees okay so next we're gonna put an egg wash on this pie crust got a little bit of sugar go for it it's tears really good a pot I'm sorry you're in charge all right see all this okay now let's make the custard the cornmeal and of chess pie cut down the sweetness so you know custard pies are really cool and they're always delicious but chess pies are just a little bit earthier and just have a lot more dimension so we have eggs coin meal flour cinnamon butter milk sugar and cooled brown butter you want to make the brown butter but then you want to cool it cuz you don't want to cook the eggs go for it all right we're gonna start adding wet dry wet dry hora meal flour cinnamon sigh man look let's all just saw always when you're making a chest x don't just get regular corn meal you have to get finely ground corn yo your regular corn meal its way to course you don't want that alright that looks nice move slowly add that butter for my job but uh I do this is the brown butter i'm going to add it slow so it doesn't solidify constantly whisking when you're pouring brown butter out you want to stop with about a teaspoon left in there is when you make brown butter all the milk solids get really really dark and a little bit too bitter that very last teaspoon that's where all the burnt stuff is just leave that in the pot so it doesn't end up in your pie okay you're probably looking at this feeling of being like wow that is really really liquidy don't worry about it there's a lot of eggs in there and there's also some flour to help find it up this thing bakes can be really really soft really really delicious so we're gonna bake this by 350 degrees for 35 minutes after 10 minutes though we're gonna cover the edge of the foil to make sure they don't burn okay so while that's baking let's make some cookies okay so what I have here is a sugar cookie dough and I've made a bunch of different colors so this cookie dough is actually a saw blade oh it's a lot more like a shortbread than it is like a traditional sugar cookie can find the recipe of food network com so now what I have I made some stencils I got a little tree with a little trunk I have some presents too it's gonna be really cute first you want to do roll out sheets of the cookie dough and then put it in the freezer so it gets really hard Sarah's gonna roll out this dough in between two pieces of parchment that way she doesn't have to use flour and it's gonna keep the colors really bright want to make sure these cookies are nice and thin because these are gonna bake on top of the pie with the pie if they're too thick they're not gonna bake all the way you want to make sure they get nice and crispy oh look at that is so clever ok let's get this in the freezer yes okay so it's been a few minutes and I think the dough is ready awesome cone okay first what you do is you take your stencil just lay it down on the cookie stencils are great in the kitchen they really hope you be creative and they really save you a lot of time looks like a Christmas tree all right so now let's cut out the rest of these no I think our pie is ready we still gotta bake it for another 10 minutes after we put these cookies on the pies looking really good it's nice and dark colors flavor it's a lot of sentiment in here it's a lot of brown butter in here and that's what's giving it that really nice dark golden brown now let's add our cookies that's ready to go back in the oven for about 10 more minutes ok so this by has been cooling for a couple hours now I'm ready to decorate before I do anything on the pie I'm gonna create a couple little bows for my presence so I made some white royal icing just egg whites and powdered sugar I'm doing is I'm just piping a couple little loops on the lip of this pole and then when they dry I'm gonna pull them off and use them as a little 3d bow on top of the presents and we're just gonna let those air dry okay mr. pie let's see what you got this is a bag of black royal icing I'm just cut a little hole here this was gonna outline all the presents and you'll see how the 3d when you're piping something that's really really small you want to use a really small piping bag because you have so much more control so what I'm using for ornaments are little tiny pearl Dragic basically just a fancy sprinkle how about that for a decorator pie tomy but it's still impressive everyone is gonna see this is gonna freak out it is delicious for my cinnamon chess pie recipe and more go to foodnetwork.com / stuff sweet spot
