for the holiday baking championship great was proved that it's not the holidays without cookies all right so for a really cool cookie looking at hamentashen even taught her to Jewish cookies now they're usually for porom but this cookie we're gonna jazz it up with some holiday flavors and we're gonna make this thing ready for Hanukkah so here's my friend sara gonzalez she's gonna show you how to make it and I'm gonna explain it so this cookie starts with the dough first we're gonna cream the butter and the sugar my great grandmother told me and everything sweet and put a little bit of salt and everything savor you put a little bit of sugar always add a little bit of salt to your cookie dough I have flour but it also have ground-up chestnuts you can buy chestnuts in the jar or you can roast them fresh to take the chestnuts you grind them up in a food processor and you'll end up with chestnut flour that's gonna give your hamentashen super holiday flavor so in this bowl there's flour and there's chestnut flour just want to take this mix it all up take the flour you dump it onto a parchment grab it by the corners and now you won't make a mess now you're gonna mix it until it's just incorporated if you overmix it the flour gets really tough and then you get chewy cookies want your Cookie to be really tender now the last little bit of mixing you're gonna do do it by hand just incorporate all those loose pieces we don't want to over mix add oh okay just like a real Baker want you to take a little bit of flour about this much you're just gonna throw it into the bowl then you're going to take this guy just scrape underneath and you'll be able to get the whole mass out in one lock put a little bit more flour cookies are very temperamental too much flour you're going to ruin it just enough so that the plastic doesn't stick you're going to turn the dough out on the plastic and you're going to push it down with their hands because we're going to do a cinnamon trick that's going to give it a swirl but first we have to get in shape I'll just Pat it down nice and gentle okay so right now Sarah is making a pace the mixture of 121 cinnamon and sugar alright cool salix good you go thank you now all this cinnamon onto one side of the dough we are gonna swirl the cinnamon so when we roll it out we're gonna get these really cool swirls press it's kind of like a cinnamon roll it's full of cinnamon and it's rolled up but it's a hamentashen grab the plastic just fold this over full it again cinnamon and a hamentashen my mom's gonna see this and punch me in the face she's gonna be so mad I'm gonna get a call from the rabbi is gonna be like Duff you made the beautiful cookie if it's not Jewish gonna stick that in the fridge let it show so we got our hamentashen dough in the fridge and getting nice and chill so we'll be able to roll it out now we're gonna make the film traditionally hamentashen have something like prunes or apricot or even poppy seed filling for the holidays we're gonna go apples and spices so we can start with a little bit of butter slip that in there okay get it all melty brown sugar and a little bit of sherry perfect nutmeg and now apples now we got a caramel base sherry sauce going on and we're just gonna cook these down was gonna get nice and mushy and liquid ok so these apples been cooking for about 15-20 minutes are nice and broken down and really soft all that sherry flavor and nutmeg really got in there it's now we can add our extra ingredients so you can take some pecans and just fold them in I would just do like a handful maybe a handful and a half Alex right and then for applesauce the applesauce and the pecans are really going to add a lot of texture the pecans are gonna had a lot of crunch the applesauce is gonna make it really smooth so I'm gonna put this filling in a bowl let it cool and then it'll be ready to fill the cookies meantime let's get tore down all right let's see how our swirl turned out excited I am it's all cinnamon sugar in here I'm gonna cut this down about 12 pieces all right so here's how you make this cookie you can take each one of these little rolls that you made you can flatten it out you're gonna roll it till it's about quarter of an inch you're gonna cut it with the cutter put a little tiny bit of filling on you don't need too much filling if you put too much it's gonna go out all over the place it's not gonna close right just enough filling you're gonna fold the corners together you're gonna make a three corner little hat the cookie doesn't have to keep its spiral shape you just want to make sure that it's distinct from the dough around it that's good looking cookie alright so these cookies supposed to look just like this so let's get these cold and then we'll egg wash all right here's the cookies have some cold cold no just egg wash these nice and gentle okay we got the egg wash on these cookies are gonna go in the oven at 350 degrees for 20 minutes look at those okay now these are cool we can do our drizzle we're gonna put a praline drizzle that Sarah made on top it's got butter brown sugar cream vanilla a little bit of sherry you know putting a drizzle on your cookies really gives it just an extra holiday touch these are great idea really nice mm-hmm I'm more interested in eating them uh-huh mm-hmm oh babe
