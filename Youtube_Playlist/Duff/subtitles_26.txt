the holiday baking championship the Baker's had to take a typical holiday activity and turn it into a dessert okay so what do you like to do during the holidays me I like to ice skate so we're gonna make a cake that looks like an ice skate that's dancing on its toe so you're doing a cake like this it's really kind of like balanced on one edge you really have to build a structure to hold it all together so as you can see the skate is bolted through the base so this isn't gonna go anywhere it's not what I got to do is fill up this part with cake this part with cake we're gonna decorate the whole thing and it's gonna look seamless you know there's so much cool symbolism around the holidays there's so many things that you can make a cake up go for it don't be afraid of it okay so what I have is a vanilla sponge and American buttercream first I'm gonna start stacking up the cakes and filling up all this negative space when you're making a cake sculpture we use cake and buttercream don't use anything else like you've used some kind of mousse use some other kind of filling you just don't really know how it's gonna react buttercream is more stable thing out there so you're looking at a 3d shape like this you really just have to guess on how much cake you have I got a lot of experience and we've made a lot of cakes so I can usually look at something and know okay this is how much cake I'm gonna need it's always good to over make not over bake the cakes over bake the number of cakes that's important make sure you have enough cake if you go over you're gonna have plenty of cake to make some friends well show me some kids running around the neighborhood like all right who wants cake I know that this is way off the mark but you just start with a piece like that and so you just slowly and gently pair it away until it looks like what you want it to look like you just look for the natural contours of whatever shape you're carving and off you go so we cake didn't quite reach the edge here and take something cake that I carved off the top and use it on a bomb gonna recycle this we're ready to face now this is the magic this is when you take something that's made out of ten different materials and make it into one seamless shape you make it 3d cakes you're gonna do a lot of icing a lot of your icing is actually structural to really keeping the shape of your cake cake carving is an inexact science so whenever you have any sort of like divots or things like that let's fill it up a buttercream okay so it's looking pretty good it's a little heavier than it used to be sometimes it's really nice to get a 360-degree view of whatever it is that you're doing just to make sure there's nothing really glaring that sticks out sorry to let this buttercream set up in the fridge and then I'll decorate first thing we're gonna do I'm gonna put some black on the top so I made some black tinted rolled fondant I'm gonna roll out a small piece and just stick it on top of the skate just wanna take a little bit of water and just wet the top okay with an exacto knife she's going to trim off the excess you know using your thumb to smooth it down anything you can imagine I can turn it into a cake and you can - you gotta look at the way that this cake is built think about the physics of it it's really not that complicated so the weights going down into three pieces to be the tongue the left side and the right side these white fondant for that take a little water and just wet the front if anything ever gets sticking just a little bit of cornstarch take out some of the extra would be easier to work with you can get a little more detailed as you get closer to its final shape and just smooth this down to the contours of the skate they want to find the line of the tongue right here okay one side now let's do the right side it's now ready to do some detail on this cake we need some really simple items get a bamboo skewer and the back of a paintbrush with the paintbrush we're gonna make the holes that the laces go through okay now we're gonna make some laces because if the laces I'm going to use some light blue fondant okay now I get the laces done got do the tie so I got the laces done now I'm gonna paint on the wooden sole okay so now I'm gonna paint on the wood I'm using brown food coloring and they thinned it out a little white alcohol can use vodka rum anything like that don't worry if you're serving this to kids the alcohol of that word keep paying until the fondant gets really sticky and then because it's really sticky it'll kind of grab the brush the brush will drag the sugar and start getting this texture it looks like we're doing all right so there's my escape cake for this ice skate cake recipe and more go to foodnetwork.com so I stood up sweet spot
