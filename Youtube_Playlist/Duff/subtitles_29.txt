but Thanksgiving comes around I can't help but look at a simple pie and want to make it look more festive it's the cake maker in me I'm going to show you a variety of techniques dress up that plain old pie okay so the first thing I'm going to show you is the lattice top we're gonna make a couple different shapes let's start out with a braid now this dough's gotten a little bit warm I want to make sure it's nice and cool and I'm using it so that butter firms up it's kind of like braiding hair not that I know much about that there it is here's a fun thing to do you cut some very very thin strips and you grab these to make a little twist roll it into a little snake take a pair of scissors you cut it about 3/4 of the way through cutting it on a bias which means an angle then you can turn it into a little shaft of wheat berries listen it's really cool when you do stuff like this because it shows people that you care people get really excited about a pie that looks good all right here's how we're gonna do this we're gonna make a regular pumpkin pie then you're gonna par bake it about halfway all you want to do is make sure that the top gets firm enough to be able to hold some kind of decoration all right let's put this lattice pie together let's start out with this nice twisty guy right in the middle I'm gonna slide this guy right into here now let's pick this one up way down this braid now if the little the pie comes off don't sweat it here's a cool and I made with some circles see I love the asymmetry here you know instead of a regular lattice pie when you just have like slat slats lack kind of gets a little boring after a while with this there's like so much going on all right now let's take a knife and trim off the extra here's the thing is that usually when you bring a pie somewhere somebody else is probably bringing a pie and like you know not everything in life is a competition but it kind of is and so if you roll in with this masterpiece you're gonna be like what's up look at this pie okay that's the top what about the edge I got something special so here what I did was I made a big long braid and shaped it into a circle now we're gonna egg wash the whole thing and then we to put some sugar on top so what I'm using is turbinado sugar not only is gonna make it sweep it's give it a lot of texture all right bake it off now let me show you how to make some roses first I'm gonna take a circle cutter I'm gonna cut out six circles take a tiny bit of egg wash and on two of the circles I'm gonna wet a little bit of it and stick these here now I'm just gonna roll these up make sure you're just touching the inside not the outside now you take your thumb and your index finger and you pinch pinch pinch tear and a half all right you see it all right let me show you another thing we're gonna make some leaves and vines to go with those roses take your circle and you're just gonna cut a tangent now paring knife I'm going to cut some little jagged edges in those rose leaves just like in nature every one of these leaves is unique and they have a lot of imperfections you know something doesn't have any perfections it looks like it was made in a factory somewhere now I'm gonna cut some very very thin strips okay now here's my pie I'm gonna gently lay down this pie crust into some vine like shapes now let's get some leaves come on here come on here now let's get our roses go here put one right here right there all right now you got to make sure you egg wash everything you don't get the egg wash on there it's gonna look a little weird can I tell you me when I make a really good-looking pie I am so stoked like I know I make beautiful cakes but I am not as confident with so when I make really beautiful pie it's like instantly on social media you
