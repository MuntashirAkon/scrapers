we're gonna make a 3d snowman with a bit of planning and a little bit of elbow grease you can totally do this at home I promise now for the Snowman body what I do is I went to the craft store and I got these styrofoam hemispheres I got a 10 inch 1/8 inch and a 6 inch all right then what we're going to do is on top of this sphere I'm going to stack it up with cake and we're going to carve it out and we're gonna make a whole sphere I cover the sphere in a little bit of luminal file to keep any of the little bits of styrofoam from ending up in my cake you don't want to eat that stuff I'm going to take a little buttercream it's gonna keep the cake from sliding around take my first 10 inch cake so now I'm just gonna run this around okay so you cut the top off the cake so it's nice and level let's get some more butter cream on their cakes like to move so you don't want to put so much butter cream in here that when the cake settles its gonna come out the side all right just so you know carving a sphere is really hard I might mess this up when you're carving cake you want to make sure your carving cold cake one cake bears a lot as you carve you kind of see the shape sort of emerging now if you do happen to like cut off a little bit too much it's okay because you're gonna ice the cake later and you can fill in those inconsistencies of buttercream okay I think we are ready to ice this cake whenever your frosting a cake you want to make sure that your buttercream is relatively warm do you want to be able to spread it and it's nice and smooth just get buttercream on every square edge of the cake now turn into a ball when you're icing a cake you're scraping off the buttercream every single time you wipe make sure there's no big glaring holes because when there's holes fondant won't cover on me now I got it all iced and looks like a sphere remember we're going to put two more spheres on top of this so I want to make sure I have a nice flat surface to put the next fear on so we're gonna get this top off have a little bit more buttercream I'm gonna put this in the freezer you get the cake nice and cold stays really firm and the fun that goes on much easier all right our sphere is nice and firm now I'm gonna roll out some fondant and cover this guy rolling pin is important starch there's a good amount you don't want to stick listen when you're working with funding want to work with conviction roll the fondant out to get it onto your cake and get it smooth out as quickly as possible the longer it takes the more it dries out the more tries out you're gonna get a little wrinkles you're gonna get little tears you just want to work fast but clean there you go gonna carve a little hole here so it's gonna fit on the pole pull that piece out all right so I got the base of that built it's just a piece of wood I got my three cakes let's build a snowman cake number one now the trick is to feed this on without the pole going through the actual cake coming out the side okay there we go when you're building this cake first you want to poke a hole in the styrofoam because that's where your central pole is going to go and then you're going to lay your cake on top of that so when you put the cake on to the pull the pole goes all the way through and it's not displacing anything now from here you got a blank canvas you can go any direction you want let's make some of the other decorations so the gum paste you can make almost anything you let it dry for a day or two and then you can pick it up and it's like plastic then you can shape it you can sand it down you can airbrush it you can drill holes in it fondant will never really get that hard and also it will never really get that strong I'm not liking about cakes like this is that they got a lot of personality there's a lot of cakes in the world probably a lot of cakes with a picture of a snowman on top of it world needs those cakes but the world awesome these 3d snowmen that you put dry ice in their pipes and they smoke there you go he's smoking Merry Christmas all right so for how to make the elements of this cake and more go to foodnetwork.com/star stuff sweet spot you
