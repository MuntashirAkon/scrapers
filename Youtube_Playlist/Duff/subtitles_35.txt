entertaining at New Year's Eve is something I do rarely but I do know what finger to about how to put on a good party also have a few ideas on how to put decadence into a single bite of dessert I'm gonna make something I know Elvis would love some banana panna cotta I'm gonna top that with bacon peanut praline and some peanut butter mousse that's whipped up just right all right so here's what goes in the peanut butter mousse peanut butter butter and powdered sugar and we're gonna cream that together and we're gonna make it that you see the color starts to darken that's that peanut butter basically taking over everything else now let's add our liquid a little bit of vanilla a little bit of corn syrup so the corns here so you're gonna loosen this up and give it that satiny texture don't keep the mixer on forever if you over mix this stuff it may break so when it looks nice stop the mixer all right the mixer is occupied so we're gonna whip our cream by hand make a figure eight it's a lot more efficient and take a little bit of this cream and I'm not gonna be very gentle so I want to loosen up this peanut butter a little bit more now take the rest of the cream let's fold it there's a big difference between folding and mixing mixing and sit here in stir and stir and stir and so everything comes together folding I'm trying not to knock all the air out of my mousse all right and once you got this folded put it in a piping bag put it in the fridge I like the flavor of fresh bananas but like I like eating a banana I'm gonna put a banana on something I'm gonna roast him I'm gonna fry if I'm gonna do something too in this case we're gonna puree them I think the superstar of this dessert is the banana panna cotta how can you not save banana cotta from here on out I am only gonna save banana cotta I'm the chef first we're gonna do thanks for gelatin pour it in a pot and then we take milk and heavy cream so we're gonna let this stuff bloom just like that gonna add some sugar and the seeds of one vanilla bean and a husk as well I want to heat this up so all of our gelatin melts all right so you want this to kind of boil because you're trying to get all the flavor out of the vanilla beans so you can see the way that the vanilla is behaving that this is a little bit thicker okay and then boom we have boiled my friends and now it's going to the blender it's a lot of good stuff is gonna stick to the bottom of the pot it's a lot of flavor in there make sure you get all this stuff out vanilla ain't cheap okay bananas are a really mellow flavor you want to brighten those up a little bit so I'm gonna add a little bit of lemon juice to this also gonna add a little bit of salt here we go that's some goodness right there we're in the panna cotta base and let it get firm the fridge all right guys let's build this desert so let start with some creatine qui Dean is basically just crushed up icecream cones you'll do a little pile I'm gonna take a chocolate cup I'm gonna place it right in the center you can totally buy these things nobody's gonna take less of you it's okay here's our panna cotta gonna take the little cutter I'm just gonna pop this right into the chocolate cup some peanut butter mousse kind of feel like a decadent New Year's dessert really isn't complete without bacon don't forget about the candy of leaves baking it up in this peanut praline and there you go decadence in a bite for this recipe and more go to foodnetwork.com/star sweet spot
