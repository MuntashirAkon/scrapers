the holidays bring out the wizard magic dessert maker in me so today I want to show you guys how to make s'mores do this and you'll take your ordinary campfire dessert inside for the holidays and you'll blow it through the roof all right so there's a couple steps to making marshmallows the first thing we're gonna do is prep the pan that they're gonna go into I'm gonna use a half sheet cake pan so I can get a nice deep marshmallow now what you're gonna do is take some powdered sugar and cover this thing this is gonna make sure the marshmallow doesn't stick to the plastic it is the holidays it looks like it's snowing and when kids see me make the marshmallow it's like wait a minute you know how to make marshmallows all right so now we're gonna do is cook sugar we're gonna cook this sugar to 260 degrees what you need to cook the sugar is a little bit of water a little bit of sugar a little bit of corn syrup three tablespoons just stir it around a little bit so it looks like wet sand we're gonna cook this on high this is a candy thermometer it has all the temperatures but it also has all the names of the different stages that you cook sugar to so 260 degrees looks like hardball we're gonna clip this guy right to the edge and then this is going to tell me when the sugar is ready to go okay so while the sugar is cooking we're going to bloom some gelatin right so here's how I like to do this I like to get the water in there really quick and then whisk it together to make sure that all the gelatin is touching the water and the whole thing blooms evenly this stuff is gonna turn into like a hockey puck see again all thick all right you can see the sugar going it looks like we're 225 right now okay so I got two egg whites cooking sugar and some gelatin we're basically making an Italian meringue thickening it with gelatin eggs going there I like a little bit of lemon juice not only does it give it flavor but it also gives the meringue a stability all right now check out the gelatin Wow looks crazy right so that's the gelatin looks like when it's bloomed so I'm gonna start this guy whipping you're not whipping this up to a big meringue you just want to get it frothy I'm gonna add a teaspoon of vanilla also gonna add a pinch of salt all right so you seal that sugar cooking in there we are totally there okay so take it off the heat be very careful with the thermometer that's all hot sugar on the bottom of that thing I'm gonna put the gelatin into the sugar and the hot sugar is gonna melt the gelatin and now we're gonna slowly pour this into the meringue so what you can do is basically whip it until it's cool as the mixture cools down that gelatin is gonna trap more air and you'll see it whip up really quickly trying to move it around so you don't have to futz with this stuff too much you're just gonna gently without knocking the air out you just want to even this out okay I'm gonna push it into the corners here now it's nice and smooth more powdered sugar can make sure you can't see any shiny stuff and we've got some more plastic wrap gently go on top just like that now put this in a cool dry place not the fridge in the kitchen somewhere in the pantry just put it away fresh marshmallows are really magical you know it seems like to like you know an elf would be in there making that thing but it's not true like this I'm the elf you could be the elf too okay so I think we're ready to cut out some marshmallows and build our s'mores I'm gonna brush off all this extra powdered sugar so we got our marshmallows feeling good we got a cutter mm-hmm it's a big marshmallow the other thing I know look you get different cutters you know you can do a little heart you imagine that in like a little cup of cocoa I want to burn these marshmallows on the sheet tray but burn these on the plate you got other stuff that's going on on the plate and the torch is gonna melt those things now I like him really dark you don't like him this dark don't torch him that dark okay you pipe a little mousse take your graham cracker tiny little bit of cocoa powder just for some color marshmallow I also got some really cool-looking little cracker cookies little sticks cuz like you know when you're keeping you put the marshmallow on a stick and hold it over the fire so I figured like this would be like a nice little play on the stick and there you go fresh marshmallows are really easy to make and the taste between the stuff that comes in a bag night and day for this holiday recipe and more go to foodnetwork.com slash duff sweet spot you
