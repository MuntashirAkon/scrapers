I'm a big fan of trick desserts often called imposters we're a big treat is made to look like something it's not think about it the best way to eat which you like of Thanksgiving is pile up a huge fork full of the good stuff and eat it all together so these cupcakes basically do the work for you it's like a whole feast of one bite so I'm gonna make a bread pudding cupcake frosted with mashed potatoes torched off and topped with chives after Thanksgiving everybody has seen this sitting in the fridge leftover stuffing it's got bread it's got celery we've got the spices this is a great way to kind of reconstitute that stuff and make something really delicious out of it first thing I'm gonna do is take a cup of heavy cream 2 eggs with the salt the pepper so we whip this up and now we got a quick savory custard pace I'm gonna take all of my leftover stuffing alright you put that on the floor the dog can lick it out and now it's gonna match up the stuffing in the custard you want to let this custard soak in a little bit so once you get this all in here let it sit for just like 20 minutes or half an hour all right now you know prep the muffin pans and bake off our cupcakes for me to find a cupcake interesting it's got to be something you're not expecting and that is usually something that's either frosted with mashed potatoes or it has a bunch of cheese all over it so unlike a regular cupcake and when you put in the oven it's gonna rise these don't really move that much so whatever size they are when you put them in the oven that's the size they're gonna be able to take them out all right I'm gonna bake these off to 375 degrees for 15 minutes till they're a nice golden brown look it's either a muffin or it's a cupcake you know and you gotta pick one so you want to make cupcakes you got to do frosting so got some leftover mashed potatoes got a half a cup of cream got some butter a little bit of sour cream is gonna make this stuff a little more pliant we use a whip attachment now we don't want to turn these mashed potatoes of glue so be gentle so we're doing is we're adding a little bit more dairy to this just to make it so you can actually pipe this out and it looks good I also give us a little more flavor makes it a little more rich alright those are good now most cupcakes get sprinkles these cupcakes are gonna get chives you don't see me working with vegetables very often okay so got these nice chives I think our stuffing cupcakes are done these are nice and crispy and smell the butter so the custard is holding all this stuff together this is really easy you can totally do this mashed potatoes in the bag yup me I think mashed potatoes chives stuffing it's a nice combination on the plate take all we're missing is cranberry sauce and a little gravy now before you put the sprinkles on let's torch these things give us a nice crunchy texture also gives it a little bit more flavor now we can add the sprinkles mm-hmm they look awesome all right so that's one Thanksgiving me on a cupcake but I got a couple other ideas - I took leftover creamed spinach added custard to that baked it off and now I have these nice cupcake bases then I was thinking to myself with the frosting on my spinach cupcakes I'll do a feta cream in just a tiny tiny pinch of Hungarian paprika you know it looks like I got some leftover chives - why not that's a holiday cupcake but what about all that leftover bacon what are you gonna do with that why don't you make corn bread bacon cupcakes with a honey buttercream that is a handsome-looking group right there for these holiday recipes and more go to foodnetwork.com slash Duff's sweet spot you
