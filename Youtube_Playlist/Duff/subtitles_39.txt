every year is a holiday I like to think about tradition and then think about ways to make it new so I thought I'd take a traditional Mexican eggnog drink called a romp opaque and turn it into a pastry cream and then pipe it into a crispy churro rabota is just fun to say right would you rather say Ron Pope is an eggnog egg mag go Boop it gonna poop it roll pulpit strong word all right first thing we're gonna do is we're gonna take some milk some sugar smallman I'm gonna buzz min this blender give it all she's got captain ya got the load I'm going to take this over and put it on the heat then to this mixture i'm gonna add one big fat cinnamon stick cinnamon into the milk now so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to make a slurry the slurry is basically any mixture that contains cornstarch or flour that you're going to use to thicken up a liquid you got to make sure to whisk all the corn starts really evenly into the egg yolks you got to get it all you don't want to see any of that white powder now you see how the milk is just starting to boil you want to get it just to the point where it boils and then take it off the stove real fast glad you go you ready ready ready ready ready ready boom okay so now this is tempering so what you want to do is just put a little bit just like that and then stir it up and then what you're doing here is you're getting the eggs used to the idea that they're gonna be warm they're like oh okay it's a little warmer in here and then once you get some in there and you kind of go slow so just sort of poor all this good stuff in here then you want to put all these yolks this whole mixture back into here okay now this is gonna happen real fast can already feel it's starting to thicken up so I'm going to turn the heat down see the tracks from the whisk and then into the bowl okay now while this is hot we're gonna go pinch of salt butter in the rump now some of this alcohol is gonna steam off but you want to keep some of it because you do want to taste this stuff and use a dark rum so right now it looks sort of gross you can fix that so you got all this liquid you just add it to it and your added a bunch of fat just mix it in and emulsified all these different things together it's going to give this pastry cream a really nice latin feel after you make your pastry cream get your plastic wrap out then you're going to push it down onto the surface of the pastry cream okay so let's get this in the fridge and let's get it out of my hand because it's burning my fingerprints off these are my churros want to serve these when they're nice and hot so the day before your party make your rum both a face your cream make your churro batter put everything in piping bags and then you're ready to go and all you got to do pipe out churros fill them with the Rome Pope a and they're nice and a hot and crispy and everybody's going to think you're an awesome Baker okay let's fill these guys grab a churro you want to poke a hole in just one end okay here's a churro find a little hole squeeze it there go nuts how you fill a churro I mean seriously Ron Pope a filled churros hope we're done are we done filming over time filming John Romero mouth no longer are so good this is a great little dessert we took a lot of things that are really traditional made something new with for this recipe and more go to foodnetwork.com
