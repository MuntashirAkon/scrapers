an edible gift box is a spectacular way to impress someone at the holidays I want to show you guys how to take on Treme and to present it inside a decorated box you know if I was having a holiday party in my house I would want to do something that was really special there's some desserts that should be elevated in tart so the way these are built is that there's a little crispy cookie underneath and on top of that is a white chocolate mousse once that's all firmed up I made a red glaze poured it over the top and then just tipped it it's a little bit of edible gold all right so let's make the box that's gonna go around this entremet got some gum paste some stencils and an exacto so I'm gonna take a little cornstarch and roll this guy out want to get this to about 1/8 of an inch thick so I'm gonna make frames so I'm gonna take the big square I'm gonna take a pastry cutter and go across like this nice and straight I'm gonna use the exacto knife first we're gonna gently score the top I try to stick the knife all the way through on your very first pass you're gonna pull the gum paste and it's gonna change shape and now I will in size there you go now all you got to do is do that about seven more times I listen when you're making one of these take your time some of them are gonna break it's just gonna happen make sure you have a couple extras okay so I got a nice flat sheet pan then on it just a piece of acetate I'm going to take some cornstarch a little strainer like this one just a nice even layer of cornstarch it's pretty good okay now let's put our frames down I so got some royal icing in a cornet we cut off the tip I'm gonna go about seven millimeters no what I'm gonna do is just pipe some lines this is gonna be the framework for the finer detail that's gonna happen later on now you can make any pattern you want just realize the bigger space you have in between each line the more delicate the piping is gonna be okay so I sent the pipe frames aside for about two hours to dry and before you work with this make sure to dust off any extra cornstarch and now you want to position your frame so the front side is down and you just want to suspend it by the corners what you wanna do is just pipe nice little thin lines and just let gravity kind of make them into loose you know just laying them on top and then when you stand this thing up it's gonna look really cool I promise and totally do this so whenever one of them breaks just remove it from your frame throw it away and pipe a new line so as the lines get longer they get a lot more fragile all right so now I just gotta let these dry no sudden movements then we're gonna build our box so the way to build one of these deserts is basically the way you build a card house you start with one you add a wall to that and then once you have two walls they're leaning against each other you can build everything else on that foundation so far so good now if I measured everything right the top should fit who's for okay fix okay all right but I think when we want to do just a little bit of decoration just kind of make the box Sparkle a bit so I got some really nice kind of taupe and gold Raja is here I'm just trying to make the box a little bit more interesting but the decoration is actually reinforcing the structure right so every time I do another line here it's gonna make sure that this thing is gonna make it from the kitchen to the table where somebody's waiting for it now look you've taken a long time and you've built this amazingly beautiful dessert and now you get to destroy it and you have to be okay with that make this for something holiday worthy or just make one because they're cool for this recipe and more go to foodnetwork.com slash duck sweet spot you
