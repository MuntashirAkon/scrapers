for the holiday baking championship the bakers were asked to bake something nice with sugar and spice now while I was tasting the cool stuff that the holiday bakers created my mind took off on what I would do so I came up with a sugar and spice panna cotta that's packed with tons of flavor and some sweet surprises this recipe i hit the kitchen with my favorite baker sara gonzalez so this panna cotta always starts with a cookie this is all a shortbread cookie base now I got three different dough's here cuz we're gonna make three different Panna cottas and we're gonna layer them up like a parfait the cinnamon cookie goes with the maple brown sugar this one is a nutmeg nutmeg and that goes with that's been with an irish cream panna cotta the clove cookie goes with the honey panna cotta we're gonna take these little cookies we're gonna roll them into just little tiny peanut size cookies okay so each Panna cottas gonna have about about four or five cookies per layer perlier sounds about 10 or 15 cookies yeah but you'd have 20 of each flavor just to be on the safe side now these will bake pretty fast 10 minutes is all they need 10 minutes tops mm-hmm all right let's get him in there now these cookies are tiny so you need a lot of them for each layer so these are baked off we're gonna put these in the panna cotta we want to make sure that these cookies stay nice and crispy the way to do that is it codeman some kind of fat some people code them and just straight up cocoa butter but I say let's use some flavor this is a butterscotch it's really helpful if you use chopsticks to pick up your cookies and dip them in the butterscotch otherwise you're really gonna burn your hand I found that out the hard way once you're done dip in the cookies put them on a parchment-lined sheet tray and put them in the freezer so they get nice and hard so let's start with the Irish cream panna cotta you bloom some gelatin over hot boiling cream whisk it up and then add Irish cream for flavor each one is a different kind of sugar so the sugar from the Bailey's yes the Bailey's is just using the Irish Cream Liqueur remember when you make this let your panna cotta set up for five minutes before you add your cookies don't let the panna cotta set fulier the cookies won't sink awesome all right so layer one of the Panna cottas already done the next layer we're gonna do is the maple and brown sugar panna cotta and that's gonna have a cinnamon cookie with it okay so this is the maple brown sugar layer panna cotta with the cinnamon cookies the next layer is gonna be a honey panna cotta and that's gonna have a clove cooking you see how we're building layer upon layer of flavor that's how I like to build a dessert you can choose to either eat it one layer at a time you can get that spoon all the way down the bottom get a whole big bite go for it so there it is three different sugars three different spice cookies a whole ton of flavor now Sarah did the easy part she made the Panna cottas look really good I'm gonna do the really difficult part and that's the garnish I have a little gingersnap cookie I cut a little dado right here in the edge ready and if you can't get enough baking during the holidays go to foodnetwork.com holiday bakers and check out all my tips and tricks to make your holidays the sweetest ever
