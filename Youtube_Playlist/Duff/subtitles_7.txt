okay so baking cakes for the holidays is awesome baking pies for the holiday is really awesome too for the holiday baking championship we asked the Baker's to stuff the cake you stuff a turkey right so why not a cake what if you could do something really cool what if you could bake a pie inside of a cake now you can make all this stuff from scratch you can also buy all this stuff at the store it's totally cool the whole point of this thing is really have fun and stick a pie inside of a cake so if you know make it from scratch don't worry about it you need four cakes cherry pie filling some pie dough and some chocolate frosting you'll also need a couple of tools you have pizza cutter a big round cookie cutter and a ruler okay so the first thing you want to do is cut some holes in your already baked cakes leave the ruler out so you can see half the cake take the ruler go 90 degrees make another mark that's the middle of your cake when I get right on top here you're gonna have four cakes total you're going to only cut holes out of three cakes you're gonna ice the inside you're gonna build the barrel of pie right in here bottom cake is gonna be a whole cake something has to hold up your barrel of pie now it's time to ice the case what I've done here it's taking some store-bought frosting and I put it in a mixer even though it's store-bought you still want to whip it up a lot of times when people icing your cakes and having problems with it it's just because the icing is too thick okay first you can ice the bottom layer you can ice the whole cake okay so what I'm using here is a cake wheel and what this does it spins the cake so I can keep making the same motion and that'll ice the cake really smoothly instead of moving my arm all the way around just moving my hand straight up and back here comes the next one once this cake touches the frosting that's on the bottom layer it's not moving its cake will break in half really really quickly so you want to make sure you get your hands all the way underneath and then very quickly line up the edge and lay it down all right so get your frosting on here then you just want to run your knife all the way around do like two times three times maybe four times okay so now we're gonna put on the next layer take the clean side of the cardboard stick it on here move the cake towards the edge and then line up the edge and just gently pull it out try not to scrape up the chocolate frosting and there you go and the top way you want to get a lot more frosting on there because you have to do the sides as well you don't want to leave the cake on iced cause then it'll dry out really quick it doesn't have to be pretty just get it on there so you can take a nice bench scraper just sticking on the sides you don't have a bench scraper can always use one of these you'll get the same effect this is just a lot easier scrape scrape scrape scrape scrape scrape you can go nice and fast and once you get good at this this is gonna be second nature now here's a tricky part icing the top of a cake you only go in never go out you go scrape and we'll wipe scrape and white now that you have the whole ice you want to measure it you're gonna cut out pie dough's slats it's actually gonna build the walls of the barrel so you take the ruler stick it in here and it looks like we are exactly two and a half inches perfect all right so let's talk pie dough the pie dough is really easy to make just butter flour water and salt so this pie dough doesn't have big chunks of butter in here I don't want it real flaky this pie dough is actually gonna have a structural purpose we're gonna cut out the slats of the barrel this is gonna hold all the pie filling inside the cake I'm gonna take a little flour I'm gonna put it down on my board just a bit you don't need a whole lot now before you roll it out just push it down with their hands it's a lot easier to get it from here to here with your hands and it is with a rolling now you can roll looking good the first thing we're gonna cut out is the bottom of the berry this is same cutter you used for the cake I'm gonna cut out a circle of pie you're gonna cut a straight edge you're gonna measure two and a half inches which is how deep the cake is we cut about 3/4 inch thick slats now you gonna bake this off at 375 for 10 to 12 minutes check it at 8:00 it's firstly gonna take your big round cookie you need to drop that guy right in the middle then you're gonna take your slats okay so I wanna make sure that you're really getting pretty tight seal you want to make sure they're nice and snug because the whole reveal of this is when you cut it open this is exactly one can of cherry pie filling from the grocery store see if it fits and what you want to do here is you want to go just below the crust that way your icing will have something to grab this is gonna be very difficult to ice Oh we'll figure you've got it all piled up and you gotta smooth it out very very carefully they used a lot of frosting layer it on there and then gently smooth it out you don't wanna be mess around that too much if I gave this one more pass it's gonna curl up I'm gonna get all this cherry pie filling through the top of the frosting then you got to start all over nobody wants to start over now we just got to decorate this thing make a look real cake like okay so now I'm gonna pipe a border on here no bigger offense than seeing the cardboard underneath the cake let's add some snow a lot of times when people are trying to sprinkle powdered sugar they'll take their hand and they'll actually hit the strainer it's not how you want to do it gonna take the strainer and hit your hand you have much more control perfect okay now I'm gonna ask Sarah is my favorite Baker to come in and cut this cake and let's see if I can fool her hey Sarah hi dad I made you a chocolate cake yeah beautiful thank you very much oh my gosh can I get it now yeah cut a nice big slice like I'm
