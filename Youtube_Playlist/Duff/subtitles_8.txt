I love to see what kind of breakfast offerings people come up with during the holidays when our holiday baking championship Baker's served up their breakfast extravaganzas the one thing missing for me it was a really flaky Danish and when it comes to flaky Danish my mind starts racing when I think about the possibilities so I love really flaky Danish pastry the one thing that intimidates most people is how to create the flake let me take you through how to make a laminated pastry down that's when you rapped owe a round butter fold it and turn it over and over and so you have the right amount of layers so for me the ultimate breakfast Danish has a goat cheese of pear filling this is crazy good for breakfast it's salty and sweet for this recipe i hit the kitchen with my favorite baker sara gonzalez so it starts by making a basic pastry dough which really starts by making a cold-pressed butter the trick here is to put the butter in between wax paper make sure you have cold workable butter and make sure you know exactly how big it is so you know how big to make your actual dill so when you start folding you're not gonna have any pieces that are overlapping you want a rectangle to cut into even size Danish at the end so measure it this one here is a six inch by 12 inch rectangular so once this is done put it in the freezer to chill thoroughly now you're ready to make the dough and this is cool because you get to activate yeast which means the dough is a lot usually when you wake up you want breakfast when the yeast wakes up it also wants breakfast so you don't want to just bloom yeast and water you want to make sure it's a milk and especially flour okay so you want to pay attention here really makes it well scrape the size and you may want to change from the paddle to the dough hook as the dough gets more supple now what it's done mixing it's time to need it every good Baker needs a rolling pin now you want to measure this remember that butter that we measured into a rectangle this is why you measured it this is a 14 inch square remember when you taste this how flaky it'll be this is definitely worth the effort so this is step one and laminated dough you have dough you have butter you're folding it together you're rolling it out you're gonna fold it again you're gonna roll it again you're gonna fold it one more time and then you're gonna roll that out too you can do this at home I know it's intimidating I know it's scary as long as you stay mindful you will be able to laminate down your own house promise if Sarah can do it so once you have the layers cut the dough into pieces these are gonna be the tops and the bottoms to your Danish alright it's time to start on the filling take your goat cheese your cream cheese and your sugar add your salt and your egg yolk and cream until it's really smooth remember don't forget to scrape the sides as this mix so put that aside in the refrigerator and let's move to the pears you want to slice him up real thin then add the spices and the brandy saute those for about five minutes so we got pears we got laminated dough got goat cheese let's make some Danish all right now you want to coat this with a quick egg wash an egg wash makes a dose shiny makes until crispy it gives it flavor and texture and color one same that delicious are you that on Christmas morning now that's a breakfast if you can't get enough baking during the holidays go to foodnetwork.com celess holiday Baker is gonna watch my video series and check out all my tips and tricks to make your holidays the sweetest ever
