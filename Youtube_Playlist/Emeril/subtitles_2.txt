right yeah every was a key welcome and alive hey you know we uh we've gotten a lot of that incredible feedback on that www Food Network thing and you know we'd all like to eat a little lighter this saying a little healthier huh I know what you're thinking you thinking hey Emeril come on that healthy stuff tastes like cardboard I used to really think like that but um tonight what I'd like to do is show you a few tricks that I have uh just sort of learned and kind of just sort of lighten up a few of those classics little healthier versions if you will of the classics this is that you love but without losing any flavor that's what we're going to try to do tonight kind of zero in on that saturated stuff you know now speaking about classic flavor give it up for our special musical guests Neil Giraldo is in the house oh yeah and his wife is a really really big foodie so I like to bring her out please give it up for Tyler we're cooking why did it have you having to be here are you ready I'm ready we are rocking out with healthy classics tonight right here on Emeril live yeah are you doing welcome nice to have you see these aren't the cheap seats huh how you doing mom well it's great to have you guys in the house so excited I wish we were like doing Italian food or something no but anyhow we're gonna we're gonna kick it up a few notches real simple I'm gonna stop with a little bit of a salad actually made with romaine hots a romaine but before I do that well I mean by hots of romaine well I just took those beautiful little romaine heads made these little wedges like this okay little wedges and we got oh you had set it back to here we got to have some sort of pork fat even though we're trying to we're trying to get lighter you know so I said to myself self exactly and then all of a sudden this Canadian bacon thing came into my head you know that's free lean it's like a fifth of regular bacon not that we're counting that much but all right so we're going to crisp up a little bit of Canadian bacon that I diced up very very lean doesn't have a lot of fat and we're going to stop with that we've got our romaine and then I thought we need some croutons so what I'm going to do is um drizzle some olive oil on a little bit of these slice croutons that I sliced from a bag yet this is like when you want to use good olive oil and all right so we got that now for me I like a little garlic you can do it yeah I mean come on that's healthy for ya you know and we need recipes like this and they say get a clove of garlic and rub the crouton do you guys believe that no you know you read those recipes get a clove of garlic and why don't you just wave it over it like that you know I mean hey if you're gonna use some garlic come on get some garlic out here and like just give them a little garlic like this right spread it like that don't deprive them so I'm gonna garlic up the croutons gonna visit with Pat Neal a little bit when we come back another knot stick around see at home I pretty much do all the cooking he did my husband doesn't yell fizz all the evening our kitchen at home obviously has all the accoutrements that she would need we're out here on the bus were really limited cooking out here as a challenge want to sit down here next to me you know it's been 25 years and I've been took it on the bus for at least 20 of them so I don't know I think I can cook anywhere now I know this place you have two burners on this bus and no ovens with thermals it's just a cooking show I think that probably the most ambitious things that I made don't judge alleged crepes there with caramelized sugar so that was uh I was pretty amazing you can be now hey give it up yeah why did to have you man wanted to have you guys so close the lovely wife Pat Benatar in the house ladies and gentlemen yes indeed hey 25 years that's a miracle to begin with I take my hat off for that I mean that God bless it's a beautiful thing 9 times nominated for a Grammy four-time Grammy Award winning and a new album out go check it out all right yes hey you at home go by about 400 copies where you currently neighbourhood on yes all right now I've got this pasta dish I'm under a lot of pressure here right now that's a great cook so I'm gonna get the salad out of the way so I can move on to know another healthy alternative all right first of all I want to make a simple dressing I roasted some garlic one of the tips that I Toyota's going to share with you is that you want to get when you're doing this type of lower saturated fat lower fat cooking you still want to get the flavor so you got to look for little things to punch the flavors roasted garlic being one of them okay lemon lemons another thing that comes to mind curry if you like that cayenne pepper you got to have things that just sort of just pop the flavors now another thing that I think is misrepresented which I'm going to use to make this dressing is that when you instantly say to people we're going to use buttermilk they go you know and buttermilk really is a one of those alternative things that you can use because it doesn't have butter in it it's really almost like a yogurt so it's kind of really delicious so we got the roasted garlic in there orange zest different citrus peels zests flavors work I'm going to use a little orange and this is that mayonnaise you could use low-fat mayonnaise if you want it's all up to you lots of fresh herbs of a good thing you get a lot of impact I'm using a lot of parsley and I'm going to use a lot of chives in there and then simply now what I'm going to do I'm ready to put this thing together what we're going to do now is we're going to add the buttermilk in here and a real real simple dressing little salt some pepper like I said you could use cayenne and really kick it up if you want you could use crushed pepper all right now what we're going to do put this thing on here now if we wanted to uh multiply this a little bit more you know like if you have oil and vinegar it's like a vinaigrette but if you add an egg and then you add oil you have an emulsion like mayonnaise was so we already got an emulsion in that because we used a little bit of that low-fat mayonnaise yeah didn't you see them on the back of the barn alright all you low fat chickens stand up just kidding alright look on a serious note I'm putting this together now I got my romaine the inner side the outer edges that I just chopped up okay got a seasoned em I don't know what you get your romaine where I get mine and don't come seasoned little salt and pepper get our croutons about eight minutes for them and here's how we'll simply put this together nice platter white salad take the romaine put some on that side and some on this side now nice white bacon a little bit of tomatoes really light just will use a little olive oil make them even a little lighter practically flying out of my hand right now and then we'll just use a little bit of those light Tomatoes like this and then we'll take the croutons put a few of those stacks over here alright now we could either do two things we could dress the greens or we could just use a little olive oil toss them up then the salad dressing so we'll just go a little that way we'll go a little this way we'll go a little that way that way and this is so light it's unbelievable there you have it okay folks little lights our I know you're surprised no Parmesan cheese hey it's light I'm going to put some of these light croutons in here for texture all right now we were talking about how we love pasta so much so there's a nice pasta that there's kind of big strips like this called pompe del pompe del noodles but if you go in light and you want to stay light with the pasta dish thing what you can do is use zucchini this is really a fantastic dish with a mandoline or shop knife this mandolin cut on a long way like this to see that Pat it just kind of kind of can go as long as you want and basically as long as the zucchini doesn't have a lot of heavy seeds you can sort of like use this as noodles okay yeah so now here's what we're gonna do we're gonna take some olive oil mmm that's when you use the knob you don't use your knob high medium medium low you gotta use your knob now ladies keep it G back there please we have a guest alright so now what we're going to do is we want to flavor this oil but you see the Pens not streaking hot right now right it's not all hot because I used the knob but what we want to do is before this gets hot we want to flavor see garlic burns people make a big mistake they turn the skillet on they got it on high it's like ready to jump off the stove it's so high they add the garlic it's burned in two seconds and then they wonder why everything tastes bitter so what we do is we start and when you start hearing it just kind of sizzle like that like it's doing now you can flavor the oil even better I was telling you earlier about certain spices ingredients right crush red pepper see we're going to get the flavor right out of that a little bit of green onion oh yeah babe or scallion you would call right see we're getting the flip we're not cooking them all out now what we're going to do is we're going to start layering our noodles of zucchini and then what we're going to do is we're just gonna sort of lightly doesn't that look good ah oh wait oh wait it does smell good that's why I'm telling them people at home they got to get smellivision you know get with the program you don't have smell-o-vision I call you cable company and complain look a little salt mm-hmm little pepper now here's what we do something very very light a little remove we just add a little bit of that just for just for flavor just for flavor and what I do now is I just take a little just a little ragu like this of tomato and we're just going to let it sort of trap in there and sort of steam it and keep all the nice healthy stuff in there and when we come back I'll show you what it looks like stick around don't touch that dial we'll be right back we could take a chill baby oh sweet right Neels absolute job while I'm doing this is to get really hungry hey I'm starving be open the why's it gets a little chance to breathe so we could enjoy it and see put on some kind of great music which is either Pavarotti or Louie prima or something like that that makes a good gig this is a really simple dish this is just basically a chicken dish that has white wine garlic cum lot of olives and fresh basil in a little bit I basically make this with dark meat because it stays much more tender and because we have we're limited to how we can prepare it it's it's kind of a braised dish nicer room seeds falling all over bone perfect enemy Tonya major you might pasta and you're just keeping it warm and then you just kind of put it together it's really evening we're total foodies everything we do is around food out of your soul long we've been out for ten and a half weeks you just you can't eat any more food that's not home-cooked you get crazy it's so good simple food oh it's just so good enough that's all we're married this long uh-huh all things can fade but cooking never dies I could help you count the minutes so your next great meal on the bus Neels are all over the band and the missus in the house Pat Benatar yes indeed alright this thing is getting so white I'm about fading away here a little bit of tomato remember I told you earlier about those fresh herbs a little chervil parsley chives and a little basil as much as you like now I'm just going to fold this in you just want the herbs to just just for a minute just get that flavor out and then basically will serve the zucchini pasta dish here it does look good huh it's light too and basically what you could always do to enhance it a little bit you could always just do a little essence like this around Pam like that just just to kind of you know what I can't take it being so light just a little just a little goes a long way right all right when we come back Neil Drago Pat Benatar and I another that stick around right yeah UCD is called go like go get it talking about a little flavor pops these Roma tomatoes that you can buy year round cut them in half season with salt and pepper cover them with olive oil and you slow roast them in the oven and they really can do wonderful things for pasta pizza salads maybe 50 minutes to an hour 300 degrees get the juices going all right so now I got to put you on the spot pal want to help me cook yeah all right come on Pat Benatar all right so for Grammys oh thanks but as I got pine nuts okay and um you don't have to chop them too much but I was gonna do this filo you and I do this little layer I know feel me feel oh that's it it's hard to work with filo but look we got this guy here in New York it's not that regular filo stuff this guy well we're gonna wearing it together I trust you but I thought what we would do is we'd make a little pizza and so if you could just put a rough chop on that and then we'll bring one layer out on the cutting board of the filo and you could brush it with olive oil okay and then we could sprinkle a bit of the pine nuts on that that would be great I'm with Anna feel free whenever you want to kick it up you know just go ahead just go ahead and now I got this today down at the the Old Market I saw this funny-looking spinach isn't had some funny looking spinach I mean then I first looked at it I went hmm dandy line but I tasted it and it was really really delicious but of course I don't really want to walk to use too much of the stems that so what I'm gonna do is I'm just got the oven on low or the stove on low I should say and I'm gonna just sort of take this spinach oh yeah that's good that's perfect like that and now what we'll do is I'm gonna stop will turn that and see I have this covered here Pat because when people work with phyllo dough if they don't um they don't cover it with a damp towel it gets all brittle E and that's some of the big problems that people have so I'm going to do a little layer of that for you right there and then you want to add a little bit of moisture to this and so that's where the olive oil comes in so if you want to just lightly brush it and then a little pine nuts like that maybe we could do like three layers of that while I'm over here on spinach detail I know all these but I thought it would be worth this intense flavor of the spinach with this this sort of organic spinach it tasted really good so hopefully it'll end up tasting good all right so the stems you could say for I don't know maybe you're raising some snails in the backyard or something I don't know so now that I have that and I have my heat on very very low that I'm wilt in this we could do one of two things we could add butter but we're keeping it light we could add a little olive oil that would be really good and uh are you making out over the time I'm good it looks like you're doing good things good so all right I'm coming to help you a little sprinkle another layer so folks what you want to do is try to get about three layers of this because what we're going to do is instead of using pizza dough we're going to use this phyllo dough like this you can see it doesn't have to be quite exact little salt then also what I did but that's just because of me I actually have so I actually have like a little um so how about if we do this a little olive oil hmm so light and a little h2o and we're just gonna kind of wilt this down a little bit now well you ready for me already wow that chicken dish look fantastic that you need for you it did I use doc I use the doc put together it keeps it more tender alright so the reason for our madness Pat and I here what we're doing is we're gonna we got three layers now we got this little bowl like this and what we'll do is we'll just go around Pat and sort of make a circle like we're making a pizza round and we'll keep it keep it as close as we can okay and meanwhile what I'm gonna do here now is I'll take this wilted spinach you don't have to cook it that much yeah yeah cooking what Pat Bennett he's cooking with me that's great so I'm just gonna shock this spinach you don't have to cook it very long turn the heat off and what do I mean by that well see I'm I got a little ice bath here and when you do that you shock it real good but also what happens it's vulnerable right now so it just like took in even more water and spinach has a lot of water so what you want to do is after its shocked you know no ice we're going to squeeze out make sure it's good and cold how you doing great so now this is what happens we put those on the on a parchment paper lined sheet pan and we're going to bake them off for about 12 minutes at about 350 degrees you don't have to worry about doing that that's the great thing about having an awesome kitchen staff you see now Pat what we do is we got that spinach like that this is what the filos look like when they come out of the oven see they got a little poofy like that just a little bit so now what we're going to do is we're going to use this as sort of some light pizza okay that's gonna be like well you'll see roasted garlic you can't roast that on the bus huh no no oven we're gonna have to get some connection now ready a conduction next time we're gonna get some connection some are uh you know you're gonna cook for Neil and I'll just fed actually a care package and and forget the oven you know okay so here we go pack now that we've got this here's what we're gonna do we're gonna take um you have that brush yep who brush it one more time on the top perfect and then what we'll do is now we'll add a little bit of spinach like this that we blanched okay stems hmm little bit of spinach like that guy you want to do another one and then here's the reason for the lightness that Pat and I right now we're doing very light very light practically down Fifth Avenue right now we're gonna add a couple of cloves of this roasted garlic on the spinach like this okay and then Pat and I are going to put them in the oven for about doesn't take that long maybe about six minutes when it comes out we're going to flavor it with a little bit of oregano and some feta cheese for our light pizza all right that's when we come back okay stick around we'll be right back not gonna tire everybody all right hey welcome back everybody Hills wrong all in the band one of the greatest sous chefs on the planet Pat Benatar ladies and gentlemen so you know those oven tomatoes that we are that we didn't so we put a few of those on but let me let me show you what we did during the commercial break and then we're going to get into a sort of a little lighter style gumbo that I'm going to show you how to do so look at this we got these sort of pizza things going on so now what we do Pat little oregano then we do a little crush pine nut like that you had earlier yeah really nice and then instead of using the other will use this feta cheese because it's good and light I'm not making this stuff up come on work with me so a little feta cheese like that and then just to sort of finish it what we do Pat is this we'll just kind of take a little bit more olive oil hmm all right for me since we got it light I'm just gonna hit it with a little pepper all right now we're gonna put this back in the oven all right so this goes in the oven and we got our little white pizza now like the hottest thing to make light is like gumbo cuz Gumbo's gumbo ho so here's a trick that I wanted to show you and whether you want to keep it light or not first of all we're going to keep it shellfish fish shellfish light you know how we always take when you make the roux cuz the whole secret with gumbo is all in the room so we take equal pots of vegetable oil I would use butter but vegetable oil right light and then instead of adding that what we've done to sort of get more flavor out of it is we are a head of time we've toasted the flour you can do this this has done a lot in Louisiana to speed up the process of those doc roux Gumbo's but you need an oven yes and so you can do that now it doesn't take it takes like a good hour I want to have to do this but it's speeds it up and you get all this wonderful flavor all ready to start now too much flour you add a little bit of oil like this until we get that but look at the color already packed well it's about 350 degrees and you know Rouge shouldn't be so thick thick thick it should be spreadable like that but look Oh already to color folks on that okay I mean we're they're ready just from toasting it in the oven all right now we can start with the Trinity so we've got onion and we've got celery and we've got bell pepper now we got to let this cook one thing with the vegetables Oh a little bit of salt can you hand me that Cayenne right there Pat please salt and we're going to use cayenne pepper to spice it up now one of the things about the vegetables here got to let them cook 8 to 10 minutes get the flavor out after 8 to 10 minutes what we're going to do is we're going to add about 30 cloves of garlic hey it's healthy I add a couple of bay leaves and a little bit of thyme so what we're going to do is we've got fish stock and we've got clam juice after the garlic we're going to add okra that I cut fresh okra okay tomatoes and then what I'm going to do is I'm just going to use pieces of gumbo crabs like this inside for that flavor okay but guess what guess what I gotta wait eight to ten minutes so I got a ask you think you could like sing a song for that minute our way your nose contagious yes danger then you fashion into perspective Oh when we tag watch the song will you think of Roble yeah like I said earlier go like go get it yeah speaking about that listen to this that gum but once you add oakley you add the tomatoes then you put the crabs in a the crabs going to give it all this nice flavor but it's also delicious that takes about 45 minutes to an hour that's where I'm at right here in a nice little simmer smell I love now loving it now if you want to kick it up a notch lighter like we're going to do now when it does that we're going to add the shrimp we're going to add some crabmeat we're going to add some oysters and some green onions and a little bit of parsley and then look we don't have to cook this very long we're just going to get that love thing going in there taste it season it speaking about what we made watch how beautiful these are oh yeah you thought we forgot about them huh no way talk about a great little snack look how light these are they're practically floating to you so you just have it that and what I like to do is you can just sort of drizzle it can cut it with a little pizza wheel if you want drizzle with a little olive oil and that's that sorry Pat oh yeah I got a you know a little a little hot yeah we'll save that as weak safer boom by now you got a serve gumbo with rice my opinion sassafras on the side hot sauce on the side it's just one of those things you got to do remember the seafood has like a built-in thermometer you don't have to once you add the shrimp and it starts cooking you don't have to cook it much longer you serve a little bit of that light gumbo like that then see how nice that color is because of that flour that we toasted a little bit of rice little green onions and hopefully you all got a healthier choice tonight right folks all right want to thank the guys in the vein good friend of course Neil Giraldo want to thank him Pat Benatar thanks for joining me see see I've got yeah
