okay gimme that thank you very much and thank you all for coming great turnout um a couple reasons why I'm here um first of all being part of the Macy's culinary team and culinary Council I thought what a great way to have an afternoon to share with you my latest book kick up sandwiches it came out exactly a week ago and it's been a lot of fun um the people that I have shared with last week I launched on Good Morning America and then I was on the chew and the view and the Rachel show it's amazing to me how close especially in America how close sandwiches are to our culture because it doesn't really matter what culture we come from we all have some sort of sandwich memory that we can relate to I certainly have a few of them which I share in the book growing up in Fall River in Massachusetts Portuguese descent so and french-canadian so I share those but as I have been very fortunate to travel not only in this country but you know in the world this seems to always be a sandwich connection no matter if you're in France or in Vietnam this there's this connection of a sandwich a memory of a sandwich and so I decided to to take those memories particularly of my own on and of course my culinary team are not only here in Orlando but also in New Orleans and and throughout our organization and sort of pull what kind of sandwiches with some of the favors today I'm very very simple we're doing a classic Monte Cristo which those of you that have been around a little bit it's hard to find a Monte Cristo these days they used to be very popular 20 years ago on restaurant menus and on lunch counters and and diners and now your high press to really find the classic Monte Cristo anymore at least on the right way and then secondly what I've been really really surprised about in launching this book a week ago but in all the research and particularly we did something really unique and that is that we we sort of went and found the best bloggers in the country and some of you are in the room right now but we went and found some of the best bloggers who are really into food not just like great bloggers but really into food and really take it very seriously and what we found out is I have found out not only this past week but doing all the research for this great book was how many families use a sandwich and a soup at least once a week as a dinner and as dinner at home it's fast it really is great of quality that you want to put into the sandwich of the soup as well as it's very economical and practical and certainly it's pretty easy for the for the kids to to want to take and participate in that so first of all I want to thank the bloggers secondly I want to thank all of you most importantly for being here and all right let's get started shall we um so the first sandwich we need we need a batter um so you can do this a couple different ways and what I learned when I first won the sandwich of course we used eggs and so these days there's obviously allergies coming out the wazoo and really truly actually my daughter's just launched a two weeks ago their first book on gluten-free cooking uh so many people have so yak disease right now it's mind-blowing we have to make adjustments in a restaurant which who would have thought about that 10 years ago of doing like a gluten-free pizza or gluten-free dishes but anyhow so no eggs we're going to use we're just going to use strictly a few different dry ingredients and we can always add and I will add but flour that I have a little seasoning in here so salt and then baking powder and baking soda totally optional if you don't think that you're going to keep this more than a day on then you really don't really have to use the baking soda the baking powder I'm using because I want to get that little bit of puffiness that is what it's going to do as a natural leavening agent so we'll just sort of mix that up and then I'm going to use a beer um you don't have to use a beer you can use milk I thought hey listen Macy's is paying ability why sprouts first I use two beers who knows so the consistency of this should be really almost as great we're saying we're talking only a grater same well it's kind of like a good tempura batter right it should just about coat of spoon it shouldn't be too thick but it should be just a nice consistency and you can always spit it out as you begin now in the in the book um there's also a fabulous section for breads because I think when you think about sandwiches right it's not just about like ham and cheese you know it's not just about like baloney and cheese or baloney although there's nothing wrong with a great baked baloney sandwich I can tell you that but really those components are the bread um and these days you have a lot of choices because there are so many great artisanal bakeries out there that are doing really really awesome so you can go that route or you can go into the section that's in kicked-up sandwiches and there's a whole thread section for basic two-week - multigrain pumpernickel etc etc if you want to choose to go that rope and do your own bread the the other great section that's in there um and it's worth I mean of course it's great sandwiches what is the condiment section spoon it up is also what we call it in there because we tell you about how taking really really simple staples like mayonnaise whether you buy it or whether you make it and what you can do with them to really kick up your sandwiches ah something as simple as like ricotta cheese which is on every supermarket shelf and how you can sort of flavour those things to really sort of kick up your sandwiches - anyhow there's a whole book of condiments in there and and and toppings and salad dressings etc that you should check out that's really really awesome third is obviously what are you putting in it so whether it's a simple egg salad sandwich which believe it or not was one of the almost number one blogged sandwiches in this little thing that we did which blew my mind because I mean I didn't think that egg salad would be that interesting to people but when it goes to show me when you have a great recipe something as simple as egg salad done right and done to taste delicious people are going to get excited about that um and then of course beside that inside is where I was really talking about is really the preparation whether you keep it simple plain whether you toast it whether you griddle it what are you griddle it on a machine whether you griddle it on a stone in this case we're using our great sort of Macy's pot here which is sort of a thing that we've done exclusive for them to sort of right we're doing it in a to fry the sandwich believe it or not you can griddle it and if you want to do that but there's nothing wrong with frying if you fry right okay the whole key of frying right is the temperature okay people out there think that frying oh my god I'm gonna I in my veins in my nerves and this has been all be applauded and all my goodness and you know if you fry bad then you should talk like that but if you fry right you don't really have to have to worry and it's all about really the temperature and how you do that if you're going to fry on the stovetop as we are today as opposed to a fryer you want to make sure that the oil is about 50% of the what I call the weight in the pot because it's going to expand whether we put shrimp in there or catfish or whether we're going to put a Monte Cristo in there that it's important that we sort of keep that together all right very simple innards good roast turkey good ham this is an uncute ham a good American cheese not that processed crap that's out there and good American cheese okay good ingredients make great food make great sandwiches very very simple condiments so we have our bread and basically for this what we're going to do is we're going to take a little bit of mayonnaise or as much as you like some people are not mayonnaise fans that's okay but we want to give as I say in the book to spread a chance to really sort of show itself the other thing that I also like beside that is is adding a little bit of mustard this is a DeJohn mustard I don't think that you have to add a lot but I think the combination of this really makes this to be a simple but yet delicious sandwich and then from there what we're going to do is we're going to start with the cheese first and then we're going to start with the roast turkey and you see you know just this also as simple as a sandwich there's also a technique that goes with this too to make it work to make it all stay together it's not just throwing everything in between two slices of bread if you want to do that go on a fishing trip going up you know on a picnic oh that you don't really care about and then we're going to take the ham and really just want to lay that and then we're going to come back with the top layer of cheese as I said what is very important for this particular sandwich is really pressing this pressing it is very important and don't mind getting your hands dirty now the key then the next thing is soft butter it really and particularly if you're going to griddle this as opposed to frying it if you're going to griddle this you really want to make sure that the butter is soft it's not going to tear the bread up and shouldn't tear the bread up and you want to make sure that you distribute it evenly which is why you have a sandwich spreader or you could use a good butter knife pressing it really really good as I said is very is very key and then once it's pressed then you can griddle it or fry it with this particular thing what we would do now is take it dip it inside of our battle check your batter before you're going to do this as you can see now our batter is getting thick as it's sitting there it's just because it's relaxed it's the way that it's going to do which is what you can always add to thin it out which is perfect now a trick that Gregg and I were just talking about in Barnard before I came out was for this particular sandwich it's really important that the proteins sort of solidify again so we have the proteins the meats the cheese that we've sort of relaxed as we have made the sandwiches okay but not what we want to do is we want to take and we want to take those proteins and you can either wrap them so you can do it ahead of time or we want to put it back in the refrigerator so that they really solidify because then what you want to be able to do is to be able to really just sort of dip that inside of the sandwich and write what you want to do then just we we have got this out we're going to just sort of pack this dry a little bit I don't know if you ever had a Monte Cristo but preserves a some sort of Jam was always sort of a centerpiece or a mama later whether you like raspberry orange whatever you like the other thing was I never could imagine why powdered sugar would be sprinkled on a sandwich like that I could never figure that out and then I figured out that the whole key to that is that if you did fry bad the powdered sugar covered it up and so you really couldn't you couldn't really so look you're just a little bit like that and maybe another another layer sort of like this listen that look great right here with me you
