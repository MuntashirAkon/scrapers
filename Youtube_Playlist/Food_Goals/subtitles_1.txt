what's up guys welcome back to my Bake Shop I'm Dan Landon from baked bread and tonight I'm creating another crazy gigantic food cake so huge watermelon shootable are now in place watermelon are one of my favorite foods to eat or fruits rather I should say this I'm here to write it started we have Anthony on camera we have Caitlyn answering questions and course I'm Dan let's do this so I'm going to move this huge watermelon cake that I've already made out of the way here but first I'll give you guys a little peek of what's to come move this out of the way you're probably wondering how I arrived at the shape don't wear much I guess so what I have here is a pound cake it's nice and cold I took it out of the fridge what I did was bake one 10 inch cake layer cut in half and I sandwiched it together and then I cut a flat side here so that it would stand up flat just like that but to get the water down shape what I want to do is take a serrated knife and just little by little leave the bottom of the cake wide and towards the top of the cake just taper it up so this will give me that classic you know watermelon slice shape down looking for so for cakes like this they're sculpted and kind of defy gravity and bow out a little bit like this cake does I really like to use a butter cake or a pound cake there's something that's nice and sturdy so that you know when it's standing up it stays Danielle and I also really like to use ganache too if you guys to watch me a design cakes before you've probably heard me talk about ganache it's basically just a mixture of chocolate and heavy cream and you mix the two together and it makes this really strong filling or frosting that's solid room temperature so just with my serrated knife here I'm just going to keep tapering this in and eventually I'll arrive at this tapered watermelon shape just like that so I could be just like that or I could continue to taper it up but it's pretty simple pretty easy whenever you're sculpting a cake if the cake is cold it will be a lot easier and if you're nice to get a lot of cake or buttercream or whatever stuck to it you just want to wash it off with some hot water and it'll be easy-peasy so that is how I created this shape let me just get this out of the way and we started with the actual decoration of this one right here so the first thing I have to do is roll out some white fondant and that's cuz I'm going to start this entire watermelon white and then paint the red paint the pink part rather so I'll start with some white fondant here and I actually microwaved it a couple minutes ago sort of the planks of warm flexible and I'll grab just a little bit of vegetable shortening put that in my hand and give this an ease don't forget to do that to have questions about what I'm doing here your questions about baking your tapes I'll leave your questions in the comments below I'll do my best to answer them and don't forget to share this video with your friends if you think they'd enjoy it and check out my facebook page at base button the links should be at the top of this video so I just want to knead this white fondant just until it's nice and stretchy nice and flexible people always ask me why your fondant cracks and sometimes unfortunately fondant does just crap but usually I find that it cracks because the fun that's dried out where you didn't need it long enough so a good test is always to see if your father's a nice and stretchy when you're kneading it and if it is it should be stretching when it goes on the cake I want to grab just a little bit more just for insurance I have enough that's another trick with phonics you always want to work with a little more than you think you need because the excess that hangs off the cakes makes putting the fondant on the cake a lot easier it's really helpful so this cake will be awesome for you know summer barbecue a block party you cook out and then whatever you want to take it to and I actually started to water modes that are when you decorating here with 12-inch cakes so I would get them you know not large all right so I want to roll all of the wrinkles back so they have nice smooth top grab some cornstarch and my shaker here get a good bit on the table and I want to roll out pretty large piece I'll give it a good pat down with my hands a little bit more cornstarch on top grab a good old PVC rolling pin start over so every couple rolls I like to turn my on it just so it stays circular and save nice interior as well and as I go along with I see any huge air bubbles I'll just give them a pop with a little pin I just know that this Navy shirt ain't going to end up covered with Coon starts by the time I'm done this but you know price you pay for making awesome cake so I'll roll this until it's about a little maybe an eighth of an inch thick maybe a little bit thicker I'll be alright - so I'll grab a pin just to pop use you can zoom in on some of this stuff it yeah Nicolette wants to know how do you keep layer cakes fresh and moist process hey Nicolette you know that is a great question some people like to use simple syrups to keep their cakes fresh moist I don't usually I think the best trick is just to work quickly so bake your cake wrap it up as soon as it's cool and then fill in frost it as soon as you can if you're going to leave a cake in the refrigerator overnight you definitely want it to be at least at the crumb coat stage so it's nice an airtight so anytime you put a cake in the fridge you want it to be frosted with some type of you know crumb coat ganache or buttercream so that's airtight if you need to store your cakes for longer before filling and frosting them wrapping them a couple times and then freezing them is actually a really good process or a really good really good thing to do I should say alright so just using this out my fine Rivard I'm gonna grab my cake so this cake is ganache this is the beauty of ganache I can like handle it and hold this and really really kind of hit it with some good force while I'm decorating it and it's not going to go anywhere so what I want to do kind of wait for my work service is just miss my cake with some vodka and you guys know I really like to use vodka for cake decorating cuz it dry so quickly so sometimes when attaching fot it to a ganache cake I like to use vegetable shortening but the box is going to give an extra hold for this cake so basically I'm doing is placing one side of the cake down and then I'm just going to grab this white fondant and just wrap it up just like that super easy around my fondant smoother smooth this whole thing on here until like I said I have a good bit of excess and that's perfect it's always better to have more and be able to cut the fondant away than it is to throw it out be like oh no I don't have not so I'll give this to good smooth from the middle out that's going to push out any air bubbles if I do see some air bubbles of trapped between the cake and the fondant I'll just give them as smooth if you guys are just joining we are creating this gigantic watermelon cake just in time for all the summer barbecue Sofia wants the Nelson taste the vodka that you can trade on the page shit no you totally don't taste the vodka it completely evaporates so I'm going to still be there don't worry so I'm just going to take a craft knife now and what I want to do is just cut this spot it away right where this rounded area ends so I'll start by cutting a lot of excess away so I can see how to see what I'm working with now put this away for later use can always reuse funny you're going get rid of it as long as you put it back in this bag right away it will stay good alright so now I can kind of see the edge of this cake and I'm just going to use my knife and just carefully wrote a knife along the edge of the cake and hopefully get a nice flush cut if not I can go back in and do another another pass with my craft knife so this is kind of like I guess paddling the cake because of the shape of this watermelon covering it in a traditional manner really wouldn't work well so I find that this is easiest methods what I want to do here is just take my fingers just smoothy's together I want the fondant to become pretty well attached to the ganache cake and then what I'm going to do is just take this off clear myself a little bit of space here for somebody with an alcohol if you guys don't use alcohol you could to these water that would work just fine alright so when I go back here to want it yeah alright so I'm going to pick right here is good yeah I'm going to pick my cake up take my board and a piece of parchment and just flip the cake over because I need to get the other side and you be able to cut the other side so I feel a little air bubble I'll push that out the side here so right now Pennsylvania it's a good two solid 75 degrees which makes cake decorating even in a sea kind of difficult on another advantage of using ganache is that ganache like you guys saw is pretty solid room temperature whereas buttercream is not sovereign temperature really softens up so if you're having issues with your cakes feeling too soft when you're trying to butter cream or carbon in fondant and you've used buttercream try switching to ganache and you might find that it's a lot easier so if you guys want the recipe for the cakes that I'm using you can check out my blog which is baking with Dan comm also checking out my Instagram it baked by Dan on its ear and because I usually post a lot of cool stories and pictures of what I'm doing for these lives so if you guys want to be in the know for the time comes you can check it out there all right so I'm just doing a couple final cuts here to get all of this white off and get it where I need to be smooth this with my finger good all right so before divine want to take stationed rush just get rid of any of this extra corn search yeah Sarla would like to know what exactly is phenom Darla ganache is what is on the inside of a truffle it's a mixture of chocolate and heavy cream I like to use white chocolate ganache because it's not going to show through like chocolate or dark chocolate would so to make white chocolate ganache you're going to need a scale the recipe is by weight and I 5 parts by weight of white chocolate and then in one part by weight of heavy cream or whipping cream double cream and a cream that has at least like 35 percent butterfat in it will work so now I'm going to roll out some green fondant and that's going to be the green skin in this watermelon so let's move that away in grandma green so I studied a watermelon pretty close to you're ready for this cake is that it's really funny whenever I make fruitcakes I always spending a bit of time splitting the fruit or vegetable but I'm turning into food and basically what I notice is that the two colors in the watermelon are basically just two saturations of green so what I want to do is start the cake with the lightest green which is kind of this lime green here and then I'll build up the color using like a sponge painting method so I want to give this a good roll same thing I want to nice and stretchy we'll grab a little bit shortening so if you guys are just joining we are creating this epic sculpted worm just in time for all those summer festivities and what I'm doing now is meeting the green fondant for the skin of work Jennifer is asking how you go about keeping the key good if you say do it before you need it Jennifer if you're going to make a cake a week before unit you definitely want to double or triple wrap it into some type of plastic wrap and then put it in your freezer and it should be done and then you can just defrost it before you want to fill it or frost it alright so same thing I want to roll out the three here I'm gonna grab my cornstarch even more on the table as if I don't already have enough cornstarch on the table on me let's hit some more here so I'll roll this to the width I need it about eight inches and then prepare just going to roll it long way around if you find that your fondant sticks a lot when you're rolling it it's really helpful to always keep the fun that moving if you're always shifting around and keeping it moving it's less likely to stick and if it is sticking you'll catch it you'll catch it earlier than you would if you just kept going and then if you need to start over you can start over quicker I don't think you know alright so I'm just popping these air bubbles and what's really great here about the scandal or doll is that the fondant doesn't have to be perfectly smooth it has some denser you know craters in it no big deal because I've never seen a perfect watermelon I hope take day they exist so any kind of imperfections or textured textured elements are just going to add to the look of the cake once it's finished all right good so my rolling pins 20 inches long so I know that I have enough fun and I'll just roll this up on a rolling pin brush off some of this cornstarch here turn the 5/8 I'm not my cake again I have sitting on a piece of parchment and I was given mist with more vodka so that my sonnet six and on the bottom of the cake I have attached a piece of foam core board that's what cake is standing up on so I don't want that to be too sticky because I'm gonna peel it away from that so I'm just making sure that the edges of this white fondant that I apply it earlier making sure they're sticky because I want the green and the white to adhere to each other a lot of times with sculpted cakes people have issues with trying to get their ganache or their buttercream smooth because they're using a palette knife which is straight but obviously your cakes aren't straight or curved you can either piece of plastic acetate to smooth it you can also just buff it with some water and your hands once the butter cream or ganache is set up all right so you see I just unrolled that right over the watermelon and now basically I'm just going to use my hands and get to smoothing this in here so I'll do the same thing I'll cut this upper side and then I'll flip the cake over to cut the other side but I'm pushing specifically right along the edge here because I want to get the green fondant that's the skin of the watermelon and the white area I want them to be attached really well and if I want to buff this out I'll take a little extra piece of this bonnet you guys need to see me do this trick before and I'll just rub the Sonic along the cake and this will just make sure it's attached adhered I know I just said the skin doesn't have to be perfectly smooth but it's not just about smoothing but it's also about making sure that the fondant stuck to the cake really well that's real important go so now what I'll do is grab a knife here and cut away a lot of this excess so guys don't forget to post your questions in the comments below share this video if you guys have ever created a close to cake or into the case you want to share share it in the comments below so we can all check it out so now what I want to do is place the flat part of my knife just go ball in the cake I'll start at the middle here make sure you guys can see this and if I run this along the area that I already covered and try and keep them legs nice and steady I should get a nice clean cut yeah breezy wants to know if you have to create the cake after you do the ganache brandy you don't have to freeze the cake you can just put it in the refrigerator if you're going to cover a cake in fondant once it's once it's covered in buttercream or ganache usually you don't want to freeze it at that point because when you take it out of the freezer it's going to get a ton of condensation on it and then it's going to make it really tough to cut your cake because your fondant will basically you wet the whole time you're trying to smooth it all right so just a couple more cuts here I just want this to be a nice clean edge and after we get this on here I'm going to be painting this and want to show you have to Cole cool sponge painting techniques using a sea sponge and a piece of plastic wrap to get a really cool texture that I think looks pretty realistic so I'll just smooth this with my pointer finger and some make sure it's nice an attached and I'm gonna be flipping this cake over I'm just going to cut away a little bit of extra I don't want to cut all the way up against the cake cause they get a little bit of overhang so all right so same thing I'll smooth this side over make sure to attach the white and green really nicely if they don't feel like they're attaching what I want to do is to take a paintbrush with a little bit of vodka and just brush that on there good when I smooth my hands so we'll find that smoother for this part since its rounded one really be too helpful so my hands are my best tool here is I can kind of confirm them to the cake clean off my knife just so I can get a nice clean cut I always like to use the part of the knife to that's closest to the handle I find that that's usually sharper since you know for everyday cutting you don't really use the inside of the mix so that works really well for process like this good switch back to my craft knife here for these final two cuts and then we'll be good to go this is this watermelon cake will be ready to paint which i think is a really fun part of the whole project good are you so tell people are ask me if you kind of back up and you crazy box on the cake why'd you do that yeah guys so I sprayed back on the cake just so that the just of the fondant would stick to the ganache that's what I did I like to spray either butter cream cakes or ganache cakes with vodka if I'm going to cover them in fondant just because the vodka dries pretty quickly so I find that I get a good good contact between the cake in the pocket it is here's pretty quickly all right so one more final cut it's all about the details here so something like this you definitely don't want to rush through all right now take my pointer finger my thumb again smoother this all together we have some good contact and now I just need to cut off this piece of fondant it's on the bottom so I'll go back to my knife here I'll kind of find where that cardboard is and just start carefully cutting away so this us that is pretty important because this obviously becomes the base of the cake what the cakes going to sit on so I have to make sure that it has a good sturdy base whenever I'm creating a slope to kink I always like to kind of overcompensate with the structure it's always I think a little bit easier to over the infrastructure or over plan than it is to kind of underestimate how strong the cake Marian update Ryan with right - no Brian yeah no type of paint you use when you're PPP Brian so it's actually not paint it's just food coloring it's the same food color that you use to color fondant or buttercream and I just mix it again with vodka because it drives so quickly so it's not going to make your fondant really sticky and gummy like water would Alden cookies water alright so now I have the cardboard exposed here and what I want to do is grab my paint so I have some Moss color food coloring I have some vodka and I have a little natural sea sponge so the first thing I want to do is take some of my less saturated green and I'm going to sponge paint all over the entire thing this is going to get any kind of that uneven light green speckle that you see on the watermelon I want to try and make sure I don't get any on the white section lock it down so I want this to be pretty regular it doesn't have to be perfect good and then what I want to do is go back with the same green but in a more saturated tone so we'll get this later green out of the way and I have some full strength moss green food gel here I'll add some vodka to my plate and I want a nice dark green so I'll just have this sponge in here and I'll start with one line straight down the middle gut so that's my first line I'll do the same thing I'll continue that over on the other side let me actually move myself here so you guys probably see me a little better back with my darker green good and then I'm going to take a tape brush and just speckle the inside of this dark green strip to some little more more dark green good so if you guys are just tuning in we're about a halfway through making this giant sculpted watermelon cake I'm painting the fondant right now to look like watermelon skin so I'm using a sea sponge and some Moss colored green food coloring I'm going to get a close-up here I'll show you guys again how I did it I'll go up all the way towards the edge just gonna sponge paint this on and then what it kind of starts to meet this top point I'll stop so you can find these sea sponges in the craft section of the craft store they're always sanitized when you buy them but of course you can just clean them with you know sanitizer hot soap and water and you can use them for cake decorating so I'll go back with my paintbrush a little bit of a darker green just in random spots good and then I just want to do one more pass here right towards the bottom so guys don't forget to ask your questions in the comments below and Caitlyn will let me know what your questions are and so if you guys if you have questions about anything baking related cakes pastry you know whatever you guys want to know get me the comics we'll see if we can answer them alright one more time a little bit of green on the brush and then what we're going to do is grab a piece of plastic wrap and I just kind of have punched out and then I'll go back down the middle of each of these stripes on the skin here to kind of blend in this darker green areas this is actually one of my favorite painting texturing techniques is using this plastic wrap because it works so easy you can also do this to texture buttercream it's really cool do you guys like these cakes tutorials and you know baking and decorating things check out my youtube channel my youtube is baking what down YouTube you can also just find some of those videos on my facebook page which is baked by dan on Facebook alright so now the green is pretty much done so I'll clear this green out of the way but any tips for making found on teas taste good there guys you know what if you're going to make funded from scratch usually the best tasting thing you can find is marshmallow fondant and you can also flavor fun with whatever you want you can add extracts to it you can emulsions to it whatever you want to do but I find that a little bit of salt and some vanilla extract into a marshmallow fondant makes it taste pretty good just as it is so I'm just cleaning up my cornstarch here alright so let me grab my turntable good try and center that awesome all right so let me just change my gloves here get rid of it three through diet it's always in my club so if you guys have an idea for a hate project that you would like to see whether it's a sculpted cake or giant food cake whatever you may want to see let us know in the comments below we're always looking for ideas for the next Facebook live and take it for me any time you're painting a cake with your color or your coloring fondant it's always really helpful wear gloves because your fingers end up watermelon green I'll probably be like after a couple days so alright so the next thing I want to do is grab some green tights and I want to kind of blend this really harsh green line between the skin and the white pulp together so I'm just going to take a little bit of green petal dust tap some into the cap here and I'm just really going to lightly just brush over the spot where the two meet so where the green and the white meets I'm just going to brush with a little bit as green petal dust and that kind of that makes it a little bit less of a harsh transition so if you can find these powdered food colors in most arts and crafts stores that sell cake decorating supplies so if you just go to cake decorating aisle you can find this stuff okay so some people are asking I don't know if you know the answer to this is it's safe for children to eat just yeah I would say yes definitely the vodka evaporates if you don't believe me you can pour a little bit of vodka into a plate and walk away for a couple minutes and come back in it'll already started evaporating um but like I said if you don't want to use the vodka that's just my medium of choice you can use water or you can use piping gel or you can use a mixture of water and corn syrup you could use simple syrup in a spray bottle anything that's going to make the surface of your cake kind of damp and sticky will work well to attach fondant to a cake so I already just run the parts we already have a little bit of texture on this white area which is perfect the most challenging part for me I'm making this cake was just trying to get the the red pulpy part of the watermelon to look realistic because it's just such a such a deep colored and textured aspect of the watermelon is pretty challenging to replicate in cake but I'm pretty happy with how my finished product turned out again looks pretty nice alright so I'll put this green food color away and now what I need to do is paint on the the red section of the cake so I'm going to get my green fondant back out I want to roll it out so to paint the red on the cake out of basically thinking like how do I paint this red and get a nice clean line and I was like well you know we're going to paint my house I'm going to tape off the walls right here I'm going to tape the corners when I'm going to pee in the house but I will say I'm not going to put tape on a cake so what I'm going to do is stick a fondant shirt to it paint the red section of the watermelon and peel the fondant off and I'll have a nice clean line so basically that's what I'm doing here I'll roll this out one more time smaller going pins left and then I'm just going to use a shirt cutter to cut a strip of green fun and I want to stick this trip to the Cape just using a little bit of vegetable shortening the shortening will hold the shirt in place long enough for me to paint right into paint but that'll be able to seal it off alright okay so strip cutter people call these shirt cutters ribbon cutters they're delighted for names words you can find them online or at cake decorating stores basically I'll just pass this all the way down the strip doesn't need to be perfect doesn't have to be any even thickness I'm basically using it to act as a guide for my painting right so a little bit of vegetable shortening I'll rub this on here so that it is nice and sticky this is like the homestretch of this cake guys so if you're watching don't go anywhere because once this rent comes on this cake completely comes together and I think it's the most most epic summer cake that I'll probably create all week I'll make another one next week all right so just rubbing this shortening on here good so what I'm going to do now is Center my cake back on the table and just pick up these strips here and just stick it to the side of the cake so I'm trying to line up the edge of this strip with the edge of the skin that I created earlier just pinch this off so I'll just push this in place to make sure it's here good and then I'll grab my knife I'll just cut this flat all right oh it's like I said this is my technique for basically taping off the watermelon so I can get that red section there so to paint my cake I'm about to use a mixture of pink and red I tried this out a few times on a swatch the pink wishes to brighten the red almost was kind of too deep so I found that a mixture of pink and red food dye worked best for well messes to do next I have that mixture in a custard cup here it's a little bit of food dye with some vodka and then before I go on I just want to look down at this and just make sure that evenly attached that there's no spaces because I don't want the red to drip down I'm doing this so that I have nice white outline after I finish painting my red one here all right so I'm going to take a modeling tool and just give this a little bit of texture just kind of Nick it up a little bit because watermelons always have that really porous spongy looking kind of effect to them and then whenever I thought of watermelon never really sharp at the top it's always kind of denting and spongy edges that looks just so softly kind of irresistible you just on a plate into it because you just know to be juicy so I'll roll around the tool in a couple of areas just to insinuate where seeds will end up so I'm doing this texturing before I paint it obviously well allow the paint to gather in those areas it'll look a little fuller I think once it's done I want to get some more plastic wrap ready and I'm going to grab a paper house in case I need it and then starting at the top just cluster our paint mossad went out a little more vodka to it next time I make this cake I think what I'm going to do is especially buy some watermelon vodka so every time vodka for the project it's just going to fit my two issues the peanuts and putting in these not mine so I chose to paint this that's a good question because I can kind of manipulate the paint once it's all on there and give it a look of texture if I just put fondant on it it would just be really solid and it wouldn't have as much life to it I don't think so and for things like this I really like using a fan brush because I think it gives really a quick coverage so any areas really pull up towards the bottom definitely want to get rid of that right away so that it doesn't kind of drip down under my strip here all right subject but I go in with some more plastic wrap here just kind of hit this up and like a sweeping motion our young million-dollar question was able to do the math this is actually a red velvet cake I thought about making a vanilla cake and dyeing it pink but I'm a big chocolate fan so I always sneak some chocolate and stuff whenever I can and once it's live is over the crew and I are you enjoying this cake so I figured you guys will pay for it so oh yeah oh yeah yeah all right so so going in with this painting here so whatever I'm paying a cake like this and I mix the color up I wanted to do a swatch first so before this live I actually mixed this paint up and I painted it on a little bit of white on it just to see what it would look like because it would really stink to have this whole cake you know put together and then put the paint on there and completely heated so it's always a good idea to do a test first so for my seeds I'm just going to take some little black pieces of fondant and roll them out and stick them in some of these groups that I made all right backing with my plastic wrap give us a little bit of DAB here so whenever you're doing this technique you always kind of to change the area you're using because once it gets really loaded up with color it doesn't work as well so I think the polls look a little bit better than dabbing it and then once it starts to dry if you kind of go back and texture it the colors a little more therapy it's a little bit thicker so it kind of pulls a little bit nicer and I think you get even more texture out of it good all right so I'll let that set for just a second you know the red dye up so now what I want to do is just grab just a little bit of fondant just going to roll out some seeds for this watermelon so I know that some watermelons have like white seeds or tan seeds and some have black seeds but I wanted to see two really uh really contrasting on location but I decided to go with black so I'll just roll some circles with a fondant actually going to continue a blowback for this because it's impossible to do this glove so let that dry for just a moment longer so little bits of black fondant just roll the circles in my hands point the bottom and then just let them dry for just a second good so a cake like this when it's done I would keep it in a refrigerator until I wanted to serve it just for just for insurance if I was going to travel with this cake I definitely would keep it chilled until I was ready to leave if you chill your cake and then you keep your cake in a brown cardboard shipping box that is specifically for cakes it will kind of insulate the cake and it will be a little more insurance that your tape will travel and still be in one piece and get wherever you're going all right so time for the magic here let's peel this green strip off see what we have big reveal place extreme keeping cool there we go look I'll take a little bit of hand-colored fun a little bit of brown and I'll need it just into a circle just like this right here and then I'll take a texturing tool just texture that a little bit and I'm going to stick this to one side of the watermelon I think this side look is good press today with my fingers this is kind of like a little nub for the watermelon groves they're like the bellybutton I like to call it a bellybutton awesome alright let's stick some seeds in here to do that I'm going to grab my wooden sculpting tool and I'm just going to use the rounded edge of the window angel and push in a little bit with a point up and then I'll take my seeds and push those in point out how she wants to know when you paint the cake yeah does the color deepen as it's done or is a pretty true color when you first do it uh Tasha I actually find that the color kind of lightens a little bit I think if it dries especially with this red it lightens so you may have to go back and recolor it but I actually kind of like when it lightens up because it has a kind of white accents that a water down has it I guess make it look really like juicy but it depends there's not really a hard answer without depending on the color that you're using some may deepen some may lighten as the you know as the paint dries alright just a few more seeds here and this watermelon will be barbecue ready so if you guys are just joining again get to see highs hope to this case from the very beginning don't worry because this video is going to be on the food number Facebook page it'll be on the wall just a few minutes after this broadcast is done so make sure you check out the food number Facebook page to see this video on full answers back and don't forget to check out my Facebook page base by down on Facebook also check me out on instagram at baked by Dan because I have in profit shots of this cake and I'll put this video after the fact on my own Facebook as well so just a few more seeds I'm doing the indentation here just so disease kind of sit recessed into the cake looks a little bit cooler that white insiders have them stick on the
