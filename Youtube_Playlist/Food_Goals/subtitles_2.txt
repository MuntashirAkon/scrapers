hey everyone i'm chelsea white of cello suites and i'm here today to show you how to make a checkerboard cake so if you kind of match the chekura theme of black and white we're going to be flavoring this cake like cookies and cream some of you I haven't started off by showing them how we're gonna put together our layers so we can build this chick checkerboard pattern so as I'm doing this if you guys have any questions about me or baking or any of the techniques that I'm using feel free to ask so I have here 8 inch cake grounds I baked and I'm using some circle cutters to cut out 4 different pieces from each cake later and we're then going to alternate back inside of each it Oh pick up sorry we're then I'm gonna alternate them inside of each other so we can get that really fun pattern so I've already cut up two of my layers and you can see that I have started stacking them together so you're just gonna be alternating your white and your black paint layers so since I have a black layer here I'm gonna go ahead and take this white layer I'm gonna Nestle it in here and then we're gonna take our smallest little black circle and we're gonna put it right in the center so we're gonna go ahead we repeat this with all four of our cake layers umm and I'm gonna run you through some of the tips that I use to help make sure that this pattern turns out so I'm using here today my favorite vanilla cake base and my favorite layer chocolate cake recipe and both can be found on shell sweets calm so with that I'm gonna go ahead and assemble my second layer here so one important thing to note if you're making a checkerboard cake is to make sure that you do level your layers and normally with this recipe it bakes very flat so you don't normally have to level it but today since we really want all of our layers to be perfectly the same height that way our checkerboard is aligned it is important that you do later so keep that in mind if you are using this recipe or any other recipe that's a very important step so next not only to our layers complete have two layers I have a cut here and if you don't have these exact cake pans with this silence or okay sighs you can definitely alter this to use like a six inch cake ground if you had smaller circle cutters if the only thing that's important is that you're spacing between your rings it's equal and uniform so I'm gonna go ahead now and it's really easy I just like to make sure that it's lined up and you just gently press into the cake later so you want to press nice and firm and I like to kind of twist them a little bit just make sure that it's cut all the way through and then I just gently pull it out any questions out there while I'm doing this what's your favorite non cake dessert my favorite non cake dessert that's a tough one um I would have to say probably chocolate chip cookies so I like to cut out my cake grounds while my parchment paper still on there that's just my preference but you don't have to do that and then I just gently pop out each little bit and while you're doing this you want to be really careful because you don't want to tear your rings so my fingers are thoroughly chilled and that makes them a little bit easier to handle so I recommend doing that if you plan to cut out rings like this another thing is you also if you don't have um these circle cutters you can totally just alternate black and white and make a really fun pattern cake that way with a little bit less time cool but will still have a really great on interior once you cut into it so now we're just going to cover the last layer here and again you just want to really make sure that you're lining it up uniformly around your layer so let's put them together before I cut in just to make sure spacing is really even so we're just gonna gently push it in like this and also as you're doing this if for some reason you do get a lot of crumbs around your rings make sure that you clean them off so that way you don't get different colored crumbs all right so now it's time to assemble these last two layers and then we're gonna go ahead and get started assembling our cake I'm do the same thing as before I'm just going to gently remove these and this also takes up a lot of counter space to lay out all of your layers so make sure that you definitely let yourself enough room if you plan on doing this technique we're gonna go ahead and just keep alternating our leaders here and I'm gonna gently just push them together to make sure they're nicely lined this one here and then we just have the centers left so these should look exactly like bull's-eyes once you're done with them I'm gonna go ahead and make sure there's an excellent level I'm gonna go ahead and dust off my hands and and we're going to go ahead and get stocking so I'm going to go ahead and slide this over here and I'm going to Center my cake stance you guys can see exactly what I'm doing so we're going to stack these and we're going to be frosting it with a little bit of American buttercream that I made and this is just standard vanilla buttercream so my layer cakes I like to put a little bit of buttercream on my cake base and just spread it out and then I really help secure your cake to your cake base sometimes you get a little bit of slippage and I can help control that so we're going to go ahead and start I think with this layer you can go ahead and center it and as you're doing this to get the checkerboard it's important that you alternate your outside layers so next we'll stack a vanilla layer that has been all on the outside rim so I'm going to go ahead and put on a decent amount of buttercream here and I like to add a lot of buttercream to my cakes they're like a huge sweet tooth so if you don't like this much butter cream it's all about your preference you can definitely put less on and also if you don't love American buttercream you can totally use a different type like Swiss meringue or Italian any of that would work on this cake do you ever use chocolate buttercream and cinnamon on I do actually so today when our finished decorating this I would be adding a little bit of butter or chocolate buttercream to the top to decorate so yes and we will be today somebody gently spread this out and since we did level our key players if you have some loose crumbs so it's really important as you're doing this gently birthday frosting to the edge of a cake layer so you don't rip up a bunch of those crumbs go ahead just keep working my way out here and then we're going to smooth it any other questions how do you make the buttercream so this buttercream I love American buttercream for the taste but it also is the easiest buttercream to me all you do is you take butter sugar and vanilla you mix them together you very slowly incorporate powdered sugar and then you add in splashes of cream so literally five ingredients super easy my recipe for American buttercream is at lunch Elsa's calm and actually a full tutorial as well on my youtube channel which is called shell sweets bakery so you haven't any questions on how to make it definitely head over there and check that out I'm going to go ahead now just spin this around get nice and level buttercream and that's for not an ex-gay clear so like I said earlier we're going to be using this later next and it's important to make sure that your layers are pretty aligned as you're doing this because you want them to line up when we cut into this it's next to I have now it's more oh I forgot to add our our crepes or a lot of them to our next layer so I'm going to add some more butter cream on top of this and we're going to smooth it as well so again we're just using the same technique here and if you don't have an office especially you can always use a knife um but it also special makes a lot easier so if you have one definitely use it and if you don't but you like decorating cakes a lot I highly recommend getting one these two tools are the most used tools in my entire time so I hope you don't mind getting them if you don't have it and you like to be okay so we're gonna add some chopped or some chopped chocolate sandwich cookies at this layer and this is just going to give it a little bit of an extra crunch as we bite in so I always like a little texture in my case so but if you don't like chocolate sandwich cookies or you are not a big texter person so next we're going to use a layer that has black on the outside so I go ahead and set this down and we're gonna run the press down just make sure that we have all this orbit was secured underneath it's pretty good we're gonna have some more buttercream any other questions out there yes do you chill your buttercream first no I don't um I guess if I were to make it ahead of time and stored overnight I would pop it into the fridge but in general I usually on whip up buttercream and then use it immediately and I don't chill it so if you have any problems with your buttercream being too thin and you are struggling to frost smoothly on you can always that a little bit less heavy cream or a little bit more powdered sugar either those will help stiffen up your buttercream as well where can you buy the rings that you use to cut the wires so I bought my rings on Amazon I literally just searched circle cookie cutters or circle cutters and they popped up which was great but I'm really sure you can also find them at cake decorating stores are probably even on some water to retail stores like Walmart or Target and then we're gonna add our last layer so we're almost done stacking I'm so excited to cut into this cakes that's the very best part so this is definitely in be a delayed gratification type of a cake so last but not least around our last cake layer here and again when you're handling these layers you have to be very careful because you know it's four individual pieces of cake and you don't want to show you all stay together so be very delicate as we're doing this so now that my cake layer is on edit to flip it upside down because it makes it easier to get a nice sharp edge just when your frosting and that's because you know that the bottom and the sides are the key player base against the pan so they're guaranteed to be flat so anyway I have now just press this down make sure you don't have any air bubbles in here and to make sure all my layers are nicely aligned and once we've done that we're gonna go ahead and start to frost the exterior of the cake now in a perfect world I would definitely apply a crumb coat to this cake chill it and then apply a nice second layer of buttercream especially since we have our use matte dark cake base which is going to release some dark crumbs but today since this is a live stream we're just gonna be doing one coat of frosting however if you have unloaded time I highly recommend using and crumb coat but it's always the best practice so now I'm going to go ahead and smooth this out on the top and then we're gonna work our way down our size it's gonna make sure this is nice in the line alright so you don't have to cross this way this is just the way that I find is easiest I just kind of push my cross into the edge and then work my sighs but I think a lot of people have different techniques for this so if you do it a different way that's great but I find that this works best for me we're going to smooth it out and so once we have all the Frost's do you want to hear we're actually going to be covering this cake with crushed Oreos so if that's going to be great because that way if we do get any extra crumbs on the edge of our cake or any of our Oreos are peeking through it filled the cake with it's not gonna be a big deal and they won't really show up so we're just gonna make sure we get a nice even layer of frosting here and then we're gonna go ahead and get stuck hoping this in crushed chocolate sandwich cookies all right so we're gonna go ahead and smooth across it now around and out a little bit more in a minute but first I'm just gonna try to shop in all those crumbs again if you don't love a lot of frosting you can totally you can even do this as a naked cake where you just leave the edges exposed or you can do it really like frosting where there are some bits of exposed cake it really all comes down to your preference so I'm gonna go ahead and add a little bit more on here because that's how I like my cakes and I'm just gonna share this cake with my friends that are helping me tonight which are Julie and Lauren and they also like frosting the hawk so we're going to add a watch this any other questions out there for people just tuning in you just go through what cake you're making of course so I'm making today a checkerboard cake and it is going to be a cookies and cream flavored cake and we're going to be covering it in a minute with crushed Oreos and we have made some rings with our cake layers we're going to make a really beautiful pattern when we cut into it so now that I have frosted our cake and we have a decent amount of frosting on here we're gonna go ahead a little bit just make your edges a bit sharper and then we're going to add some crushed Oreos so I'm gonna go ahead and just kind of apply an even amount of pressure here and drag my cake bench around and this is just to really smooth out those sides and again this isn't going to be perfect but it's not a big deal because we're going to be covering our cake and crushed Oreos in one minute so if you have a hard time getting perfectly smooth sides on your cake a really great technique that you can use is covering your cake and either sprinkles crushed Oreos anything like that even crushed graham crackers and that can help kind of cover those imperfections and still make your cake look really great and give it a great pop of flavor as well so that's a great trick to use if you're working on learning how to perfectly smooth frosting I have a full in-depth tutorial in which I take you through all the tips that I use get perfectly smooth sides so you can download out my youtube channel which is called shell sweets bakery if you want to learn more about that so I'm gonna go ahead now just add a little bit more frosting up here a little bit and then we're gonna smooth out the top and then we're gonna smooth it one more time any other questions people are very excited for you to cut into the cake I know it's gonna be the best part I'm already excited but I'm trying to like control myself as we finish decorating this cake that's the thing also so like I'm gonna rush through frosting right now but I swear I could spend all day smoothing a cake I think that a lot of Baker's out there are also perfectionist and so it's so hard to just hurry through these steps but most quickly as I can as we get to the best part as soon as possible it keeps moving and again you have the recipes for everything that I am making share at lunch all sweets calm and if you're enjoying this and you want to see more of my cake tutorials you can always check out my youtube channel which is called shell sweets bakery alright I think we're just about as smooth as we're gonna get with one coat of frosting so that's great you can see we do have a little bit of cake poking through but it's not a big deal because we're about to come in this in crushed chocolate sandwich cookies so I'm gonna go ahead and slide these over and I'm gonna get out a large baking tray and whenever you're covering up meat and I think it's always great to set it in a baking tray so that way and run away sprinkles on our trapped if you don't do this to end up with sprinkles all over your floor or um crushed cookies so I highly recommend this step I've learned that the hard way I think last time in your life for examples I also box rumbles everywhere like my feet we're just crushing them okay so I excused my hands and gently press crushed Oreos all around this cake and again I'm just making this cake for me and my friends tonight and I clearly wash my hands so I was gonna use them so anyway I can grab a handful here and I'm just going to very gently press it up and it's important here to apply enough pressure so that you're going to adhere the cookies to the side of the cake but not so much here as much your frosting so it's definitely a delicate kind of touch but you need it to be somewhat firm so be careful as you do this to be a comfortable with you my own pressure that you believe you need to apply the other questions other how many layers are under there so in this case there are four layers which is going to give it that really awesome pattern when you cut into it and it's just a vanilla and chocolate cake base that I've used to make that pattern and what size hands did you use to make the layers so these are 8-inch cake layers but you don't have to use that size if you have different size cake pans you can totally make this pattern out of AA different sized cake layers and veterans is covering this and just kind of gently turn it as we go so you guys can see the progress that we're making this have no idea how much willpower it took not to eat all of the chocolate sandwich cookies while I was chopping them I did taste test a little bit group but there still should be enough respect so I've been doing this you easier tons of extra rock on the sides and I likes gonna scoop that up and utilize it as I work my way around the cake so we're almost anything for about three quarters the way great any other questions where people find the recipe so again in this recipe you guys if you want to make it for the cake layers the buttercream everything is up on shell sweets calm and also I have tutorials for everything if you want to see exactly how I make this cake batter that can also be found on my youtube channel which is called Chelsea bakery [Music] I have a lot of leftover sandwich cookies so I think that we'll be able to take care of those later who gives you this right all right so once I covered the cake I would like to just kind of gently press in with my hands and that's gonna help secure any piece that might be a little bit loose or might not be fully effective cake all right so that's pretty good so I'm gonna go ahead now I just scrape away the excess around the base of my fingers because we don't want this falling all over the place when we move it us back onto our cakes and there's a lot of loose bits at the bottom here so obviously go ahead all right that's pretty good so now we're going to ahead and generally lift this up see if I can flip it I might use my offset spatula just to be safe there we go we're gonna mend places back onto our cake stand I'm also gonna rinse off my hands away quickly just because they have all right and now we're gonna go ahead and decorate the top of this cake so to make this a little bit fun I have some extra sandwich cookies here and we're gonna find this place these and a ring around the top so I'm gonna go ahead nothing is broken so I've made a lot of cookies and cream cakes in my day and I wanted to do something a little bit different today so I'm mixing up the pattern so we're gonna go ahead and keep working our way around here so once all of these sandwich cookies are in place we are going to be piping on some chocolate swirls on top of them which should be really fun and then we're gonna go ahead and slice into it which is the moment we've all been waiting for am i right am i right you are right okay so I have here some chocolate buttercream that a place into a bag and I'm using the Wilton 2d tip and on this chocolate buttercream is just the same buttercream you used for the vanilla to cover the cake but it on a little bit of baking cocoa to it and just a splash of extra cream to help counteract the cocoa because it helped it cut it ends up the buttercream we're gonna go ahead and now just pipe on some really fun swirls and if you don't have a Wilton 2d dip you can definitely use whatever ticket on my hand I think a Wilton 1m is also very common I think a lot of people have that so you can use whatever you think will look best how long does it take like this last after it's completed I'm also good for you know I haven't ever really had kicked it out for that long so I don't think I really know and it depends on how you store it but I think if you put it in the freezer what we could last for let's say like up to a week but I think that the sooner you eat it after you bake it the better the fresher it is all right you guys and just like that our cookies and cream checkerboard cake is complete so times the best part now which is pointy this case I'm gonna go ahead and set these to the side and wring their out our giant plate and their giant knife we always use think yeah I might come around to the other side because I think that that might be easiest for them to see : so I can show it to you hopefully okay so here we go you guys in this a really big slice because I'm sharing it with my friends we also with the Oreos you kind of have to cut paper one inch slices or two inch slices so kind of regulates how big of a slice and slice but all right you guys let's see how it's turned out so we have a really fun checkerboard pattern I'm going to set this down slide that over means your frosting is a little bit smeared but overall it's a really fun pattern that we have there and see how easy it is to put together and checkerboard cake so on again if
