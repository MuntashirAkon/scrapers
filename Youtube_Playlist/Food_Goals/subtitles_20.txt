so giant avocado what's up guys thanks for tuning in to Food Network live I'm Dan Langan tonight I'm here to blow your mind with this gigantic avocado cake I can't wait to show you guys this cake project and how it comes together is gonna be so awesome so grab some chips and guac get comfy don't go anywhere because you're not going to want to miss this so to create this giant avocado cake I had to prepare a few things ahead of time namely a whole nother cake which I have filled and frosted and covered in dommage it's a cards cake so if you want to see how I carve the cake or how I arrived as its shape here check out my Instagram story because I put the entire thing on my Instagram story so if you want to see how I carved it and got to the shape check it out there first they have to do to start a new avocado is put the light green fleshy part on top so what I did was a pre rolls and funding just to you know save you guys the time of watching you roll fondant out so I have some fondant here free rolls and I have a little bit of simple syrup in my spray bottle we switching it up this week usually I really fuse vodka for this stuff but have a little bit of simple syrup in my bottle and I have my piece of fondant that's rule now so I'll just grab my PVC pipe I'll turn my cake sideways and I will roll this on top so if you guys are just tuning in I'm Dan Lyons from baked by Dan you can check me out you can check my facebook all right there so if you guys see this right here I'm just going to unroll this right on top of the cake pretty easy and then I'll grab my fondant mover which is right here and I'll give it a smooth and then what I'm going to do to cut this nice and even around the outsides just so I have a nice clean cut is actually flip the cake over so there's a lot of cake flipping in this design so before I flip the cake I'm going to place a piece of parchment paper on I'm going to grab my board cake board and I'll pick the cake up so my cake is nice and cold I filled this cake in frosting so in front of this cake last night and carved it this morning so little tip there hold your cake very tight in there flipping over right so now that I can kind of see the edge of the cake could be a lot easier to cut the edge and you can see on the cake that I created already the the skin of avocado goes right up to the green right here so to get a really nice edge right here that whole process starts with how I cut this green so I'm taking a craft knife here and I'm angling my knife out to follow the the outward angle of the rest of the cake and I'm just cutting the fondant away right along the side of the cake so I'm try and do this nice and slowly because this edge will show on the final cake so I want it to look pretty good so some of you guys may be wondering why I created a ginormous 25 pound avocado cake and the really simple reason it's just because I love avocados so now that you know spring is here and summer is on its way in Pennsylvania avocados are really abundant I eat them all the time actually love them and if you guys are into healthy baking or like baking with healthy alternatives you probably know that since avocados are so rich in fat you can use them to sub out for some of the butter in your baking so if you're making like a banana bread or chocolate chip muffin or something like that you can use avocado in place of some or all of the butter in your recipe so you have to be willing to experiment on that one but I've done it and works pretty good so I'll peel this away put my green farm in the way so I can use it for later so not have a nice clean edge right so I'll put my craft knife away and before I move on before I move on to rolling out the skin of the avocado I'm going to grab some piping gel and a little paintbrush and what I'm going to do it's just paint some piping gel along the bottom of this fondant strip right here that's just because I want the side of this one to be really nice and sticky so that when I attach the avocado skin to this whole cake it adheres to the top and I get like a nice a nice connection with the fondant so that the whole thing looks pretty seamless as that makes sense so if you guys are just tuning in we are school uh well cakes re sculpted but we are decorating and designing this epic ginormous avocado cake if you guys love avocados let us know in the comments below let us know what you think so far and if you have any questions about this process or about baking very even questions about me whatever you want to know put them in the comments below I'd love to answer them and if you guys attempt this cake please share it on my Facebook page because I'd like to check it out so a lion wants to know what colors new Nick's to get that color fondant the greeting yes alive I'm so glad you asked that question so to get my colors here I actually spent a lot of time studying an avocado so I got an avocado I cut it open and I had it sitting there on the table as I was putting the cake together um so to make this green I use electric green I used a warm brown and I also use a little bit of golden yellow which is like a brown yellow so I'm going to just slide my cake out of the way here so they need a lot of space to roll out my avocado colored skin so to get this color right here for the skin I mix together moss-green i mix together chocolate brown fondant and I added a little bit of black and a little bit of copper because avocados actually have kind of like some red undertones to them in the skin so with colors with kind of off colors like this it's really helpful to like I said have the actual objects on the table when you're mixing the color and it's also helpful to combine a lot of colors together there's not really like once that color for what an avocado skin would be so you guys can see that this is really nice and stretchy if you've seen me work with fondant before you know that I always say that I microwaved my fondant before I start kneading it just so it's nice and soft and I have some shortening on my hands and I'm using that to knead this till it's nice and smooth so once it looks pretty stretchy which it does I'm going to get it ready to roll out so I'll gather all of my kind of creases to the back now get a nice clean top the great thing about this designer here is that avocado skin is by no means smooth that's completely scratching and crazy-looking right so if there are some dents to be able to this totally know the deal and I racked my brain right trying to figure out how I was going to texture this fondant to make it look like an avocado skin and I came up with a little technique that I'm super excited about it actually uses corn kernels that are inside a little plastic bag so stay tuned for that feel cool so have some corn starch on my table I'll grab my PVC pipe just going to start rolling this app go from side to side guys don't forget to share this video on your Facebook page share it with a friend to is totally into baking share it with someone who loves avocados I don't know anyone else that has made a gigantic avocado cake so I was pretty pretty pumped when I made this cake Kayla wants to know what you use to make the pet Kayla Kaitlyn I owe Kaitlyn a great question so yeah we'll get to the pit the pit is actually a six inch apt sphere cake so I just use my half handling my six inch balls and to make the pay so I was just popping some air bubbles on my fondant like I said probably really wouldn't even matter because their air bubbles in the fondant once they're textured on top about it or not even really on to see it but and I'll keep putting my hands under here moving this around just make sure it's not sticking trying to roll in all directions here okay so this definitely looks wide enough I'm gonna make this a little bit smaller or think we can going to tighter shot here on this fondant rolling so I'll just roll from the center out and then around back another direction and if I see any big like rolling pin marks I can kind of pop them out with the rolling pin okay so I'm not too worried about this being like a super even thickness because any irregularities are just kind of going to add to the natural look of this whole thing right so let's see here I'll roll my fondant up on my rolling pin if there's a ton of cornstarch I'll just brush that off if I roll it just cuz I don't want any barrier between my fondant in my cake because I want to stick in place right all right so I'll grab my draw go check avocado and uh it's pretty humid so you know what this this ganache is already pretty sticky but I'll just give it a really quick mist with simple syrup and you guys will see on the base of this avocado before I flip it back over this is a piece of foam core board the bottom quarter of this cake is solid bright cereal treat so I layered it together like a normal cake buttercream cake buttercream cake but the bottom layer is for a cereal treat that's because the shape of this cake requires a really good sturdy base so out of rice cereal and then I have flown or and this is not sticky because I'm going to cut this piece of fondant away right all right so I'll pull this little closer to me and then starting with the fondant right at the bottom of the avocado I'm going to start rolling this on up and over first thing I want to do is smooth my front part a shape like this is pretty easy to cover because there aren't really any sharp corners or anything like that so I'll just move it over with my hands I'll get rid of this crease right here smooth that down and I'll just do the same thing all the way around so guys like I said if you're curious about how I arrived at this shape prior to covering it in fondant and all that check out my Instagram at base by Dan because I have all your guys's backs I got had you guys in mind I figured it would probably one in two high-carb the cake so it's all on my Instagram story when I was carving and ganache seeing this cake earlier today I put in my Instagram story along with some instructions so if you're curious on how I did it and you'd like to attempt it just head over to instagram @ face idea and you can check it out you can see that covered pretty easily and I want this bottom edge to be pushed in and attached to the cake pretty nicely because I want it to attach to I want this skin color to attach to that flesh that light green right so just for one quick smooth before I move on I'm taking some of this extra fondant I'll need it to get rid of those dry corn starchy bits and then I'll just give a little smooth but I'm really going to be rocking this up in a second anyway so this may not matter but I don't know if the cake designer and me that can't let me cover a cake and not at least give a little bit so now I need to expose this base this piece of foam core so I'm just going to start just by cutting the fondant away just until I can see that foam core and then I'm going to lay my knife so it's flat on the foam core and just use the foam core board as a guide keeping my knife pretty level as I just turn it around so now I still have a nice solid base for my avocado cake to sit on which is really important whenever you're doing a sculpted cake like this where all of this cake is tapering out and it's sitting on just a little you know little piece this is probably like I don't know a sixth of the entire base of the cake you want to make sure that your cakes are nice and solid so ganache really also helps with that because ganache is solid or in temperature so I'll grab my sculpting tool and now I'm going to do is just use the sculpting tool actually maybe first before I do that I'll just use my fondant smoother and just use the sharp end of the fondant smoother to really start to just push that fondant in because I want a nice solid feel like good contact with this fondant to the edge of the sink so now that I've gone around with my fondant smoother I'll just use my sculpting tool and I'm just pushing this skin colored fondant the avocado skin fondant into the side of the cake as I just turn it around so if you guys are just joining we are coming up on one of my favorite parts of this technique and that is the texturing technique of the avocado I was nearly jumping up and down when I figure this out because I was so excited it's always so cool when you come up with a new technique even add to your cake decorating repertoire so all right so now what I'll do is grab my craft knife again mmm and I'm just going to cut about like the quarter of a half an inch away from the cake away from the edge of the cake and then I'm not going to cut the fondant away until I flip the cake back over one more time so I'll cut this away and now I'm going to grab my very high-end avocado skin texturing tools which is just some corn kernels in a plastic bag and just by pushing these corn kernels into the fondant with a good amount of pressure it makes this really awesome texture maybe since I have two of them I can do like two sides at a time double time air and so guys like I said I did a ton of research on avocados as I was putting this cake together because whenever I make a food cake I want it to be as realistic as possible and I know that I love avocados and everyone that I know loves avocados but I was really surprised to hear that the United States alone grows like 200,000 tons right 200,000 tons of avocados every single year and not surprisingly the majority of those come from California not Pennsylvania but it's a heck of a lot of avocados so you'll see here I'm taking these corn kernels in this sandwich baggie and just pressing it into the cake and the cool thing about using something organic and natural like this to texture cake in fact every time I press into the cave is going to look completely different like it's not going to it's not going to give me the same texture you know at each turn so when I first tried this I used rice but the rice was just too fine and the texture that it made was just almost like too fine and delicate for something this size I think that a corn works a whole lot better but if you guys have a cool idea of how I could texture this cake you know let me know in the comments below buttons I'm not too proud to hear other people's ideas so I'll go around there's just a few more times when I made this original cake I probably spent about a good ten minutes of texturing it but I won't put you guys through all that alright so the next thing I want to do is just add kind of these pinchy pinchy like veiny things that you see in an avocado I don't really know how to describe it I guess you would just call them like scars I don't know like scanners like imperfections so to do that all really going to do is just pinch the fondant together and run my fingers around it I noticed these like I said as I was you know getting a friendly with avocados checking them out so I'll use my sculpting tool here to can also if I want to make any like deeper marks I can use my sculpting tool for that so I'm pretty happy with the color of this but once the entire cake is done I'm going to hit it with some airbrush I really like to airbrush food cakes whenever I can because the really subtle like color variations that you can get with an airbrush really brings food cakes to life whenever you spend time texturing a cake like this when you then airbrush that cake all of the texture really comes to life and that's what really kind of brings the design over the top and makes it look super realistic I think so let's just do it one more right here cool so I'm about to my core in one more time if you guys are just joining in this my patented avocado texturing technique is corn kernel inside the family's bag press it into the fondant you have yourself some avocado texture so let's go out in here but what about that look I'll just push the air bubble wrap Claudia wants to know what cyber take your even today Claudia this is a yellow butter cake I wanted to use butter cake so that was nice and solid so that you know stay together really well and then I filled it with a lime buttercream it's an American buttercream but it has some lime juice and some lime zest okay so now to flip this cake over I'm going to grab my base again right I'm going to put the base right on the center of the cake make sure my hands are nice and dry I'll pet myself up a little bit before I do this it's like you're in the gym you're up to you like something really crazy right awesome so now if I did my work well which it looks like I did you should see that we have a nice solid connection there between that lime green flesh color you know skin avocado flesh and the skin or the meat of the avocado I wasn't quite sure what terminology to use and I was talking about the skin versus of you know flesh and all that so but there are actual names so before I cut this I'm just going to use my hands and just really gently kind of gather just spun it up the sides and then I'll use my knife and I'll just cut it away so I'll use the palm of my hand just to smooth this fondant in and because I put piping gel on the very cut edge of this lime green part right here it's nice and smooth so I'll grab out a sharp paring knife and I'm just going to really gently cut into the fondant and then use the top green part I just want to use this top green part right here and my knife just to cut this skin away and I'll just rotate the cake probably like every quarter turn so guys if you're loving this video share it with your friends who are into begging or into cakes share with your friends that are avocado lovers share it with everybody now and if you have any questions about what I'm doing or questions about baking whatever you guys want to know just hit me in the comments below be happy to answer them if you guys have a sculpted cake picture that you'd like to share I love checking out other people's projects so share your photo bolon we can all check it out awesome alright so if my edge looks a little rough from cutting all I have to do is just push that in with my finger right don't get rid of that rough edge but I kind of like how it looks because I think it looks really natural right because when you cut an avocado in half it you know certainly doesn't always look like you know you cut it apart with I don't know princess floss or something so potentially something I made up but it makes sense right so I'll just smooth this down with my hands and so the next thing that I have to do is add my pick so I'm going to grab my turntable so it's easy to move this cake around I'll put the cake up on the turntable what of you guys might be wondering why this finished avocado cake is sitting on a pink base it's just simply because I thought to see pink would look really great with the avocado because pink and you know lime green or complementary colors but I'm not too sure about how I feel about the pink myself but we'll see so let me grab my avocado pit here and I made this avocado pit by taking all of the carvings from this cake this was two quarter sheet cakes I took all of the carvings mix them up with you know spatulas and buttercream basically made cake top men and then put that all in a six-inch cast fear pan and I got this I covered in brown fondant and I painted it with a little bit of ivory food coloring and vodka to give it that the textured look and I have a completely awesome technique that I'm going to show you guys to add that look of gosh on what you would call it like when you cut an avocado in half right and you see the pit the pit always has some of the flesh from the other side on it right so the way to get that flesh or that you know chunky little bit that you'll see on the finished cake right here is to actually just take some of the same green fondant that we used to make the top of the cake give a little bit of need with our fingers I'm going to add a little bit of water to it just straight water and then using you know a spoon or a palette knife or whatever we're just going to mix the two together until it's nice and chunky doesn't have to be smooth because you know usually avocados or avocado flesh on the inside because in smooths we'll just make it license nice and spreading nice and chunky like this some people do this to fix cracks in their cake if you have a crack and your fondant you can thin the fondant down like this but I was trying to think of a final detail to add to my avocado cake and I was like oh I need to add some of this green green fleshy bit to the tip and this is why I came up with so I have a pastry brush right just bumping into the light no big deal guys don't be alarmed so I'll load this onto a pastry brush and basically I'll going to do is just brush it on adds just a little bit more water just because it's a little super sticky but you guys can see this is totally already starting look like an avocado with just a little bit more texturing and some airbrush we're going to be set awesome so yeah I just want these like chunky chunky pieces brush a little before right here it's like my main spot right there all right one more spot and then guys I'm about to bring out the airbrush because like I said I don't think any salted food cake is complete without a little bit of airbrushing so so far I think this looks pretty sweet I'm a pralaya I'm really happy with it get rid of this little bit of water right here if you guys are just joining we still have a couple more cool steps to finish up this avocado cake make sure to check out my facebook at baked by Dan check out my instagram at base pride and i have a full full lineup on my instagram story of how I got to this shape and how I sculpted this cake down you guys can check it out and once this cake is finished I'm going to be cutting into it so you're just going to want to stick around for that so to airbrush my cake I'm going to use a little bit of black a little bit of brown and then a little bit of lime green which fittingly is actually going on color green so I'm going to plug in my airbrush a little bit loud you know don't be startled this and I'm gonna shake up my airbrush color a little bit of green and then I'm just going to airbrush very gently the side of the cake I'm just aiming for the very side just want to add a little bit of green color precisely it's important to keep your cake moving whenever you're airbrushing it because you don't want any of those really solid color spots so my airbrush keeps moving and my cake [Music] and now of the take just the very edge where the skin meet the avocado flesh I'll make some sauces hold it darker our Coty's are never you know perfectly well color maybe I'll hit the core just a little bit and now I'm just going to grab my black I'll leave a little bit of the green that's in there a couple drops black and a couple drops of brown and I'm just going to use these just to highlight some of these cuts or some of these texture marks [Music] just for some color variation in the skin [Music] I'll hit the bottom of the cake a little bit added look of shadow and just some drama to that I'll make sure I attach the little pinched bits that I added there so now going with a bit more Brown and I'll add just a couple of those signature brown spots that are in the green and this cake will be good to go right just cleaning out that little folder [Music] I'm always bummed out when I cut into an avocado and I'm like so pumped to eat it and it has a brown sauce but I'm looking for a realism here so but I got and there we go sculpted avocado paint from base began sweet now I have two ginormous avocado cakes I don't know what went up to have some friends over and have like a China Mikado cake party if you guys have any questions leave them down in the comments below but we're going to cut this cake don't you worry so since I've been working on this one it's probably nice and soft let's cut this one right here actually before I forget guys I'm missing one of the best parts we have to add this little stem you know to the top of the cake I just saw it on here you can have an avocado without a little without a little stem on top right I like to call it the bellybutton of the avocado I'm sure that's not a technical name you can call it whatever you want but what I'm going to do to make the little nub of the avocado is a little stem is just take some of my leftover Brown the same Brown that I used for the pit I almost call it the core I'll just roll it into a little ball push that in place and then I'll take my ball tool and just give a little bit of shape just like that it's those small details that make such a difference I think whenever you're creating a food cake so camera girl thanks for reminding me about that so what do you guys think two gigantic sculpted avocado cakes what I love about these cakes is how different they are I mean them using the same process but they both look pretty different if you guys are curious if you didn't see when I was texturing the cake I use this really cool texturing technique I took some unpopped corn kernels in a sandwich bag and I just pressed those corn kernels into the cake totally cool technique it gives you a really realistic avocado texture so the moment everyone's been waiting for people may not believe that this is the real cake but I assure you guys it is so let's cut it open so I have a knife right here let's just get a nice big meaty slice right straight down in the back so i frosted this cake with ganache because i really like using ganache for sculpted cakes because it's nice and solid but you could use buttercream you were just have to make sure your cakes stay nice and cold while you were working on it check that out yellow buttermilk cake filled with some lime buttercream if you want to make lime buttercream you can just use your favorite American buttercream recipe use fresh lime juice for whatever liquid you were put in the buttercream and if you feel so inclined you can put a little bit of lime zest in there it's delicious it's refreshing it has a nice little zing that contrasts against the sweetness of the cake really nicely so check it out lime buttercream super easy to make there you go guys because we're wrapping this up don't forget to check out my facebook page at Bates right and check me out on Instagram API and let me know what you guys would like to see next week because I spend a lot of time thinking about all these projects to bring the guys so I love your input everybody has an awesome weekend thanks for watching I'm Dan Lang and I'll see you soon
