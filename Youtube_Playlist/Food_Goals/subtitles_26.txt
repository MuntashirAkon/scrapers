[music playing] SKYLER BOUCHARD: Who is the sugar monster? What is the sugar monster? Anyone who is obsessed with sweets, first and foremost, and just having fun. We're not just your standard bakery. SKYLER BOUCHARD: Yeah, I've never seen anything like that. ASHLEY HOLT: They're little works of art, and just loud and fun. It took me a long time before I was able to actually find my own personal style. SKYLER BOUCHARD: Where do you get the inspiration? Because I can't just think of that out of thin air, you know? My brain's a little crazy. When I did this cake, there is this beautiful, beautiful rock called an aurora crystal. It's like a magical fairy unicorn rock that you look inside. And it is just rainbows inside of this rock. And you just thought, oh my gosh, let me turn that into a cake because I can? ASHLEY HOLT: Yeah. All right, show me how this is done. Pick up a little cluster. SKYLER BOUCHARD: All right. As long as you just paint all of them a different color, then it looks like holograms. Every single one? Oh my gosh. Well, let's get started then. When did you decide to go full time with this? ASHLEY HOLT: 14 months ago. SKYLER BOUCHARD: Wow! What were you doing before this? ASHLEY HOLT: I was working as a culinary producer and food stylist. SKYLER BOUCHARD: Oh, wow, so this is really up your alley? ASHLEY HOLT: The inside of this cake is a sprinkle cake, a vanilla sprinkle cake, which is our most popular. SKYLER BOUCHARD: Oh, nice. ASHLEY HOLT: Yeah, filled with a fruity cereal pastry cream. SKYLER BOUCHARD: Oh, my god, I'm going to cry. ASHLEY HOLT: It's a very competitive industry. And it's super important for me to stay, you know, ahead of the trend and just on the forefront of people's minds. We have to put our own spin on it. So we're cutting it differently. We're using different rocks, mixing in more gold, adding in the drips. SKYLER BOUCHARD: And also I noticed, you have all these tattoos. And they are kind of food related. What inspired these? What's-- ASHLEY HOLT: Well, this is my sugar monster. SKYLER BOUCHARD: Wee, so that's the one. ASHLEY HOLT: Yeah. This sugar monster has a big pink swirly ice cream cone hair. SKYLER BOUCHARD: That's what that is. ASHLEY HOLT: Yeah. SKYLER BOUCHARD: OK, yeah ASHLEY HOLT: --jagged teeth because half of them fell out from the sugar, and holding a purple cake. SKYLER BOUCHARD: What was the first job offer you turned down because you were like, I'm doing this, and I'm doing it full time? It actually happened like five months ago. And it was going to take me away to Austin, Texas. Oh my gosh, I was going to make about $75,000 on the job. How did that feel? It felt scary a bit. But it also felt very good. I was very proud of myself. I mean, it's incredible. The clients that we've been able to have recently and just the experiences, and I would have missed out on all of that. SKYLER BOUCHARD: This is so cool. I feel like I'm a mad scientist, and I haven't even done anything. I'm just standing here watching you. So do you have any words of advice for any millennials trying to start a baking business? Find your own style. Be smart with your money. And to be completely fearless, and know that it is going to be hard before it gets easy. Yeah. Just don't give up. And then it turns into this. SKYLER BOUCHARD: It's so pretty. ASHLEY HOLT: I know. It's just beautiful. Well, I'm going to cut into this thing. SKYLER BOUCHARD: Oh, girl. You're not ready for this. SKYLER BOUCHARD: Wow! Look at that. It's as beautiful on the inside as it is on the outside. - That's how a human should be. - Yeah. --like cakes especially. Yeah. [laughs]
