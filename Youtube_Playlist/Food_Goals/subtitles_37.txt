what's up guys thanks for joining me here I'm damned Langan tonight it's all about the cake you guys can see I've got breakfast on the brain I created this entirely edible satin pancakes huge shagging pancakes the whole thing the cake a lot of fun to put together I want to show you guys just how I did it so let me get this huge pain cream cake out of the way I'll put it right here for a reference and I'll grab another cake that I've prepared this is a lemon blueberry cake or a lemon berry cake the recipe for Remy Sheratons you guys can check it out and what I did was just fill this cake with vanilla buttercream let it chill overnight and I have it on a base and connected to my base is a piece of copper tubing the copper tubing is connected to the bottom of the base copper tubing is completely food safe that's what your water runs through in your refrigerator so it's great to use for structure for cakes so to make this gigantic pancake cake first thing I have to do is roll out some tan colored or I guess batter colored fondant so I wrote up some snakes of fun and I did this ahead of time - huh expedite this process and after I rolled up snakes of fondant kind of regularly what I did was just flatten them down a little bit with my hands really simple because when we create these pancakes what we're really doing is just creating just the very edge so this huge pancake cake right here is actually cake on the inside the only solid pancake is belongeth on top so it's kinda like an optical illusion so once I have you know my my takes the fondant rolled out what I want to do is dust and very top of them and that's going to give the look that these were you know like on the grill or on the griddle whatever you call the thing to cook your pancakes on so to get this nice brown color actually just mix together some yellow food dust and some Dutch process cocoa powder so it's just like a nice natural color and I'm just brushing this in nice and heavy and then I'll use another brush to get rid of all these like little excess bits of dust that are now on the sides so if you guys are enjoying this video if your friends are into cakes and baking share this video you can check it out later share it on one of your friends walls so they could check it out and enjoy it and you guys know I love talking baking and cakes and answering all of your questions so if you have any questions about what I'm doing or questions about cakes are baking whatever you guys want to know I'll leave those questions in the in the comments below and if you are looking for the recipe for this cake this lemon berry cake it should be sharing the comments yeah sharing comments good you guys can check that out there cool so you guys can see I'm just brushing the top here with this dust another what I do is just take another kind of pastry brush and just use it to get rid of all of the excess look at my original brush back to because I want the edges to stay fairly just like light tan like I only really want this color on the very top of the tank what I'm going to do is grab my pizza cutter and I'm going to get to pancake slices out of each one of these little tubes right here so if you guys want to check out my facebook the link to my facebook is at the top of this video it's baked by day and you can also check me out on Instagram I post a lot of cool stuff there usually before I do these lives here on the Food Network Facebook page I usually have a story or my own serum that shows like in process photos of how I got the cake ready so follow me on Facebook and Instagram you know since I'm Ganesha alright so I'll take my cake and I'll decide which is my front I think this is my front because I like where the syrup bottles going to be here with where this copper tube is so what I'll do is take out my first piece my first piece of fondant and I'm basically just going to wrap it around and I want that light colored side facing out and then I'll just stretch the two pieces to meet in the back and kind of push them together with my hands I'll bring all of the seams to the very back of the cake and then I'll cover them up with some syrup drips so you really won't even see them once the whole thing is put together so we'll do that again so I also think it was pretty advantageous to to roll this fondant out ahead of time because it kind of set up a little bit by it's pretty warm here today in Pennsylvania actually so fondant is sweating it's really soft cakes or soft so I'm just taking a sharp paring knife right here and I'll just cut the edge flat and then I'll just push these two edges together and I do want to try and keep some space in between them I don't want all the pancakes to sit perfectly flat on top of each other because let's not help antiques rolls so you know so I'll just make sure this is nice and adhered to the cake and the buttercream is pretty sticky so I don't need to you know really like what's this fondant but if the fun that wasn't sticking I would just read it with a little bit of water so let me take you back down here that's how the first two pancakes go and I'll just show you again how I got this color so I'll take one of my ivory colored pieces of fondant and I'm just dusting the very top with my mixture of cocoa and yellow food coloring so if you guys are just joining we are creating this epic sack of blueberry pancakes that are being covered with a gravity-defying drizzle of syrup it's pretty cool it's pretty sweet cake literally and inside the cake is a lemon blueberry layer cake so unless I forget um I'll cut into the cake you guys can see what it looks like alright so dusting the top here just to get that color that look as if these pancakes were really cooked on the grill and then just getting rid of that extra dust to keep my keep the side of my pancakes ice and just ivory-colored and I'll grab my pizza cutter cut it straight down the middle so if you guys create cakes yourself if you're a cake artist we'd love to check out some photos of what you've created so share pictures in the comments below if you guys have any of them if you have an idea for a really sweet cake for next time something else you would like to see in one of our broadcasts let me know in the comments so I decided to make blueberry pancakes because blueberry pancakes are my favorite I pretty much love anything blueberry like blueberry pancakes or blueberry muffins totally my jam but you certainly could use whatever kind of fruit you want for this guys let me know in the comments below what your favorite pancake accompaniment is alright so you guys can see this does take a little bit of time and another detail that I like to add are these kind of air bubbles like these little imperfections on the side of the pancake so pancakes in Baker's terms would be considered like a quick bread because they get their leavening from usually baking powder maybe Basin soda but basically they cook from the heat of the pan right so there's always these cool about air bubbles in them on the sides because a basically cake so I'm just using a ball tool and a Dresden tools what it's called a little sculpting tool just to put some little holes and things on the sides looks a little more realistic I think you can also kind of drag a line sideways so if you guys would follow my work you'll know that I'm totally into these gigantic food cakes certainly my Jam's though last week we created a huge avocado it was pretty cool they were like alright so let me go here again I'll grab another circle my fondant that I've dusted with cocoa powder so you get the top nice and brown nice and like griddle Brown and I'll just stretch the strip around so the two ends meet in the back and I'll just kind of pinch those little ends together my focus is really the front so this is the front here so I just want to make sure that each pancake is meeting up with the pancake shirt below it good looks good right going for another one so tonight I'm using marshmallow fondant a lot of people ask me would take a fun that I like to use and usually I make my own fondant just because I use so much fun and it's easier to make it it's also cheaper so if you guys are looking for a really cool fondant recipe just search online marshmallow fondant it's pretty easy to work with it tastes really good because it's basically 50% marshmallow sauce if you like marshmallows you'll like marshmallow fondant and whenever I'm kneading my fondant or rolling my fondant out I like to use a little bit of vegetable shortening my hands to kind of add a little more moisture a little more flexibility to define it keeps it from cracking awesome starting to like a stack of pancakes all right so let's bring it back here I'll show you guys again you guys are just joining how I'm getting this color so I've rolled out some ivory colored fondant about 24 inches long because I needed to sit around my 8 inch cake so 24 inches plus a little bit of stretch kind of gets me where I need to be so after I roll up my fondant strip I have some cocoa powder that I've mixed with just a little bit of yellow petal dust on my paintbrush here and I'm just painting on the very top of this shirt and then I'm going to cut this shirt in half so to create this pancake cake you guys will see in just a few moments to get the gravity-defying effect it's holding my little syrup cup I actually just used quarter inch copper pipe or copper tubing you can find it at any hardware store it's completely food safe because it's what your water runs through in your house you like in your plumbing and it's pretty sturdy it's easy to shape so it's great for Kate structure but it can hold a good amount of weight so good stuff to use if you're into building like grab you find okay all right so after have the top of this stripped off did I'll just cut in half doesn't have to be perfect the more variation that is in this strip the more variation I'll get in with in cakes right so I'll just pick this up bring around you have any questions so far now the questions the questions to start and show me operator all right so get these strips to meet in the back push them together whenever you're wrapping fondant around a cake there's always a good bit of stretch so like I said I kind of just take the sides of the cake this is an 8 inch cake multiply it by 3 get 24 inches and then 24 inches plus a little bit stretch gets me completely around my cake so it looks like just about two more will get us all the way around so before I move on I'll go back to what I was doing earlier here I'm just using a ball tool just to make little air bubbles in my pancake because the size of pancakes always have those little fluffy little bubbles on greatly bubbles quick tip if you guys are big pancake lovers like I am if you have you know a favorite pancake recipe and you're looking to kick it up a notch next time you make your pancakes separate your eggs add the egg yolks to the pancake batter as normal and then whip the egg white so it's just a touch of sugar so like a medium peak and then fold those egg whites into your batter your pancakes will be fluffier and because I've ever dreamed super easy step takes just a couple more minutes and it really just kicks your pancakes up a notch so try not next time so if you guys are just joining I'm Dan Lang and I'm from baked by day and you can check out my facebook page at the top of this you can also check me out on instagram at baked by Dan if you're really into these cool cake creations share this video leave any questions you guys may have in the comments below and if you're looking for the recipe for you take them using tonight it is a lemon berry cake since I'm making blueberry pancakes you can find that recipe pinned at the top of the comments so I'm just wrapping you strips of fondant around the cake my cake is nice and cold its frosted with buttercream but you guys know I really like in Osh juice so ganache would work for this pretty much anything solid I or anything to get some solid on in the in the refrigerator so sometimes it's helpful to use a sculpting tool to kind of push the edges of the fondant together if they're not really like meeting up but like I said this is kind of the back of the cake and I can cover this up with some syrup drips just like you have here so I'm not too worried about it all right so it looks like just one more strip should finish this up so let's see let's get this final trick we'll finish it up I think we're good I think we're golden just like these pancakes all right so in butter creams are getting soft cash so that's basically the making of a huge stack of pancakes pretty cool huh so just a few final details here before I put my top pancake on just a couple of air bubbles a little bit of texture here to make these look like they're nice and fluffy like they just came off the griddle right sweet so if you guys want to get notifications or find out ahead of time when we are doing these live tape broadcasts you can first off make sure that you like and subscribe to the food our Facebook page check out my facebook page 8 by dan and check me out on instagram at 8:10 because i always put something my story as i'm preparing for these cakes so you'll kind of get a little hand up listen tell me on my Instagram alright so I'm just going to clear my workspace and I just want to dust away all of this all this cocoa powder just won't get any cocoa powder on my top pancake as I'm rolling it out alright so Roman town pancakes super unique all going to do is take piece of fondant same color that I used to make all of my strips make sure these are all nice and attached awesome and before I even go to roll this out to take the fondant I'll kind of give it like a little pinch see if I'm going to get an 8 inch circle out of it looks a little small I'm going to add just a little more on to it I'll give this a nice meet whatever you guys are rolling fondant always want to be nice and stretchy see how this stretches like taffy or Bubblegum's not ripping not as important for rolling on a huge pancake but if I were going to be covering a cake in fondant and I needed it to be nice and flexible you stretch to the fondant will be really important so giving this a nice roll and then kind of like shaping a little bread loaf I'm just going to tuck all the fondant under to get rid of any creases or anything like that and then grab my cornstarch get a good bit of cornstarch on my table a little bit on top and I'm switching it up tonight I'm using the good old fashioned wooden rolling pin as opposed to my PVC pipe so I want this to stay really circular so every two or three turns I'm going to turn it just like an eighth of the way not even a quarter turn just a little turn it stays nice and circular and I want my top pancake to be really thick and really hearty looking since it's a great timing so I want to roll this too thin I'll stop in just a moment and check the measurement of it so you have a little air bubble not a deal I suppose a pancake would have air bubbles in it anyway right but the cake decorator and you can't not pop an air bubble when I see it on top of my cake all right so I'll grab my a cool thing over here and awesome I'm actually eight nine inches so eight inches on my cake or less the border of all my other pancakes should be perfect look at this just a few more rolls alright so now I'm going to do is just keep my sculpting tool and fine but I think looks like the center of the pancake and I'll make a little hole just as a guide for myself because what I need to do is fish this pancake over top of this one because you guys can see in this cake there's a pancake on top right so that's how I got it on there just guiding this over and I'll just stretch it into place oh yeah the crowning glory if any parts are too short a big deal I'll just stretch a little bit awesome right nice butter cream off my hands so the same deal I'll just add a little bit of texture to this since this is the final top pancake couple of air bubbles so this will seem or a little mark at the top is going to be completely covered by our syrup in just a moment so same deal I'll go back with my cocoa and I'll use nice like circular buffing motions to add some color to the top of this and then to add some real like char grill marks not charred gosh you would never want a pancake to be charged but to add some real color marks to the pancake I'm going to get my little creme brulee torch and hit just the top and sides of this cake for even more out color totally not necessary to use a creme brulee torch but anytime I can pull the torch out and kitchen I'm always down to do it so I figured that'd be a cool little effect for tonight alright so just taking this just to the very edge and all of this cocoa powder I'm going to have to brush away before I move on so if you guys are just joining right now I am dusting fondant to create the look of a pancake because we're making a gigantic stack of pancakes and of cake but the inside is a made of pancakes inside is made of a lemon blueberry cake and you can get that recipe at the top of the video all right so now away from my workspace I'm just going to dust off any excess no one said this was a tidy process cool dust off any little bits from the sides and then I'll just finish by the dusting off of my board alright gosh now I can get rid of this Coco confusing me because I'm looking at pancakes going to smell chocolate alright so let's do graph to do next next i have to grab my blowtorch so you can get this thing to light there we go so I'm just going to take the blowtorch and just hit the sides of this pancake just a little bit and you'll see that it starts to like brown and bubble up it's exactly them looking for just on the very edge so it's all the sugar in the fondant that allows this carmelization happen looks like I'm running out of you team but you guys get the point there all right so let me grab my maple colors modeling chocolate and I'm actually using modeling chocolate or I used modeling chocolate rather to create all these syrup tricks just because there's a lot of piecing together that goes on and modeling chocolate is really great for kind of like being seamless or being able to have seams the kind of healed of zone so the first thing you have to do is cover my copper tube with a big piece of modeling chocolate to come into the main setup report so I'm going to roll this out fairly thin like what's gonna happen interesting and it just needs to be the length of this piece of copper tube right here and I don't need to add any type of person X Pro layer I don't need to add any type of sticky anything to this copper you'll see that just by pressing it into the tube it sticks so the molotov chocolate totally just sticks in place and then I'll just pinch it around just little by little until the edges disappear until the tube disappears rather than the edges meet up and then I'm just going to use the palms of my hands to smooth out the seam so if you don't have modeling chocolate utility could use fondant for this modeling shop it's super easy mate I have a recipe my favorite recipe for modeling chocolate on my website as well so if you head to baking with Dan comm you can find it right just pinching isn't so the edges of the modeling-chocolate are the seams are completely together and then what I'm going to try and do is just with a really light touch I can't go too heavy here because it's super warm and this stuff is super soft but I just want to use the soft parts of my fingers and like the palm of my hand to kind of smooth this out all right that could be smoother but to move on I'll show you guys to make this syrup before I just want to roll out some of this modeling chocolate pretty skin so I'll start with a circle here I'll grab some cornstarch I need a good bit of cornstarch for this sort of thing put some on top okay in just our roll a circle and then cut out like a poor shape so really a regular circle hole Oh a poor shape that I'm looking for oh good let me grab a really sharp craft knife this is actually a scalpel so when I'm decorating cakes I really like to use scalpels because they stay so sharp you can find scalpels online they're actually about the same price as a regular krabby I and they just stay so sharp that they make cutting fun and modeling chocolate like super easy it's such a dream cutting modeling chocolate or fondant with a scalpel alright so same is when I put my top pancake on I'll find kind of like a center piece here I'll have to meet the hole little bit bigger I'm just going to fish this over my piece of copper tube lay it down there get rid of this cornstarch I'll press it into place and then what I really want to do is just soften this edge my modeling chocolate is moving around a little bit so just a little bit of vegetable shortening under it will make it just sticky enough to not move quick tip there all right so as I was saying just to kind of soften this edge here make it look a little more natural like an actual sarah forms going to take my finger just soften this edge a little bit right and then now I need to hide this seam right here I want it to look really natural like syrup is actually pouring on top of the pancakes so I'll take some this modeling chocolate again on a roll a little sausage please they're round they're kind of push it down just lightly kind of just insinuate that it's still kind of pouring out and then I'll just pinch this top part up so that it meets this main pour awesome alright so now what I want to do is add my little little syrup cup I don't know what you'll call I was going to call it a pour but that's to clean up it's called little uh mm syrup carafe I guess so this is just a cylinder modeling-chocolate the same brown color as the syrup and I paneled it in a piece of white modeling chocolate and chilled it until it's nice and cool so what I'm going to do here is just plunge the little cup right on to this copper tooth here there's this solid modeling chocolate it is solid modeling chocolate okay let me just look at the front here make sure it isn't seeing anything so I'm just going to add two little bits of modeling chocolate here just to kind of further reinforce that the syrup is actually pouring out of this little thing here that will smooth awesome so back down to this cerebrate here like I said I'm just using my fingers or the soft part of my hand just to smooth this out so now what I want to do is create a few larger serif drips just like here and don't forget I'll get to that handle in just a second that's kind of one of the last things I want to put on but to make some of these characters I'm going to take more modeling chocolate I'll just roll it until it's smooth and I want to roll a teardrop shape so I want to kind of get rid of any extra cornstarch here because I don't really want a lot of cornstarch on this otherwise it's not going to stick to the cake and that's not cool all right so teardrop shape rounded at the bottom cut one inch flat you can I'll attach this right here so to do this I'm just going to pinch one end so it's kind of flat attach it there and just press it into place and I'll flatten out the top because if it's dripping it'd be kind of flat here but then I'll try and meet the side nice and rounded right saj that seam out with my finger and I'm going to be brushing this modeling-chocolate with with vegetable oil or like cooking spray to make it nice and shiny so since the modeling chocolate is fact-based it really likes to be brushed risk vegetable oil get nice and shiny because less oil to that and that's what modeling chocolate we now know it's the only way I could describe it there are many ways to make modeling chocolate and fondant shiny brushing it with cooking spray is one of the easiest so I'll do one more drip on here and you get this a more of this brown we're in Lemongrab not looking chocolate not sure where that got you okay so in the meantime what I have to do to finish up my stack of pancakes is make some blueberries after all these are blueberry pancakes so to make my blueberries have some dark navy color fondant and I added a little bit of tylose powder to this just to stiffen it up to get this color I mixed together black purple and some navy blue and to turn them into blueberries there's a turn the spine in the blueberries basically I'm just going to knead it until it's nice and soft and then roll it it will fall in my hands to get rid of any of the scenes set the time for just deciding I'm going to grab a little star cutter just to add like a little 5-point indentation to the top and then I'll grab my little ball tool and I'm going to press it into the center and then kind of pull it out up in a few spots and then pinch it back together I think that looks pretty pretty blueberry like alright so I'll show you guys that again taking a little bit of this navy blue or blue berry colored fondant rolling into a nice smooth ball hit it with a little Equinix star just to make it look like a little you know where they came off the stem and then rough it off just a little bit with my ball tool place that right there alright so let's add one more of the syrup turkic-speaking i think these are really soft stuff to make my syrup colored modeling-chocolate super-easy a little bit of golden yellow a touch of copper and then some Brown gives you this awesome set up color so a lot of times I've seen pancake cakes where people use actual syrup that's cool but I think it's a little too like thin and seeker I really like how this how the modeling chocolate looks that's why I decide to go with Molly chocolate writing so a pull top nice and thin so that I can blend it into my top syrup piece right here wait all right so to finish up my little lass a little syrup pour here that's when I add a little handle so really simple I'm just going to take a little piece of white fondant flatten it down a little bit get some cornstarch to show that it's not sticky and this case is about to come together if you guys are just joining you're seeing the final crowning jewelry the final few moments of this huge stack of blueberry pancakes come together so make a little handle just going to see if this works perfect cut a little strip of white modeling chocolate it's a little bit thinner and I'm going to attach this to my setup Cup at the top of my cake so to do that wet that just a little bit hopefully it sticks truly hot in here so we'll see so I'll pull one end in and then pull out of there and in takes me back to my days in the ceramic studio cool pretty simple there I don't want to fidget with this too much because it's really kind of hot but there you go little handle it so now I want to make this shine I want this there to really glisten like real syrup right so I like to just take a regular old cooking spray spray some of it into the cap grab a paintbrush I should start so organized and I'll tell you once I start working everything is just crazy alright so just by brushing some vegetable oil just on to this therap it gets really shiny I what I'm doing this I like to be really careful because obviously don't want the pancakes to be shiny I only want the CEREC to be shiny so just brush it on and this usually lasts for quite a while but oil isn't really going to absorb into the modeling chocolate too much but if it's data I would just you know we brush it before before the celebration but this cake isn't for a party both of these pancake cakes or are just for me so lucky you lucky me right so I'm just brushing this here for the special oil to get nice and shiny nice and set up like get this little guy right here in the back so I think the best part about this cake is that well number one it's it's so huge and then it looks like a huge stack of blueberry pancakes but it actually is a blueberry cake on the inside so you should really can't get cake for breakfast drink I cake for breakfast sometimes anyway so okay alright so let's finish this up I have some big ol Pat's of butter here super easy all I did was take some really like yellow modeling chocolate and come into squares and just round the edges just a little bit so let's see where's my front this is microphone X that's a big Pat's of butter and I'll start with some blueberries so whenever you're placing stuff on a cake it's good to kind of place it in late groups of three because things look good in groups of three so three or five or you know maybe even one would be good so you know put one down here in the front another one right there so really quickly I'll show you guys one more time how you eat blueberries a little bit of my navy color fondant give a little need so it's nice and soft so I can roll it into a circle I'll roll it into a little sphere I'm gonna set a square different a square take a little five-pointed star cutter giving the look of the top stem part of the blueberry and then I'll pinch it back together just a little bit there we go put that one on side and I'll put a few more on the top why not there you go so that's how I like to make a huge cake that looks like a stack of blueberry pancakes I'm going to cut into this I'll show you guys exactly what it looks like on the inside I also have one I'm not going to cut into let me grab a nice sharp knife and a plate and a little paper towel because of any final questions leave your questions in the comments below don't
