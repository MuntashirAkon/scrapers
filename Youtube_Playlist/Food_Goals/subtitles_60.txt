hey guys what's up I'm Dan lying in your favorite cake daiquiri or at least lame itself and it's Friday night next weekend is Memorial Day which here on the East Coast equals the unofficial start of summer so that means I'll be the beach and I'll be grilling so I wanted to make this awesome light-up grill cake I made this cake last year for a 21st birthday it was really popular on social media so I figured I'd show you guys how I make it cool as far as this cake I think is that actually lights up in the middle so if you want to get a quick shot of that while I'm getting my second cake set up I'll show you guys all the steps it takes to make this cake so they're actually some little LED lights that are made for cake decorating and the center of the cake and makes it you know look lit up like embers which I think it's really cool so to make this cake first thing I have to do is start with a short cake here and cover it in black fondant I already did just in the interest of time so I have to roll out a strip of black fondant place around the top of shape let me just move this out of the way and I'll grab some one side and some black fondant so if you guys have watched me before here on Food Network on the free to our Facebook page you guys know that I love talking baking and cakes and answering your questions hopefully our questions pop up today sometimes you have some issues with them so if they don't get to answer your questions I apologize but try and speculate waiting so right here I have some black fondant and I just to go with black just because my girl is black so I figured it'd be a pretty cool color and then it highlights all the color food on top of the cake you'll see my fondant here is nice and stretchy it's actually not too hard to get at this consistency right now because it's been about 90 degrees right now in Pennsylvania for the past few days so we're like Miss heatwaves so fondant and buttercream and all of those things are super soft so what I'm doing here is just getting this fondant ready to roll out a strip to place down on the top part of my crib so if you guys have ever created a a barbecue cake you know grill cake something to get ready for Memorial Day or convening in the summer we'd love to check out your photos I love seeing all the stuff you guys create so in the comments below share a picture of what you made so everybody can do it and if you want to check out my facebook page you can find me on Facebook at Bayside and you can also find me on Instagram I have a pretty cool Instagram story no update all day as I was working on this barbeque cake so if you guys kind of want to see some in process shop you can check them out on Instagram or you can just get really comfortable right now and I'm not going where because so follow me through and I'll show you how I'm getting ready for Memorial Day all right so I'm rolling my fondant out hopefully about 30 inches long I have 30 inches marked on my table so see here my cake is a 10 inch cake so 30 into 30 inches or a little over 30 inches shoot me all the way around my page so I'm just using my finest wheeler to smooth it out I'll grab what's called a ribbon cutter and I'm just going to cut an even strip of black fondant out of here and I want to save all this glass on it and use it to make all of the charcoal briquets my barbecue inside here all right so now what I have to do is flip my take over I don't even have to wet this tape because the humidity in the air is making some condensation take already so I'm going to place a cake drum or just a stack of cake circles top of my cake flip it over no matter how many times I do that my heart always tough for a second every time and the reason that I'm flipping my cake over very simply is just because I need a rim of fondant around the top of my cake and I think it's much easier to do when my cake is upside down so I'm just going to pull this strip right up to the side of my cake and then wrap it all the way around and I'll meet the camera back here at the time and then you guys can't see this right here what I'm doing is just using the table as a guide to get a nice flat rim here and then we're these three pieces of fondant joint together what I want to do is just cut through both of them get rid of that little extra wedge and it'll grab something sticky like piping gel and use it to catch these two edges of fondant together push those together you're really strapped here but I'm going to grab my fondant smoother and then just smooth around the side of this just like I'm smoothing fondant on the cage normally a lot of people ask me what type of fun and I like to use I use whatever I have available sometimes when I'm using black fondant like this or what I'm using dark navy or or red I like to buy it just because those really dark colors are kind of hard to mix especially if you're starting with white fondant so if it's a dark color I buy it whatever whatever is available if it's a lighter color or white I really like to make marshmallows on it it's super easy to make if you search online for marshmallow fondant you will find some really great recipes and you just have to experiment as with all recipes and you know find one that works for you so here I have a 14 inch cake board I covered it with some green fondant and textured it a little bit with a clean tea towel and I'm actually going to put my cake on top of it so it looks like my grill is sitting in the grass although the grill cake that I create it for the demo I made to look like it was sitting the beach for this next week I'll be grilling a tree you know indifference so now what I have to do here is just take my cake up all right so I'm going to place the spatula on my board and then place the tape around top of the spatula looks pretty centered I'll just peel that right off and then I'll peel this board out and now I have a nice rim of fondant assuming I can get this off assuming that the condensation has it made it completely stick so if you're in an area that's really humid and finding fondant is always sticky every working out of cakes one thing you might consider doing is switching Sigyn osh ganache is really easy to work with it's great for coating cakes because it doesn't have to be refrigerated so if your cake isn't cold and it's not going to get a bunch of condensation and I'm actually not even going to worry about all of this corn searched because all of the condensation that will gather on it has got to kind of make it all disappear so onto some fun stuff you can't have a barbecue that curtiss-wright cheeseburgers it's me so I have some brown modeling-chocolate here and I'm just going to give it an E very simply until the the cracks kind of go away you need it so it gets nice and soft modeling chocolate is basically just a mixture of chocolate and corn syrup I actually have my favorite recipe for modeling chocolate on my blog which is baking with Viacom so you guys can check it out there and you can also find the recipes for the cake I use this is actually in the apology cake with chocolate and vanilla cake filled with strawberry buttercream super delicious I think it's a really nostalgic American cake and a great way to take off summer so I'm just shaping some rough cheeseburgers here out of this modeling chocolate and I say ruff because the you know the shape of nothing perfect and I'm just going to take a piece of aluminum foil that I crinkled up and just texture the sides of these burgers and then I'm going to take a mixture of piping gel vodka and a little bit of reddish brown food color and I'll paint these so that they look really juicy and meaty and you know I'll sizzling a scrumptious like they're growing up so if you're a cake decorator it's really cool to find different things around your workspace like parchment paper or a limited foil board you know whatever you have and use it to texture your fondant or your modeling chocolate so I'll place these ramasees a parklet and then I'm just going to grab this mix here that I've pre put together it's just vodka so that it dries a little bit of warm brown food color so you get that nice meaty red look and then some piping gel which adds that you know greasy kind of juicy look to these burgers and then after this dries I'll put some modeling chocolate cheese on top so I'll set these aside or set these aside for just a moment all right so before I move on to tweenie I guess the great on my grill what I have to do is roll out a long sausage of fondant that's going to fit all the way around cake good good look at that k there so we're going to be creating the shrimp I'm going to show you guys how I make the kabobs they're all made out of fondant or modeling chocolate everything is edible even the little even a little great pieces they're actually fettuccine pasta that I painted with some black food coloring so - the LED cake lights everything's edible which i think is really cool so mister only had a make a black fondant here I want to try and give this a nice and even and I want it to kind of be thickness of the height of that that that rim that I just created on my grill so people always ask what I like to use to roll my fondant up you know cornstarch or powdered sugar I prefer cornstarch but whenever I'm rolling a shape like this you'll notice that I don't let me have any powdered sugar or corn starch on my table because if I did instead of this rolling it would just kind of flop around and like turn into like a flat shrimp like a flat thing it it would really be what I was looking for some milk cornstarch gets the job done just fine so I'll cut one end flat and I'll line this end up with the previous scene that I had and I'll just carefully place this all the way around the cake so this is going to give me some height to rest my pieces of black fettuccine on sounds funny saying black fettuccine but um yeah black fettuccine that I have to make the great through my grille cut this with a nice sharp knife and then join these two pieces together so push this app just until it's rounded don't they actually make black haha they do make black pasta I believe it's a squid ink pasta yes I know that that's the thing I've actually never eaten it I don't know if I would give him the chance but they do make black pasta yeah alright so I'm just smoothing this back out and then what I'm going to do is make some charcoal briquettes because you can have a charcoal grill without charcoal briquets right so back to my black fondant really simple here these little charcoal briquettes add a lot of detail to this cake so I have some pre-prepared I'll take my fondant and all I'm really going to do is roll it into circles kind of flatten it down and then square it out and I'll paint these with some white food color so that they look kind of would actually be the word a lit I don't know burning hot hot charcoal briquettes so I'll make a few more of these and then I'm going to grab some white food color and a patient rush I'll put some of this western color into a little custard conference and a little bit goes a long way here so kind of want this to be like a dry brushed look and I'm just going to brush these no real like rhyme or reason doesn't have to be even maybe some size or white and you know some stay solid black you know for visual interest so if you guys are just joining right now I'm using some black fondant and some white food coloring to make some sharp over tests for my barbecued roll cake which I'm making in excited preparation for Memorial Day which is next weekend so this is the cake I'll be making again next so you're ready for my Memorial Day celebration because there's nothing like a crazy cake to uh to kick off the celebration especially being a stubborn so alright so now comes the really cool part my favorite part of this cake the lights alright so these little LED lights can be bought online they light up they're actually pretty bright you can see how bright they are and they're made for for cakes and decorating food obviously they aren't edible but they're not going to hurt your cake by you know placing them on top of the cake if I were making this cake for a client and like I said this cake is just for me I would advise the client that there are six LED lights in the center of the cake that are edible and then they would know to take them out but anytime you see a cake whether it's a car cake with lights that light up or fire truck or a monster tank with light-up eyes that light always comes from me little LED lights so I'll place these in the center of the cake and then what I'm going to do is take my charcoal briquettes and just start playing them around the outside it's funny when I made this cake last year for 21st birthday I really did do some research into what a charcoal grill looked like because I haven't grilled on a charcoal grill since I was you know much younger with my dad hanging out over the summer I feel like everyone uses gas through a charcoal grill makes a much cooler cake than a gas grill would for sure so I'm just going to make a couple more of these little charcoal pieces some black fondant some white food coloring if you guys are just joining I'm Dan Lyon I'm decorating this grill cake you can check out my facebook page baked by Dan we have we have the link to that right at the the top of this broadcast here and then to make these embers this part that lights up in the center what I have here is just a mixture of crushed up rock candy I have some clear some yellow and some orange and what I want to do is just make the top of these lights just a little bit sticky with some piping gel so everything kind of sticks together so I can pile up the rock candy on top and then the lights illuminate the rock candy from the underside and it looks like the grill is really lit my absolute favorite part of this cake and these lights actually stay lit for several days which is pretty cool really surprised the first time that I use them a couple years ago and they stayed lit for you know like several days so I'm just going to try and keep this rock-candy right towards the center here I'll just gradually cover these up and you can see right away is a really awesome effect that you get from the rocket can be being illuminated by the LED light you could also use coarse sugar here I guess if you had a sanding sugar you could probably set as well I'm laughing here because my my camera girl absolutely loves getting shit on cooking so it's kind of a little inside joke between us so now my grill is completely lit looks like it's ready to go all I have to do is place some rums on top now it's important that this outer edge here is about the same height as my my bro test because what I'm going to do is just place some pieces of this black set of Cheaney right across the cake and I want the fettuccine to kind of set right on the edge of the grill get rid of some of this cornstarch here and then if I need to cut any of these I can do that really easily just by pinching off the end so I'll place one and maybe like every inch or so and if it's not sticking I'll just grab a little bit of piping gel just stick that down but once I place my burgers and and sewers on top well that's going to stick with no problem so I colored these fettuccine just by mixing together some black food gel that you know I would use to color fondant word anything like that and I mixed that with some vodka and the reason I used vodka is because it wouldn't hydrate the pasta like the vodka didn't make the pasta mushy so basically I just made like black watercolor you know using the the vodka and the black food diet and after a couple coats I had these black pieces of fettuccine and they're strong enough to support the weight of the little food pieces I'll put on top because of the help of these little charcoal pieces right here look that broke good thing I have an extra so a great tip for someone like this is to always have an extra you never know if you're going to need it alright so one more here place that down just lay some burgers on top let's get this thing going give some life here so one burger there let's see I want to try and not cover up my lights in the center too much so I'll place these burgers right side by side let's make some let's make some kebab make some some skewers let's see I have some uh some ivory colored modeling chocolate here and I use it to make some uh some mushrooms where you sewers I'm actually just going to use more fettuccine as my little skewer pieces I knew that I could have just used regular Shearer's but I was going for you know the fully edible thing so more pasta it was here we go alright so it's really worn here like I said so my modeling chocolate is pretty sticky that's why it looks so shiny but normally a room-temperature modeling chocolate is really solid so you really have to like give it a good meat but today it's nice and soft alright so to make these mushrooms we just go to a row a circle cut in half this will be the top cap of my button mushroom and then I'll make the little bottom pieces of the mushrooms just a little circles flattens out here so normally for a cake like this I would have all of these little decorative pieces created like a day or two in advance just so they all had time to dry and set up and then when it came time to assemble the cake the whole thing would be a lot easier so I'll just put this on I'll let this hang out for a second it'll kind of stick together I have some little brown cubes of modeling chocolate the same modeling chocolate that I used for my hamburgers and I'll paint these with the same piping gel vodka mixture so this is the meat or the protein on my skewer you know come to think of it this uh this girl cake actually is pre protein heavy and we have two cheeseburgers probably about 25 grams protein each and then you got these skewers so this is definitely it's definitely a well-rounded nutrition cake I would say all right let me just switch my gloves out here since I have that often lon clicking gel paint on top so if you guys want to share this video please share it you'll have on your Facebook wall forever if you want to you know try making this cake and if you do make this cake by all means absolutely please share it with me on my facebook page at 8 by dan I love when I you know I get the feedback that people of use tutorials to make cakes one of my favorite parts of the gig so it make these shrimp here really simply I'm just going to roll some really elongated teardrops pinch the end of one flat and then this is going to become the shrimp tail and it just needs a little bit of texture to it so I'll grab a modeling tool and kind of fan this out that will give it some shape and I'll kind of texture the back and underside of these doesn't have to be due to too detailed I'm going to dust these with a little bit of orange petal dust so I'll do that just on a napkin so I made a huge mess here so a little bit of orange petal dust tap it on the paper towel first and go in here so I know that shrimp especially once they're well once they're cooked are much darker that like peach orange on their tails and then that the color kind of fades up so I'll darken the tail a bit and then I'll bring the color kind of unevenly up them real quick here can also airbrush these that would be really cool and a little dark so maybe I'll use this other side here and then I'll kind of curl leaf okay so let's play some shrimp on the barbecue it's gotta fix this tail a little bit so modeling chocolate pieces are always easier to put on a cake once you chill them after shaping them because they'll set up really firm and then they'll go on your tank a lot smoother [Music] so time to put together the rest of these skewers I'm gonna grab two pieces of fettuccine certainly could use actual skewers here no real reason to make you know fake skewers especially since skewers or steamers but I just wanted to try and stick with as much edible stuff as I could so really simply I just have some red spheres of modeling chocolate that are kind of like cherry tomatoes one of my favorite vegetables to put on a kabob I have some strips of yellow fondant that I cut and textured to look like yellow peppers so you have my mushrooms here place those on there and then I'll go in with piece of beef prime cut of modeling chocolate beef right there a little slice of zucchini or summer squash whatever whatever you want to call it sometimes called cornea there you go in UK right mm-hmm Gareth is not okay don't quote me on that if you have any viewers from from the aforementioned places where they call summer squash what was that clear that right guys come let us know in the comments below and the next to this broadcast I'll check it out and I have learned something new all right so I'm just feeding these over the pieces of pasta and then whatever fun had gathered up on the edges of the pasta from the you know from the action of putting these on I'll just kind of clean that off I'll see which side looks best I kind of like that side here I'll shorten this a little bit so final touches going on here before I guess this whole thing together and you're going to grab a pastry brush just use that to dust off any of the less bits of this cornstarch great and like I said my favorite part of this cake is definitely the light up embers in the center so I really want to highlight those as part of the design and not cover them up so I'll place these just towards the edge here a little bit of cheese and you will be good to go so ningke's change my gloves again I don't get a bunch of colored dust on my modeling chocolate cheese I'll give this a good need I'll roll it out cut it out of the cutter and this cake will be good to go little dusting of cornstarch on top I really was going back and forth right away our cheddar cheese or this is white American look good go steal the white American cheese for my burgers so that's what I decided to go for it okay all right so I'll grab a square cutter once way too I'll make some hot corner slices to just make it look like one of these burgers has a heck of a lot of cheat line all right so I'll put that down there and I'll kind of pinch the edges of these slices so it looks like they're melting down hey other side nice place machines again so that's my version of a barbecue grill cake let's put the two side-by-side I have this barbecue grill right here on top of what I got some credible clicks in the yard you know just hanging out in the yard getting ready for Memorial Day and then I have this barbecue grill cake that is sitting in some sand on the beach because that's what I'll be doing next week at the beach grilling so I hope you guys enjoy seeing out and creating BBQ cakes you have any questions let me know in the comments below to my best answer the ones that I can see you guys next Friday night don't forget to check me out on Facebook at Beach High
