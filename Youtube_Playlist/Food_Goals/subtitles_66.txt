what is up guys happy Friday I'm Dan Lang and I'm here to show you guys a really awesome sculpted cake project so when fronting I have this huge half sheet cake and it's been really warm and sunny here in Pennsylvania so I've totally been feeling the summer vibes lately so I figured I'm just going to skip spring entirely and I wanted to make a ice cream cake so a huge sculpted ice cream popsicle pop possible ice cream whatever you want to call it so you guys will see right here I have a huge half sheet cake let's check this cheap cake out I have a huge half sheet cake did I uh filled in France with buttercream it all I did was round off the edges with you know a knife gave the entire thing a nice buttercream coat with the help of my bowl scraper right here and whenever I'm eating an ice cream pop or popsicle there's always a huge bite at it because I don't mess around it comes to ice cream so I want to make a big bite out of this ice cream so what I'm doing here is taking a 7 inch pastry ring my cake is nice and cold so this is cutting super easily before I cut this let me just pop some gloves on this project is so much fun to put together this big ice cream pop is one of my favorite cakes and last week we made a huge lemon slice and a lot of people actually made the cake and shared it which was really cool to see so if you guys make this cake screaming you know attempt it definitely share it let me know so I'm just going to clean these crumbs up a little bit and I have some buttercream and what I'm going to do is just give this like a little crumb coat it doesn't need to be super stick with icing or anything because we're just going to cover it in fondant so I have some buttercream here this is just Swiss buttercream it's nice and soft and I'll just give this little crumb coat just my fondant sticks so if you guys are into all of this cake design and like cool custom cakes and sculpted cakes and stuff definitely check out my Facebook page which we have linked to at the top of this video it's baked by Dan on Facebook and if you do Instagram check me out on instagram at baked by Dan so hopefully we got some questions rolling in I love answering your baking and pastry questions or cake baking questions so if you guys have a question leave your question in the comments below and I don't forget to share this post with any of your friends you think would enjoy it cool so just a really quick little buttercream coat like that grab my little paper towels get rid of these crumbs so now I have to roll out some fondant right so tonight I'm using marshmallow fondant and it's just a recipe that I make if you've never worked with marshmallow fondant before you definitely should check it out because it's super easy to work with you can use search online for marshmallow fondant recipes you'll definitely find plenty of recipes you could try out so I'll just move my cake right over here and I will grab oh so this is about five pounds of fun it looks like a lot of fondant and it certainly is but whenever you're covering a cake and fun you always want extra fondant because you want the fondant to be able to drink really easily order the cake because it makes smoothing the fun and a lot easier so I'm going to grab just a little bit of vegetable shortening through my hands here and I want to knead this stuff until it's really soft until it's almost like saltwater taffy because I want it to be nice and stretchy so that it's flexible when I drape it over my cake so if you guys have any funding questions if you with those questions below see if we can answer them so if you guys are just joining we are totally feeling the summer vibes tonight oh it's beautiful warm weather we've been having in Pennsylvania least and we are creating a huge sculpted ice cream popsicle cake I was kind of going back and forth but I call this a popsicle shy called an ice cream but I'm all about rich desserts so I definitely choose ice cream over a popsicle but to each is alright alright so this is pretty flexible now so gosh you gotta work on them out of breath here he's doing this so what I'm going to do is gather all of my rough corners to the underside get a nice smooth top that'll be the top I'll roll out so I will grab my shaker filled with cornstarch you could use cornstarch here you could use powdered sugar or confectioners sugar icing sugar people call it different things but I like powder I mean I like cornstarch it's what I've always used works well for me so before I even ground my rolling pin I'm just going to start flattening this a bit put a little bit of cornstarch on top grab my trusty PVC pipe start giving us a rope so I always like to roll from the middle out make sure it's nice and even I'm going for about an eighth of an inch thick here pick it up I'll turn it around turning your fondant often make sure that the fondants not sticking to the table and it also ensures that the fun it is a nice even thickness which is important you know whenever you're making a sculpted cake turn this again so I know that I need my fun it should be about as long and as wide as a rolling pin so I'm going to just roll this fondant totes as wide as my table so if you guys are just tuning in we are rolling out some fondant right now to cover an awesome ice cream sculpted cake er let's complicate that is an ice cream popsicle the cake itself isn't made of ice cream though you guys get the picture if you guys like your scene here if you feel so inclined check out my facebook page of Bayside and check out on Instagram I always post cool stories I was working on some really cool French macarons today so I was putting that in my internet story all right so this is got a little too big to turn around so what I'll do is just shift it around with my hands just make sure it's not sticking which it's not and I'll grab a pin here you guys can see that I have a couple of air bubbles no big deal at all just pop those and smooth it out my finger have one right over here too sometimes the air bubbles in your font especially especially the ones on the end don't even end up on your cake but it's always easier to pop the air bubble when the fun is on the table then to try and wait so you know - okay so what I'm doing now is just kind of buffing this on it smoothing out I'm just holding the rolling pin still I'm just getting it as one final stretch this is just going to get rid of any like digits in the font from the rolling pin we have any questions someone wants to know what your Facebook is again ready so my plan yeah baked by Jan's you guys just look at the video description above you'll see a little link you can click on that those baked by Dan you can check me out there or if you're looking for my Instagram it's just baked by down on Instagram or you can search the damn Langan on Instagram that's me alright so I have my fondant smoother here just give them this fun in the nice buff get into this something wants to know if March now and fondant will hold up better in a high humidity climate that really depends on the recipe really depends on the recipe and how humid the climate is so you guys will see here like Hawaii like Hawaii you know I've never been Hawaii I would love to be if you want to invite me to Hawaii probably say yes but um honestly with with a lot of things like a lot of things and baking and cake decorating I would say experiment if you're making marshmallow fondant and you know you're in a high human climate or a climates ranking it I would leave some of the water out so check out a marshmallow find recipe leave some of the water out of it and probably work well for it so I roll my fondant up on a rolling pin so let's check this out right here so starting with the fondant just hanging out just the very edge of the cake roll the silver my cake stretch it down the sides the first thing I want to do is push in the fondant right around this little cutout right here and we're going to cover this in some melted chocolate on top so I'm not super worried about these little cracks right here but whenever you have it in doubt like this you want to work on that first because kind of a funny shape so you want to make sure you push that in and then the next thing I'll do is grab my corners so to smooth the corner down I'm just going to bend my hand and like a 90 degree angle fashion and just smooth that in flip this around we'll do the same thing right here stretch it out to slightly been been in and I will just use the soft edge of my hand to push this down towards the side of the board and it's a little humid here today so I could tell that my buttercream was already sticky but if my buttercream didn't look kind of sticky from my cake being cold and it being brought out into you know humid weather I would have just sprayed my buttercream with a little bit of water or vodka which is my favorite thing if you guys could see me decorate cakes fourth you'll know that vodka is always like my go-to liquid for attaching something to a cake awesome that was pretty I love them stuff it's easy alright so you grab my fondant smoother I'll just smooth out the top of this it's already looking so good so if you guys are curious this layered half sheet cake is probably cake for about 45 people which is a heck of a lot of cake so I'll tell you I have a lot of cake to eat when there's live broadcast is over all right so what I'm doing here is just taking my phone it's bitter I've got the rounded edge down and I'm just smoothing the side of the cake this helps to attach the fondant right to the bottom of the cake or right at that bottom corner do that again this way by the way in the back and then I'll just use my fingers just to push that in right there alright so I'll cut away most of this excess just to make the board a little lighter just using a paring knife for this if you guys are just joining you don't forget to share this post leave a comment let us know what you think if you guys have ever created a spoke to cake before I love to see other people's work so share that picture below and I by all means if you attempt this cake somewhere over the weekend or later tonight I don't know whatever works for you certainly share it on my Facebook page at a Friday know and love to see it so now I'm just taking a sculpting tool and I'm going to start pushing this fondant under the cake this is really important because a real popsicle is rounded on the bottom just like it is on the top so this wouldn't just sit completely flat on the board it would round under so the way to do that is just by pushing the fondant under the cake using some type of sculpting tool could even use a spoon like a metal spoon backwards or I guess you would say backwards right like a spoon flipped over and just use the rounded part of the spoon to do the same thing right here then can you explain we have a few questions from various people about using vodka to make fondant stick to cakes I was sure yeah really simple so guys fondant is mostly sugar and sugar dissolved in water alright so whenever you use water to attach foam into a case or it to attach fondant to itself you have to be really careful because if you go overboard the fondant just has the tendency to get really sticky and kind of get kind of gooey and slosh around that's what water but vodka is alcohol so it doesn't dissolve the sugar as easily or as quickly and it also evaporates really quickly so I like to use vodka simply because it dries so quickly it makes the fondant stick to the cake and it's not really going to cause any like gooey fondant or like debating of your colors you really could use any clear alcohol you know whenever I guess you could use tequila you could use clear rum that's the thing right mm-hmm wait round white rum I have even used when I've run out of back you guys I've even used like an orange the tool that you would use for making like a margarita so I'm just using this sculpting tool just to hit the microphone with my head there I'm just using the tilting tool to now cut the fondant off so it's like a multi-purpose tool first you tuck the fondant under the cake and then you use the tool to tape extra fondant off and I like to do this in pieces instead of doing like one really long strip I think it's a bit easier to cut off just what you need because I don't want to cut too much off here I definitely want to tuck it under because I don't want to see the cake especially since this is a red velvet that you guys may have seen awesome so now you can see that I have like a little rounded edge here the fun it's nicely tucked under actually how I did that we have this point in edge here I just take the tool just pushed upon it in and then glide the tool on it super easy just finish up this little higher cut mark right here so this is a pretty giant cake like I said this is cake for like gosh 45 people I thought about making this cake so long but I figured this is Facebook live the KFC's huge recipe big easiest way to make a really impressive cake I think it's just makes huge that's all you have to do it just makes you so I figured let's make a huge ice cream obstacle but if you wanted to make a quarter sheet cake if you wanted to you know attempt this and make it much smaller so we could do that you are the boss in your own kitchen do whatever you want all right so that looks pretty good I'm happy with how that looks right so I'll just go around one more time of my fondant smoother just smooth the top and the edges kind of at the same time if my fondant was kind of sticky and my fondant smoother for sticking to the fondant a little bit all I have to do is put a little cornstarch on the up on it and if you know big jokes I'm just going to steam this cake anyway so that cornstarch would have disappeared all right so let me just put my fondant back we always want to keep your fondant scraps bag right because all right so now what I'm going to do is apply a little bit of vegetable shortening just to the top portion of the cake because I'm going to roll out some Brown chocolate fondant and attach it to the top of the cake and then cut it away so that it looks like really luscious strips of really rich hot fudge sauce or something like that so I'm using vegetable shortening to attach the brown fondant because I want to drape a big thing of brown fondant over this and then peel it away so the vegetable shortening allows me to attach the fondant but it's kind of just like a semi-permanent attachment it's not going to be impossible to pull away right so if I use water to attach the brown to the green it would totally check it out in every loss so I'm just going to move this get my work face back you have a question Bethany would like to know if you weren't going to be covering the top of your cake how can you fix crack in your fondant um could I question that well the first thing you can do is start with fondant it's really soft so you can microwave your microwave your fondant and then knead it for probably like five minutes I need to mind pretty quickly you can also take your phone and smoothers and kind of like push those cracks together and kind of like massage them together and you can also grow some shortening over it but um yeah everyone has a different methods that they like you could use a little bit of royal icing that was colored the same colors on it and use that to kinda like catch the I found that off you just kinda have to experiment I think and find what works you know best for you but I think the best advice I could give to that question is to try and be really diligent with your fondant meeting so it doesn't crack first place and if you find that your fondant is constantly cracking try different recipe or try adding a brand upon it so is the brown fondant right here ash is pretty stiff so a little shortening on my head let's give us a nice neat I want to knit and stretchy so I'm a total chocoholic when it comes to desserts and sweets if it's got chocolate in it on there so that's why I decided to go for chocolate here but it's good totally be any any colors on there any flavor you would want it to be if you guys have a suggestion or a cake that you would like to see create on Facebook live hit me in the comments below let me know what you think always looking for fresh creative ideas someone said this could have been an orange creamsicle so hop to go hey cook but I sure I'd go with a mint green and like I said chocolate because chocolates like my favorite food group alright so see how this is nice and stretchy is pulling really well and not really breaking this chocolate fondant does have actual chocolate in so the texture of it is a little bit different this is kind of like a mixture of chocolate modeling chocolate and fondant so a little bit tougher if you were trying this you could just use plain vanilla fondant it's dyed brown but where's then it's all about chocolate with me so alright so I'm meeting all the edges together the corner so you have a nice smooth top and I see I'm gonna measure my cake here 11:6 so you might find it about 17 inches wide right and then it would be just as long as it turns out okay on top so I'll start rolling this sideways to get the width of the network this reminds me of the gigantic chocolate-covered strawberry cake that we need for Valentine's Day which is like one of my all-time favorite cakes you guys didn't see that video check out my facebook page because it's there it's really awesome be a great cake for any of the remotes actually but we covered the bottom of that cake with some Brown fondant this was a chocolate-covered strawberry shortcake so we feel on that chocolate covered vibe right now all right so everyone usually asks me why I use a PVC pipe and the answer is just because I like to and I kind of always had let out know the real answer is because they're PVC pipes are really easy to find I got this at the hardware store for like 3 bucks and super easy to clean so PVC for rolling out fondant always a good a good deal I find it fun it doesn't stick to it as much either just because it's a shiny plastic surface so I'm just popping any air bubbles I see my fondant with a pin a little thinner on this times like this one totally wish I had a shooter all right so roll from the center out right now check my thickness here in a little bit [Music] so if you guys are just joining I've already covered my huge ice cream popsicle with a nice mint green fondant and now I'm rolling out some chocolate fondant I'm going to drape over the top going to come my chocolate dip it shopping trip that's pretty good I'm happy with that oh all right so same deal I will roll this up grab my cake and I only want this on the top half of my cake right here so if you guys just thaw just you're tuning in and just use a little bit of vegetable shortening on the top push on cake that's going to make this fondant stick slightly easier to sing how then did you make this piece with hot on it yeah yeah I'd say it's about it's like 1/8 of an inch thick probably all rights the same deal start with my corners start with the top edge this top little cut this extra off got a little say it with all the chocolate there and little to my channel alright so I'll push in this indentation this is the bite mark because if there is an ice cream popsicle and myself in the same room gonna be at least one bite mark out of it so I'll push that in there smooth these sides down this chocolate fondant is awesome it actually smells like chocolate I don't know if you can solve it I can smell it you can phone I don't you guys can smell it but also rich and chocolatey that is all the notes of chocolate so that one on really easily I'm going to grab my sonic smoother smooth that down the sides there kind of push that edge in smooth this around and usually when I'm covering a cake in fondant I want the edges to be nice and sharp sharp corners and all that good stuff out in the night scream pops cooling you know it doesn't have sharp corners all rounded and rushes and just dipped in rich chocolate sauce perfect it is so grabbing my sculpting tool one more time I'll do that same deal I just did I'm just pushing the fondant under the cake and then I'll go back and I'll use the tool which is a bit more pressure to actually cut the fondant off so if you guys have any questions about sculpting cakes or about baking cakes if you have any issues or things you know you need some guidance on when it comes to baking let us know leave your question the comments we'll see if we can answer it alright so cutting this away and in just a moment I'm going to use a sharp craft knife and do some more cutting here so that it looks like there are just big drips of this chocolate and not just one on solid piece so if you guys want notifications for when I'm going to be doing these on live broadcast make sure to check out my facebook page which is baked by Dan you can find the link for it in the top of the video here you can add me on there also check me out on instagram at bake by dan i also have a youtube channel that's baking with dan though they don't get a little confusing there so lightly different slightly so I'm going to grab a sharp craft knife and what I'm going to do is just cut through this chocolate fondue and just cut some drips of chocolate here and what I'll be able to do is pull this extra fondant away because I only used vegetable shortening to attach it if I'd used water fun it would be stuck there until I don't know like next week forever basically someone wants to know that the pre-press that you did for this cake how long does it take sure um you guys will see really quick obviously the shortening didn't go all the way down to where these pieces are so if any extra pieces aren't sticking all I have to do is that a little more shortening will stick in place so how long does this cake take so I baked these two half sheets yesterday when I was baking I was doing my bakes for the weekend and after they cooled I filled them with some mascarpone buttercream and then I just let the cake chiller tonight so I'd say this is like a two day project so you would bake until your cake one day and then let it sit in the fridge overnight or for you know two days if you needed to and then you can decorate the cake in one day so I'll just start back at the other side here do a shorter one yeah guys sometimes people think that you know you have to like finish a cake in one day but often with a lot of sculpted cakes especially be really really complicated really detailed ones there like day long or like week long projects so you just keep your take chilled in the refrigerator as long as it is crumb coated you shouldn't have to worry about it drying out because all the fat and the buttercream or the ganache whatever it is keeps your cake nice and it's an airtight alright so I really like this apply and then cut away method I think it's a lot easier to drape that chocolate fondant over the cake and then cut the fondant off as opposed to trying to cut out this really intricate shape in and lay it in place I think that becomes a little more difficult alright so anywhere that didn't get any shortening to make these stick I'll just apply a little bit shortening I'll kind of stretch those out and if any of these edges look like really sharp or really cut I'll just run my finger over them so they look a little a little softer a more natural so if you guys are just joining I still have two really awesome pieces left to go on this cake simply I want to hang in there for I don't know another ten minutes maybe to see this come together any sharp edges you can just take a craftool or sculpting knife and just tuck those under one more piece right here all right so really quickly before I forget if this was a real ice cream pop you would not have the bike dipped right I don't think you bite your ice cream pops on and dip them in chocolate right so I'm going to cut away just this outline where the bite is so we can see the green let's fill that back and you'll see how easily that comes off like I said thanks to the thanks to the shortening being on there so now what I want to do is just add a little strip of brown fondant to the bottom just to kind of act like a border so I'll just use this extra piece I just cut off just cut a thin strip with the help of my trusty paring knife and I'll just push that in place there also make use of my sculpting tool again percent please any of this shortening I can just kind of buff out get rid of it just smoothies sharp edges in with my fingers oh yeah if I were to take a flight out of an ice-cream obstacle it probably would be this big so this is pretty accurate so card thing all right so I'm going to turn on my steamer I want to steam this nice and shiny so all the cornstarch disappears this is tool that way if someone when the homemaker didn't have a steamer what could they do in order to steam a cake like that you can carefully use your iron with the steam setting this whole by iron straight up and then use the steam button if your iron has one of those functions I think that's probably the best bet but you should always try to be pretty limited with the amount of cornstarch or whatever your you are using because you need to go overboard sometimes you can't take her a bit with the steamer always so you have to be careful so before i steam this cake I'm going to give it one more go round and make sure that there are no edges that need to be covered up because once the cake is steamed for at least you know 5 or 10 minutes until it dries it's going to be really sticky and when it's sticky I'm not going to be able to smooth it or run a fondant smoother or anything like that over it because it was just stick the fondant smoother wouldn't know glide over the cake give these corners one final smooth so I also have some giant cradles that I made now stick those in place with the help of my scheme how did you make these things so to make these sprinkles I'm glad you asked because look I have some right here to make these sprinkles I just rolled out some snakes fondant right pretty thin and I've used my fondant smoother to roll them see sometimes when you're rolling now like a snake you got marks from your fingers but if you use a flat tool like a spotted smoother they're nice and flat and then I just use my knife to cut sprinkles let them dry for a few hours about a bing-bam-boom sprinkles baby exactly what I did and I just placed them on a paper towel so that the paper towel absorbs extra moisture and right away alright so here we go give this cake a little steam if you do make a lot of cakes so you can get a handheld steamer like this they're pretty cheap I think this is like just here two bucks so make sure I don't knock my sprinkles off the table alright alright so I'm only sticking the sprinkles to the chocolate part so I'll try and give this chocolate a good bit of steam so that it's nice enough isn't tacky or sticky so you always want to keep your steamer moving whenever you're steaming tape because you don't want the steam to bead up on this is because in a good run or the steam could form like a bunch of bubbles or water droplets and then runs so hopefully these all stick if not I'll just get a little more steam another we'll see what happens here stick very good so I am loving how this is turned out guys let me know what you think in the comment about how this cake looks so far I would normally spend a good amount of time here trying to space all of these colors out and make it like absolutely even imperfect right sprinkles not perfect now that's true he puts wriggled out of cake they kind of just fall all wherever they may write whatever they stick to things I always say yeah that's that's what I love about food cakes is that they really don't have to be perfect because foods not perfect right I mean less you obsess and try to make it perfect but usually food is pretty varied in its presentation all right I have one more piece I'm going to add to this popsicle and then it's going to be done and I'll have to devour the whole thing just kidding so just another message if the steamer wasn't available to here it wasn't really working I could just as easily grab a paintbrush and a little bit of piping gel which is another one of my favorite favorite mediums for sticking fondant to itself and uh the piping gel works really well because it's pretty sticky it's kind of like corn syrup but it has some gelatin in it so it's nice and sticky and it helps fondant stick to itself or stick to you know other things really well so on these edges here where maybe I need like a little more strength the piping gel is a pretty good go-to sweets add a few more of these what's on left last ones a pack guess what what does that another one this is also a great opportunity to cover up any like little air bubbles or dings that got my fondant get a little too excited cover your cake and you ding the fund and a big deal just cover it up with something right can you explain again why you're using shortening to stick this fondant to the fondant sure can't exactly yeah I said it right so after I covered my cake in green fondant I want it to or I added a panel of a chocolate fondant and then I've cut the excess a way to get the strip you look so shortening allowing you to stick the chocolate to the green but then be able to peel it back so the shortening isn't a permanent stick it's a temporary stick it will hold fondant in place stuck to itself but if you need to reposition something it's a repositionable hold I guess that's probably the good the best word to use it is reposition all right few more here I need a purple one and then I have a huge a lollipop stick or popsicles it stops popsicle stick this is one huge ice cream popsicle so calls for a huge popsicle stick all right one more sprinkles and I promise I'm done all right here we go it was pretty cool yeah yes does love it all right so let me grab my big popsicle stick so this is made from gum paste and I rolled some tan gum paste about a quarter of an inch thick I use my trusty ruler here to cut it three inches wide and then I just rounded the edge with a flexible blade and I made this a couple of days ago so on a dry nice and solid I have some skewers in it so they can stick all the way into the cake so what I'm going to do is find the center of my cake here so it's right there and I'm just going to make a little slit just to kind of give this a head start moment of truth add this popsicle stick and you'll be good to go if you guys are just joining this as the crowning glory of this ice cream possible cake so here we go so this should just go right in often there we go a gigantic ice cream popsicle cake because like I said I'm feeling the summer vibes just in time for the weekend these are now pretty cool we have our mid green-colored find a cake of this luscious fudgy chocolate drip on top some gigantic sprinkles you have a huge bite out of the cake of course because I mean come on ice cream popsicle this big of course I'd have to take a huge bite out of it then we have our big popsicle stick made out of gum paste it's not going anywhere if you guys do any final questions about this cake how we create it let us know in the comments below don't forget to check me on instagram at bait by dan and if you have a cool idea for a cake you'd like to see next week hit me in those comments
