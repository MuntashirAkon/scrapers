what's up guys how's it going welcome back to my bait shop I'm Dan laying in tonight or today rather it's all about tape for breakfast because I'm creating a gigantic fried egg I don't know the other than can't afford because that's what I do around you so this giant fried egg starts with a big forty inch layer of butter cake and a little six inch layer butter cake so this little 6 inch gave income to joke so I actually died the a butter cake yellow apart basics I'm gonna cut through the whole thing it's yellow egg yolk so the first thing I have to do is carve down my yolk so you can see here I just started with a six inch round layer cake and I already started rounding off the sides just around a little bit I always spend a lot of time looking at the food I'm going to create before I before I actually you know create it and I eat eggs every day when I was younger I always used to eat fried eggs we call them dippy eggs but I know most people probably call them sunny-side up eggs we're good so guys don't forget to leave your comments below I'm curious to know your favorite way to eat an egg and I don't know if our questions are showing up so if you have any questions I'll do my best to answer any of them whichever ones I can after this broadcast but share this video with someone you think might enjoy it and let us know below if there are any realistic food cakes you would like to see me create here live on the Food Network Facebook page so what I'm doing right now is just frosting my six inch cake with some yellow American buttercream and I'm going to put some yellow fondant over it and I'm using all yellow here obviously so that when I cut into it it's yellow like a yolk so my cake for this or this yoke cake here's nice and cold and I find that sometimes when I spread American buttercream over a cake that's been carved all of the fresh crumb kind of makes a little hard to spread the buttercream so a good tip that I have is to microwave your buttercream just for about five or ten seconds depending on how much you have just so that it's a little bit thinner because as soon as it hits the cold it's going to kind of you know stiffen up so if you get it a little bit warm before you spread it on the cake it'll be a little easier to spread and another really cool thing about this cake is that since it's such a I guess shortcake since it's so rounded and organic it's not really you know take with any sharp edges I can actually make this cake from start to finish without children so normally I'm all about showing my cakes if you guys have seen me work before you know that but this one I can kind of make from start to finish so this is just a piece of plastic acetate and it's great for kind of contouring buttercream cakes or ganache cakes just like I'm doing right here because you can bend it in your hands kind of shape your cake so I just want to frost this fairly smooth now looks pretty good so I'm going to set this aside and I'm going to roll out a little bit of yellow fondant so if you guys are just joining this gigantic fried egg is actually a cake it's a 14 inch cake with a six inch cake on top this is a egg yolk I'm creating it live right now with the help of some vanilla butter cake some butter creams of course and fondant so I just frosted my yolk and now I'm meeting together some yellow fondant that I dyed with some golden yellow gel paste and just a touch of orange because I want the seal to be really really rich in color so just a little bit of cornstarch on my bench here I'll flatten it out just a touch and I'll roll this in a nice circle I always like to turn right on it as a rolling it just so stays in a circle and also because it stays nice and even and thickness that way so if you guys have never checked out my facebook page report the link to my facebook page baked by Dan is at the top of this video make sure you check it out and if you want to see some of the recipes I use for my cake or buttercream or anything like that I don't over my blog which is baking with Dan comm and also checking out an Instagram because every week when I do these lives I try and post progress photos for leaked stories of what's going on so you can know before I go live what I'm going to create we move my cornstarch here so my cake should be nice and sticky because I just put the buttercream on it so I'm just going to lay this on it right over top just use my hand to smooth the top down I want to try and keep this nice rounded Yoshi so I'll just turn this as I smooth down sees the rounded part of my hands and right now this is pretty matte but what I'm actually going to do is paint this with some vegetable oil once the whole thing is together and it's going to give my fondant yoke that really nice glistening appearance that our freshly fried egg would have so stay tuned because there are a lot of really cool techniques that I'm going to use to finish this cake off they're really going to bring it to life so another really a fun thing about this process is that normally when I'm rolling out fondant always working to get rid of any air bubbles that are in the fondant but as I was making my example cake earlier I realized that fried eggs are full of bubbles so I really didn't even have to worry about popping all those bubbles so this is just a wooden sculpting tool I'll use it all the time for cakes and since it's smaller than my finger I can use it to kind of push the fondant all the way into the bottom corner of that cake and then what I'm going to do is grab a knife grab a craft knife here and then I'm just going to cut the fondant away barely touching or that cake is and I'll just talk a little bit of that under and then I'm just going to set this aside so if you guys have any questions don't forget you can post them below I'll do my best to transfer them after this broadcast if you're looking for awesome recipes that are going to turn out bakery style treats in your home kitchen make sure you check out my blog which is baking with Dan comm and if you guys are working on any cakes or you've attempted any sculpted cakes or sculpted food cakes please share them in the comments below because one of my favorite parts about this whole gig here is getting to see what you guys create so feel free to share away awesome so that's when I can finish them inside what I want to do here really quickly just to round this out just little bit further take some of my fondant just an extra scrap piece here knead it together until all the wrinkles go away I'm going to use this to buff my yoke out I'll get a nice smooth side there and just really lightly I'd imagine the support would be like to put makeup on I don't really know I don't know if anyone's ever tried to use a piece of fondant to make a vodka then be really funny you should share about it have you ever tried that gate you think that would work no Beautyblender maybe at work maybe you could blend your beautiful makeup with a piece of fondant alright so see that just kind of buffs the whole thing out makes it look nice and soft gets rid of any like rough finger marks awesome so this I'm just going to set aside and I'm going to get to work in on the weight of my case now my cake is going to start with just white fondant but as you'll see in the cake that I've already completed there's a lot of color and texture that goes into it and that all comes from using a propane torch once the whole cake is put together so what I have here I want to work on a piece of parchment so it's easy to clean up I have a 14 inch cake it's about an inch thick I have it on a 12 inch board so I have a little bit of overhang so that when I shape my cake you won't see the board won't ever be exposed so the first thing I want to do is just kind of cover two sides in this way just to make it kind of a in uneven circle so it's a little more than organic looking or you know like natural as a fried egg would be and then basically I just want to taper in all of the sides so I'm just going to turn this as I work here so this cake itself actually started with three pounds of vanilla buttermilk cake which I call my confetti cake on my blog because I usually like to put rainbow sprinkles in it but if you just want a nice solid buttermilk cake you can forego the sprinkles and you'll have a really great butter base cake cards well and stacks well also goes just an interest of keeping my space clean I'm trying to keep all these chromosomes parchment and then I'll just drop this with some buttercream and I know from earlier that we stopped doing a crumb coat this is going to look a little rough but like I said Friday totally organic bumpy all kinds of Ripley and you know rough looking from from being fried um so by no means am I too worried about this beam you know really smooth like I normally would be when I'm putting on this cake which is really cool because it makes this process a whole lot quicker so I know that eggs are one of my favorite breakfast foods and they've been ever since I was younger we call fried eggs dippy eggs and I was a little kid if you guys have a favorite way to eat an egg or you have a cool idea for an egg cake let us know in the comments below because I think Arius the same what's your favorite way to eat an egg key yeah dippy eggs yeah I don't hope anyone else fulfilling everything so you can call it funny side up you can call a fried egg and silly call it dippy egg which actually sounds really funny two more in say so and have it this is nice and tapered in I want to leave this out fairly flat because that's where I'll attach the yolk and whatever I'm carving a cake I like to do it in really short motions I just take off one section at a time you can always take off more but if I did accidentally take a big dent out of my cake it wouldn't be a big deal back filled with buttercream so frosting a cake is more like being a only go for meant work early go consult their sculptor well I mean you know when you're when you're frosting a cake it's almost like you're out now working with like bread and a there's nothing on my cake artists come on alright so this looks pretty organic it will take even more shape once once the pilot is on there so let me just clean up my space a little bit you guys are just joining this gigantic fried egg cake it's 14 inches across made with three pounds of cake and creating it right now out of cake buttercream is fun so don't go anywhere because we're going to come together to mess up the next few minutes so I'm going to move my cake up onto my turntable here this particular Topher do you guys have any questions about fate being about you know sculpting cakes or whatever let me know in the comments below I'll do my best to answer once this broadcast is over can also feel free to hit me up on my Facebook page or think right and check me out on Facebook of a potential me on Instagram alright let's give this a frog so I have some butter cream here at piping bag just an easy way to kind of distribute this and I just need a thin layer here doesn't have to be really pissed with all these crumbs I like to try and keep the spatula going in one motion and just keep a spatula on the buttercream because if the bear spatula touches the cake or I pulled a spatula up to complete its just going to kind of rip those crumbs away which is no big deal because all of this will be covered once the cake is out you know covered in the white fondant so I think my favorite part of putting this cake together is getting to torch the edges with the propane torch anytime I can bring out my propane torch and fire that up when I'm working on a cake it's always toys extra fun it's a chance to be a little a little dangerous and live on the edge a little bit you don't get to live on the edge too much when you're making cakes but when you're torching a cake that might be as crazy to catch so across this all the way to the edges I'm going to tuck the fondant under the edges of this cake so I'm not too concerned with getting the buttercream all the way to the very edges because the butter critter the fun is going to stick to the case anyway smooth this all out awesome so I'll take a little poll scraper here and just smooth this just a tiny bit so connecting perfect again like I said but I don't want any huge lines in my buttercream so this is just a big bowl scraper it's just going to get rid of any really rough lines they're good so I'll set this aside and now what I have to do is grab a sheet and I'm gonna put the tollgate together this giant egg cake I'll put it together on a sheet pan because when you're making an egg bake need a big platter for them and the biggest thing I have is this sheet pan so I have a clean sheet pan turned upside down and since it's metal this is also going to allow me to torch the edges of a without letting me do a fire so now I've got to roll out some white fondant so before I do that I want to clean up any final crumb before I get my weight fondant all right grab my white final step before I put my wife on their own is to actually add my yoke before I add the white on it what that's going to do is cover the bottom edge of the yoke the white will be a fondant that's the egg white of the Cape will actually cover the bottom seam of the yoke so they yolk and the white will look more like they're one piece as opposed to just being stuck on top now I'll try my white on it get a little bit of shortening in my hand so it's nice and easy to need and I'll give it a good knead until it's nice and stretchy so what this is nice and stretchy and we'll pull it out and I'll draped it all over the cakes and I'm just going to cut away the portion that's covering and oak and smooth the entire thing together all right I'm going to bring all these wrinkles to the bottom decided nice smooth top and I'll roll it out look at a cornstarch on my bench if you guys are just joining here my name is Dan Landon I'm from baked by Dan I love making hammock realistic food cakes one my favorite things to put together and tonight I'm making this huge fried egg because eggs are my favorite breakfast student I thought it'd be really fun to turn a fried egg into a cake so I see a few air bubbles normally I'd be really dead-set on popping them but I'm not worried about because the white of the Friday always has air bubbles so we'll just add to the look of the whole thing I do want to try and keep this in barely even circle just so I know that go covers my whole cake so I'll keep turning it as I roll it tuna rolls and I should good to go so normally I'm always working with chilled cakes because chilled cakes are a lot easier to sculpt and cover with fondant but I'm just going to cover this straightaway I obviously haven't chilled butter cream but since it's such a rounded design and really organic to begin with it so it doesn't need to be chilled so just kind of roll this up move my Center my table unroll this fondant on top of the whole thing first thing I want to do is just smooth down around that yolk because in just a moment I'm gonna basically just cut away the fondant right where the yolk is touching the white and I'll just peel this extra way and that yolk will be revealed there so by putting the white over the yolk and then peeling it off it makes the egg look a little more seamless like they're actually one piece instead of you know just like the yolk looking like I just plopped it on top of the white so around the edges here what I want to do is just kind of flatten this down so it looks a little more pointed towards the ends good all right I got my craft knife again grab my sculpting tool and I'm just going to trace around the yolk just to get myself a line of wearing it to cut so what I'm trying to do this right up against the edge of the yoke and if there's any space like if any cake shows through totally no big deal I'll just push the white fondant into into the yolk and it will just look like one seamless stain so really carefully I want to peel this up good so I'll just push these two pieces together put my white away here all right and so on this edge here what I'm going to do is cut that quarter of an inch away from the side of the key because I want to spin this edge a little bit and texture it so it looks nice and rough and that's the part that I'm going to hit with my propane torch it's really brown and make it look like it's actually you know fresh out of the frying pan peel this away take a little bit of my white use it to push that fondant towards the yoke and if any buttercream Peaks out I'm just going to brush it away with the pastry brush alright so now it's really just on the texturing and coloring and that's what absolutely brings the paint to life so this is my favorite I'm going to move this up on top of my turntable all right I'm gonna grab a pastry brush get rid of any buttercream or a little cake crumbs that have kind of poked through the whole thing and I'm going to take two texturing tools and the first thing I'm going to do is just smooth out this cut edge so it looks a little softer and a little West Point so the smooth is hoping down I want the white to look thin but I still want it to be a good bit of cake so this cake believe it or not like I said it's about three pounds of cake so it really put served at least about 10 people you got a good inch of cake here so what I'm going to do is just start kind of rough from the edges up a little bit adding some little texture holes making this look like you know I just dropped this egg into a skillet of hot oil that white started to cook up right away so just some holes in some spots that the propane torch is really going to accentuate maybe some larger ones and other spots kind of break it this is one of the best parts of making food cakes is when you get to really come be creative and random and texture things and add color and add you know dimension with your with your texture and airbrushing and dusting makes the whole process really fun so now I'll just add some air bubbles or little little pricks around where the UH where the white video could be together I want to add some more texture I can just use my fingers right so once this cake is finished I'm going to hit it with some pepper because I always eat my fried eggs with fresh dirt freshly cracked black pepper it's like one of my favorite things and crush up black sprinkle actually work really well for that the first I thought about using black sugar but the crushed up black sprinkles really look like fresh cracked pepper because you get a really irregular shape and size of all themselves it's all about those sprinkles can do a lot of them alright so if any parts look like too rounded and don't look flat and off ball just kind of push them out just a little bit more push some areas in just a perfect circle awesome alright so super painful all right so I'm going to start this and then I'm going to paint the case it's a little shiny and then I'll hit it with just a little more color so I'm just going to keep my propane torch moving as I aim aflame right towards the side of - I'll let some areas get a little bit darker so this is just a little creme brulee torch I just borrowed from the kitchen store and all its really doing it caramelized in the sugar we're burning all the sugar and the fondant basically take this all the way around edges and then I'm actually going to use some watered-down piping gel to paint over the yolk to give it kinda like a semi-gloss finish and then to give the yolk a really high gloss finish I'm going to use some vegetable cooking spray vegetable oil don't want some little spots need where that oil jumped up and hit the egg I'll just hit a few spots on top not too dark so just a little bit all right so now I'm going to grab some piping gel written down with just a little bit of water just a little bit easier to paint on my white and I'll just paint this whole thing on here and I'm just really going to bring the white to life just so it looks nice and freshly cooked and ready to eat I'll paint it all the way up to the yolk if some of it gets on the yolk though chilly no big deal doesn't matter so make sure I have a nice even covering so I'll just spin my cake as I bring the brush up the side of the cake alright I'm gonna grab some cooking spray and I'm just going to spray the cooking spray directly on top of the yolk and then I'll use another pastry brush just to kind of paint the whole thing to make it look nice and smooth so just spraying this vegetable cooking spray on top of the yolk and I'll just paint across the whole thing and then after a second or two any bubbles or brush marks will go away and look like a nice freshly cooked and give now I think this needs a bit more color so I'm just going to torch the side of this a little bit more I like when my Friday has a lot of color on the edges because I think it has a really nice toasted nutty flavor let's get some good color here so whenever you're torching fondant you always want to keep the torch moving because it'll look like it's not doing anything and then all the sudden is going to bubble and color is going to show up so this is easier to do in codes if you're looking for a really deep color instead of trying to do it really dark all in one shot and it's going to smoke a little bit too because you're burning the sugar in the fondant but that's no big deal actually smelled like tar piston marshmallows so I'm not complaining all right a little bit more right here and then when I hit this with some black pepper I can eat a fried egg without some freshly cracked pepper on top so I have some black sprinkle that I just kind of crushed up and I'll crush them up just a little bit more as I sprinkle them on top of the egg and I think it looks like freshly cracked pepper right across the center there we go so I'm ready to eat it's not even breakfast time but right now I have cake for breakfast this is my gigantic fried egg if you guys just joined and
