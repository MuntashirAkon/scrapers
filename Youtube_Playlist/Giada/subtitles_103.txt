good Italian food doesn't always mean big plates of pasta or heavy meaty dishes sometimes just a few bites our best mozzarella in Carrozza is the ultimate grilled cheese sandwich if you like baked clams you'll love my clams casino little mouthfuls that promise big flavor pizza day with gorgonzola tomato and basil is like a palm-sized pizza and how's this for fast food crunchy Parmesan chicken tenders baked not fried on this show the best dishes come in small packages here's a party favorite for kids of all ages crunching homemade chicken tenders that don't even have to be deep-fried covered in breadcrumbs and Parmesan cheese they come out of the oven crispy and perfect for dipping in my creamy vinaigrette I love making these chicken tenders because they make great snack food and I've even figured out a way to Italian eyes them so I'm gonna take the chicken tenders and put them in this bowl and we're gonna marinate them in some buttermilk now the thing about chicken tenders is there are the strips of meat they're located under the chicken breast so as the name leads you to believe they are very tender and that's why I love them we're gonna add a cup of buttermilk the buttermilk helps tenderize the chicken even more it also gives them a nice Tang just leave them in there make sure they're all covered nicely and you want them to sit and marinate for about 15 minutes or up to a half hour it really does break the meat down the proteins in the chicken and help make it really tender okay so we'll leave those alone in the meantime I'm gonna make the coating we're gonna use three-quarters of a cup of bread crumbs and there's seasoned Italian bread crumbs so they've got Italian seasonings in it they've got dried parsley a little maybe a little bit of thyme if you don't buy the Italian seasoning or you just have in your pantry regular plain bread crumbs go ahead and add some dried herbs to them and of course we're gonna add freshly grated Parmesan cheese and mix it together and this is a good time to buy the pregrated stuff so you have to sit here and grate all your cheese otherwise if you have little nubs or little stubs of Parmesan cheese left over in the fridge throw them in the food processor you'll get this nice ground-up Parmesan cheese you can use for things like this we'll leave that alone and in the meantime I'm gonna make the dressing and this is what I'm gonna dip the chicken tenders in I'm gonna take a couple cloves of garlic here I crush them with a little bit of force just because I'm going to make a paste out of the garlic and making a paste out of the garlic really intensifies the flavor and I really want that for the dipping I'm just gonna chop it just a little bit so you want to get it into a nice mince and then we're gonna add some salt to it the salt helps break down the garlic even further and helps create a paste and right against a flat surface just go ahead and just make it into a paste and you can see that there's a little bit of liquid and moisture coming out of the garlic and that is what you want okay that looks good and add a little bit more salt in there a little bit of freshly ground pepper and about three tablespoons of balsamic vinegar and it's thick and a little bit sweet it helps add that tang and acidity to the to the vinaigrette but also gives it a little bit of sweetness mix that together I love to play the balsamic vinegar now we're gonna add about 1/2 a cup of extra virgin olive oil and again this is where you want to spend the money on good olive oil because really taste it here it makes a big difference between an okay dressing and are really good dressing believe that and when my chicken is finished marinating I'm gonna dredge it in the breadcrumb and Parmesan mixture get it in the oven just make sure and shake off the extra buttermilk that way you don't get a clumpy crust the thickness from the buttermilk also helps the the breadcrumbs in the parmesan mixture stick to the chicken tenders and you can also make them ahead of time make them in the morning cover them with plastic wrap and just pop them in the fridge and pull them out and bring them to room temperature before you stick them in the oven that way they cook evenly all the way through drizzle the top with a little bit of olive oil and just so that there's a little bit of moisture that the breadcrumbs can sort of absorb and create that wonderful golden crust as if you had fried them so that's the trick to getting that beautiful fried color that golden brown is to Joy's a little bit of olive oil right on top ok now I'm gonna pop them in the oven 500 degrees for 12 minutes and then it's time to dig into them you
