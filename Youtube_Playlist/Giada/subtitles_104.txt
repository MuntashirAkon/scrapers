I'm spreading my artichoke and bean puree right on my crostini all right now for the fun part so this is the prosciutto and see after it goes into the oven it seizes up it gets nice and crispy see that and it just kind of crumbles so all I want to do is put it on my fingers and crumble it up in my hand and then sprinkle it over the top of the crostini and look at that color and it gives it that nice salty crunchy bite that I just love nice and the girls are gonna love this that looks so good let's grab the vegetable parmesan boy oh boy it smells good and smell the fennel and the peppers and of course all that cheese look how beautiful it is nice golden-brown crust on top from all the melted cheese and the bread crumbs ah we're gonna let it rest just for a little bit time to go to the fridge and grab the melon we are gonna make the best mint and melon slush ever so I have got some ginger ale and I have a honeydew a friend of mine had this in in Cabo a little while ago I remember her calling me up and telling me how great this drink was that she had by the pool and I thought this is the perfect girls drink it's a slushie but it's fresh and clean and really really good I want to cut it in half so that I can take off the skin I'm only gonna use a quarter of the melon and what I like to do here cut the two ends off just like that and then just run my knife along the bottom just peel off the skin and if there's any residue skin just kind of peel it off just like that and the honeydew sweet it's got a nice body to it I really like it in here and I love the color so then I cut the quarter in half again and just cut it into cubes because we're gonna put it in the blender I love the texture too and now I need a little ginger ale and the ginger note gives it a little effervescence so it kind of makes it a fun drink for all the girls I don't half cups of ginger ale it's also slightly sweet too so I think will be really fun all those boo-boos make it lots of fun and we need fresh mint there we go put that right in there nice fresh clean mint then half a cup of sugar so a quarter and another quarter so we got a half a cup of sugar and the amount of sugar you add to this drink kind of depends on how sweet the melon is so I'm gonna give this a quick little whirl perfect so now time for the crushed ice let's go the freezer and I like to add three cups of crushed ice I like really icy so a true slushy where you can all kind of drink it up and it's ice-cold and it makes it nice and thick too me and now we've blended all together you don't want to blend it too much because you still want it to be nice and chunky just like a slushie should be so here we go pour it right into the pitcher nice and slushy and icy and beautiful I'm gonna pop it in the fridge keep it cold and my friend Julie should be here any minute so I want to help her set up and then come back and get the food
