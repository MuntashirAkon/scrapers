man it looks good you can see the salmon on top and the arugula it's nice and golden brown and while that cools I'm gonna get started on my chicken meal and easy with my tomato and fennel sauce and I've got three bowls cuz we're gonna bread this chicken I just want to measure out a little bit of flour all right now we need two eggs so the flour allows the old to stick to the chicken and then the egg allows the breadcrumbs to stick to it so you need all three to get that nice crispy crust there we go so two eggs so just want to beat then we need some store-bought breadcrumbs need that nice crispy crust so we need some fine breadcrumbs right in there and we're gonna season the breadcrumbs so I'm gonna add a little bit of dried thyme a little bit of dried basil and you can use whatever kind of herbs you like and some Parmesan cheese so just add a little Parmesan cheese in here there we go and I just want to mix it all together I want to fry them up a little bit of vegetable oil so I can get a nice golden-brown crust without the chicken cutlets burning and doesn't have any flavor and you want them nice and thin so they cook quickly there we go and I have got five pieces because I figured since I was gonna make this for Vanessa I could make an extra chicken cutlet for myself a little bit of salt and a little bit of pepper and then we're gonna flip them and season the other side and a little pepper now let's start and we'll dip the chicken in the flour first just kind of shake it and get any extra flour off and into the egg and then into the breadcrumbs then we go make sure that all the chicken gets coated then we get a nice even crust everywhere okay here we go nice sizzling sound all right last one into the pad and these are gonna cook about three to four minutes on each side so in the meantime I'm gonna clean up so the chickens been cooking about three minutes and yeah nice and golden-brown on the other side yeah you can see the cheese actually melted into the crust it looks good okay so now they need to cook another two or three minutes on the other side in the meantime while I wait for those to cook I'm gonna get started on the sauce okay we're gonna start with some fennel we're just gonna cut the tops off and just cut the bottoms ever so slightly and then with the fennel what I like to do is just like an onion it's almost like peeling the outer layer of the onion you take the outer leaf off and I do the same thing with the top I'll cut the tops off just clean the bottom off a very thin slice and then I just cut just the outside leaf just take it out and then I take the inside and you cut it in half and I just kind of slice it thin there we go so the fennel is ready I'm gonna grab my platter I just lined the plate with some paper towel just absorb any of the extra grease while it cools they've been cooking about three minutes and let's check yeah you want to check the bottom and make sure that's nice and golden-brown so one out there we go and then we'll let them cool slightly before we pack them up there we go all right I'm going to place the chicken back here while I finish the sauce and let's cook the fennel in there and I want to cook the fennel in the same pan that I cook the chicken just so we can keep all that flavor in there a little salt and a little bit of pepper right in there just to season it and soften the fennel a little bit the fennel is gonna cook for about five minutes or so just until it softens and then when I come back I'm gonna show you how to put this all together and later a tower of sweetness its fruity gooey and dripping with chocolate
