I'm chopping half a cup of walnuts and just roughly chop them I like a little bit of crunch on my crow stop and I really like how the walnuts work well with the apples and with the gorgonzola cheese that we're gonna add in a minute the walnuts are chopped apples are cooled so it's time to add all the walnuts right in there then we need lemon and you only need about a teaspoon of lemon zest it's we need a little bit of lemon juice as well there we go that's about right now for the best part the gorgonzola cheese it's an aged bleu cheese and it's made usually in the Piedmont or the Lombardi regions of Italy that's where they make the best kind of bleu cheese and it's aged for about three to four months and the consistency changes depending on how long it's been aged it's really good stuff and with the apples and the nuts it makes for wonderful flavor and sometimes it can be crumbly sometimes it can be super soft this one's kind of in the middle and it's got a nice pungent flavor that's why I like it so much and we're gonna give this a quick toss just to blend all of the ingredients together mmm it kind of melts into the crostata into the apples and everything and it just ends up being so yummy so now time for the dough so I just want to flour the board a little bit just so the dough doesn't stick to the wooden board oh this is nice really important to let the dough have time to rest and sit so the butter can get nice and cold and a little bit more flour on top of the dough grab the rolling pin and I also want to flour the rolling pin so the rule engine doesn't stick and we'll just start rolling out the dough and see as you rule it it kind of spreads the butter throughout you can actually see pieces of butter in there and that's what you want so that way when it bakes it becomes nice and flaky and you want to roll it into approximately an 11 inch round and then about a quarter inch in thickness makes you work out your arms it's perfect okay that looks about right I want to roll it on the rolling pin roll it onto the baking sheet but come back over here then I take my filling that's cooled completely and we put it in the middle of the dough so that we can fold the dough over the filling great just kind of move up the edges and I spread it out a little bit just leaving a two inch border everywhere and I take the edges I just fold them over see just like this see if it creates its own little shell so that it keeps all the filling intact and inside and it doesn't really matter how you plead it just make sure there aren't any cracks if there are just press with your fingers and it kind of seals the cracks and look how beautiful that looks and just brush the sides with the egg wash just like that it feels the dough and it allows it to get nice and golden brown there we go okay so now bake it at 400 degrees for 25 minutes until the edges are nice and golden and the insides kind of bubbly and the cheese melts into the apples and then I'm gonna clean up and get my fat filled cooking losing with three different cheeses this dish is decadent and delicious
