hello I need a little support clams Casino is an elegant and classic bite-sized Italian appetizer Little Neck clams are topped with a savory vegetable and punch it to blend and baked with a Parmesan cheese topping each shell holds a tender blend of flavors so good you'll want to savor each one I like to add a little veggie topping to my clams Casino and of course a little pancetta now when this dish was first created in a restaurant called casino in New York City they just topped the the clams with a strip of bacon I'm gonna make it a little more Italian by adding pancetta and some veggies but they're perfect because they're bite-sized you just pop them in your mouth they're so tasty they're so gourmet and they don't take any time at all to make just like that and that's just gonna take a couple minutes so basically the same idea as bacon you're just gonna crisp it up and then it'll add little bits of crispy whites salty little bites to the filling so that it's nice and crispy does it think I'm gonna prep the rest of my veggies I'm gonna add a couple cloves of garlic of course it adds a lot of flavor to the filling so a little bit of garlic shallots and what I love about shallots is they're milder and flavor they're still part of the onion family but they're a little more delicate and this is you know a little delicate appetizer so we're gonna use delicate flavors and that's what shallots give you the same oniony flavor but a little bit milder so we're just gonna slice our shallots okay just like that and you put these around the table and you've always got people that are so excited and they feel like you're really treating them to a great little plate of food with the clams all right smooth these over to the our bowl and we'll let that cool while we make the filling add the olive oil there we go and of course all the flavors on the pancetta that just browned are gonna be in the films we're gonna cook the shallots and the garlic in all of that a little bit of salt bring out all the natural moisture that's in there don't be afraid a little smoke it's good flavor and they're cooking away now we're gonna add red pepper and what I love about the red pepper is the color obviously but the crunch red peppers they've got that nice crunch to them or add pepper straight in see that as a little redness texture in color yummy you have to think when you make these little dishes at a party you want all sorts of different flavors and textures there's something for everyone I'm thinking nibble on satay for just a minute or a little bit of pepper right over the bed add a little bit of white wine basically to pick up all the flavors from the pancetta when we brown the punch it out a little brown bits it also adds a depth of flavor to the filling some oregano just a couple pinches of oregano it's a little bit peppery a little bit lemony that's actually a warmth of flavor to the filling okay and the vegetables just absorb the flavors of the wine it's just yummy and you can smell it mmm so you have a little extra white wine in your fridge just pop a little bit in there and if not you could add a little bit of clam juice to give it that same depth of flavor all righty our filling is ready it's gonna cool and when it's completely cooled I'm gonna add some Parmesan cheese because I don't want to add the hot stuffing to the cold clams so I want this completely cooled add some cheese in the meantime I'm gonna clean my clams I'm just adding some rock salt to my baking sheet that I've actually lined with foil it creates a nice flat surface the shells to lay on as they bake and I had my fish person shuck the clams for me and give me the clams and if you do some shells that way it makes for really pretty presentation people just pick them up and just pop them in the mouth go alright time to clean off the clams they're pretty sand free grit free usually but you want to make double sure rinse them off now we're gonna fill each shell this is gonna be so good perfect I bet my filling this cool so I'm gonna top it with the filling and then pop them in the up so now it's time to add the Parmesan cheese you'll see the Parmesan cheese will absorb all the liquid wine and you liquid from the vegetables makes it nice and crude spoon a little bit on top of each lamb and it adds a beautiful beautiful color on top of the clams and it's gonna add some great flavor chip we're gonna top with a little bit more Parmesan cheese we need to drizzle a little bit of extra-virgin olive oil it adds a little bit more moisture to create that nice golden crust on top okay we're ready to put it in the oven 500 degrees for about 12 minutes
