tonight I'm going to the Los Angeles Philharmonic the concert hall is a unique and stylish landmark so I want my pre concert dinner to stand out but I want to keep it easy too I'll serve a simple pasta rigatoni with an elegant squash puree and shrimp asparagus and zucchini cloody topped with shavings of pecorino romano for dessert a sweet cornmeal cake with aromatic rosemary and a thick balsamic syrup an apple and thyme martinis are fruity but not too sweet cocktail I've dressed up my menu for a perfect pre-concert dinner I want my guests to arrive at the concert with great memories of dinner so dessert has to be outstanding corn meal and rosemary cake with balsamic syrup isn't kid stuff and my guests are gonna love it so I'm gonna start with cornmeal I'm going to use half a cup of fine ground cornmeal then we need 1/2 a cup of cake flour now the cornmeal doesn't have any glutens in it so you have to add something to sort of give structure to the cake and that's what the flour does and now I need a little pinch of salt and some baking powder add one teaspoon of baking powder right into the flour there we go just like that I'm just gonna give it a quick little mix here so now that these are all mixed I'm gonna put this over here and we're gonna start with our wet ingredients so a stick of unsalted butter at room temperature then we need some confectioners sugar and we're gonna add one and a quarter cups of confectioner's sugar also known as powdered sugar and we're also gonna add half a teaspoon of vanilla and the vanilla extract just gives it a nice aromatic scent to it and some sweetness there we go clean the sugar and the butter together and now they're smoothing out so I'm ready to add my exit so I'm going to add two whole eggs and four yolks now the whole eggs kind of give the cake structure we'll just mix those together first and slowly the yolks get absorbed by the butter and the sugar so we're ready to start adding the egg yolks we're gonna do one egg yolk at a time and back to mixing then it's really important to add the egg yolks one at a time to really give it the butter and the sugar time to sort of absorb the yolks next egg yolk just like that so now I want to add a little bit of rosemary now that's what makes this dish special is the rosemary and adds kind of a piney flavor and essence to this cake so we're gonna add a minced rosemary and we're also gonna add some sour cream I know you're wondering sour cream like that well the sour cream adds sort of a Tang eNOS to the cake and also gives it really nice creaminess to so half a cup of sour cream so we'll mix those together it thickens it up - I love those little bits of rosemary inside of the batter it's so pretty now it's time to slowly add to the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients we're gonna add it in three batches there we go a little bit at a time and you want to mix it just enough so it's incorporated we're adding a little bit of air with the paddle attachment you don't want to add all the dry ingredients at once or else all of the air deflates and you don't get that nice tender light cake okay second batch its mixer and these stand mixers are awesome because they do all the work for you so all you have to do is flow the ingredients in there and they sort of mix it all up so now last addition there we go every gal now we're gonna pop this in the oven at 350 degrees for 35 minutes until the top is nice and golden and the sites pull away from the cake pan let's pop it in the oven okay while that cooks I have the topping to make I take a half a cup of balsamic vinegar give just regular store-bought balsamic vinegar what we're gonna do is we're gonna reduce it and we're gonna make a nice thick syrup to pour over the cornmeal cake and that's what makes us so yummy I'm gonna add 1/2 a cup of granulated sugar there we go so it's basically equal parts sugar and while Sonic's vinegar what do you want to do is bring it to a boil and then simmer it for 5 minutes the last thing I want to do it's add a sprig of rosemary and up next I'm going to show you a main course that is perfect for my special night out
