so todd and i got married 10 years ago some friends of ours threw us a beautiful rehearsal dinner the one thing that kind of stood out to me was the cocktail that we had I did a grapefruit Bellini very light very satisfying and that works for both men and women it was probably my favorite thing about the rehearsal dinner my nerves took the best of me and I didn't remember a whole heck of a lot but I do remember how much I loved that drink I'm feeling my grapefruit for my grapefruit and thyme Bellinis these are very festive cocktails and what I'm doing is I'm cutting the ends so I can get a stable sort of grapefruit so I can start to just peel the grapefruit with my knife and what you want to do is just follow the flesh of the grapefruit and cut off the skin and expose a beautiful pink grapefruit and I love pink grapefruit scuzz they're nice and sweet we're done awesome okay let me show you how you segment this looks a little more daunting than it actually is I take a paring knife and I just cut in between the membrane so that I end up with this beautiful little jewel of a grapefruit segments so pretty when you float them at the bottom of the champagne flutes we have a bowl underneath to catch the segment's or also to catch the juice because we're going to use the juice of the grapefruit in the actual drink so now you want to take a few of the segments drop them in the champagne flutes there we go and I'm gonna do a few in here and then a few the last one we're gonna set this aside and we're gonna cut this grapefruit squeeze all the juice out I love freshly squeezed grapefruit juice so yummy perfect this was a juicy one and now we're just gonna pour the grapefruit juice through a fine mesh strainer just to catch any seeds or anything like that that could be in there okay next we're going to add the simple syrup so I made as an easy little simple syrup half a cup of sugar half a cup of water and a whole bunch of time I brought the sugar water up to a boil and then I turned off the heat and I just let it all come down to room temperature it infused the simple syrup with a time flavor nice and citrusy a little bit early now a bottle of Italian Prosecco and Prosecco tends to be a little bit sweeter not quite as dry as champagne a little bit lighter too so we're gonna open this up oh yeah good good good and then we pour it gently and carefully right into the pitcher and see the color is so pretty as well then I take a glass and here we go isn't that nice look at the beautiful little jewels and grapefruit it's so refreshing slightly sweet with a little Irby lemony flavor from the time and that sweetness from the pink grapefruit I taste as good as it looks it's been fun going down memory lane with all of these recipes and now chichi
