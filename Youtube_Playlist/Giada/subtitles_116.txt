while I was waiting for the butter to melt I got a head start on my lobster tails and basically all I did was take a pair of scissors and cut down the back of the lobster just like this and then I take a metal skewer and I just run it down right the bottom side just like that that way the lobster tails aren't gonna curl up so it's going to look really pretty and basically by taking the scissors and cutting down the back of the lobster it makes it easier to eat later on and when I brush it with a lemon butter it kind of seeps into the lobster all right so I'm doubled by lobsters I'm going to wash my hands okay so now I'll show you a little trick there grab a spoon and now that the butter is melted you can see that the milk solids separate from the butter fat and they rise to the top kind of like a floating iceberg so you just basically skim it off the top just like that we'll grab a measuring cup and I pour the melted butter into the measuring cup and you let it cool for a couple minutes and then when it's cooled you'll see that all the the remaining milk solids will be at the bottom so you just pour it and leave that in there in the meantime when I get my lemons three lemons and we're gonna zest three lemon because we're gonna really infuse the lemon into the butter grab zester and here we go it kind of enhances the flavor of the lobster not traditional but citrusy and bright and super yummy that's it we got lots and lots of lemon zest here okay these three and we pour the melted butter on top of the lemon zest and when you pour it you just don't want to pour the whole thing and then that's it cuz all the milk solids whatever was left over is settled on the bottom so you don't to use that and the heat from the butter brings out the flavor in the lemon zest and it makes it nice and lemony there we go okay now show you what I do I take a lobster tail put it down on the tinfoil and I pour some of the warm lemon butter right over the top and then I like to open up the shell just a little bit just like that and kind of brush the lemon butter right inside of it just so it really soaks into the lobster meat that way when it cooks it's gonna be so good succulent and it's gonna have that lemony buttery kind of flavor to it there we go okay pat down and wrap the lobster tail all right I'm gonna get the rest finished up you prepped and then some packing tips to make this lobster bake elegant easy and fun
