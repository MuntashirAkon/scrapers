my steak is nice and cooked with it back nice color and what I want to do is take it off the grill pan I'll turn the grill pan off and I cooked it for about eight minutes on each side so it's nice and medium-rare just the way I like it but it's really important to let the meat sit for a few minutes before you cut into it so all the juices can redistribute that way you get a nice moist piece of steak when you cut into it it's nice and juicy all right so while that's it's I'm gonna make the topping it's kind of a mix between a vinaigrette and a sauce so 1/2 a cup of black olives also garlic so one garlic clove so the garlic in there then three tablespoons of red wine vinegar you need a little acidity to balance the flavors then to bring it all together I'm going to add some Dijon mustard 2 teaspoons and I love the Dijon mustard it's a little more elegant have more flavor than regular mustard a little salt of course right and some pepper now we're going to change it up a little bit I'm gonna add two different oils vegetable oil and olive oil six tablespoons or so of vegetable oil and six tablespoons of olive oil so we split it because the oil balances out the acidity from the red wine vinegar okay so now I just want to give this a quick little whirl okay so now for some freshness and some green parsley I'm just gonna add it right in there cuz I'm gonna let the blender do all the work couple tablespoons or so fresh parsley alright so the vinaigrettes done now it's time to cut the meat there we go and I like to take a ribeye and slice pieces out of it goes there's no way I can eat this entire steak take our plate and load me up and a little vinaigrette see nice and thick and see that's what I mean it's kind of like between a vinaigrette and a sauce a piece of my focaccia and of course we can't forget about the orzo there we go guys oh look at that cheese oh I think my mouth is now just watering from 1 to dig in see nice and pink all right so let's go with the meat first since it's nice and hot perfect little bite hmmm that crush when you earned a salt and pepper so good like around this try this hmmm mushrooms and cheese then we've got the focaccia I got a grape it just bursts alright this is the perfect Steakhouse meal but you can't go to steak house and not have dessert so I have the perfect refreshing light dessert to cap this all off the perfect end to a steakhouse meal is something light and refreshing the citrus semi-fitted they'll end any meal on a high note I want to start by making the custard so we're gonna measure half a cup of sugar and we're making a citrus semifreddo so I'm gonna add lemon juice and lime juice let's take a nice lemon you need about a quarter cup of lemon sometimes that means half a lemon sometimes it means the full lemon there we go this one we're gonna use the whole lemon this is semifreddo it just means an Italian half frozen it's even better than ice cream in my opinion so we're also gonna add a couple tablespoons of lime juice and this is the real kicker we're gonna add some women cello couple tablespoons of limoncello now limoncello is an Italian liqueur it's made of the famous Sorrento lemons a little sugar and alcohol limoncello and a pinch of salt need the salt to bring out all the flavors of the citrus and we're also going to add of course egg yolks right in order to make a custard you need the egg yolks so eight egg yolks I've already separated them start mixing that stuff up and adding one egg yolk at a time and that's what makes the custard so rich are the egg yolks there we go okay and now what I want to do is cook the custard over a double boiler so I have a little bit of water that's simmering you just want the steam that comes off the simmering water to cook the custard and with this mixer we're just gonna keep mixing this for about five minutes until it's thick and creamy
