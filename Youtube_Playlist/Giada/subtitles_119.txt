get ready for the ultimate Italian grilled cheese sandwich mozzarella in Carrozza mozzarella cheese and fresh basil are layered between two slices of bread dipped in beaten eggs and fried in olive oil served with pesto they are deliciously rich finger food this is an Italian version of a grilled cheese sandwich only we deep fry it in olive oil and by the way who doesn't love that and I'm using whole-wheat bread that you could use white bread sourdough anything that you like and the next thing I'm gonna slice my smoked mozzarella now in Naples they make this with regular mozzarella and they kind of sell it right next to the pizza basically the pizzerias and the bakeries they sell pizza and then they sell mozzarella in Carrozza and it means mozzarella in a carriage the bread being the carriage that's carrying the mozzarella so we'll slice that up and we are going to put it on the bread just enough to cover the surface they're so good they're so good now put that aside now we need some basil mmm we do some nice fresh basil leaves sweet little lemony two pieces of that and then a little more cheese well right on top ah and you just put the top slice of bread right there just like a sandwich same thing I'll nibble on those later and we're gonna make the coating thing we're gonna use about a cup of flour and a few eggs just break the eggs will do 4x so the flower actions are protective barrier basically for the bread so it doesn't get soggy or oily and then the eggs create this crunch now you want to make sure and do this with your hands and then into the eggs oh there we go take the next one it's a little messy but it's worth it get some flour everywhere so that the egg sticks to the flour too okay and into the egg it's kind of fun my mom always had these ready for us to munch on and she leave him at room temperature and we just come in and she'd cut him a little triangles we pop him in her mouth good stuff all right I am ready to fry up the sandwiches so I'm gonna grab my spatulas we'll put one underneath there like that I'm also gonna grab I'm of an itchy a couple of admits just to make sure you want to be careful when you're frying that you don't fry yourself okay so take the proper precautions if you just leave it in a couple of minutes on each side just get that nice golden crust that's it that's all you're looking for and then you cut them in a triangle in your munch he's creating a crust I rig there we go got that one off hold this one out and put it right here on this cooling rack and I put a rack on top of the baking sheet that way the oil can seep out of it and we can sort of drain so it's not really oily and as soon as this one's ready we'll flip it will cook it until it's golden brown the other side a couple minutes then we're ready to cut it up and get
