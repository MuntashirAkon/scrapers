I started shopping some vegetables for my Moroccan inspired Swiss chard rolls these are super yummy and they're sort of savory and sweet all in one there very filling and satisfying but they're also very light and beautiful and kind of transport you to another place when you eat them chop up two carrots and an onion here you want to give it a nice flavor I know I think a lot of times people get a little scared when you talk about things like the vegetarian style dishes but they can have a lot of flavor it's just about giving lots of different ingredients so we're gonna start with the basic which is onion carrots and reinforce a little bit of an onion flavor a little bit milder though we're gonna add a few scallions and I like the scallions a little more exotic we're gonna add tofu to this little coconut milk curry and cumin to add warmth next some garlic we're just gonna use one clove of garlic so not a lot of garlic I don't want the garlic to overpower the the warm spices that we're gonna add to this you know my mom's a vegetarian so I'm always looking to create new vegetarian dishes that look really pretty and kind of make your mouth water perfect just chop that up next we're gonna add some ginger slightly spicy but not in a heat Conaway more than a warming kind of way I'm just gonna grate it adds a little exotic flavor to the Swiss Charles take all off the other side let's give this a nice little stir stir picking up mmm that ginger smells good plus ginger really is great for the body alright so now for some spices we're gonna add some cumin and some curry powder so we're gonna start with good old cumin very warming spices we're gonna use one teaspoon of ground cumin and then two teaspoons of curry powder and curry powder is a mixture of lots of different spices it's got cinnamon it's got turmeric for color it's got a little cardamom and what you want to do is sort of toast them ever so slightly we're gonna add 1/2 a cup of golden raisins for a little sweetness and a little chewiness these are Jade's favorite yeah a little bit of tofu so instead of adding meat I'm gonna add tofu for a little bit of protein bring add six ounces of extra firm tofu and you definitely want extra firm tofu so that it holds its shape it's a bean curd used a lot in Asian cooking cut it and kind of cubes nothing too big nothing too small give it a nice color and flavor too next we're gonna add a little bit of coconut milk you want to make this um slightly creamy so instead of adding cheese we're gonna add coconut milk instead it gives it a nice sweetness as well as making it nice and creamy and we're just gonna add a half a cup of coconut milk so not a lot and then give it a nice mix to add a little bit of body to this I just cooked half a cup of brown rice and half a cup of wild rice and I cooked in a little vegetable broth and that little piece of ginger I like the combo because it gives it a bit of nuttiness and texture difference but you could use just brown rice you can even use white rice if you want to or all wild rice it's kind of up to you and toss the rice right into the veggies and tofu and coconut milk and allow it all to heat through and give the rice a chance to absorb all those flavors now I just want to give us a quick little taste to make sure the seasoning is just right go back yes mcleaney I got to raising a little sweetness and he's a little salt little pepper hmm can turn that off we've got our water boiling we're gonna grab some Swiss chard leaves you buy Swiss chard at the grocery store very similar to like romaine lettuce except a lot greener and what I like to do is cut the rib out because I want to roll these with a filling and then for this purpose I don't want them to be too long so I cut the leaves in half then what I do is I place them in some boiling salted water to make them a little bit softer I've got my baking dish that I already greased and at the bottom of the baking dish I'm gonna put some spicy tomato sauce a little out of yata and I like the spiciness with the creaminess of the filling but you could definitely use just regular tomato sauce if you don't put the spiciness and we'll just spread it out and this just helps the Swiss chard rows so that they don't stick to the bottom of the pan move this over we're gonna grab a plate lined with some paper towel and my tongs they only need to be in the water for like 30 seconds and as you're doing this you can put more into the water take the paper and blot this was chard we can take it and put it on the board now I want to do is just take some of the filling and put it right there and roll it up and see how easy it is to roll it up once you blanched it a little bit and then I land it right on top of the tomato sauce and then we're gonna add more tomato sauce on top and put in a 400 degree oven for about 30 minutes until it warm through and the top is nice and crispy and it's gonna be absolutely divine all right I'm gonna finish up the rest of my Swiss chard rolls and then we're gonna get started on my little piece if day one of my favorite French salads transformed into a mini Italian pizza
