my husband Todd is surfing today with his friend Chuck so while the guys do that I'm gonna prepare a hearty meal to warm them up after an action-packed day on the water white bean and chicken chili cannellini beans Swiss chard and layers of spice for a fiery kick cheddar and scallion bread crunchy ciabatta smothered in cheese it's especially great dipped in chili and for a cool finish limoncello granita it's sweet creamy and silky smooth a casually elegant meal that appeals to the surfer and everyone certain point first up a lemon simple syrup for my limoncello granita it's really easy water sugar some lemon zest and lemon juice bring it to a boil and let it cool down completely now that the lemon simple syrup is cooled we're ready to start a limoncello granita add the lemon simple syrup right into the food processor it's so great because the food processor do all the work for us and it's really important to let that cool completely so that way you can put it directly into the freezer and it won't curdle the cheese so we're gonna add some mascarpone cheese now this isn't a traditional thing for granitas because usually it's just a little bit of flavoring and a simple syrup but mascarpone cheese really does make it super creamy and light usually with a granita you have to scrape it every hour after you put it in the freezer not with this one you put it in for hours you let it sit it comes out and it's ready to eat so we're gonna add 1 cup of mascarpone cheese and you want to make sure that the mascarpone is at room temperature so that way everything blends together really nicely then for the star of my granita my limoncello now limoncello is a lemon liqueur it's made of fermented lemon peel and it's made in Italy but every Italian region has their own way of making it believe it or not and really the difference is just how many lemons you actually use to make it and how long you ferment it for we're using half a cup of limoncello then nowadays you can find it everywhere so it's really easy and it's really really good and just a pinch of salt just to bring out the flavors of the lemon and you know granita is very similar to a sorbet and this one is actually going to be more similar to a sherbert in that it's creamy and that's it so the food processor does all the work then we grab just a glass baking dish and then you just pour it right in there nice and creamy thick and frothy you pop it in the freezer for four hours and it's all done is that easy I love it so now we're gonna go from cold to hot I'm gonna start with my white bean and chicken chili it's very hearty and really yummy and I think it's gonna be perfect for Todd and his friend when they come back from spending the whole day in the water I want to heat up my Dutch oven and while that heats up grab my knife and I want to do I was trying to chop an onion and four garlic cloves cuz this is kind of an Italian this is known as a sofrito that's sort of the flavorings and kind of flavors the whole chili and I really like making chili but the white bean chili for me is my favorite I love white beans cannellini beans because they're super creamy and it depends on how you like your onion and I like it chopped up now it's gonna cook for a while so the onion will fall apart no matter what but remember the smaller you chop it the quicker it's gonna cook into the pan see it's nice and hot and that's what you want and I like lots of onion in it and once it's cooked down I need to come sweet so it's really good then four garlic cloves and I know it sounds like a lot but you really need it especially because chicken can sometimes not have a lot of flavors you want to add a lot of flavoring to it three and four it's funny you know when you have a garlic head that is super tight it just means that the cloves are very very fresh now I like to mince the garlic but you can also leave it whole if you want to and then take it out there we go close now we'll give it a quick little chop and a little bit of salt just want the onion and the garlic to sweat you know to really cook down softly and slowly it's really good and some black pepper give it a little stir you just want to cook this couple minutes just until the onion starts to soften and you can smell the garlic it's something great about garlic a minute and hit something hot it just feels roma fills the whole kitchen so let's let that sit for just a minute and cook down a bit I'm gonna grab my spices so I need chilli powder oregano cumin and fennel seeds and this is the secret and it's what makes it really really good so we'll start with chili powder we need its tablespoons of teaspoons 2 teaspoons of chili powder now the chili powder is classic in a chili and it gives it that nice deep color then we've got one tablespoon of dried oregano and I like to oregano it's nice and earthy so we've got one tablespoon of dried oregano and then we've got the cumin two tablespoons of cumin and the cumin is what adds the warmth not a spiciness but nice warmth and again it's a classic ingredient and we're just basically toasting the spices and the herbs just because it's gonna add more flavor to the chili and I love doing that and one tablespoon of fennel seeds it's kinda like licorice and that's it those are all the flavorings so we're done with that and you just want to toast them for like I don't know a minute or so is enough you know that's what they do in Indian cooking too they toast all of the spices that just brings out all the flavors so now I just make a little room at the bottom of the pan add a little bit more olive oil just because we're gonna add the chicken and chicken doesn't have a lot of fat so it needs a little help otherwise it'll burn and we've got two pounds of ground white each chicken just take that off and you can use any kind of meat you want turkey beef pork combination anything but I'm sticking to the chicken the chicken in the white bean I'm liking that and break that up let's go ahead and cook it and break it we're gonna add a little bit more salt just to flavor the chicken cuz like I said the chicken needs lots of flavoring alright so we're gonna let the chicken continue to cook and I'm not done yet I gather a lot more flavorings to add to this chili party layers of beans and veggies make this chili a stick-to-your-ribs favorite
