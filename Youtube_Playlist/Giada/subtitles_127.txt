I started melting some chocolate for my s'more brownie bites these are sort of a mixture between the flavors of a s'more and the texture of brownies but they're little in the decadent so I just melted a stick of unsalted butter with 3/4 of a cup of mini chocolate chips now that it's melted I want to turn off the stove and pour this beautiful smooth melted chocolate right into this bowl add half a cup of sugar then we're going to add two eggs and the eggs are going to thicken this up and of course bind it it's a very very easy brownie batter to make so 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract for a little bit of gourmet sweetness so now we're gonna start blending this all together you just want to blend this until you get a nice smooth mixture it's gonna be can buy and add marshmallows and graham cracker now we're gonna add half a cup of regular all-purpose flour make sure you really measure it out that when we get the right consistency and thickness half a cup of quinoa flour and quinoa flour as you can see is very very fine it adds a nutty flavor to the brownies mix it until it gets nice and thick half a cup of mini chocolate chips you know what I love the most about cakes and brownies is when you bite into them and they have chocolate chips inside and it adds another like layer of chocolate which i think is always necessary but once you add these you want to just fold them in instead of using the mixer so you don't break up the mini chocolate chips so what you want to do now we grab a little bit and we go straight into the mini muffin tray then you take three little mini marshmallows and stick them right inside look how cute these are then I take the crushed graham crackers sprinkle them right over the top aren't they cute all right so I'm going to finish the rest of my little s'more brownie bites pop in the oven at 350 for about 10 to 12 minutes until the marshmallows are lightly golden my s'more brownie bites baked at 350 for 12 minutes and you can see that the marshmallows slightly melt and they becomes pale golden brown color the graham cracker is kind of set into the chocolate so now I get to taste it and they're still warm
