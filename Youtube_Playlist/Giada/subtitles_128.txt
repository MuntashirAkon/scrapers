in a bowl of lemony broth this dish is beautiful and delicious the first thing I want to do for my salmon dish is start sauteing the shallot so I'm just gonna slice off the sides here and peel it and they're just have a very mild flavor it's very delicate and it doesn't overpower the salmon or the lemon predicta which is what I'm gonna make and the little blue did though basically it just means a light broth and Italian a little bit of olive oil and we'll just add the shallots right in there a little bit of salt as soon as those start to soften we'll add the chicken stock the lemon juice and lemon zest in the meantime I'm gonna get started on my pea puree it's just thought out frozen pizzas then add a little fresh flavor submit it's just one of those Hardy herbs that's super clean and in Italy they use it for both sweet and savory dishes and we're also going to add the garlic clove let's give it a quick little whirl all right now let's see here the shallots there we go now let's add the chicken broth and some lemon zest it's a really easy way to sort of make a very elegant broth to serve with the salmon perfect now just want to roll out the lemon a little bit and add some juice but as you can see it's very very easy because I after add the lemon juice it's basically done you just let it simmer for a couple of minutes and that's it ready to add the olive oil in the pea puree so as I pulse this I'm going to add the olive oil the olive oil is gonna add a richness but also bring the pea puree together and smooth it out there we go perfect now I'm gonna add a little bit of salt and a little bit of pepper but see how bright green that is I love that you can do that with carrots potatoes squash zucchini basically artichokes anything you want you can make a puree out of so any kind of vegetable it works with again I'm just gonna pour it into my little bowl now I'm gonna add grated Parmesan cheese to this right at the end because I'd like to keep sort of the integrity of the texture of the Parmesan cheese and the heat of the blades can actually change the flavor the Parmesan cheese so I like to add it right at the end do that see that's coming along now we can turn that off and it's time to start cooking the salmon there we go a little bit of salt and pepper on our salmon fillets and a little bit of olive oil just like that perfect yeah let's see our pan should be nice and hot yep we've the heat about medium all right and we'll get our salmon fillets right in there I'm just gonna see them this side right in the pan a little bit of salt course right and from supper my family's gonna cook for about 5 minutes till you get a nice golden crust on the outside and medium air on the inside just the way I like it time to add Parmesan cheese to my peepee right I'm going to add about a half a cup of Parmesan cheese grated freshly grated Parmesan cheese so that's done now let's see we can flip our salmon show you how to serve this or do a little bit of beetle dig so see the bits of shallots we go a little bit more perfect now you do a little bit of the pea puree nice color nice texture right in the middle like that salmon fillet right on top like that and then for finishing touch I just add a little sprig of mint you could add more pure a a little less and just serve it like that and it just it makes for the most fantastic meal but up next I'm gonna make the greens fans favorite cookies cuisine
