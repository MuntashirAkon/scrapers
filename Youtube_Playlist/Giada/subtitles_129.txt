you can bite and you can buy jarred but what I like to do is make it from scratch I'm talking about tomato sauce something that is very simple to cook and store you can toss it with any kind of pasta or dress it up with your favorite ingredients for something a bit harder all it takes is a few basic ingredients and in less than 30 minutes you've got a simple tomato sauce for my tomato sauce I like to use a heavy enameled cast iron pot and the reason i like to use it it just distributes the all the heat evenly my vegetables that I'm going to use and my tomato sauce so it doesn't burn the bottom but if you don't have it any stock pot will work just make sure and stir the sauce often so it doesn't stick to the bottom and burn so first I'm going to heat it up just a medium-low heat so by the time I'm done cutting up all my vegetables my pot will be warm I'm going to add a little bit of extra virgin olive oil and add so much flavor to the vegetables I like to use these yellow onions a little bit sweeter and milder and then they use my knife myself make a little slit a little incision and then I'm going to peel the outer skin off of it and we're going to cut it in half that way I can get a nice firm grip on my onion and it doesn't roll around my cutting board first I cut the onion vertically then I cut it horizontally and that makes dicing easier we'll add a little bit of sea salt to draw out all the moisture out of the onion next we're going to add some garlic when you're buying garlic you want to look for a tight firm head or bulb and a nice white color tip my knife pound it run on it it makes it easier to peel you want to make sure and not burn your garlic it becomes bitter when it turns a dark brown color and it makes the whole sauce bitter so I'm going to slowly sweat my vegetables but just means allowing all the natural sugars and liquid to come out of them immediately the aroma is all that sweet pungent flavor comes out of the garlic since it hits the heat now this onion garlic carrot and celery mixture is known as a mirepoix it's just a base flavor for making stews and sauces the carrot adds a fresh sweetness to the sauce okay so these are starting to sweat so I'm going to add one more layer of flavor here which is bay leaf they're really wonderful and flavoring tomato sauces and stocks and stews but you can't eat them they're have a rough leaf and we're going to take it out at the end and won't eat it leave that alone we're going to get our canned tomatoes ready I like to use crushed canned tomatoes they're picked and canned when they're the rightist they make a really hearty thick wonderful sauce seasoned it a little sea salt some fresh ground black pepper you're going to let it simmer for an hour so some of the water will evaporate and we'll get a nice thick sauce and you know I love to make the sauce once every couple weeks and then I just store it in my refrigerator or my freezer because I use it so often in everyday cooking that it's just great to have so every day I don't have to sit here and make sauce so handy and it's just so delicious
