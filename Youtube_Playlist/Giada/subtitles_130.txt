Cheers tea tea dessert is a must I've got a family recipe that promises to Wow Italian doughnuts it's so easy because I use store-bought pizza dough they can be enjoyed warm with a dusting of cinnamon sugar or dipped in gooey chocolate and crowned with crushed espresso beans or toasted almonds who doesn't like donuts well I know that I love donuts and this is the way my mom used to make donuts for us and the kid take some pizza dough and all you have to do is buy pizza dough from either the grocery store or go to your favorite pizzeria and ask them for a ball of dough make sure it's nice and cold flour the surface a little bit and we're gonna roll it out these are so much fun you have to roll it out until it's a half an inch thick and then we're gonna deep-fry now who does my deep fried dough I don't know many people who don't and in Italy these are very similar to a Tuscan donut called bomboloni okay just roll it out just like that get the air out of it and I'm gonna take a cookie cutter and I'm just gonna make sure that it doesn't stick so we're gonna put some flour over the dough and then we're gonna cut out circles see just like that then I'm gonna take this little one-inch little cookie cutter let's see pile these up over here and go around and just cut them so I've used half vegetable oil which is really like to the bottom to the top and the thing is you don't wanna over fry these you don't want these to become a really dark color because it'll make the dough too tough on the inside 45 seconds per side and they'll still be sort of pale my first ones are almost ready that's it for a minute I'll show you how to make a topping this is the easiest topping and this is the one that my mom made the most very popular just take some granulated sugar and some cinnamon ground-up cinnamon mmm smells like Christmas it has a little spice to it so it gives the donuts a little bit of spicy flavor perfect cinnamon sugar done now this one's ready as you can see nice and pale in color but they puffed up there we go okay so now I'm just gonna dust them I'm actually dredge them and some cinnamon sugar the trick to putting the topping of the cinnamon sugar on these donuts is that they're still hot so the cinnamon sugar sticks to them just like that and guess what now you're ready to pop in my mouth how often you get to eat a warm doughnut straight out of oil like crunchy and perfectly sweet remember the best way to make donuts I promise you gotta try it not only is the cinnamon sugar fantastic but I like to dip it blue ganache now ganache is a French word for basically melted chocolate with heavy cream and that beautiful we can top it in some nuts some toasted almonds so I take slivered almonds I toasted them and then I sort of break them up with my fingers and there you go another fantastic looking doughnut and let's see we'll do another one here we'll do it again in the almonds and you could top it with any nuts you want it can be walnuts it could be hazelnuts I just happen to love the almonds you could even do white chocolate dark chocolate it works really well with the milk chocolate here and now in espresso beans it's got a kind of a strong contrast flavor now this looks heavenly doesn't it this is perfection
