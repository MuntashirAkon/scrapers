so while my vegetable parmesan is baking I'm gonna get started on my artichoke and being crostini so what I'd like to do is cut up some rustic bread great so now just drizzle the top with a little bit of olive oil we're gonna bake them at 375 degrees about 10 minutes just until they get nice and golden brown while those bake up and they're clean up here and grab the rest of the ingredients make the puree so we need some artichokes some pecorino some prosciutto there we go we'll use the prosciutto a little bit pecorino a little bit we're gonna start with the artichokes I always have frozen artichokes and I like to make dips or put them in soups do lots of different things with them it just makes eating artichokes really easy cuz you don't have to clean them or do anything with them but you want us to follow them out so just take them out of the freezer and let them thaw in the fridge and because they're packed when they're really sweet and right do really good in the step so now that we have the artichokes we'll grab the beans and the lemon so I'm using some cannellini beans what's important when you use canned beans is that you drain and rinse them because that way you get rid of all the extra salt if they're packed in do a little bit of salt and pepper and lemon so the lemon is that ingredient that kind of perfumes the whole dip and makes all the flavors really come out so I had about a teaspoon of lemon zest and then we'll do three teaspoons of lemon juice and already smell so bright and sunny it really does it puts a big little smile on your face all right we're done with that so now roll it and we only need half of a lemon if you get a nice juicy lemon you'll get three teaspoons out of half eleven a little acidity to kind of counterbalance the creaminess of the beans and the flavor of the artichoke basil again it puts a smile on your face cuz it's so fresh and yummy the food processor tends to bruise things like basil they're very delicate so I'm just chopping it up so it doesn't get caught in the blades now we need a little cheese about a cup of pecorino romano and the pecorino is very similar to Parmesan cheese it's a lot Tangier and Parmesan cheese but it's similar process that it's aged in and if I could punch it so it adds a nice like salt effective perfect there we go and put the pecorino right in there it smells so good still buttery has a nice strong flavor to it which is really really good so now I want to give this a quick little whirl that perfect so now I want to add a quarter cup of olive oil now I just want to clean down the sides it's nice and thick just make sure that everything is really well incorporated sometimes things kind of fly up on the sides perfect perfect my assault perfect everything tastes really good alright so that's ready now we got something else we got to do here I I'm gonna start with my first shoot though so this is how I like to put the prosciutto in the oven to get it nice and crispy I take a little bit of vegetable spray and I spray baking sheet just like that grab the prosciutto and I went to the butcher and hadn't sliced the prosciutto super thin that way when I put it in the oven only takes a few minutes to get it nice and crispy and here we go with the prosciutto just need four slices that's it I just put them on there sometimes it can be a little tricky to take apart when there's thin now remember when you put them in the oven and it kind of intensifies that salty bite that salty flavor of the prosciutto that's kind of what I want plus it's crunchy you always want a little bit of a crunch so it's like crunchy on the bottom and creamy in the middle and then crunch on the top up next I'm gonna show you how to put all of this together get the vegetable parmesan out of the oven and make my melon and mid flush
