I've shredded the chicken that I cooled and cooked season with salt and pepper see look how good that looks so we've got the chicken now we've got mushrooms onions and garlic some thyme and why mmm perfect - I think the leg weedy are telling me something they want act ok let's get that ball out and we're gonna toss it now the heat from the linguine will really heat the mushrooms and the chicken and don't worry oh this is going back in the oven so it's mostly all cooked but just in case it's all gonna get reheated now the great Luba Chanel sauce perfect it's warm but not hot we're gonna pour it all over the top look at that isn't that make your mouth water whoo these guys luckiest guys in town I'd say that's music to my ears perfect so now I'm gonna add some parsley you don't have to but I love it fresh parsley new brightness a little fresh flavor in your mouth throw that right on top and I like to add some peas they're thawed and I don't even cook them and the heat will just slowly make them perfect so there's no need to throw them in any boiling water you don't wanna overcook them or else they get sort of chewy and not good okay so that was about 3/4 of a cup of frozen peas I'm just gonna pour this whole mixture into my buttered baking pan now for the topping breadcrumbs and I'm using Italian style store-bought breadcrumbs I'm not making my own that's plain breadcrumbs and some fresh grated closed on cheese let me down with a job a little cheese right on top and we're going to mix that together your hands and just pour it right over the top so you've got a nice crust on top that's thick it's not just a really thin crust it's too thin and get wet and we're gonna dot it with a little bit of butter and the butter helps create that a dark brown crust you know that was my favorite part to eat as a kid I didn't care so much about the inside of the pasta I just wanted to crust okay that looks like enough butter this is gonna go in a 450 degree oven for 25 minutes and by that time the boys will be back from their bike ride after a tough workout don't forget your reward dessert my raspberry almond tart is worth working up a sweat for I feel a light puff pastry shell with fresh whipped cream its crowned with juicy fresh raspberries a light dusting of cocoa powder finishes it off raspberry almond tart is healthy and heaven I love the convenience of puff pastry you can find this puff pastry in a frozen section of your grocery store it makes making dessert so easy and so much fun we're going to take one of these sheets you want to thaw just a little bit and we're going to just fold it like that and what I want to do is cut three quarter inch borders on the sides of the puff pastry as straight as possible go down each side take it that sounds well this marble board keeps the puff pastry cold so it doesn't stick or melt just apply a little bit of pressure I'm gonna make it into a nice square now what I want to do is I have one egg that I've beaten I just want to brush the edges here because we're going to put the sides back on use your fingers to help you along make sure that they they stick together press it down stick together the egg will act as a glue to help that happen creates a nice border towards an almond filling now I'm just gonna brush the edges because I want them to turn nice golden brown in the oven I want the guys to wood all over it I'm going to take my fork and prick just hope the sides back up again I'm gonna bake it in a 400 degree oven for 20 minutes and when it's cooled I'm gonna fill it with an almond raspberry filling
