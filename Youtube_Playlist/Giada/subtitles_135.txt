so I've started making my marshmallow stirs from my white hot chocolate and what I did is I just melted some semi-sweet chocolate and I'm dipping the marshmallows in the chocolate look at that and I put these little popsicle sticks right in there so that it's really easy to swirl them in the hot white chocolate and we're going to pop them in the fridge the chocolate sets and let me grab my vanilla flavored almond milk so I'm gonna make this with almond milk instead of regular milk which i think is gonna be really fun I've got six cups that we're going to heat up and I thought I would give this white hot chocolate I'm nutty your flavor or grab a couple of spices here so I'm going to make this super super yummy what we're going to do is add a little bit of cinnamon a little bit of nutmeg so we're going to do one teaspoon of cinnamon and cinnamon adds a nice warmth nice and sweet it's kind of like a bear hug that's what I always think and we're gonna add a quarter teaspoon of nutmeg so not a lot because nutmeg tends to be quite strong it's warm but it's not as sweet as a cinnamon it's very spicy without being hot which I think the kids are gonna really like and let's give this a quick little stir and nutmeg works really well with anything creamy all right so the almond milk has heated up nicely and it's just barely simmering so we're gonna turn off the heat I'm gonna start adding three bars of white chocolate last bar I think this will be really fun to drink out of our little camping cups over there let's give it a stir and slowly start melting the white chocolate and you want to do this off the heat so that the white chocolate doesn't settle to the bottom and burn so we're gonna add a tablespoon of agave I'm using vanilla flavored almond milk but it's unsweetened so you do want to add a little bit of sweetener and they got a melts beautiful in here it's not as sweet as sugar so I really like it the white chocolate has melted little a little bit now let's grab the marshmallow stir just gonna grab one gotta save the rest for everybody else and see how the chocolate sets right on the marshmallow and then you dip it in there it slowly starts to melt it and warm through look at that if that isn't decadent I don't know what is you
