you can't try to scan cooking without some kind of bean dish this is one of my favorites warm cannellini bean salad is a tuscan specialty that fits in anywhere what sets this dish apart from other beam dishes are the fresh herbs the fresh sage and thyme now first I'm going to add some extra virgin olive oil into my pan and we're going to heat up all the ingredients a couple cloves of garlic and you know Tuskens love beings there's a lot of different beam dishes and this happened through my favorite and again you can use as much garlic as you like you just don't want this dish to be overpowered by the taste of garlic and we're just gonna heat it up you don't want it to turn dark brown or burn because it becomes very bitter so now we need some sage about a tablespoon or so mmm smells good has like a musty minty taste you can use as much or as little sage as you like but I happen to love sage so I'm going to use a lot and sage grows very easily in Italy so that's why we also use a lot of it and we're gonna use about a teaspoon or so of fresh thyme when you're buying herbs you always want to look for vibrant green color of the leaves and the stems and no wilting or browning sometimes beans can be a little bit boring in their flavor so you want to enhance them with lots of fresh herbs and extra virgin olive oil garlic all right perfect so now let's add some of the herbs and again we're not cooking the herbs we're just warming them up the heat brings out all the aroma and the fragrance now for the tomatoes and now I'm using canned tomatoes they just have more juice and they work really well in this traditional bean dish and I can make them all year round because these tomatoes are sweet look at those colors vibrant red with the green from the herbs looks great all right we're gonna cook that for just a couple of minutes and the meantime I'm ready for my beans and i'm using cannellini bean which is a type of Tuscan bean you can definitely use dried beans and Phil come overnight and cook some but just to make my life easier i like to use canned beans I'm off to the sink to rinse the beans it's important to rinse off canned beans just to wash away the flavors of the can and a liquid that it's Gordon while I'm here I'm grabbing my arugula it's almost time to plate up of course the beans are cooked so all I'm doing is just blending all the flavors of the herbs and the tomatoes and flavoring them a little bit salt and some freshly ground black pepper and just reheating them because the warmth of the beans and the herbs and the tomatoes will slowly start to wilt the arugula and that's what makes it so wonderful one more little added flavor some prosciutto and I've got some thinly sliced prosciutto here and I just want to quickly dice it this just adds sort of a salty layer of flavor to the dish and we don't even really have to cook it we're just gonna reheat it really quick it just needs it I really feel that bean dishes are fantastic as long as you flavor them you really flavor them that's ready and we're gonna toss the warm beans with the prosciutto and tomatoes and sage and thyme right over the arugula there we go okay this is gonna go so perfectly with my chicken Florentine oh I cannot wait all right now I'm gonna take a look at that su cocktail cake because it's been sitting in the fridge for three hours and I think it's ready oh my gosh it looks so good and it's gonna look even better once I unmold it and decorate it that's up next
