I'm cutting my pizza dough for my niece Wacha today and basically it's like a Nicoise salad on a pizza so they're really fun I'm just taking a four inch cookie cutter and cutting out some store-bought pizza dough to make these I like them a little bit smaller though easier to eat when I have a spa day it's nicer to have smaller bits of food rather than you know a big old pizza that you cut in pieces everybody gets their own little beat City so the topping and the idea behind this is that the tapenade made of the Nicoise olives is actually all the flavors that you would find in a Nicoise salad so we're gonna use 1 cup of Nicoise olives and I like them because they're nice and rich and you can buy them I'm already pitted so it makes it really easy then we're gonna add one garlic clove again not overpowering with the garlic there we go we're also gonna add a little little lemon juice just to lighten the flavors up when I make a Nicoise salad I like to make a little lemon vinaigrette to go with everything kind of brightens up the flavors of the tuna and everything so instead this time I'm adding the lemon juice and the fresh citrus flavor into the tapenade then for a little bit of a bright sort of Irby flavor we're gonna add some rosemary and a little bit of thyme the rosemary is sort of slightly minty which I really like it's nice and earthy so it really stands up when you bake it in the oven you want herbs that are nice and hearty and then the thyme is nice and lemony so it works really well with the lemon that we just added in there kind of brightens up all of the flavors we'll just chop this up okay put that right in there we're gonna add some capers so I just buy some capers and then I just rinse and drain them it takes away some of the up saltiness of the capers then anchovies now a lot of times in Nicoise salad you will find anchovies as a kid I grew up eating lots of anchovies especially on my pizza so we're gonna use two anchovy fillets it's that little bit of salty bite that you just don't get um from regular salt you know you could also use anchovy paste if it's easier to kind of give it a little bit of moisture a little bit of extra-virgin olive oil about two tablespoons or so just so we can blend this all together so now let's blend it until it's smooth Oh smells so good so rich it looks so so pretty alright now here we go we are just gonna take some of the tapenade make sure that it's nice and and creamy and smooth so that you can spread it out on top of each piece of pizza dough so this is going to take the place of any tomato sauce what we're gonna do is we're just gonna slice some tomato and we're basically gonna put a slice of tomato on top of the tapenade place it right on top kind of push it ever so slightly so the tomato can stick to the tapenade and then I drizzle a little bit of olive oil just to keep the tomato nice and moist and give it a golden color we're gonna put these in the oven at 400 degrees for about 15 or 20 minutes and up next I'm gonna show you how to finish these guys off
