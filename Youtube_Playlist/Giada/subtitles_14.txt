so I have to granny smith apples for my roasted apple pies with whipped cream so i cut the apples in half after I've peeled them and then I'm gonna slice them again just like that I'm gonna cut all the core out of all of these there we go these are really fun this is kind of a really easy way to make apple pie and second Apple now it wouldn't be apple pies with a little cinnamon sugar so we're gonna do a tablespoon of cinnamon and a quarter cup of sugar I love cinnamon it's so comforting then I take a fork and I kind of just mix it all together perfect so now I take all of the apples and take a spoon and just toss all the apples in the cinnamon sugar just make sure cuz they kind of stick together sometimes to separate the apple slices so that all the cinnamon sugar coats over each Apple and then you bake them and make sugar caramelizes on the baking sheet and they get like this dark golden brown color there we go that's perfect so now I grab my baking sheet and I've line a baking sheet with a Silpat a Silpat is just a silicone coated baking sheet that nothing sticks to but you can always use parchment paper if you want to and then I just take the apples and just kind of line them up like that okay so now we've got all of our apples I know what glob I love apples and cinnamon all right so let's pop this in a 400 for about 12 to 15 minutes until they're nice and dark brown and the sugar is caramelized let's grab the pie crust out of the fridge I got my whipping cream too so I can make whipped cream later on so now I've got my pie crust and I'm totally cutting a corner obviously by buying pie crust but these days they have really good pie price at the store son this just makes my life a little easier I take a three-inch cookie cutter and we're just gonna cut little discs out of it and we should get eight little disks seven and eight and just lay them on and again this baking sheet is also lined with a Silpat so that the pie crust doesn't stick to it there we go and we're gonna bake these off at 400 degrees as well and the trick here is that you don't want to put the pie crust in the oven with the apples cuz the apples have a lot of moisture and it's not good for pastry to cook in an oven where there's a lot of moisture otherwise it'll get soggy and you won't have these nice crisp little discs and you just want to use the fork and prick the top of the pie discs because you don't want them to rise too much you want to be nice and thin perfect so we'll pop this in the lower oven and those are gonna bake for about eight to ten minutes until they're light and golden brown so now we get rid of this and we start with the whipped cream my bowl a measuring cup and a little beater here so whipped cream 1/2 a cup of whipping cream can't really have apple pie without some whipped cream you just got to have it so we'll do some whipping cream let's start whipping it up alright time for the powdered sugar and it's just a couple tablespoons of powdered sugar add that right in there and the powdered sugar is nice and fine so it kind of dissolves in the whip cream really well so let's mix that in whipped cream is done nice stiff peaks I'm nice and sweet too this is good all right I'm gonna leave this in the fridge so it stays nice and cold Karolina should be here any minute and then we're gonna put this all together and have a great lunch
