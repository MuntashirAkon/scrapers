so it's time to make my pizza Bianca with kale and meatballs I just got some store-bought pizza dough and I'm spreading it out on a baking sheet I put a little bit of olive oil down on the baking sheet first you want to make sure that the dough isn't very cold because it'll be easier to spread out we're gonna move it and we're gonna get started on our fish amel we're gonna start with two tablespoons of butter unsalted two tablespoons of flour we're making a roux and then we're gonna add milk to it to make the cream sauce that we're going to put on the pizza melt the butter and the flour together until the butter has absorbed all of the flour and it's called pizza Bianca because there's no red sauce on this pizza stir this for like a minute or so just to cook out that raw flour flavor we're gonna add one cup of room temperature milk you want to make sure all of the ingredients are room temperature so nothing ceases one bay leaf just for flavor it just kind of adds a deep warmth some salt some pepper and a little bit of nutmeg about an eighth of a teaspoon of nutmeg to give the cream sauce some flavor and some depth and last but not least we're gonna add one garlic clove just to infuse a little bit of garlic flavor into this fish about just kind of kind of leave it whole whisk it for like two three minutes until it thickens alright so the bishop mal is done and I'll show you with the spoon what it's supposed to look like turn it off and what I do is I usually dip in the back of the spoon and then I go like that and if it stays separate then you know it's ready now time to take out the bay leaf we're done with that and we're also going to take out the garlic clove we take my pizza dough I'm going to juice a little bit of olive oil on the top and then we're going to core the bechamel take a spatula and just spread the bechamel and leave about a one-inch border now we need the mozzarella so we've got some shredded mozzarella mozzarella melts beautifully we're gonna add 3/4 of a cup move it on so I've got my 8 8 balls left over from before they cut them all in half it's gonna make it a lot easier to put them on the pizza we're gonna top it with more cheese 1/2 a cup of grated Parmesan cheese right over the top what we're gonna do is we're gonna put this in a 450 degree oven about 15 minutes so it's time to add the kale on top of the pizza we're taking two medium-sized kale leaves I'm taking out the rib you feel like you're eating some greens in the whole thing so you feel better about getting it what I want to do is just kind of chop the leaves you want to kind of cut them a little small so that the pizza doesn't have to be in there for too long take the kale and just spread it on top of the meatballs so now I take a little bit of olive oil and I just drizzle it right over the top because you want to keep the kale nice and moist and the final touch a sprinkle of salt so we're gonna put this in the oven for another 10 minutes at 450 degrees that's so now what I want to do loosen the bottom for the spatula I take my pizza cutter and we're just gonna cut the pizza in half I want to taste one of the meatballs and I want to taste some of that kale whoo-hah so creamy with the nice crispy kale chips all right up next one of Todd's favorite ways to eat meatballs my meatball paninis it's the perfect meaty sandwich leftovers never tastes so good
