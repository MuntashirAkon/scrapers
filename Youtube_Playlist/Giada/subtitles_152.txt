I've been adding the flavors grease to my Italian cooking today and I'm gonna finish with my version of a Greek delicacy it's got light phyllo dough pillows filled with smoked Italian mozzarella they're fried until the phyllo is crisp and the cheese is melted top them off with sweetened figs and crunchy black sesame seeds so we're gonna start with the topic I've got 3/4 of a cup of honey in this bowl and I'm going to add some dried figs and we want to rehydrate them by heating them up in a little bit of honey just like that there we go and I've already taken the baklava out of the oven that's gonna cool while I make this appetizer I've also got some vegetable oil that I'm heating up it's got to heat up to 350 degrees so that I can fry up the smoked mozzarella so now I'm gonna show you what I'm gonna do what makes the smoked mozzarella crispy is the phyllo so we're gonna take a sheet of phyllo just put it on our board and take my smoke one side left and we're gonna cut it on about one inch pieces or so so you just want to fold it over fold the phyllo over the smoked mozzarella just like that and then wrap it just like you would a burrito just like that so let's do another one put it down take another piece of one sided left fold it over fold over the sides just wrap it and wrap it all the way down see it's really really good who doesn't like fried cheese so we're just gonna put it in there for about two minutes on each side there we go they're popping up a little bit all right the first one is ready it's nice and golden okay last one out now I'm gonna show you what I do you put it on a plate just grab the last one I want to take a little bit of my honey and figs pour it right over the top we're also going to add black sesame seeds or you can even use regular sesame seeds and just toast them isn't that gorgeous it's so beautiful I absolutely love it okay so now I get to dig in you did that mix of the smoky mozzarella with the sweet height and the chewiness from the figs and see how stripped the baklava they're like little packages are they cute or what all the nuts apricots and honey it's funny although every country has their own cuisine we actually are a lot more similar to our neighbors than we are different and sometimes a little touch of your own into any recipe it just makes it extra extra special like these little baccala
