a good lunch is a go anywhere taste of home for me one of the best ingredients to use is pasta I start with some spiral shape routine then top with juicy roma tomatoes extra virgin olive oil and tangy lemon a crumble of ricotta salata adds a salty bite the Athenian with sauce of the Yamuna is home cooking you can take with you I'm gonna get started another quick easy and delicious lunch with my routine e with South Sylvania morning so first thing I want to do is put some salt in my water got a season the pasta routine ER these spirals they're about one to two inches long just like that they're so cute and this sounds like it's trapped inside which I love they're also known as Fuji depending on what part of Italy you're in yeah give it a quick little stir there we go just like that and they'll take about eight to ten minutes to cook in the meantime I'm gonna make my Ross Southside now south and Italians basically just means sauce and none of this is gonna be cooked so it's super easy you can make it while the pasta cooks I'm just gonna take a little paring knife and just core the tomatoes and then I'm gonna cut them with wise just like that then I'm gonna squeeze out all the seeds so let's just go ahead and core all of these roma tomatoes I'm using a pound of roma tomatoes I love them because I have that concentrated tomato flavor just take them in the palm of your hand and squeeze and see how the seeds come out super easy just like that okay I am just going to dice all of my tomatoes there we go okay now I want to add a little bit of salt the salt is basically gonna immediately bring out the moisture in the tomato so it'll create a little bit of a sauce for the pasta and give it a little kick let some freshly ground black pepper go I'm just gonna give it a quick little stir now it's called sauce of amore right so lemon sauce so I gotta add lemon so I'm gonna zest a whole lemon right on top the lemon zest it has this amazing perfume there we go we're gonna warm the lemon just to release all the juices and go ahead and squeeze the lemon do the whole lemon the lemon juice adds a little bit of moisture to create a sauce and the acidity kind of brightens up the dish I want to check on my pasta it should be al dente by now and let's see these guys mmm nice and salty too I would like it it's basically tender on the outside with a little bit of a bite on the inside I'm just gonna use this handy little scooper and scoop the hot pasta over the tomatoes and the lemon and again the hot pasta will bring out the flavors and the aromas of the fresh tomatoes and the lemon just sort of balance out the acidity and the flavors of the tomato I'm gonna add about 1/4 cup of extra virgin olive oil and it's really important to use really fruity great tasting olive oil in a dish like this because we're not cooking it so all the flavors of the olive oil will be very sort of apparent so if you don't use a good olive oil it could destroy this dish it's smells so good just toss all that together whoo get a nice lemon and tomato facial see how pretty that is okay so now I'm gonna add somebody caught the Salathe now usually I add Parmesan cheese but I'm doing something a little different here so I'm gonna use somebody cost us a Totten it kind of has the flavor of feta cheese but it's a little drier than feta cheese and it's perfect for crumbling and for grading so I'm just gonna kind of cut it into little cubes here because this is a clean and simple dish that he caught the seal out that gives it a little bit of that kick that it needs sort of take that he got the set out to toss it right on top of the rotini just like that give it a nice little mix a little bit in here and you see how the spiral is on the rotini grab all of the sauce it's kind of a hearty pasta with sort of a hearty chunky salsa so when a little bit of the dukakis alotta some tomatoes utakata soffit gives it that meatiness a little bit of that salty bite fresh tomatoes and the fresh flavors from the lemon juice mmm-hmm you could reheat it and have it for dinner the next night or you can eat it cold and there'll be the best pasta salad you've ever had
