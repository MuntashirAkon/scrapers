Todd are you gonna start the game you play yeah you can play I'm having some friends over tonight for some fun and games five-card stud poker for the grown-ups I call you twister for the kids had a venue for everyone zucchini and olive flatbread caramelize zucchini and salty olives smothered in a two cheese topping cauliflower bacon gratin a veggie dish that kids love thanks to crispy bread crumbs crumbled bacon and even more cheese and chocolate toffee Muscat pony bars the cookie dough chopped candy bars and chocolate need i say more it's food and fun for everyone I'm starting with dessert first and not just because I love dessert but because these chocolate toffee Muscat winner bars need some time to set up in the fridge what I love about these is that they are elegant and perfect for adults and the perfect little treats for the kids as well I have one pound of sugar cookie dough and it's just a store watcher and cookie dough and I think it works really well in here I'm gonna show you how I'm gonna doctor this up and make it all my own two of these chocolate toffee candy bars and what I like to do is chop them up nice and fine blues will add half of it inside the cookie dough and the other half will reserve it and Pat it on top so you get the crunch on the inside and the crunch on the outside too need a nice sharp knife there we go you want to kind of cut it up in small pieces so it can kind of melt in the cookie dough and that you don't have huge chunks on top either okay so now that we've got that grab the pool half of it goes inside and the other half we are going to reserve there we go so we'll leave that for a little bit later then I also want to add some vanilla extract so let's grab that and that's what I said I'm gonna doctor this up and make it all my own and no one's ever gonna know that it's prepared cookie dough there's so many great things on the market these days that really makes baking a lot easier so 1/2 a teaspoon of pure vanilla extract and take a spoon and I mix this all together and kind of break it up and make sure that all gets incorporated really well even smells really good perfect so now I grab my baking sheet and I just sprayed a cookie spray all over it and then I put a piece of parchment paper over it and I sprayed the parchment paper just to make sure that I can just lift it all up like this and cut it into bars and nothing will stick then just put the dough right in the center there and I kind of just press it if the cookie dough gets sticky just wet your hands a little bit with water and you want a nice even layer and it bakes up so sugary and so buttery it's so hot now I prick it with a fork just so it doesn't grow too much in the oven it stays nice and flat and we're gonna bake it at 350 degrees for 12 to 14 minutes until it's light and golden all around the size so while that bakes let's get started on the topic we've got chocolate chips so we do one cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips I love this we're gonna melt the chocolate and then we're gonna add Musk opponent to it and make it a nice thick and rich as a topping on top of the cooked sugar cookie dough there we go and I've already heated up a little bit of water so we're doing like a little water bath and patiently we're gonna wait for the chocolate chips to melt the chocolates melted look how beautiful this is it's just silky and rich and it shines and I love it so now I want to take it off the heat I want it to cool and I'm gonna grab my sugar cookie dough nice this is exactly what you want you want it to be nice and golden just like a tan on top so I'm gonna let that cool and the chocolate cool is in the meantime I'm gonna go set up my living room I've got a fun little grown-up table to set up so let's go a piece of green felt cut to size turns any surface into a very cool poker table and everyone gets their own little side table for food and drinks okay looks like we're ready to shuffle look so good in there this is gonna be really fun all right my chocolate is cooled so now it's time to add one cup of mascarpone cheese into the melted chocolate basically almost this whole thing the musket pointer is so nice it's nice and mellow and creamy it's perfect and you just see how you just mix it together and it creates a nice thick creamy topping and that's why it's really important you cool the chocolate a little bit after you melt it so that it combines very nicely it's nice and smooth perfect alright so we'll grab the cooled cookie dough and all I do is basically add all of the chocolate and must go to put a mixture to the center and then I spread it all out so you get a nice thick layer and just kind of spread it out and make sure it coats all of the cookie dough and we're just about to add the crunch some toasted sliced almonds and I just put them right over the top it just makes it look really pretty and gourmet it adds a little bit of crunch too and remember the leftover chocolate toffee candy bar that we cut up earlier here we go we're right on top so now we're gonna put it in the refrigerator and let it set for two hours then we'll lift it out and cut it into little bars and up next I'm gonna make one of my favorites my cauliflower and bacon Greta a rich and creamy dish that's loaded with bacon and layers of cheese
