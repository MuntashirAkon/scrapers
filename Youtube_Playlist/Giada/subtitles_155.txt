when you're planning to host a working lunch keep it simple and satisfying this side dish has potatoes cooked in chicken broth and lemon juice so they absorb all the flavors then I toss them with tangy lemon zest fresh basil and olive oil lemon basil potatoes have a light summery flavor that makes them a perfect side dish usually I like to boil my potatoes in water but to make this recipe extra special I like to do it in chicken broth and we're using baby potatoes the little red potatoes and I love them really because I can cut them in half and all of a sudden they're bite-sized they have a really thin delicate skin so I don't have to peel them when I have people over for lunch especially when it's a working lunch when you're having a chicken sandwich and a salad you need something to sort of round out the whole meal and this potato this potato dish really does that and now I'm gonna take the potatoes and put them directly into my pan and we're gonna measure 2 cups of chicken broth and I like it cuz it's really gonna flavor the potatoes the potatoes basically absorb whatever you cook them in and so that's the point of cooking them in the chicken broth just make some extra extra special so pour that right over the potatoes just like that we're gonna add half a cup of lemon juice so just roll and cut the lemons and basically just add all the juice right in here okay there we go now I'm gonna add two tablespoons of olive oil and the reason I'm adding the olive oil is to keep them kind of nice and silky kind of gives them a little bit of a free flavor 800 salt and some freshly ground black pepper so then you have to bring the mixture up to a boil and once it's boiling you turn back down to a simmer and put the lid on so my potatoes are cooked I've drained them and I can smell that lemon flavor that's why it's so great to cook them with all that lemon juice because it just kind of permeates everything it smells so good all right so we're gonna add two more teaspoons of extra virgin olive oil right on top just to make them extra shiny and pretty and really fruity and we're also gonna zest some lemon right on top of the potatoes just because I'd love to see those little yellow flecks right on top of the potatoes and because it really does bring out all of the flavors pan for a finishing touch a little freshness little mint eNOS some basil and I love seeing the color too you know you see that little bit of green it kind of brightens up a potato dish I just kind of put that right on top and then just kind of want to toss them so that the olive oil and the lemon zest and the basil kind of coats each and every potato half okay so pretty it smells so good so now grab the fork they're so lettering is so good that freshness from the lemon zest fruity olive oil and the basil Yami alright up next I've got a great dessert cuz it's dessert slash drink it's my frothing chocolate and special shake
