kids aren't the only ones who love desert so when my friends bring their kids over today I want to have something everyone can enjoy this will be a hit my strawberry Muscat when it filled cupcakes will win fans of all ages cupcakes are so easy to make and they're great when you're trying to feed a crowd I'm making it easier by using store-bought vanilla flavored cake mix so we've got one box of the cake mix just dump it into the bowl and to that I'm going to add 1 in 1/3 cups of water and you can just follow the direction in the back of the box that's all I'm doing and 1/3 cup vegetable oil and you've got to stick to vegetable oil just because it's a very neutral flavor so you can't add olive oil done that in the past and it just doesn't quite work so well so just mix those together and to this I'm going to add 3 eggs there we go mix it all together okay that's it so now I've grabbed my tray I've got my cupcake tins and inside of them I just lined them with these cute little paper linings and it keeps the cupcake nice and moist and it just makes it really fun to just pour the batter into a little liner you want to film about three-quarters of the way up perfect so now I'm gonna bake these at 350 degrees for 25 minutes until they're nice and golden on top all right well the cupcakes bake I'm gonna get started on the extra special filling this is gonna be so good so I'm using 1 cup of mascarpone cheese and the musket point of cheese is nice and smooth so it makes for the perfect filling and you can pretty much add any flavor into it what's great about it is you can use it for things that are sweet but things that are savory too and to that strawberries and lemon juice just to cut through some of the sweetness and kind of bring out the flavor of the strawberry you just want about a tablespoon which is approximately half a lemon and also going to add a quarter cup of sugar now let's put the lid on it and blend it all together perfect look at the color it's this beautiful like pink hue that has to it inside of the vanilla muffins it's the look so pretty and so now I've got to take my pastry bag and this is just a plastic pastry bag you can buy the store and what you want to do the pastry bag is just cut the bottom just like that and throw a little tip like this with little small little hole all the way down into it so now wrap around your hand just like this cupping it like that just scoop out the mixture yeah dollop it right in so I'm just gonna switch here smaller spoon okay so I'm gonna finish filling this pastry bag and wait for the cupcakes to cook and cool and then I'm going to show you how to make these cupcakes into something spectacular
