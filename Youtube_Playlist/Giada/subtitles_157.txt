having fun with food needs playing with flavors and colors here's a great dessert mango cheesecake with basil lemon syrup for my crust I want to start with one cup of peace coffee just turn the machine on and get them nice and ground until it almost like a fine powder to bind it all together I want to add 3/4 of a cup of melted sweet butter and again you want to process action it becomes nice and thick so I just want to take my mixture and pour it into my springform pan and I'm using the fingers spread the mixture out all over the bottom of the pan now that I have a nice even layer at the bottom of the pan I want to bake the crust off at 350 for 15 minutes look at this crust oh my gosh you can smell the butter ooh it smells good okay so now I want to take it off the baking sheet and put it on a cooling rack that way the air circulates and the crust cools down faster so now I'm gonna use two classic cheesecake ingredients 1 cup of whole milk but he got the cheese just like that into the food processor and we're also going to use 2 8 ounce packages of cream cheese just like that now before I had anything else I want to just puree these two together okay so now that those two are mixed together I'm ready to add sugar now you got to sweeten this up this is my favorite part actually cuz the added sugar took that he coughed in the cream cheese and it just mmm so sweet and yummy and to make it extra extra specialist cheesecake and to give it a beautiful color like that nice orange color I'm using two cups of mango puree so you can do this with fresh mangoes if you want or what I like to do is buy frozen mango pieces and just prayer them all together so pour two cups of the mango puree right into this I just love it it kind of lightens up the whole cheesecake idea and the flavor too in your mouth and then to bind it all together I don't need for eggs okay so now we have a nice smooth mixture which is what you want I take my baking pan put the cooled crust right in it you just take that and pour this luscious velvety thick yummy mixture right on top of the cooked crust now gonna add the water I just want to add enough hot water so that it goes about halfway up the springform pan and by doing this you're keeping the Cheesecake nice and moist as it cooks so I'm gonna cook it at 350 degrees for an hour and a half until it's nice and moist then I'm gonna let it cool and set in the fridge and up next I'm going to show you how to finish off this fantastic cheesecake
