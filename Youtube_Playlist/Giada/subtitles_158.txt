the perfect sweet treat on a hot day is lemon ricotta granita the clean Chris bite of frozen lemon ice is smoothed out by the topping of sweet creamy ricotta cheese the lemon ricotta granita cleanses your palate as it tingles your taste buds the sweet part of this lemon granita is the simple syrup so I want to just simmer a 1 cup of water with three quarters of a cup of sugar and we're just doing this to dissolve the sugar there we go about medium heat and going to take a couple of minutes for the sugar to dissolve and now I want to juice my lemons and usually granita is made with coffee that's a lot of times you see coffee granita and especially in Italy it's made with coffee but in this case I'm using some fresh lemon juice just gonna roll the lemons just to release the juices and it makes it easier to work and juice lemons when they're not cold when that room temperature just there we go and thus it is just helping me catch all the little pips and we need two thirds of a cup of fresh lemon juice there we go and you want to use fresh lemon juice if you want the freshness the clean light flavor of fresh lemon juice now I want to dest from lemon and this is just for the garnish for the top of the grenada but I want to do it now while I still have whole lemons here that should be plenty we'll use that later now we'll just juice this one as well you want to get two thirds of a cup so we still have a few more lemons to go the texture of a granita it's icy and slushy and really refreshing on a hot day okay this is all done the sugar is completely dissolved okay now we're gonna add the lemon juice and we'll whisk just a little bit just to blend it all together and now I'm gonna pour it in this glass baking dish all right so good now I'm gonna cover it with plastic wrap and I'm gonna set it in the freezer for a few hours and I want to scrape it every 45 minutes just until the ice crystals start to form and it gets us fleshy consistency now while that's in the freezer I'm gonna make my topping and I'm gonna use some ricotta cheese as the topping and what I like about it is that it's sort of like cottage cheese it doesn't have as many Kurds but it has that same texture I think it works really well with the granita there we go and of course we need a tablespoon of sugar I'd like to sweeten my topping just like that and a pinch of salt and the reason I'm adding just a pinch of salt it kind of brings out the cheesy flavor in the ricotta and the sweetness and the sugar I'm gonna mix these up and I'm gonna leave it in the refrigerator until them ready to put it on top of the grenada mmm I can smell that from very nectarine crisp let's take a look wow so good it's still bubbling a topping so fantastic nice and brown now I'm gonna let this cool for a bit and then I'm gonna serve up all these desserts to my friends
