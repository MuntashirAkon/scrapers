you'll want something to soak up all the sauce from the chicken cacciatore lemon parsley bruschetta is perfect before I start my lemon bruschetta I need to get my cookies out good good all right there beautiful pale golden color all around the edges they smell so good I can smell the chocolate it's still warm and sizzling all right I'm gonna start my lemon bruschetta and I'm gonna start by taking this ciabatta bread it's very rustic looking and what I love about it is it's actually a lot lighter inside then you would think it is not as doughy as other types of breads are it's got a nice outer crust she's about six slices or so and you know I'm cutting it on an angle like this makes it easier to sort of bind them to just like that just gonna cut these in half all right pop them on the grill I feel the grill is hot I'm just gonna put together some lemon juice and some olive oil and traditionally that's what they did with bruschetta they just rub some uh fresh extra-virgin olive oil over it and the warmth of the bread absorbs the olive oil and it's fantastic so a couple tablespoons of lemon juice and olive oil extra virgin so a couple tablespoons of lemon juice and a couple tablespoons of olive oil and a little bit of salt for flavoring let's back together and you know when you have risk if ten restaurants there's so many different toppings you can do it with chopped tomatoes you could do it um quits that cannellini beans are just one of my favorites and even with fennel all sorts of stuff just gonna peel my garlic because as soon as the bread comes off the grill I'm gonna rub it with this garlic all right let's see if the bread is ready yeah there we are just nice and toasty well baby one for me all right I need about another minute on that side now I'm gonna chop some fresh flat-leaf Italian parsley because we're gonna just sprinkle a little bit on top of the brisket to give it a nice color just a rough chop believe that right there now I want to start with one of my other rustic favorites smashed potatoes drizzled with olive oil and tangy Parmesan cheese I'm gonna use red potatoes I'm using baby potatoes so I'm just gonna slice them and cut them in half and we're gonna boil them it's such a time-saver to do two things at once so while my bread is grilling I'm preparing my potatoes what I like about these potatoes is the thin skin and their waxy er then russet potatoes so they have less starch in them they're perfect for boiling and make fantastic mashed potatoes they come white or red I happen to love the color and I'm gonna leave the skin on and these red potatoes are also known as boiling potatoes so see there's that there's the key to knowing that they're great for boiling but these back in here and grab my bread yep my bread is ready the bread is warm and I've just cut the little end off the garlic and I rub it and the warmth of the bread starts to melt the garlic so aromatic it's so fantastic all right now just brush a little bit of the olive oil and lemon juice mixture just must sprinkle a tiny bit of parsley and the parsley is just for beauty just look a little more attractive all right those look great and now it's time to get the potatoes in the water now I have cold water and I'm gonna add all my potatoes in and bring them up to a boil up next I'm gonna make my amazing smashed Parmesan potatoes
