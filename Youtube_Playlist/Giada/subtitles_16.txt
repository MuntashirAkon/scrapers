I'm having two and a half cups of cherry tomatoes for my chicken meat an easy with fennel tomato sauce so now that I have the cherry tomatoes cut and my fennel has softened nicely I only took five minutes to do now we want to add the tomatoes into the fennel and we just want to cook them for a few minutes just to soften them they're nice and sweet and we'll add a little bit of salt and pepper just to season the tomatoes a little bit this is gonna be so so pretty okay while the tomatoes soften I'm ready to cut up and pack up my food cotta this is my egg white frittata with my locks and the arugula now that it's cooled completely I'm just gonna cut it up look how pretty that is I'm just gonna cut it again into little squares you know what I just want to make sure it tastes right I don't think she's gonna miss that corner mmm mmm the LOX and that nice salty bite but it's also buttery that is a good one so now let's grab the Tupperware and I'm gonna grab my label basically what I did is I labeled all the dishes and just had reheating instructions so we have the egg white frittata with lox and arugula enjoy at room temperature perfect we're trying to make this as easy on Vanessa as possible so now just gonna grab all the frittata I'm just lay it in the Tupperware this way the Tupperware will keep it nice and fresh because it's sealed do that and put the lid on and the egg white frittata is done I'll just set it over there and we'll pack it up in a little bit okay now that they're starting to soften you just want to soften a little bit and we're gonna add a little bit of dried thyme mmm the lemony time is really earthy and its really good in here perfect we also need a little bit of garlic just gonna add one clove of garlic in there just for a little extra flavor again not too much garlic a little bit of garlic for flavor is good just chop that up and we'll just cook it a little bit in here there we go perfect let that just sort of infuse the flavors of the sauce okay so now one last ingredient a little mascarpone cheese we're gonna add half a cup and look how beautiful that is nice and creamy perfect I just kind of add that all in there it just melts into the tomatoes and the fennel and I think it might be time for my lunch I'm gonna grab a plate and grab the small little chicken milanesa that I made for myself let's grab a sauce and basically all you want to do with this is just melt the must component cheese and then turn off the heat and let it cool that is all you do mix it all together see how nice that looks and then I do a little bit of sauce right over it just like that let's taste it I'm excited I'll just smell the food makes me hungry hmm mmm crunchy nice crunchy crust lots of flavor from that Parmesan cheese and the herbs mmm all right up next I'm gonna make a very simple dessert that involves a little bit of chocolate but I think the nesic is gonna love
