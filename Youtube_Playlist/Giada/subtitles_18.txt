the Walt Disney Concert Hall is one of LA's most elegant venues and I want my dinner to have that same Flair rigatoni with squash and shrimp is worth a standing ovation the cornmeal and rosemary cake is baking in the oven so while that cooks I'm going to get started on my sauce and I'm making a bit of an unusual sauce because instead of making a sauce out of tomatoes I'm going to make it out of butternut squash so we get a little bit of olive oil into the pan and I'm gonna add one pound of cubed butternut squash I've peeled it and cubed it into about one inch pieces a little bit of salt and some freshly ground black pepper right on top now I want to saute the butternut squash first just because it kind of releases all the sugars and creates a nice caramelized crust on the outside of the bun nut squash and just makes them super sweet and really delicious so let's peel some garlic got a flavor the butternut squash it's gonna chop this garlic make a nice flavor puree out of it a little bit of garlic right on top and I just want to give that a quick little stir when that garlic hits a hot oil or the hot pan the aromas are fantastic talk about an Italian kitchen that smells like an Italian kitchen let that cook just for a couple of minutes just check it's nice and caramelized in the meantime I'm gonna cook my pasta you've got boiling water your really seasoned it so we're gonna add a pound of vega toy just give that quick stir so now I want to add a cup of vegetable stock nice and moist there we go and now for the shrimp while the pasta cooks and the butternut squash continues to cook I'm going to add a little bit of olive oil to my pan and I'm going to season what's gonna make the dish look so elegant and perfect for my special night out some shrimp I'm just going to season it with a little bit of salt and some freshly ground black pepper we're going to add the shrimp to the saute pan and mix those up now the secret with shrimp is you can't cook them for too long they cook in just a couple of minutes two minutes on each side and they're done in the meantime I just want to chop 1/2 a cup of basil lots and lots of basil just want to chop it up and we're gonna add it to the pasta right at the end after we've created the butternut squash sauce let me check side butternut squash they look nice and tender there's still a little bit of sauce left over but it's almost all gone move this over and we'll just add the coupe butternut squash just want to puree it until you get a nice smooth puree take a look now we put it back into the pan and see what a beautiful color that is so we're done with that we go back to the pan I'm just gonna turn my shrimp around and kind of caramelize and create a little crust I've got to thin the sauce out with some milk now sometimes it might take 3/4 of a cup of milk and sometimes it may take a whole cup of milk you just kind of have to see how much liquid you have left over after you cooked and soften the butternut squash it just makes for a nice creamy mixture now we're ready add the pasta it's cooked there we go all the pasta in there and you want that he could fully al dente my shrimp are done so I could take those off the boots it'll switch pan keep those there and I just combine already get Tony with the squash you can see that the sauce goes inside the little tubes it Iike Tony so good so now we're gonna add all the basil right on top and it's just so pretty the colors are fantastic we're also gonna add some Parmesan cheese right on top that's a little saltiness a little butteriness there we go and again give it a quick little mix things off grab your pan yeah there you go look at that cut cream that is okay now just want to top it with the shrimp so you don't want to toss the shrimp inside because the shrimp is what makes this look elegant and special so you definitely want to put the shrimp right on top so everybody can see them how pretty that looks that is my main course it smells so good I just want to dig into it but I'm gonna wait to my friends get here up next I'm going to show you a very simple appetizer that's beautiful using fresh vegetables you know what it takes minutes to make
