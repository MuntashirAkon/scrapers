here's the dish that takes you away from it all with this vibrant combination of flavors I blend gorgonzola and cream cheese and flavor them with fresh thyme then I layer slices of sweet saut√©ed pears and strips of salty prosciutto you'll love the perfect balance of flavors in this pear and gorgonzola tart the first thing I want to do from my parent or Gonzaga tart is slice 3 Bosc pears so I'm basically just gonna cut them in half and just core them so use a melon baller to help you core it just put that over there so easy that is and I like Bosc pears because they're nice and firm so when I cook them in the butter they're gonna stay intact do that take another one I'm just make slices okay now that I have all my pear sliced just wanna pick them up in a little bit of butter let's take the butter nice soft room-temperature butter I'll just melt the butter there we go now can add all of the sliced pear to the pan just like that and heat them up just give them more flavor and it makes this tart even better so we'll leave these in the pan for about five minutes or so it's while those cook I am gonna get my spread ready four ounces of cream cheese I love good old-fashioned regular cream cheese it whips up beautifully and for a little bit of a kick some Italian gorgonzola and Grogan's ol is from the Lombardy region and northern Italy and it's just got a a nice creamy texture to it a little bit of a salty bite and a little bit of a tang and for a little bit of freshness I'm going to add some fresh thyme and time is lemony so it adds a nice kick to the cheese's it gives a little bit of like a green speck and the cheese too so it looks really pretty so now I'm just going to sort of chop it just so the essential oils in its flavor and aroma really come out well and we can add it right on top now I'm going to blend it all together and the cream cheese whips up beautifully so it's really fun here as a blend that loosens up and becomes nice and creamy alright now just want to add a little bit of salt just ever so slightly because it goes into a little sharp so you don't want to add too much a little bit of pepper I'm gonna give this one more little whip just to incorporate the salt and the pepper there we go now I can sit my tart shell I baked in a little tart shell with a removable bottom and this is what it looks like and I love it because it gives it this little scalloped edges and it makes it look so elegant just get all the cheese and now with this offset spatula just go ahead and spread it all out and you just want a nice even thin layer I only did a little bit of cheese spread it all the way around perfect okay now pour the pears right over the crust and the pears will warm up the cheese as well I want to make it extra special so I'm going to use thinly cut for shoot that which is basically just Italian turd ham and I'm gonna slice it just a little slivers here you just sprinkle it right on top and it makes it into a meal you know you've got the sweetness from the pears with the tane is from the cheese and a little bit of that saltiness and prosciutto now cut a slice of tart and there we go perfect looks good so you want to get a little bit of pear and the crust and of course the prosciutto with the big bite mmm prepared are tender but there's still a little bit from it they still have a little bit of crunch to them a little bit of salty prosciutto it is the perfect lunch again with a little side salad and you're done
