and I've got lots of boiling water and very important to flavor the water with salt and I'm using kosher salt and i'm going to use whole wheat pasta instead of semolina pasta today it's very healthy but it's also very good and I'm only going to use half of this box so about eight ounces while that's cooking i'm going to start the sauce we're going to cook the sauce so we don't need to use extra virgin you can just use regular olive oil for a little bit of that fruity flavor but not overpowering nice sharp knife we're gonna use some onions nice egg hot click them up and we're gonna add some salt right on top and don't be afraid of a little steam a little piece it's all good when you're in the kitchen add a little bit of fresh ground black pepper right on top again flavoring every single layer of your dish alright while these cook I'm going to start in the Swiss chard now for anybody that doesn't know what Swiss chard is it's part of the mustard green family so you could substitute kale for this or you can substitute mustard greens even spinach and you know what with this you can make food tacos which is why my mom used to do add as a side dish they're very versatile and very yummy let's tip all of this and put it in here a little more olive oil a little more salt and a little more pepper so while that cooks down gotta add some garlic and you can add as much or as little garlic as you like we've got some red pepper flakes the reason I like adding the red pepper flakes is because it adds some heat some kick so in the back of your throat it's kind of peppery it's really good add chopped tomatoes and we're using chopped tomatoes because they're sweeter there's more moisture so they'll add a really nice flavor to the sauce now white wine just a quarter cup and if it's good enough to drink it's good enough to cook with so this is going to cook for about five minutes and my pasta is cooking so we want to put the lid on just so it locks in the moisture and the flavor what I like about the kalamata olives is there fruity and the rich they're even smooth in your mouth so I'm just giving them a rough chop hmm perfect toss a little bite inside ready to assemble the pasta dish you believe how light and healthy this is it smells and looks so good
