I'm just grilling two ears of corn I just want to have that nice smoky flavor in my corn and black bean salad and makes it look a lot more festive too and it's such a pretty day outside I wonder how those guys are doing it's a beauty she'll cert now sit down said an hour let's sit down in here so I'm just cutting the corn kernels right off the cob the corns got a nice smoky flavor to it just adds a little pizazz to the whole salad makes it special all right so we're gonna get rid of this you can see the corn kernels are nice and juicy now I'm gonna add a little red pepper some crunch some sweetness and great color that's what I love about red pepper the color and the sweetness and of course some freshness and that crunch so rid of that and you just want to dice it now traditionally and lobster bakes they'll just serve corn on the cob but I'm jazzing it up just a little bit making it extra special and give it a little bit of a California feel okay so red pepper is in and now for a little bit of an island feel and some sweetness I'm gonna add some mango so go ahead and cut the mango now remember there's a big seed in the center of the mango so you can't just cut it down the center you got to cut the sides off kind of like you would with an apple so I just cut all the sides off and it's just easier to do it this way than to have to peel the whole thing I take one slice and I just cut down now don't cut all the way through the skin just kind of cut until you almost hit the skin and it takes a little practice but if you do it a couple times you'll kind of get the feel for it of how deep the knife goes in and then you just open it up just like that so then I take a spoon and I just kind of take them all off just like that and you want to make sure that the mango isn't too ripe just you know nice and tender so get all that off just toss it right in there just like that perfect so now some beans and I have one can of garbanzo beans and one can of black beans and I've already drained and rinsed them and they just add nice creaminess to the salad which will be really good it just gives it more body and gives it more hardiness we'll add a little bit of salt a little bit of black pepper just like that and then add the basil lime vinaigrette that we made earlier a little cumin fresh basil balsamic it's perfect right in there now what I do is leave it in the fridge for a couple of hours just so the basil vinaigrette has a chance to kind of mix in with the corn and the corn and the beans the mango the red pepper everything kind of absorbs that basil lime vinaigrette and it becomes better and better the longer it sits the better it gets so now I've got three sticks of butter when you grab a pan and I'm gonna melt these three sticks of butter you can't have a lobster bake without having some clarified butter to dip the lobster tails in so I'm gonna melt three sticks of butter about one and a half cups of butter and we're gonna do that over low heat I'm also gonna add some lemon tape to make it really really yummy turn the stove on and it'll take a couple of minutes to melt and then I'm gonna show you how to take a traditional lobster bake and give a sort of a West Coast jatta feel to it and the star of course my succulent lobster tails prepared for travel and less mess
