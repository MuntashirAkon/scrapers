how are you good to see you - thank you it's been a while but I need a couple of things sure doing something special with cheese's lots of different recipes using lots of different cheeses who doesn't love cheese I know I do all kinds sharp buttery super mild the gorgonzola the Gruyere feta fontina so today I'm gonna make three recipes using cheese as the star ingredient turkey meatloaf with feta and sun-dried tomatoes who knew that meatloaf could be so exotic and the feta cheese as a salty bite cheesy baked bottom three cheese's and a golden crust the ultimate comfort food crostata with apples walnuts and gorgonzola a sweet soft gorgonzola makes this dish irresistible three cheesy recipes all different and all delicious this is just a good excuse to taste it off so we're gonna start with the dough and the reason I want to start with my crostata is because the dough needs to sit and chill in the refrigerator for about a half hour before I fill it then bake it off so we're gonna do one and a half cups of all-purpose flour and you want to keep in mind that when you're making any kind of pastry dough that you really and truly measure very well all your ingredients so you can get the right texture that you're looking for now we need have a teaspoon of salt fine salt and then we need one tablespoon of sugar and I'm gonna pulse it all together so now let's grab the cheese and the butter three tablespoons of butter it's got to be unsalted and it's got to be cold as cold as you can get it so I kind of work quickly and diligently and cutting it into little cubes and put it in the food processor because the longer I handle the butter the more it starts to melt from the heat of my fingers and the reason you want the butter to be nice and cold is because when the dough is actually baking in the oven the chunks of butter kind of fill up with air and those little pockets of air is what creates a nice flaky dough that's why you want to keep it nice and cold we'll just drop it right in here and give it a quick little pulse just to combine the butter initially so now lemon juice and a little bit of ice water here we go we're just gonna had one and a half tablespoons of lemon juice a little bit of acid in the actual pie dough is really good it keeps the dough really tender and that's what you want make sure that seeds don't go in there and they did it okay so we've got the lemon in there and we need three tablespoons of ice water keep it nice and cold because the water will keep the butter cold as well that's why you want ice water but you don't want to add the ice so you just want to make sure you measure it out and that's three tablespoons that in there give it a quick pulse and now for the creamy part mascarpone cheese and the mascarpone cheese is light and fluffy so that's exactly what it's going to do so the lemon juice will keep it tender the Muscat point of cheese will keep it soft okay half a cup just kind of put it in the flour there we go it kinds of looking a little bit like cottage cheese curds just like that see big chunks like that now grab some plastic wrap yeah I put the dough right on the plastic wrap and then we're gonna chill it in the fridge drop it all down there just like that and then I kind of just put it together with my hands just wrap it up mold it together into a disc and then we'll put it in the fridge for half hour and then we'll roll it out and fill it so let's pop this in the fridge so if we're gonna start on the filling and I love the granny smith apples because they're nice and tart and they don't become mushy so what I want to do is peel and slice the apples then we're gonna cook them a little bit of sugar a little bit of cinnamon and butter let's skip the apples right in there I love the smell of apples cooking in butter really good really homey and rustic and that's exactly what this crostata is I just want to give it a toss here and let's add a quarter cup of sugar just right over that and a little bit of cinnamon so we're gonna do luminous sprinkle it about 3/4 of a teaspoon they'll spice little warmth gonna take about five minutes to soften the apples and then I'll show you how to put the crostata together and later I'll get started on my meatloaf a hearty main course with a cheesy twist
