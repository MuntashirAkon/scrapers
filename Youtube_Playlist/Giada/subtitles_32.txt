my friend Vanessa recently had a baby and I remember after having Jade how busy I was so I thought I'd make something special for Vanessa and her husband Jason egg white frittata with LOX an arugula the arugula gives it a peppery kick and the LOX makes this Italian omelet truly gourmet chicken Milanese a with tomato and fennel sauce crispy chicken with a warm and hearty sauce it's the ultimate comfort food mini pancakes with raspberry sorbet and chocolate sauce believe it or not this is a simple no fuss dessert that looks and tastes amazing this is a special delivery I know Vanessa is gonna love isn't she I'm starting with my egg white feet thought that with LOX and arugula and I've already separated six eggs I'm just adding two more for a total of eight and I'm only using the egg whites I'm kind of making this a little bit of a lighter Big Data it's for my friend Vanessa who just had a baby a few weeks ago and she's trying to eat really well so you just want to whisk the egg whites and just break them up a little bit okay to that I'm going to add a little bit of salt and pepper we're gonna season it but you don't add too much salt because the LOX have salt in them as well already so let's grab some cream and some LOX so the cream is to make egg whites a little more moist and then the lux well that's gonna give it great color get a little bit of that smoky bite and it's gonna be really pretty in pink so we'll measure out a half a cup of cream and that's really all you need just like that really simple this is sort of a trick to keeping if you've got a nice and light and give it another quick little whisk perfect so now time for the locks I got these great little nova scotia locks for Vanessa and she loves it plus you feel like you're treating yourself when it eat locks I'm gonna cut it in half and then just dice it up just so it really combines in the egg whites and then with the green arugula a little lemon zest and the white from the frittata it's gonna be gorgeous and it's gonna taste even better and we'll give this little whisk to incorporate the smoked salmon into the egg whites and now we need a couple more things we need a roux glass some garlic and lemon here we go what we're gonna do is actually saute the arugula first in a little bit of garlic we'll heat up the pan and I just want to get one garlic clove so just peel it there we go and then we'll just chop it up and Vanessa and Jason are so excited this is their first baby and even though people prepare you and everybody tells you like what you should be doing and how to do it you just don't know till you're in it and one of the things I think a lot of people forget is to eat to go to the store they get stuff and a lot of times people end up just ordering in so it's so nice to get a home-cooked meal so we're going to heat up the garlic a little bit cuz we're just gonna flavor the arugula here and we add the arugula just like that nice peppery fresh baby arugula really good stuff and she loves arugula she likes a little spiciness so I think she's gonna really like this and the arugula is just like the spinach it's gonna basically wilt down in no time a minute or two I just want to season it with a little bit of salt and a little bit of pepper give it a quick little saute here and while that wilts and cooks down I'm gonna zest a lemon into the bigdata I love lemon with the locks it just perfumes the whole thick data perfect and whisk all the lemon into it so now that the arugula has wilted damn spread it out so it evenly gets mixed into the egg white and then just pour the feet Tata right in there does he get a little green a little pink very pretty and now we're gonna let this cook for about 4 to 5 minutes until the sides kind of pull away from the pan and it starts to cook and then we're gonna finish it in the oven so now I'm just running my spatula around the side so I can see underneath a little bit to see that it's golden-brown so I'm gonna put this in the oven and bake it at 350 for about 10 minutes until the top is nice and golden brown then my chicken meal amazing crispy on the outside with a tomato and fennel sauce that is out of this world
