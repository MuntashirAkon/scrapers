one of the most legendary regions of Italy is Tuscany it's inspired generations of writers and chefs Tuscan cooking is simple and delicious like do Cocteau a chocolaty dome-shaped cake of whipped cream and nuts and Florentine chicken and a bed of sauteed spinach a Tuscan hallmark beans is showcased with aromatic herbs tomatoes and prosciutto these dishes are your ticket to a day under the Tuscan Sun my favorite part of any meal is dessert an easy Tuscan classic is some cocoa I'm gonna start with the outside of the dome and so that it doesn't stick add a little trick I'm gonna spray this glass bowl with this nonstick spray I'm gonna line it with some plastic wrap that way when I go to invert it it slips right out two strips of plastic wrap should be enough we'll put it right inside there and one more okay there we go want some overhang so that we can wrap it up later on okay so there's the plastic run bowl next part my pound cake I'm just using store-bought pound cake little 12 ounce loaf and we're going to cut it in about a third of an inch slices you don't want to make them too thick because they won't be as pliable you won't be able to sort of mold them and you don't want to make them too thin because they'll fall apart and you know pound cake got its name because it used to originally be made of a pound of butter a pound of flour and a pound of sugar and of course the legs and these days its flavored with all sorts of things I mean you've got marbled pound cakes with chocolate inside you've got any variation you could possibly think of Zucco's a traditional Tuscan dessert the people of Florence love it because it resembles the dome on top of the main Cathedral in Florence so we're just gonna cut all of these in triangles you can use brioche for this cake but I love pound cake just because I love that buttery sweetness it's perfect for this dessert now we're gonna line the bottom of the cake and what we're gonna do is place them so all of the triangle pieces touch each other like a windmill now all we do is fit the rest in like a puzzle and I'll sort of mold them in there growing up making toccata was so much fun and assembling the puzzle was the best part that looks good now we'll save these and we'll put them on the top I'm going to brush the pound cake is brandy I have here so I'm using about a quarter cup or so and you're just gonna give it a quick little brush it's easier to brush the triangles with brandy at this point when they're already in the bowl otherwise they could fall apart in your hand I've got two fillings that I'm gonna make there to make this cake fantastic we've got a chocolate filling which is six ounces of bittersweet chocolate that I've already melted and one cup of heavy whipping cream which I've already whipped we're going to put those two together and then after that we're going to make another filling so I'm going to add about a quarter of a cup of the whipped cream to the chocolate you don't want to do it all at once that's sort of the idea of folding ingredients that way also we keep some of the air in the whipped cream so we'll add another half of the amount of the whipped cream into the chocolate you want to do this part pretty quickly because the chocolate cream will firm up as it cools and see I'm just turning the bowl and lifting the ingredients and you don't have to worry about it all becoming one uniform color it's okay to see a little bit of whipped cream inside kind of like a mousse so now take my bowl back and I just add the chocolate whipped cream mixture a little bit at a time and you just want to brush it up against the pound cake gently with the pound cake so you don't break it I'm also gonna make another filling that has almonds in it and the combination of the flavors of the chocolate in the almond are going to be perfect in this dish and we're ready to make the second filling we're gonna take another cup of heavy whipping cream and we're gonna whip it with powdered sugar and almond extract but first I want to start whipping it just a little bit before I add the powdered sugar otherwise I can't get the air into it what's up pretty quickly the traditional filling for this cake is sweetly whipped cream with chocolate shavings and various nuts like hazel nuts or like almonds which is what I'm in use 1/4 cup of powdered sugar and a little bit at a time powdered sugar melts more easily in the whipped creams and granulated sugar all right now we're ready for the almond extract we're going to add about half a teaspoon an almond extract has a wonderful fragrance and aroma so you don't want to add too much because it could sort of overpower the whipped cream so we've got that I'm gonna add in some toasted slivered almonds and I've toasted them just to bring out the flavor and give them a little bit of crunch so again folding the almonds in just turn the bowl and lift the ingredients I'm just gonna put this filling right inside okay so all I need to do now is brush the rest of the pound cake with brandy and then fold up all the plastic wrap and put it in the fridge for three hours or up to a day you
