steakhouse food is so rich and satisfying that I've decided to make some my Steakhouse favorites at home with the unique Italian twist I'm gonna bake a luscious focaccia studded with bits of garlic fresh rosemary and grapes for a side dish I'm gonna bake tiny orzo pasta with sauteed mushrooms nutty fontina cheese and peas for the main course a meaty rib eye steak seasoned with herbs and topped with a tangy black olive vinaigrette and for the finale a lemon-lime frozen custard topped with crumbled a Medici cookies these are my versions of steakhouse classics a dinner that's a cut above the rest you've got to have great bread to go along with a great steak here's one that I love because it's hard enough to hold its own and it couldn't be easier to make focaccia with rosemary and grapes comes out of the oven warm smelling and tasting divine one of my favorite things about steak houses are all the breads that come to the table right at the beginning of the meal and I'm gonna make one of my favorites today I'm using shallots and garlic and I'm only using one shallot so not too much nice oniony flavor but really mild and instead of chopping it up I like to just slice it and it doesn't take as long as onion to cook so in that 20 to 25 minutes it kind of just caramelize --is and all the flavors seep straight into the focaccia bread we've got the shallot then I like to add one garlic clove that's all you need just a little bit of that garlicky flavor what's a steakhouse without some garlic right so no it's funny when I go to a steakhouse for dinner I'm Todd I'll always get the big steak and I'll have a few bites of his steak but it's all the sides that I love so the breads and the pastas you know and of course the desserts okay so now that I've got that polute flour on the board there we go and the pizza dough and I like to make my focaccia into a rectangle just add a little bit of flour to my rolling pin just do it that way so again just like pizza we're gonna roll it onto the little rolling pin and then put it on the parchment on a baking sheet okay so now I get to top it all the things that I love lots of extra virgin olive oil I just take a little brush and just kind of brush the olive oil all over we've added that I want to add some coarse sea salt just get it all over okay and now we'll do the shallots and the garlic just mix it up you know so every bite gets a little bit of everything on it it also needs some herbs of course so I'm just gonna add a little bit of rosemary over the top great color and great flavor it's really fragrant too now this is the really fun part and I know it's gonna sound really weird but I'm gonna add grapes green and red grapes on top somehow the sweet juices pettite rate be a focaccia dough and that's it just want to press them down when you do it okay so I'm going to bake this at 400 degrees for 20 to 25 minutes until it's all golden-brown and super yummy today I'm raising my favorite steakhouse foods to a whole new level for a side dish I want something luscious that will complement my steak baked orzo with fontina and peas is absolutely decadent and delicious oh my gosh the shallots and the rosemary and the garlic heavenly while that cools down I'm gonna get started on one of my favorite sides I'm gonna make this creamy orzo so we're gonna start with some butter and chopped up onion and mushrooms I'm also gonna add a little bit of salt just a slowly stir to wilt and soften the onions so now I'm gonna grab mushroom and I just quarter them so you need to do and I'm just using some nice brown mushrooms but you can use any kind of assorted mushrooms that you like okay so we're also gonna add the mushrooms skin with the butter and a little bit more salt Rumer you want to flavor every single layer so you're not stuck adding tons of salt to your dish run at the end after everything's already cooked and then it doesn't absorb the flavor anyway just want to mix that all together okay so that's going to take about seven to eight minutes for the mushrooms and the onions to cook down so while that cooks I've got four cups of low-sodium chicken broth and to that I'm gonna add orzo it's one of my favorite little pastas and see they look like little grains of rice so one pound of orzo into four cups of low-sodium chicken broth that's boiling I only have to cook it for seven minutes until it's slightly cooked and we finished cooking in the oven later on and up next I'm going to show you how to put this fantastic creamier together
