it's time to get started on my curried white bean dip and I have one can of white beans that I already drained and rinsed these are super creamy so they make the perfect dip now we need one garlic clove I know it doesn't sound like much but we're also going to add lots of spices to this so I don't want the garlic to overpower just a little hint of garlic in my dip add it right in there then we're gonna add 1/4 cup of extra virgin olive oil again this is a dip we're not gonna cook it you want to use the best kind of olive oil you can find and then 1 cup of parsley flat-leaf Italian parsley you need aloo green and the dip and you love fresh flavor from the herbs add the parsley we're gonna add some zest and some juice the zest to perfume the dip and the juice to get a little citrus flavor we only need half of a lemon the seasoning a little bit of salt and here comes a little bit of spice so we're gonna start out with Madras curry powder and the Madras curry powder is an Indian curry powder so it's a little bit spicier than your basic curry powder two teaspoons so it has a lot of flavor to it we're also gonna add one and a half teaspoons of cumin and this is ground cumin and again nice and warm excellent and then a pinch of cayenne pepper about an eighth of a teaspoon blend it all together it's looking good scoop it all out look how creamy that looks look at that and I made these pita chips all I did is take a whole wheat pita cut it in little triangles put on a baking sheet just a little bit of olive oil salt and then I put it in a 350 degree oven for about 12 to 15 minutes can I take the pita chips dip it right in here
