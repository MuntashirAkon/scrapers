my gosh the food just landed on the table so excited okay how many times does this happen to you a friend calls up and says I'm in the neighborhood and I'd love to stop by well there's no need to worry because I'm gonna show you a few simple recipes you can whip up in no time it's really couscous with apples cranberries and herbs sweet tangy and very exotic chicken burgers with garlic rosemary mayonnaise a gourmet burger that's juicy and delicious and toasted pound cake with citrus cream simple ingredients that turn ordinary pound cake into a stunning dessert this is a last-minute menu that saves the day every time look she was that so I have a little olive oil in my pan and I've got this great Israeli couscous and they look like little pearls of pasta it actually is pasta but it kind of absorbs the liquid and they puff up and they look perfect because you can kind of spoon them and you can add lots of flavor to it but what I want to do is toast the two cups of Israeli couscous I just put them on medium high heat until the grains turn slightly golden all right while that toasts I'm actually going to toast something else to half a cup of slivered office and I love this crunch to the couscous just spread them out and then I like to toast them at 350 for just a few minutes until they're nice and light golden brown really brings out that nutty flavor so while those toasts let me check back on my couscous here see you can start to see them turning a really nice and light golden color like toasting bread it's the same thank you okay so to these really couscous I'm going to add four cups of chicken broth and you wanted to make that noise because it just means that the pan was hot so it was toasting the couscous when they absorbs all the chicken broth it gets really good flavor it really is yummy there we go so now you would just want to bring it to a boil and once it comes up to a boil I turn down the heat to about medium and let it cook just like you would let pasta cook so while the couscous cooks let's start in the vinaigrette really really easy so let's grab wheat apple cider vinegar maple syrup and while we're here some cranberries so we're nad cranberries to the actual salad but we'll do that in a minute first I'm gonna start with my apple cider vinegar and because I'm adding apples into these really couscous I thought it'd be nice to use apple cider vinegar so 1/4 cup of apple cider vinegar start with that and 3 tablespoons of maple syrup it's thick and it's rich and it adds a nice bit of sweetness and so you want a little acidity in a vinaigrette you want a little sweetness in a vinaigrette as well then a little salt got a season it and a little pepper then extra virgin olive oil because it's a vinaigrette and it's equal parts of vinegar to the olive oil and that's it that is the whole dressing we're gonna keep it light and clean the girls are coming over for dinner you want lots of flavor and lots of color but you still want to keep it a little bit on the light side so that is what I'm doing we're at swap bowls now it's not a big bowl we're gonna mix the couscous with all these different flavors so let's start with some fresh herbs about a quarter cup of flat leaf parsley so we're gonna add flat leaf parsley some rosemary and some thyme and the fresh herbs are one of those things that you always want to have around whether you grow them or just have them in the fridge because they add a lot of flavor and lots of color that I've got some beautiful rosemary and a little bit of thyme to both really bold but really good in here and plus I'm gonna use some rosemary in my burgers so I thought why not use them a little bit in the couscous too so about one and a half tablespoons of rosemary it's nice and piney and fresh and really good a teaspoon or so of time not too much and the couscous is now boiling turn the heat down to about medium and let it continue to cook and you just want to chop up the rosemary and the thyme together because you kind of want to bruise it and release all the aromas and all the flavor it's smells so good there we go time to add the cranberries and I love dried cranberries they're chewy they're sweet and they have this beautiful red color look at this it just adds so much color to the couscous so about a cup of dried cranberries you know what you can smell my almonds time to get those almonds now they just need to be toasted just a little bit not too much so you don't ever want to forget about them perfect they're just lightly golden that's all you need to bring out the flavor otherwise they burn very quickly let those cool slightly and so I'm going to add a Granny Smith green apples just because it's more tart and it can really hold up with a vinaigrette there you go this is good add the nuts right on top that's it basically now we're just waiting for the couscous to finish it needs a couple more minutes and when I come back want to show you how to put this all together and get started on the easiest dessert my toasted pound cake with citrus cream sweet and refreshing this elegant dessert can be whipped up in no time
