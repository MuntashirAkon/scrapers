I'm making my biscotti crust for my brownie and walnut pie and I'm using 8 almond biscotti just breaking them up into pieces and then the food processor is gonna mix everything together and make a great little crust and then to that I want to add half a stick of unsalted chilled butter you want it to be nice and cold so it can bring together all the biscotti and we can get a nice mixture I'm just cutting the butter into cubes just to make it easier for the food processor to mix it all together break them all up in there we also need a quarter cup of dark brown sugar that way you get that molasses II sweetness that I really like in here blend it all together put all of the crumbs in the center of the pie dish and have a nine-inch pie dish here spread it out evenly and then press down with your fingers so we're gonna pop this in the oven at 350 degrees for 15 minutes until it's nice and golden brown and then I'm gonna get started on my brownie walnut filling I just melted three ounces of chocolate with six tablespoons of unsalted butter and look at this it looks like a little chocolate fountain so this is the beginning of the chocolate walnut filling for my pie we're gonna add one and a quarter cups of dark brown sugar I love that molasses flavor in here plus it makes a little sticky too we're just gonna mix this in now we're gonna add three eggs one at a time so just make sure that the eggs are at room temperature so now we need a little bit of flour we're gonna do three quarters of a cup give it a little bit of structure I'll mix that in there and when it bakes in the oven everything melts into everything else so don't worry if you have a few lumps it's okay all gonna melt and be really good we're gonna add a little bit of salt just a quarter teaspoon of salt to even out all of the sweetness and now half a cup of toasted walnuts that I chopped they add a nice crunch texture in the inside so now grab our baking sheet and here is the biscotti crust pour the filling right inside oh yeah nice and decadent I'm just gonna pour a few walnuts you don't want to toast them because they're gonna toast in the oven when we bake this and you create a little decoration all around the sides and you put them all around the edges of the pie and then you bake the pie see how pretty that looks so I'm gonna pop it in the oven at 350 for 35 minutes until the top firms up but the inside is still sort of gooey and chewy this is gonna be really good
