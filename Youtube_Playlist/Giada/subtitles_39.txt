my friend tally and I are ready to test-drive another sushi roll this time it's a sweet blend of crap avocado and mango thank you that's good right so that's good all right you know what I think I could do with this one though black sesame seeds but I think it'll be really pretty against the white rice more just yet I love the mango mango too sweet is good yeah it's really really tasty I'm gonna cut my mango in just small thin slices that we're gonna use in the roll so I'm also gonna use some avocado and you don't need very much in this in fact less is more you don't want to overfill the roll too much or otherwise when you go to roll it everything kind of squirts off the sides so a little bit goes a long way just cut it again in small little thin slices everything is petite and thin and then move it there we go and then take my red bell pepper from before and again I just sliced the red bell pepper super thin all right so we got our veggies down now let's grab some crack so I got some really nice lump crap so a pound of lump crap and I've already kind of gone through to make sure there weren't any extra shells and broke it up a little bit so a little bit of mayonnaise it's funny how much mayonnaise you actually end up using so about a quarter cup of mayo no that's about right and some lemon juice from before about four teaspoons or so of lemon juice you can usually get that from a juicy half eleven and just sweeten it up a little bit some brown sugar we're gonna use four teaspoons of brown sugar and if you're thinking it's kind of weird that I'm adding brown sugar it actually works because the crab is slightly sweet so the brown sugar just enhances the flavor four teaspoons here oh that's four that's done mix it all together and I'm set back so now I grab my sushi nap now this is a sushi mat you can get at Asian markets and I just wrap it in plastic wrap so nothing sticks to it it's reusable it's inexpensive it's something you can keep at home and you can use whenever you feel like having sushi night grab some sushi rice so the sushi rice you can make yourself but I grabbed some from Thomas aku it's easy enough to make but it takes a while and you gotta get the right proportions of vinegar so it's just easier to buy it we're gonna use some of this later and now here's the trick to dealing with sticky rice now it's called sticky rice for a reason it sticks to everything so I like to dip my hands in some water and then I take my hands and spread out the rice and you want a nice thin layer and you want to keep a border about one to two inches so when you roll it up you just peel the mat off easily nice thin layer now I need the nori so nori is just seaweed so it's a sheet of seaweed again something you get at an Asian market but these days you can find it at your local grocery store so that goes right on top and now some crab so take about a spoonful of crab and you know what when you're making sushi kind of have to use your hands so that's good and then spread it out so lower half now we're gonna do about four slices of mango right on top and I love it the sweet mango then the buttery avocado let's start with two slices of avocado just like that and I'll put another two and you just want to put the avocado kind of bumping up against the mango and then I take a few slices of the red bell pepper for color and a little texture and put it right on top now comes the fun part so I take the mat and just hold the crab mixture Thanks flip it and low and flip and roll and don't look back just keep going okay and see how easily it comes off because there's plastic wrap on it and what up I just take that and you take the mat and just kind of squeeze it to form a nice roll and then then I take my black sesame seeds cuz I love the color look at that color combo right it's gorgeous and then sometimes what I do is I take it and gently just kind of rule it there and pick up all of the leftover black sesame seeds all over the table good way to clean it up now to cut it we're gonna dip our knife in some water because again the rice will stick to not only to stick your hands and sticks to everything sticks to the knife too so we cut the first one off and you want to dip your knife after each cut and then you want to cut them kind of thin depends on how you like to put it in your mouth I don't want it too thick see look at that how pretty is that you can see all the colors alright so I'm going to finish cutting and finish making my rolls up next if you thought all of the sushi look the same it doesn't see what I need it's my fun salmon hand roll a whimsical cone of sushi that's blast to build
