when I have a day off it doesn't mean I don't cook it means that cook what I want today my aunt Raffy is coming over to help me make comfort food with the rich flavors of Tuscany we're gonna make an easy batch of pasta dough and use it in three dishes like corn totally filled with cheese and corn and topped with tarragon butter crab salad Napoleon's are as elegant as they are delicious and sweet fresh fettuccine uses honey and citrus to make pasta a dessert treat this is comfort food for your taste buds you filled pasta makes great comfort food and that's why I love Tortelli I fill these little pasta pillows with corn and a mix of cheeses a simple tarragon butter sauce lets the flavors shine through if you never made fresh pasta before don't worry it's easier than you think and it's worth it once you taste these corn totally so one of my favorite comfort foods to make when I have a little extra time is fresh past that now because Raffy and I cook all the time together I thought it'd be a fun thing for us to make baby was going to make pasta all right Horace so why don't we do this I'm gonna start by measuring the flour okay so we're gonna actually I know we're gonna make it in the food processor but the only reason I like to make in the food processor is because I feel like you know obviously I learned to make it with the well well would it beat the eggs inside the flat or the mess okay so will you beat the eggs for me yes add a little bit of olive oil a little salt yes to it and I will measure the flour and when you measure the flour you want to make sure and level it off so using just the right amount and the eggs now I think it's really important with the eggs that they're large eggs not extra-large not small and that there are room temperature so I've got three cups of flour I have to measure here and I can't do it well again it's olive oil and if you add too much the dough gets sort of slimy and if you don't add enough then it doesn't have that wonderful fruity flavor that I love from adding a little olive oil it also turns the dough a nice yellow color which I think looks really nice and it helps when you need it yeah but here you left a little bit there every little drop a big size measuring did you add a little salt yep perfect all right see it's very easy it's just flour eggs a little olive oil and a pinch of salt it doesn't get any easier than that things that you should always have in your kitchen or in your pantry but I'm done I don't that I'm ready so I'm just gonna add the eggs right into the flour all right give that back to you and then give it a quick little quick little pulse just a couple of times just until all the ingredients bled together right now if you wanted a fee you could put a little flour on your board because yeah you're gonna knead the dough for me is that okay yeah okay the dough won't actually ever come into a ball but the way you know it's ready is if you stick your fingers like this and it stays together it's ready to come out of the food processor I have to say this does make it easier right you're at this or too much flour in that No so you need a little bit and then you let it rest so while you do that I'm gonna make the filling for our pie get the top job I'm making you work today what can I say and a lot of Italian families people make fresh pasta but we have a little bit different I mean a little more extensive history with Nana Dino your grandfather my father right your great-grandparents on the pasta factory in Torre Annunziata right and now it's before World War two right before during and a little bit after also I believe and didn't know no Dino like any siblings go door to door or something and know your grandfather yeah how do you know yeah went was sent to school and he escaped from school when he was 14 he said he didn't want to study I understand that some his father said okay if you don't want to study you're gonna work in the past effector okay and so at 15 he started traveling around Italy selling the pasta with the past in a suitcase selling pasta and there guys think what Bernard did his you know love for food and and how he became a wonderful salesman yep everybody that said yo who is he's not afraid salesman so for the filling I'm just doing some creamed corn one and a half cups and a whole though it's not a very Italian ingredient I like the cream corn just cuz it's smooth and slightly sweet but it's also salty so it's kind of a great combination then some mascarpone there again that a little bit of florally smooth creaminess just half a cup and then goat cheese the perfect sort of compromise between the two cheese's has a little bit of tennis from the goat cheese and a little bit of sweetness from the mascarpone and I love that for tarragon and what I love about the tarragon it has sort of an anise flavor to it it's just the anise flavor sort of brightens up the filling so and of course a little fresh black pepper so the filling is done the dough is done did after why don't you cover the dough with one of those towels right there will cover the dough and let it rest for 30 minutes the filling is done so up next we are gonna make the topping for the fresh pasta okay as soon as that's ready we're gonna start making some fresh pasta
