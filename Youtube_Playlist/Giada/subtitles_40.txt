you I'm making my opinion with traveese and goat cheese and the pin they're perfect because they're easy to eat it's short pasta so it makes it really easy when you want to eat it on the go while the pin to cook I'm gonna get started on the sauce it's gonna be a nice sauce made of spinach and Trevizo which is kind of like radicchio and goat cheese so bad 1/4 cup or so there we go and 1 clove of garlic not a lot just one club because I already put garlic in the chicken salad too so I don't want too much garlic in the pasta I don't want us to smell really bad so we're gonna infuse a little bit of olive oil with some garlic the minute you start smelling the garlic heat up that's time to take it out so let's grab the Trevizo the spinach and the goat cheese there we go we'll use the goat cheese in a little bit and I found this fantastic chorizo and Trevizo is basically it's like radicchio it's just a different shape then then ridiculous and the leaves are not quite as bitter but it still has a bit of a bite to it so what I like to do is saute it because it mellows out the flavor and we're going to saute it with a little balsamic vinegar which I'll sweeten it up just a little bit because most people think of radicular Trevizo only in salads but it's actually really good if you saute it because it just tenderizes it it makes it slightly sweeter well here we go with the garlic once you smell the garlic it's done there we go and we'll add the Trevizo right in here and if you can't find Trevizo well you can just use radicchio or really any kind of lettuce you like I just love the texture of the Trevizo and the spinach together a little bit of salt and some pepper then some baby spinach leaves I like the color combination we're adding lots of greens to our food today and the other great thing about all these greens is that they really hold up well when you pack them up give it a quick little stir already the trees are starting to cook down a little bit I'm going to add some chicken stock and some balsamic so let's start with the balsamic just sweeten up the Trevizo about a quarter cup or so of balsamic sweetness intensifies as it cooks down so it really does flavor them sweeten both the spinach and the Trevizo and half a cup of chicken broth and the chicken broth flavors it creates a little bit of a sauce and helps soften the leaves do that I give it a little mix here and let it cook down and we also want to add some lemon juice we use some lemon zest in the chicken salad and now we're gonna add some lemon juice about two tablespoons or so and if you have a juicy lemon you can get that out of half a lemon if not use a whole lemon so now let's taste the pasta let's see if we're ready for the pasta doesn't look like it but let's try it one more minute and that's gonna be dumb grab our bowl need to grab the basil because we're gonna top the pasta with some fresh basil you want to add it right at the end because it's fresh and it's delicate you want to call those yummy flavors but now it's ready I'm gonna add some red pepper flakes so just a pinch of red pepper flakes just like that not too spicy but you want a little bit of kick of flavor and especially when you're cooking with lots of veggies it's nice to add some red pepper flakes because it really gives the dish that POW it's fun for your taste buds is what I always say okay time for the pasta and then we'll also add the cheese there's the pin Nick yep that one got away add the pin and right into the sauce once you add the pasta and you kind of want to lower the heat a little bit and you want the pasta to be al dente I never really checked to make sure mm-hmm come on have a little bit of a bite inside I can't make a pasta without adding some cheese so we're going to add about one and a half cups of powder my channel my channel that we also used earlier in the arugula pesto and I like to add it before we add the pasta water just to see because Parmesan cheese kind of absorbs some of the liquid as well yeah we're gonna need a little pasta water cuz you want it to be you know have a little bit of a sauce in just the little pasta water not too much a couple ladlefuls that starchiness from the pasta water really works well to create a sauce on this pasta and as the pasta cools to it'll continue to absorb a little bit take all that and make goodness out of there we're gonna put it in the bowl and the reason we're doing this is because I need to cool the pasta down before I can pack it you don't want to pack it up when it's really hot so now time to add the fresh basil see right on top and the pasta warms it through that doesn't get cooked which is good and the goat cheese and the goat cheese creates such creaminess in this pasta one and a half cups of fresh goat cheese there we go cut it in half I just take it and I kind of just crumble it right on top and with good goat cheese you can do that and then it melts into the pasta and creates this creamy creamy sauce and goat cheese is so mild you know gives a little bit of a tart flavor and give it a quick little toss just like that and see the hot pasta will melt the goat cheese and it becomes a nice creamy sauce it's so good and I can smell ah the balsamic okay so I'm going to pop this in the fridge so it can cool down before I pack it up and up next I'm gonna make the best breakfast smoothie ever for our road trip it's really going to fuel us up and look at that gorgeous color it's sweet creamy and irresistible you want to add it right at the end because it's fresh and it's delicate you want to cook all those yummy flavors but now it's ready I'm gonna add some red pepper flakes so just a pinch of red pepper flakes just like that not too spicy but you want a little bit of kick of flavor and especially when you're cooking with lots of veggies it's nice to add some red pepper flakes because it really gives the dish that POW it's fun for your taste buds is what I always say okay time for the pasta and then we'll also add the cheese there's the pendant that one got away add the pin and right into the sauce once you add the pasta and you kind of want to lower the heat a little bit and you want the pasta to be al dente I never really checked to make sure mm-hmm try to have a little bit of a bite inside I can't make a pasta without adding some cheese so we're gonna cook down a little bit I'm gonna add some chicken stock and some balsamic so let's start with the balsamic just sweeten up the Trevizo about 1/4 cup or so of balsamic sweetness intensifies as it cooked down so it really does flavor and sweeten both the spinach and the Trevizo and 1/2 a cup of chicken broth and the chicken broth flavors it creates a little bit of a sauce and helps soften the leaves that I give it a little mix here and let it cook down and we also want to add some lemon juice we use some lemon zest in the chicken salad and now we're gonna add some lemon juice about 2 tablespoons or so and if you have a juicy lemon you can get that out of half a lemon if not use a whole lemon so now let's taste the pasta let's see if we're ready for the pasta doesn't look like it but let's try it one more minute and that's gonna be dumb grab our bolt need to grab the basil because we're gonna top the pasta with some fresh basil I'm making my pinning with traveese and goat cheese and the pin they're perfect because they're easy to eat it's short pasta so it makes it really easy when you want to eat it on the go while the pin Nick cook I'm going to get started on the
