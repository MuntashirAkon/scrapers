the first thing I want to do for my federal salad is cook my fibro so I just want to bring four cups of water and one and a half cups of fat olive oil and fat all it kind of looks like spelt or even brown rice it's an ancient grain that we used to be used to make everything from pasta to bread cereals in fact my mom used to have fodder for breakfast instead of oatmeal so sort of has like a toasted nutty flavor so instead of like a pasta salad or a rice salad if they use federal so we're gonna bring that to a boil and it's gonna take about 30 minutes to cook I'm just gonna put the photo directly into the dish it's so nice it's tender it's just a slightly chewy and if you can't find fabro you could always use brown rice I think it's the perfect substitute for that it just reminds me of trattoria cooking it reminds me of rustic Italian cooking there we go okay I'll leave that to cool just a little bit in the meantime I'm gonna pair all my vegetables so basically we're making a fatter sound right so you want to have lots of color and I think red peppers are perfect for this so we'll add that on top of the federal and see it already it gives it lots of color and we'll add the green beans that I already blanched earlier lots of color lots of texture it makes it really helpful eat this way as well and of course I'm gonna add some olives that great like eggplant color a salad is all about color textures and flavors so it's really important that when you're creating any kind of salad you really think of those things and you can use your favorite ingredients these just happened to be my favorite ingredients okay now time for the red we got a season Asst so I'm gonna make a sherry vinaigrette I'm gonna use about a half a cup of sherry vinegar it's mild and not as strong as balsamic vinegar we're also going to add of course some sweet extra virgin olive oil and because this is a dressing you definitely want to add extra virgin olive oil I'm gonna add some Dijon mustard just a tablespoon it sort of thickens the dressing holds it together and also has sort of a sharp clean flavor I love from Dijon mustard so just give that a quick little whisk okay now just want to drizzle it right over just like any other grain or any other starch the fatter will absorb the vinaigrette some sweetness from the red pepper the fruitiness from the olives and of course that chewy texture from the fatter that I absolutely love the green beans are perfect there's still a little bit authentic just the way I like them
