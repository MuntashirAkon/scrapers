so I've just diced almost all my vegetables here for my caponata 1 onion 1 celery stock 1 eggplant and now I'm doing the red pepper I'd say it's sort of like an Italian side dish it's like a relish and in Italy you'll find a lot that it's served with meat just as a side or a topping so it's really yummy but for me what I like to do with this is put it in the sandwich with some melted cheese and turn it into a panini now the thing is it sounds like well it's just a veggie sandwich but actually it's not just a veggie sandwich it's a sandwich that the veggies are cooked in sort of a sweet and sour type of sauce that I create with like raisins and red wine vinegar a little sugar so it's really yummy and super hearty as you can tell from all the veggies on my board it's going to be really really colorful and delicious I'm going to start by cooking all the vegetables now I like to use prep all the veggies have them ready to go that way I can add them in as soon as I need I'm not playing catch-up and I start cooking my onion and my celery and depending on where you go in Italy you'll find different vegetables in it and it just kind of depends on like what you have and what kind of vegetables you like so some people like to have zucchini and squash for me I really like a lot of color and these are my favorite things to make it with will salt a little pepper give it a quick little toss here he's going to slowly start cooking down the onions then I add eggplant with this kind of dish you don't have to worry about salting the eggplant because it's gonna cook down and get nice and soft and red pepper there we go get that all in there a little more salt a little more pepper and a little more olive oil there we go it's about 1/4 cup of olive oil in all but the eggplant really absorbs the flavors a lot it's kind of like a sponge so the more olive oil you use the more absorbs it so while that cooks grab my tomatoes and raisins and I know it sounds kind of weird but the reasons that really really good little sweetness that little bite of sweetness that you get kind of intense so let's start with the tomatoes and the tomatoes basically it's not too much tomato supposed to be like slightly pink it's not supposed to be like tomatoes saucy but you want a little tomato because that sort of gives all the juices and helps cook all the veggies if you want a little bit of moisture in the caponata mix it all together see the colors is looking good raises about three tablespoons and I kind of just like measure it with my hands that looks good so this is the sweetness the masala will add afterwards it's going to take a few minutes to cook down and in the meantime I'm going to grab the rest of my ingredients so all the veggies have cooked down and it's so funny because you start out with this big mound of vegetables and it just doesn't look like the same thing anymore but look at how Hardy it is so I've got a couple more things to add I told you it was a sweet and sour type of dish so little taneous Redwine vinegar it has a little bit of tartness so a quarter cup this is the traditional way of making it I'm going to add four teaspoons of sugar a little sweetness from the raisins and less sweetness from the sugar three and four you just want to give it a quick pulse jerks do you want the sugar to dissolve and some capers now I love capers keeper berries are so yummy because they're this little berry that grows on the caper tree and you bite into and it's super tangy about a tablespoon or so it's funny cuz Todd never used to like capers and I've sort of introduced them to him and now he loves them and oregano a little bit of dried oregano it adds a little bit of hardiness it makes it warm and really good just gonna give like a pinch or so and just give this a quick little stir and some of that red wine vinegar kind of evaporates you can kind of it smells good it kind of opens up all the sinuses okay so now grab the bread and the cheese so I like to use provolone cheese it's nice and sharp I think what melts really nicely at the vegetables and it makes again it makes the sandwich harder so that it can stand up to being the main course so I just cut the slice in half add it right there then you take this the top of the bread and I've scooped out just a little bit of bread just to create a little pocket for the caponata and I take the bottom flip it over there we go and now put it in the little panini maker and we're just going to heat it up for like three or four minutes heat it all up together so becomes one big sandwich we're going to continue that do a piece of the provolone a cut it in half so it fits on the little dummy baguette just like that and take the caponata and kind of spoon it in a little pocket that you've created there we go so good even just like this it's so good okay look at that a perfect little sandwich alright let's take a look at this one I'm going to grab a spatula see how smushed down already Jesus started to melt I just want to let it cool down before I pack it up so I'm going to keep grilling and assembling the rest of my sandwiches and then I'm going to get started on my gourmet deviled eggs with crap these eggs are an elegant variation on a picnic classic
