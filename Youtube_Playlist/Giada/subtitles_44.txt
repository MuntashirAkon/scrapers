chicken cacciatore has gotten a bad rap in America but my recipe recaptures it's bright authentic roots before I get started my chicken cacciatore I want to check on my cookies they've been baking for 30 minutes at 350 degrees take a look perfect so we've got biscotti dough flavored with anise which I can smell it smells so good and chocolate chips I'm gonna let those cool before I cut them and bake them again in the meantime I'm gonna start on my chicken cacciatore and the first thing I want to do is season my four chicken breasts and four chicken thighs some freshly ground black pepper Khachaturian basically is like cooked in a Hunter style so it's very rustic and a lot of times it tends to be an overly sweet sauce and an overcooked dry piece of chicken well this chicken cacciatore recipe will change your line and make you fall in love this dish again all right all the sides are seasoned let's add some regular olive oil to our saute pan because we're gonna Brown them up raise our heat to about a medium you want the pan nice and hot to get it nice and brown on the outside now I'm gonna cook the chicken in a thin layer of flour and the flour will help keep the chicken moist and give it a nice brown coating in northern Italy they'd like to make this dish with onions and carrots celery and southern Italy they like to use anchovies olives sometimes chili peppers so I'm gonna Brown this side and I'm gonna flip them over and brown the other side and I'm gonna get all my ingredients together for my fantastic sauce lower my heat just a little bit and I'm gonna chop my ingredients so I need some onion just rough chop this is rustic cooking you don't have to worry about sides anything else I'm going to add a little bit more oil so that there's enough oil in the pan to coat the vegetables so they can cook and I'm going to raise my heat to about a medium and we're gonna add our onions these three ingredients the onions the peppers and the garlic are the flavoring ingredients movie sort of the base flavors garlic that's a lot of chicken so maybe three so just a quick little chop there we go and into the pan the onion acts as a bed so that the garlic doesn't burn when you add it to the pan a little bit of salt and the peppers and I'm going to use one big red bell pepper you could also use green if you wanted to they're not quite as sweet because the red bell peppers are the ripened version of the green bell peppers so we're just gonna cut our bell peppers we'll add that to our onions and garlic doesn't that look good a little bit more salt just to release all the moisture and all the juices out of the vegetables and some fresh ground black pepper all right I'm gonna let this saute a couple of minutes just until the onions are fragrant and the garlic's favourite and the vegetables start sort of wilt and the onions will become translucent I'm going to use a can of chopped tomatoes and I'm using canned tomatoes because they have a lot of juice a lot more juice than fresh tomatoes have and that's what's gonna make this dish luscious like saucy consistency can of tomatoes some white wine we're using chicken lighters we're going to use some white wine some chicken broth and some dried oregano and the dried oregano is lemony and it's sort of earthy and it makes this dish rustic and it gives it that rustic taste and now some capers I'm using capers are preserved in white wine vinegar they kind of give it a tangy taste it counterbalances the sweetness of the peppers we'll bring that up to a boil just for a minute I'm ready to add my chicken we'll put the breast and the thighs back into the sauce and the flour from the chicken it's going to help thicken the sauce alright I'm gonna let this simmer for about 20 minutes until the chicken is all cooked through and now I'm gonna go check on my biscotti we're gonna cut them about 1/2 to 3/4 of an inch in thickness there we go okay so now we're gonna put a back on our baking sheet and they're gonna bake at 350 degrees until they're like a pale golden color on top all right they're ready to go in the oven 15 more minutes that's good
