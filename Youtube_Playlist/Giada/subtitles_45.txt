faison life a lot of people think they're too busy to make a good lunch but in just a few minutes you can create a delicious lunch to eat at home or take to work like this chicken and orzo focaccia full of eggs roasted chicken and cheese routine e with salsa de Mona is a simple pasta creation with the zesty taste of lemon a pear and gorgonzola tart has the flavors of a four-star restaurant in every slice Taleggio and peach panino is a one-of-a-kind sandwich that will make your coworkers jealous in the middle of your busy schedule take a break and enjoy these everyday lunches I thought that is one of the easiest dishes to make and one of the most satisfying I add juicy rotisserie chicken roasted red peppers and two kinds of creamy cheese cooked orzo pasta mixed in makes this a satisfying meal a slice of chicken and orzo frittata for lunch is a great start to the rest of your day the first thing I want to do for my focaccia is start cooking my orzo and I'm going to add 3/4 of a cup of orzo in here that's about almost half the box and see orzo they look like little grains of barley there little pasta which is gonna be perfect for my Futaba it only takes about 8 minutes to cook and we still want it to be al dente just like regular pasta so it's cooking for 8 minutes in salted boiling water all right while that cooks I'm gonna get started on my eggs and we're gonna crack 6 eggs now a frittata is basically like an Italian version of an omelet and it's open-faced so it's a lot easier in my opinion to make and the great thing is you can have it for lunch you could have it for breakfast you can have a for dinner really anything you want last egg here we go just give it a quick little beat just to sort of break the yolks okay now for the really yummy stuff in here they got the cheese now I need 1/3 of a cup of ricotta cheese whole milk okay just like that dump that in there and we're gonna add some creme fraiche now creme fraiche is very similar to sour cream it's a little bit thicker than sour cream it doesn't have the Tang so it just has all of that yummy creaminess we're gonna give that a quick little mix now I'm gonna add some scallions now I love a little bit of an onion flavor in my frittata so the scallions will add that little bit of a mild onion flavor also gonna add some flat Italian parsley I don't know about 1/4 cup or so you could add a little more a little less depending on how much parsley you like parsley in and next I'm going to add some roasted red peppers see here I'm just gonna use one and a half I also love the color that vibrant red color in there there we go and we're gonna mix this all together and the colors the green with the red see look how chunky that gets alright that's done let me just check on the orzo oh it looks good it's the perfect little strainer I love it we're just going to let the orzo cool for a couple of minutes before I add it to the eggs because I don't want it to start cooking the eggs if it's hot and you add it to room temperature eggs and start to cook them I don't want that to happen I want the eggs to cook evenly in the oven so let that cool for a minute and now I'm going to add a little bit of salt and some freshly ground black pepper to my frittata and the thing that makes this frittata so meaty and really makes it feel like a lunch chicken so I need two chicken breasts and I basically go to the store and I get a rotisserie chicken when you cook it rotisserie style it keeps the meat nice and moist I keep a rotisserie chicken in the fridge and that way I can make lots of different things okay you can make pasta salad you can make your frittata you can make chicken salad and so we're gonna use the breasts for the Futaba just cut those out just like that see how juicy they are mm-hmm and I can use the thighs and the legs for other things pasta salad chicken salad whatever you want now I'm gonna take the skin off I don't need the skin we're just gonna do that and you can either cut the chicken into cubes or you can shred it whatever you want I'm just gonna make this really easy just cut it up into cubes mix that together just like that see now you got nice chunks of chicken in here Oh whoo this is gonna be so yummy colorful needy and fluffy and creamy the orzo has cooled and we'll just dump all of the orzo into the eggs look at that so good I love orzo my mom used to add it to soups like chicken soup it's kind of fun because it's so small it's perfect for this big data now grab my baking dish and the orzo chicken all the veggies everything in there I put the baking dish on a lined baking sheet just because it makes it easier transport this baking dish in and out of the oven and makes cleanup that much easier 375 degrees for 25 minutes then I'm gonna pop it under the broiler for 5 minutes just to get the top nice and golden brown and we can eat it oh my goodness it smells so good you really smell the Scalia so now I just want to cut myself a little piece oh you can hear how create is even when you cut into it there we go so now taste that mmm mmm the chicken and the orzo make it super meaty nice and creamy a little bit of hint from the green onions you know what's so great about this dish you could eat it hot cold or room temperature and with a side salad it makes the perfect lunch
