let's face it the word leftovers doesn't exactly bring them running into the kitchen but all it takes for a few everyday items to turn your leftover ingredients into one delicious menu lemon chicken soup with spaghetti it's a great way to make rotisserie chicken last all week long this is a hearty soup that you can whip together in no time P pesto crostini crusty bread is even better the second time around and this colorful side dish tastes as great as it looks lemon mint cake with lemon syrup I love simple syrup add it to this light and airy cake and you're in for irresistible treat leftovers don't have to be boring these recipes turn yesterday's menu into exciting new dishes I'm starting with my lemon chicken soup with spaghetti and we're going to start with six cups of chicken broth and I'm using low-sodium chicken broth because I like to control how much salt goes into my chicken soup so I'm just turning on the stove about medium-high and we're gonna grab some lemon two lemons and some carrots now I know that traditionally you obviously don't put lemon juice in chicken soup but I'm telling you this is really good the lemon juice makes it really bright and really brings out all the flavors and kind of just gives it a little bit of that like zing that little punch so we're gonna add about a third of a cup of lemon juice but you're gonna get from approximately two lemons you know what it does the lemon juice really just makes chicken soup really happy it makes you smile and we've got two carrots so you can add whatever else you want celery or onion if you want to but for me it's all about the carrots and that's really all we need because we're going to add some other really good stuff in here so I already wash the carrots ahead of time and now just want to peel them because I'm adding all these different ingredients to it it makes it a really creative new dish and that's what I love about it I want to cut the carrot into little pieces and you can cut them any which way you want you know sometimes people like chunkier pieces in their chicken soup I like them kind of medium and I just put them directly into the pot this is great because a one pot meal and it's so good put that in there so let me give this a quick little stir just to make sure that everything mixes together so now for one of the special ingredients in here and I really do think that this is special the bay leaf and the bay leaf kind of adds that warmth to the chicken soup and you only want to add one hot smells good because it can be pretty strong what you do is you just let it simmer in there and release all those flavors and it gives it that warmth that I love so now let's grab the spaghetti and the chicken so you got some spaghetti and we'll just read chicken all right so before we add the spaghetti I want to add one of my special ingredients here my rind and as Parmesan cheese rind you can use romano cheese rind or Parmesan cheese rind but I have extra rinds just sitting in my fridge and what I like to do with them this is a great way to use these leftovers is to toss it into the broth it slowly starts to soften in there and melt into the soup which gives it an unbelievable flavor and the rind is not plastic or anything it's all natural so it can melt in there and it's good for you that's all good and I'm also going to add about a handful of spaghetti just take this biggity and I just break them up there we go and you can use whatever kind of pasta you want and I like the long pasta in the chicken soup it makes it really good and really pretty so you just add that all in there and add the spaghetti cooks moving on to the rotisserie chicken there we go so I use the legs earlier in the week so now I want to use the breasts and this is what I do I use about a cup of meat and I'm gonna leave the skin on just because it's gonna give the chicken more flavor and you can shred it or you can cut it up I'm just going to cut it up because it makes it look a little bit prettier and I just cut it into little cubes just like that smells good I'm just so yummy what I do is I just take the chicken and put it directly into the chicken stock and all you really want to do to the chicken is heat it through so while the pasta cooks it's going to take about I don't know five to eight minutes to get that all done so it's pretty quick so let's add a little bit salt and a little bit of pepper give it a stir and while that cooks I'm gonna chop up some fresh flat-leaf Italian parsley a little bit of fresh flavor and again when you cook something you know for a period of time you want to add some fresh herbs right on top so give that a quick chop and smells good and the parsley add beautiful color now I'm going to add a little bit of Romano cheese and what I do here is I just grate the remodel right into the soup then Romano sharper than Parmesan cheese so it gives it kind of a pungent flavor and then we're going to add a little bit more right into the bowl right before I eat it so it slowly starts to melt in there so the soups going to cook a little bit longer and up next I'm going to make these peat pasta crostini that's going to be perfect with the chicken soup and look how gorgeous a few simple ingredients transform crusty bread into something truly gourmet new dish and that's what I love about it I want to cut the carrot into little pieces and you can cut them any which way you want you know sometimes people like chunkier pieces in their chicken soup I like them kind of medium and I just put them directly into the pot this is great cause a one pot meal and it's so good got that in there so we give this a quick little stir just to make sure that everything mixes together so now for one of the special
