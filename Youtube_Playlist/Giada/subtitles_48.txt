I love to travel and recently my husband Todd and I went to Paris on vacation we had an amazing time god I love it up here I thought it'd be really fun to recreate the experience with an evening filled with all the great food and memories we had and we're on our trip to him having deja so check out my menu we'll start with my fresh mushroom and parsley salad it's simple and satisfying then my Parisian steak and cheese croissant sandwiches there's a story behind this one the cheese is traditional mistake not so much and a very fancy dessert raspberry rose pasta creme riche and delicious with a distinctly floral flavor table we may be in California but we'll always have Paris I remember that when I lived in Paris years ago there was this cute little gelato stand tucked away behind notre Dom so when Todd and I were on vacation there recently we took some time to find it and what I loved about this gelato was that they had these wonderful floral flavors especially their raspberry rose it's almost perfuming it was my inspiration for my raspberry rose puffed Eclair so I've just smashed my raspberries 3/4 of a cup of fresh yummy raspberries I'm gonna go grab a milk and cream here and basically pot de creme is just pudding in French so that's what we're gonna make it's gonna be really yummy and I think town's gonna really find it fun and the best part is there's a real treat at the end and hopefully Tom remember it when he has it in fact I know he will cuz it's probably one of the best desserts we ever had in Paris so 1/2 a cup of milk we're just gonna heat up the milk and the cream and then 3/4 of a cup of cream there we go and it's great because you can flavor this whatever you want and I happen to love puddings so I think the flavors in here will be very reminiscent of Paris now I also need some rose water now the rose water is really where the flavors come in so when we went to the gelato place I had a raspberry rosewater gelato so I am just gonna add half a teaspoon cuz it's pretty strong I just want to heat this up just like medium-low heat you just want the milk and the cream to basically heat up with the rose water so it infuses the flavor in it so we'll leave that and we're gonna start with the eggs so we're gonna need some egg yolks this is rich but it sure is good so I'm just gonna separate the eggs we need four yolks to make this there we go and I think what's so great about traveling is the ability to kind of bring it back home so that when you're home and you haven't been able to travel for a while you can kind of recreate all those memories and I think that's so much fun especially for me and for Todd right now because without a little baby it's kind of hard to go anywhere cuz she's too little so when we're missing Paris all we have to do is recreate the dishes all right one more egg and separate it off and the egg yolks make it nice and creamy and you want to make sure and use room-temperature eggs because we're gonna add warm milk and cream to the egg yolks and if they were cold they get scrambled really easily and a quarter cup of sugar we'll just add that right in there and a pinch of salt just to bring out the flavors there we go a little whisk and just kind of mix it all together okay so sugar and egg yolks and a little salt and that's hot enough and you can see that the milks warm because you see little bubbles around the sides and you slowly add that right in there and just stir it around to cool it off there we go okay so we got that now the raspberries and the raspberries add this beautiful pink kind of tint to it really pretty and you'll see little bits of fresh raspberry in here too I can actually smell the rose water already it was beautiful scent to it now move over here I'll put those in the ramekins I just want to grab my ladle and just fill the ramekins just like that you see the little bits and you want to feel it about 3/4 of the way up it'll be good there we go so now just add some boiling water because we're gonna basically make a little water bath here and you want to fill the water about halfway up the ramekins and it'll keep it nice and moist we're gonna bake it at 350 for 30 minutes and then we're gonna chill them and then next I can make my favorite fresh mushroom salad that I had just about every day when I lived in Paris delicate slices of mushrooms and Parmesan cheese make this salad light delicious and full of flavor
