now the mushrooms and the onions are nice and golden I'm gonna add some more Sala wine one cup of Marsala wine now the thing about Marsala wine is it's a Sicilian fortified wine so it's a little bit richer than regular wine and it's slightly sweeter too and what I love about it is that it gives so much richness to the mushrooms so what I want to do is just scrape the bottom of the pan get all of those little brown caramelized bits that's gonna add so much flavor to my creamy orzo I am ready to assemble my creamy orzo dish so I've got my orzo it's already cooked but I need my oven mitts because the pan is hot instead of draining the orzo out of the chicken stock just gonna pour all the liquid and the orzo into my bowl you need to give it a little liquid so it can continue to cook meat cheese cheese cheese cheese that's what makes the orzo so yummy and you just want to grate it because it's gonna melt really well just one cup of fontina cheese we're gonna add that to the creamy orzo mmm okay we're also gonna add a little bit of mozzarella cheese you want about a cup of mozzarella I just want to cut it into little cubes what's that enough in there and about a half a cup of cream all right you want that creaminess and that's what the cream is gonna give you and it keeps the orzo nice and moist when it continues to cook in the oven and my favorite thing in the world peas I love the color they're slightly sweet we're gonna add 1/2 cup of peas and I've always got in my freezer so it just makes it really easy salt little pepper right on top now making this a quick Little Mix number gonna add the mushrooms section indulgence so now let's turn off the mushrooms and the onions mmm let's pick up that pan and add the mushrooms and the onions a nice amount of meatiness time to pour this entire mixture into my buttered casserole dish to finish it all off I've got some store-bought breadcrumbs and to them I'm gonna add just a teaspoon of thyme dried thyme into that we're gonna add a little bit of Parmesan cheese you need a little more cheese on top otherwise you don't get a nice cheesy crust about a quarter cup of really yummy buttery salty Parmesan cheese and I'll just kind of sprinkle it all over the top just like that okay so now put it in the oven 375 degrees for 30 minutes until the tops nice and golden brown for my steakhouse dinner I have to have the perfect steak I start with a thick ribeye steak i season it with a crust of herbs salt and pepper and Grill it until it's just right then I serve it with a thick vinaigrette made from fruity black olives and spicy Dijon mustard my black olive vinaigrette makes this steak a four-star classic look at my creamy orzo it's got a beautiful crust on top nice and golden alright while that cools I can get started on my main dish the steak so I've got a two to two and a half inch ribeye steak so salt and pepper on both sides and we go pepper both sides and what I love about the ribeye is the marbleization look at that so salt and pepper really nice flavorful crust on the outside of the meat I'm also gonna add earth vermont's now this is what makes this extra extra special okay gives it kind of like a an herb acrost and the herb prevalence is just a mixture of dried rosemary thyme basil marjoram and lavender and it just sometimes fennel this one's got fennel in it too and it just gives it that extra oomph that makes the steak really yummy nice aroma to when the herbs touch the grill we're also gonna have just a little bit of oil there's already plenty of marbleization on the meat but you want a little bit of oil to help keep it moist and give it a nice brown color on the grill so now want to make sure the grill pan is nice and hot which it is we're gonna cook it for six to eight minutes on each side until it's medium-rare and up next I'm gonna make my black olive vinaigrette
