so did after the dos been sitting and resting for about 30 minutes and I'm just gonna cut a piece off actually let's just cut a piece up you mind if I use this alright and then you can get started on the butter the tarragon butter I've never used the machine like that I always do it by hand well I'm gonna show you it's pretty nifty actually now I'm just sort of flattening it out with my hands I'm slowly little by little we're gonna thin out the pasta sheets but you got to start in the widest setting only because you gotta get it through there how you doing I'm doing good I'm taking the stems off because they're a little of the tarragon yeah okay so you know that you're gonna do the tarragon the butter the lemon parm and corn I'm onto it see look head off and get a pull it out and turn it and we're gonna go to number five we're gonna go1 thinner the last setting which is eight and the sink okay and make it only thin so and I just want to flour it a little bit so it doesn't stick alright some corn there's enough lemon zest tarragon butter and my brother MacDonald yeah a little bit of Parmesan cheese yourself okay and what kind of parmigiano-reggiano it's gotta be only the best I need to lower this back down to one the thickest setting and now we go again to the innocent I put a lot of pepper I like this you can do whatever you want and with white sauces I like to see the black the black OH all right a little bit of flour just to make sure the dough doesn't stick to the board just like that okay so this is what we want to do now you want to brush them sure brush it with with the egg wash yeah I just brushed the whole thing it acts as a glue I think you've told me that you use egg whites I know zeglen you can use egg whites if you like I use a whole egg I crack it add little water and beat it so we've got our filling creamed corn tarragon mascarpone and goat cheese little pepper put some salt in that water maybe so you just want to press your fingers around the dollops just to get rid of all the extra air that's a big wheel it's good yeah makes your life a little easier okay so why don't we do this why don't you get some of these in there in the boiling water and I will finish cutting these two well if you pass me the bowl with the tarragon butter then we can start taking them out because you just want to cook them for a couple of minutes and they'll float to the top the pastas cooked and then the soc it changes call it does another and a little bit of water is good because it dilutes the sauce a little bit makes it creamier and thins it out put the other two in yes ma'am okay perfect you want to start gently gently tossing yes and because the butter was at room temperature it was slightly soft it melts very easily so much fun to do this so last one done the last one coming up perfect the heat of the pot sadly are sort of warming up the lemon zest and the tarragon Ethan has smell that so good how many do you want well I only want a couple only because we have more fresh pasta to make after this so I want to relieve room with your hands she's just gonna sprinkle a little bit of Parmesan cheese right over the top that looks great hey this is the best dish we've ever made together I think all right Oh Mabel don't eat too much because we have another fresh pasta maker dish tonight my crab Napoleon's I love promoting this it's too good she's gonna like the next one too I promise mmm
