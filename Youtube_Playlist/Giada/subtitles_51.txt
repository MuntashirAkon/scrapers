every working lunch should end on a high note this is a fantastic finishing touch you can feel good about a frothy chocolate espresso shake in Italy we like to finish our lunches with a little espresso so I thought it would be fun to turn the espresso into dessert and create a nice shake so I'm gonna start by adding 1/2 a cup of water to my pan and a quarter cup of this gourmet hot chocolate mix we're gonna add ass press o to the chocolate and create a nice mocha what I think is so nice at the end of a meal it kind of whips you up and it picks you up and it makes you feel good and you can keep working too which is really important we're gonna add 2 teaspoons of espresso powder right in there already smells good this is really yummy and then I just want to whisk it until the chocolate and the espresso have basically melted into the the water just like you would with a hot chocolate there we go and that's it I'm just gonna let it sit and cool for just a minute here and in the meantime I'm gonna grab my low-fat vanilla frozen yogurt and we're just gonna add the vanilla frozen yogurt into the blender and to make it even better we're gonna add one cup of fat-free milk so I'm kind of keeping this on the light side too and the milk will also make a nice smooth mixture so you don't have any clumps and to give it a little extra vanilla flavor two teaspoons of vanilla extract yeah finally the chocolate espresso mixture right in there and then you blend it all together and I've got 4 8 ounce glasses now this is a pretty rich shake so this should be just enough to keep you going there we are what got cute that is and that's it got you a little dessert that look good little mocha let's chocolate on espresso nice and chilly nice and frothy mmm so good and the thing is we all live busy lives but it's so nice to make a satisfying light easy lunch and it shows everybody that you really care and that's most important
