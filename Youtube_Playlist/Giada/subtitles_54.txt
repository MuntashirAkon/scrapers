I can't wait to when I can hug her and get closer and she'll actually appreciate it and not try to push me away it will be a looking forward to yes it's time to get started my mother a raspberry brown sugar panini it's basically like a dessert panini or dessert sandwich but it is so good and so delicious and so beautiful with the colors that it makes me very happy so what I like to do is this I take a nice rustic white bread and I just cut this end off of it because I want to use the inside part of the bread so the slices are all the same size I want to get eight about half inch slices from the spread okay so now I just like to put the bread on my sheet pan here and drizzle it both sides with some olive oil it gets a nice golden brown color and it keeps the bread nice and moist - there we go and I want to flip them all there we go and do the other side as well it gives the bread that nice crunch factor now what I'd like to do when I make paninis is kind of get all the ingredients together and ready before I start assembling so that everything is made and ready to go so we have some fresh rosemary now I love the smell of the rosemary it's nice and piney and I think the rosemary with the raspberry he's really really yummy and you know when I was a kid my mom used to make us raspberry jam I'm brown sugar so she'd put raspberry jam and then brown sugar on the top of the bread and then put it in the pinion maker and it was just this crunchy sweet you know instead of lots of cookies we'd have that perfect so you've got our chopped rosemary then we have matzo dead this Casa della is so good it's fresh mozzarella and you can buy it at the grocery store in the specialty food section and it usually comes packed in a little bit of water to keep it nice and moist so what I do with mutts that I left is I just want to slice it and I like the fresh melts that I left for this because it melts beautifully in the sandwiches it's really fresh and sweet and super yummy perfect but I'm going to grab there's little pieces of paper towel and I want to basically just dry the mozzarella just because it's packed in water and so I don't want it to make the bread soggy when I make the panini so you just want to make sure and just take any of the excess liquid off there we go so now that we have that just need to open the raspberry jam there we go I'm very excited about this so what I do is I get my bread and I add a just like couple spoonfuls of jam and I really like raspberry jam so I like a lot of it and just kind of spread it on the bread there we go okay so now a little bit of rosemary just a little bit because the rosemary is pretty strong so you only need a little bit of that then two slices of mozzarella cheese so it can melt and ooze all over and a slice of bread and I just like to add some brown sugar and see the olive oil helps the brown sugar stick to the bread so we get a nice caramelized crust when we put it in the panini maker just like that then I take the sandwich and I put it in a hot panini maker it's going to take about five minutes for the cheese to melt and for the top to get nice and caramelized and in the meantime I'm gonna continue assembling the rest of my sandwiches look at that panino whoo baby look at how that cheese has oozed out yeah look at that crust on top yes all right before I cut that one I want to put the next one on there we go now you got to be careful cuz they're hot I take a serrated knife and then you just gotta go for it and cut it down ooh babe look at that still steaming haha mozzarella is boozing out that raspberry jam I just want to sink my teeth in there all right I'm gonna keep grilling the rest of my panini they smell so good all right honey's are done can't wait to taste them sweet and super yummy perfect but I'm gonna grab dude's little pieces of paper towel and I want to basically just dry the mozzarella just because it's packed in water and so I don't want it to make the bread soggy when I
