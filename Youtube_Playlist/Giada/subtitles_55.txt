today it's all about pampering the girls I love this the whole thing is to get like one finger different manis pedis and a menu that's pure Zen Moroccan inspired Swiss chard rolls an exotic blend of hearty flavors wrapped in Swiss chard topped with a spicy sauce Nicoise salad pizza day two of my favorite things all in one a classic French salad transformed into a mini pizza chocolate avocado mousse bold chocolaty flavor with a rich and creamy texture one bite and you'll be hooked it's our own little spa day right at home you I just have four avocados for my chocolate avocado mousse and this is a recipe that I just love it makes me feel good about eating dessert you want to take the pit out and just kind of scoop out the flesh of the avocado and we're gonna mix it with chocolate I love chocolate mousse I love the texture I love the creaminess avocados are nice and thick they make for the perfect base for a mousse next we're going to add the melted chocolate half a cup of bittersweet chocolate and we're just gonna pour it right over the avocado so I had this once at a spa and I fell in love with it and when they told me there was aa Vacarro instead of Crean in it I flipped and I thought okay I have got to make this but what is so awesome is that it leaves you feeling really light and really good Plus avocados are really great for your skin we're also gonna add 1/2 a cup of unsweetened cocoa powder right on top of the chocolate and you know actually chocolate without a lot of sugar added to it dark chocolate bittersweet chocolate is actually really good for you as well we're gonna add some agave so instead of adding sugar we're gonna add some nice agave the consistency is sort of in between maple syrup and honey not as florally as honey not as smoky as maple syrup and agave is pretty popular you can find at the grocery store which makes it a lot easier to use okay agaves in next just thin it out a little bit we're gonna add a third of a cup of almond milk and almond milk is made from soaking almonds in water and then they kind of pop urate and strain it and you get this sort of milky consistency plus the nuttiness from the almond milk is really good in here then we're gonna add a tablespoon of vanilla extract and again sweetness right but it's a nice gourmet sweetness and we're also gonna add a little bit of salt just to balance out the sweetness all you gotta do now is mix it all together until it's nice and smooth and you just want to make sure and really mix it a couple of times really well so you don't have any lumps and make sure you use ripe avocados cuz they're gonna blend a lot smoother oh I smell so good see here think that perfectly beautiful consistency look at this it's shiny it's smooth it's creamy and it smells like chocolate which is even better okay now before we start putting it in the ramekins I just want to make sure it tastes right oh my gosh filled up perfectly smooth and sweet time to fill the heavy bag so I'm doing it this way cuz it's a spa day I wanted to look really pretty so I'm using a piping bag with a star tip now you could just spoon this into any ramekin or any Bowl it's really up to you and just spoon a bunch into here there we go and you close this up grab my tula ramekins we go and we are going to just pipe it right in here number one and two and now what we want to do is put it in the fridge for a couple of hours until it chills and sets and then I like to decorate it with a little raspberry just for a color contrast and it makes it look really pretty I'm going to fill the rest of my ramekins and then get started on my Morocco inspired Swiss Charles a feast for the eyes this colorful dish is packed with warm spice and lots of hearty flavors
