my chili smells so good it's funny it can actually smell the sweetness from the corn all right it needs another five to ten minutes so in the meantime I'm gonna get started on my crusty bread so let's grab some cheese and some scallions so we've got cheddar cheese a little parm that we're gonna finish off the chili with so we'll save that for a little bit later and some scallions what I want to do is this have sharp cheddar cheese about 8 ounces of sharp cheddar and I'm gonna cut it in pieces so I can put it in the food processor and get it nice and shredded so let's cut it in a few pieces I don't want the cheddar cheese to get stuck underneath the blades of the food processor so I'm gonna help it out and I love this cheddar and when you're gonna do this make sure that the cheese is cooled out of the fridge otherwise it starts to melt in the food processor all right so let's shred bitch better perfect now that we got the cheddar cheese in there let's get the scallions I like the mixture of the cheddar cheese with the scallions then we'll add some garlic and they also add some butter to it just to make it smooth it's gonna be really really good and I know the guys are gonna love it so let's chop up the scallions just one again help the food processor out just a little bit otherwise some of these ingredients they get stuck under the blade and then you have big chunks and what you want is a nice smooth spread that way it melts really well in the oven and kind of soaks into the bread scallions are in now we need two garlic cloves I like it to make a little garlicky perfect and I love garlic and cheese bread I just do it's one of those things that I really like it's so easy to make and so flavorful and I've never met anybody who didn't like it it's just too darn good just a rough chop is good girl again and we need the butter now the butter makes it nice and smooth so we need one and a half sticks of butter so about six ounces of butter unsalted room-temperature Beyer little salt a little black pepper and now we're gonna blend it all together till it's nice and smooth here it comes look at that we have got some cheese garlic scallions and butter look at that nice and smooth just the way you want it so I want to grab my ciabatta and I've got a nice ciabatta here it's crusty it's area on the inside and it's perfect for this garlic bread this cheesy onion garlic bread I just kind of cut it down the center there it's nice as you can make these spreads and they just leave it in the fridge you use it whenever you want it there we go see see all these little pockets right here they're all in air pockets which makes the bread itself crunchy when you bake it so now grab my baking sheet now just put this down just like that then we take some of the spread and you just want kind of spread this butter and cheese and scallion you see how nice and smooth it is that's what you want so it melts really nicely all over the bread and I like to kind of slather it on see how smooth it is so good I think girl if you two we're gonna pop this in a 400-degree oven for about 10 minutes until the top is nice and golden brown and the cheese and the butter soaked into the bread I will that bakes up I'm gonna finish off my chili so we can turn it off and now I got a couple garnishes I want to do a little bit flat leaf Italian parsley you know it's nice to add a little bit of herbs on top of something that's been cooking for a while it just brings out all the flavors Paris brings it back to life it's kind of how it works and that's why you'll see a lot of chefs finishing off dishes with fresh herbs for that exact reason perfect so Parsley's done and we've also got the Parmesan cheese and the Parmesan cheese kind of melts over the chili we just need the grater I grabbed my bowls we'll grab a spoon ha look at all the Swiss chard and the cord and all the beans and the chicken does that not look so good so comforting I'm gonna fill that up cuz I know they're gonna be hungry so then I do a little bit of cheese right over the top and see how it melts mm-hmm just like that and then garnish it with a little bit of parsley the guys are going to love this and then it's on to dessert my limoncello granita they're like creamy little icicles it's gonna be perfect
