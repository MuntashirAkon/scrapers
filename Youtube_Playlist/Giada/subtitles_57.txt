a lot of my friends have kids and some of them are coming over today I want to serve something that will make everyone happy food that's just as much fun for grownups as it is for the kids like fun individual pot pies stuffed with pizza fillings roasted chicken broccoli and mozzarella cheese and a garden of vegetables mixed with cheese and rolled up together in a pancake then baked in a creamy sauce and everyone loves this dessert cupcakes filled with strawberry mascarpone cream these dishes aren't just kid stuff adults will love them too I'm gonna make something fun for the kids that the adults will love too I've created individual pot pies with a flavor everyone loves pizza it's incredible how much flavor fits into each of my pizza pot pies the first thing I want to do for my pizza potpie is make the tomato sauce so I'm gonna add just a tablespoon of olive oil and start heating up my pan because we're gonna make a sauce maybe pancetta I just have a 2 ounce piece of pancetta and I just want to cut it into little cubes now pancetta is basically very similar to bake and it's basically Italian bacon although it's not smoked and it's a little bit sweeter so I think it's perfect for the kids so we'll take the pancetta dump it into the pan and then we're gonna add two cloves of garlic the garlic will flavor the tomato sauce garlic is done okay so now I'm also gonna add a little bit of rosemary now the fresh rosemary just gives the sauce a nice intense elegant flavor a little bit salt pepper stir it up a little bit so one thing that you think it's nice and golden you can have the tomatoes and I've got one can of crushed spend my time on Tomatoes here you want to bring the heat down so like medium-low and you want to simmer it for 15 minutes so that way the flavors of the Panchita the garlic and the rosemary infuse the tomato sauce and make it really yummy awesome okay so while that cooks I'm gonna make the filling for the potpie and we're gonna start with one and a half cups of diced nuts that I like just plain old store-bought mozzarella cheese and I love the way the mozzarella melts it makes the interior of the potpie gooey and yummy like a pizza just like a pizza top then a little bit of broccoli so this is what I like to do I like to hide the vegetables for the kids so they almost don't know they're eating their vegetables the kids will get their veggies and I'll love every single bite I want two cups of chicken just dice it I just went to the grocery store and bought two rotisserie chicken breasts now I just want to pour the sauce right on top just want to mix it all together nice hot I just think it's fun because the kids are gonna sort of open it up and just discover what's in there turning the ramekins over and I'll show you how I do this so I have six ten ounce ramekins and I want to fill them with the filling and I filled it almost to the top there and then we're gonna top them with with pizza dough all right I'm gonna clean up a little bit and start rolling out my dough to top these ramekins I have a one and a half pound pizza dough that I just bought at my local pizzeria and I've basically just rolled it out to about 1/4 inch thick now that I rolled it out I'm gonna take this big cookie cutter and I'm gonna cut little circles out and those cookie cutters about 4 inches or so wide there we go one more we'll bring the tray over and we'll take one circle at a time as you want it to hang over just like that see and the dough will stick right on top of the ramekin how easy is that last one here we go put it over the top just like that okay so now that we've done that I'm going to add a little bit of olive oil to the top of each one just add a little bit to the top just like that just like you would a pizza and then take a pastry brush and just kind of brush it all the way around besides the top so that the crust comes out nice and golden brown when the kids see it they're like oh that looks so good I want to take a little paring knife just make a little slit right on top just so the air can escape and then for a little extra topping and really make these pizza pop I'm gonna grate a little bit of Parmesan cheese right on top see the Parmesan cheese sticks to the olive oil and it creates this cheesy yummy pizza crust on top it's rain and cheese I'm top of the pot pies that's it so now I'm gonna bake them at 400 degrees for 25 minutes until the cheese is melted the inside is fully cooked and the top is golden brown this is gonna be so much fun you
