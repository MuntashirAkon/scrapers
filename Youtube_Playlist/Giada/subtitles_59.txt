I admit it I like to play with my food sometimes I create dishes just to enjoy different colors and flavors like pizza topped with orange slices of roasted acorn squash white gorgonzola cheese and peppery green arugula sprinkled red on top fresh white tilapia fillets wrapped in purple potato slices topped with a green chive and rosemary flavored olive oil and to satisfy my sweet tooth a peach colored mango cheesecake with a bright sweet basil and lemon syrup today you can unleash your creative side and have fun with food Pizza is the ultimate fun food the possibilities are endless sweet and spicy flavors play off of each other in my colorful roasted squash and gorgonzola pizza the first thing I want to do for my pizza is roast my acorn squash now what I love about acorn squash is it's not as sweet as butternut squash and it has these beautiful little ridges so what I want to do is cut both ends off there we go see how pretty there I love the ridges so we're going to cut it in half acorn squash has a nutty flavor to it I know it sounds kind of weird for pizza but I'm telling you with the gorgonzola cheese it's going to be divine not always it going to taste great it's gonna look beautiful and that's the whole point we're having fun with food so you want to use lots of different colors and textures and flavors to create something really extraordinary out of these really simple ingredients all right so now that we've got that I'm going to take my acorn squash and I just want to cut little rings out of it so there we go there abouts make sure they're all separate now to sweeten it up just a little bit I'm going to add some maple syrup a couple tablespoons see look at that nice and thick a little bit of salt a little bit of black pepper got a squeezin the acorn squash and one add some red pepper flakes and gonna little bit of olive oil and then just want to kind of turn it all around just to make sure that the oil the salt and pepper everything sort of coats all of the acorn squash see how gray that looks perfect and now I'm gonna put it on my baking sheet and just kind of spread it all out cuz you want to make sure that they don't overlap so they can roast evenly get nice and golden brown so I'm gonna pop this in the oven at 375 for 20 to 25 minutes and in the meantime I'm gonna roll out my dough so I'm just using a one-pound store-bought pizza dough all right time to grate some cheese just like that all right there we go now I've got them let's set it up get it all out we'll take the pizza dough so we're just gonna add let's sit on the right on top okay we're also going to add a little bit of gorgonzola cheese now the gorgonzola will add a nice spicy sharp bite to the pizza and you only need about a half a cup so a cup of oats a ten and a half a cup of gorgonzola now before I bake the pizza I gotta take my acorn squash out look at that nice and golden-brown they shrink a little bit when they cook but they look so pretty with the little ruffled edges so so nice okay so now it's time to bake the dough 25 to 30 minutes at 375 degrees and then after that it's time to top the pizza look at that looks so good you can smell like organs Ola I like it so while that cools for a minute I'm going to take my acorn squash that has already cooled off and I'm gonna peel the skin and you could do this with again with pumpkin butternut squash any kind of squash you like and it's so pretty so now you want to top it with a little bit of arugula right over the top some fresh peppery arugula just take the paper leave it right over to the board I just want to add a little bit extra virgin olive oil right over the top this is a little Neapolitan trick my grandfather always does over fresh pizza it gives a little bit of flavor to to the arugula will add a little bit of salt and acetone of it a freshly ground black pepper over the top just to finish off the pizza now time to cut it here we go look at that so good I'm gonna cut myself a little slice look how beautiful that looks okay so now take the pizza put the arugula right over the top that's my slice that Joe is so good and of course you get a cheesy bite from the gorgonzola cheese and a nice creaminess from the mozzarella because it's melts all over the dough it's colorful it's fun and this is gonna brighten up any table
