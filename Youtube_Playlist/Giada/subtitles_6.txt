my homemade cranberry nut granola so I'm just gonna toast some sunflower seeds and some pumpkin seeds about a third of a cup of pumpkin seeds and a quarter cup of sunflower seeds you can do whatever mix you like but I like it cuz it gives you kind of a burst of energy and it's gonna be perfect my granola so now I'm just gonna pop this in the oven just to toast up just a little bit and it kind of brings out all the flavor and then you add the toasted up seeds to the granola it's really good and in the meantime we all know that I love sugar so I got to sweeten up my granola concoction with a little bit of cranberry juice my maple syrup and brown sugar and I know it's kind of a little different cuz most people just add brown sugar and add sugar to it and bake it I just like it really chewy that really chewy texture when you bite into it's kind of like sticks to your teeth but it's really good so 1/2 a cup of unsweetened cranberry juice there we go dump that in there and the cranberry juice kind of reduces just a little bit and really gives it that nice bit of sweetness so cranberry juice maple syrup a little bit of really good maple syrup about a third of a cup Eriko and brown sugar we're gonna need about two-thirds of cup of brown sugar I know what else I need some cinnamon I like the cinnamon it kind of adds a nice bit of warmth so one and a half teaspoons of ground cinnamon let's turn on the stove yeah get a quick will stir just simmer it for a couple of minutes until the brown sugar dissolves so 2 cups of regular oats not the fast cook oats that you buy for oatmeal but the ones that take a little bit longer just because it's a bit more texture and flavor them quick oats will fall apart in the oven really quick so you don't want that a little bit of salt all right I smell my pumpkin seeds and my sunflower seeds and that's the thing when you're toasting seeds or nuts or whatever the minute you smell them there's super-delegates of a minute you smell them you want to pull them out because just a second too long and they can burn remember your nose it's a great tool in the kitchen so there you go they're nice and golden brown I just want to add them right in there I'm also gonna add some almonds now our sugar has dissolved you can see that slightly thick it makes it kind of sticky to which I live look at that mix that all together and I need to spray the baking sheets and vegetable spray because I don't want the sugar in the granola to stick after it's cooked so just a little bit little bit goes a long way and let's see here let's just pour it right on the baking sheet get it all in there and you want to do this while it's still warm because once it gets cold it's not as easy to work with so leave that and we'll grab there we go spatula or make it easier it doesn't stick to it just spread it out and then it'll bake it and get it nice and toasty cuz you want to cook the oats all right so we're gonna pop this in the oven again 325 for 30 minutes a moist and chewy trail snack that's loaded with flavor
