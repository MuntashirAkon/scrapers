if you want to make an inexpensive haunted house for your Halloween party it's easy I got some ideas from Bethany Barton can a Hollywood set designer and children's book author I think a lot of the fun of Halloween is more pretending you're scared than actually being scared Bethany shows us how to turn ordinary cardboard boxes into a spooky funhouse that your kids will love I think that I just have a kid great so I just tap into my inner child brain a little glow-in-the-dark paint orange is fun we need more orange a few spooky creatures I really like monsters and creepy things and skeletons and you have a whimsical house of horrors I want to do I think a big spider web your little ghosts and goblins will have a blast I'm just trimming my chocolate orange cake my spiced pumpkin and raisin cookies are out of the oven and they're cooling so I trimmed the ends off because I want to have really nice squares I let sit in the fridge for about 30 minutes until it firmed up and see I've done all of these already and I stick lollipop stick in it then I dip it in a little bit of melted chocolate and safflower oil the safflower oil allows the chocolate to set once it's in the fridge and keep it nice and shiny I take some of the little ghosts a nice color combo and then I come over here and I do a few orange sprinkles as well okay next one you this is really fun for the kids to do in Halloween so our chocolate orange pops are done now I'm gonna pop these in the fridge and let them sit for about an hour so the chocolate can set so it's time to make the grape of mango parfaits and these are super cute we're gonna start with a bunch of these black grapes now you could use any grapes you want but the black grapes then with the orange mango very Halloweeny they're nice and sweet and what I'm gonna do is cut them in half just because it makes it a lot easier to eat especially for the kids and I started this type of thing with Jade I find it's a much easier way to get her to eat the yogurt I'll give her a little parfait a little bit of granola I'll do some grapes and strawberries and just kind of do a layering of different fruits with the yogurt all right I'm gonna grab some mango and I'm using frozen mango that I just thought what I want to do is just cut it up a little bit let's grab one of our cups and this is the plastic cups with kids are holding and they drop it well no biggie right I've got some Greek yogurt that's flavored with honey we start with some grapes and we're gonna put a bunch of the grapes right on the bottom now we're gonna add the Greek yogurt and I like the Greek yogurt cuz it's nice thick and the honey sweetens it a little bit put a couple spoonfuls right in there then some mango and I want to make sure you can see the layers you can see the black and the orange and then the white because that is the fun of it and then more Greek yogurt nice then I'm gonna add some pumpkin seeds you know it's Halloween so I thought it'd be fun to toast some pumpkin seeds to finish it all off because I like a little more crunch and a little bit goodness some I'm addicted cookies they're almond cookies and they add a little crunch traditionally in Italy we eat these how many through cookies with tea I like it when the parfaits have sort of a little height on them I think they look a lot prettier that is my grape and mango parfait so I'm gonna finish off making the rest of my parfaits Jade and I are gonna change into our Halloween costumes and then the Halloween festivities begin
