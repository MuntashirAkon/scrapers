okay so now it's time for me to make my little tasty sandwiches for the hike I'm going to turn on my grill pan get it nice and hot and the first thing I want to do is make my marinade so I'm gonna start with my herbs tarragon a little bit of fresh thyme and some basil mostly basil a big chunk of basil a little bit of thyme and a little bit of tarragon there we go I like the tarragon cuz it's nice and light with the veggies and the time is a little earthier and then of course the basil well you just can't do grilled vegetables without basil nice and fresh kind of minty and I like the fresh herbs just because you know what they have a lot more flavor than dried herbs do it just makes a little fancier and tastes better all right herbs it smells so good oh really good that in there and some extra virgin olive oil or make a really quick marinade to give the veggies a little bit more flavor there we go and some garlic and these sandwiches are really easy to make and they're very portable and they're really yummy so a little bit of garlic just to flavor the veggies I find that this kind of marinade will make any kind of vegetable taste really good and living in California we got a lot of fresh vegetables all year round and of course fresh herbs so take advantage of it there we go chop up the garlic not too much just a little garlic get that in there we'll do some salt and some very finely ground black pepper and for a little extra sweetness there we go need a little muscle there some sun-dried tomatoes there you go they're intensely sweet so chewy they're really good they need a little sweetness in the sandwich just chop that up you know sometimes I eat these but just like the handful just as a snack I put them in salads equipment everything and look at that color with the green from the fresh herbs yummy alright let's just mix that all up now time for the veggies we're gonna start with Japanese eggplant and I like them because the skin is super thin so I don't have to salt it I don't have to wait or have to do anything I just slice it and put it on the grill also it fits in the sandwich perfectly there we go and zucchini Todd and I both love zucchini and they're just as Hardy as eggplant so it works really well on the sandwich get a little variety here and again cut it about 1/4 inch thick and get the veggies into the marinade you just want to give them a quick toss that's it good girl all right my grill pan should be hot so let's get veggies on the grill all right so those cook for a couple of minutes in the meantime I've got my baguette and what I want to do with the leftover marinade is just put it on the bread you want to make use of this marinade because it's really good stuff okay so put it there and then we'll season the top piece too and I like this cuz the perfect size will cut it in half and then Todd can have one half I can have the other it's the perfect amount of food when you're going hiking so let's just grab all of that all right get rid of that flip these guys over there we go nice grill marks soft yummy all right now time for little cheese got a little goat cheese and I took the goat cheese out earlier so they can be nice and soft so I could spread it on the baguette oops I really like goat cheese Todd really likes goat cheese so it works really well and we'll put a little bit on the top as well see how easy it is just spread if you leave it at room temp look at all those great colors close that up and grab my bag of spinach I'm using little baby spinach just again it makes it a little bit more special than just using regular lettuce and spinach holds up better so as I'm going on my hike it won't wilt the way that regular lettuce will wilt in a salad actually I'm gonna wait hold off on that for one second I'm gonna start taking my veggies off see how golden and beautiful those are nice grill marks and lady eggplant slices right on top of the goat cheese and the hot eggplant to was like soften the goat cheese even more flavor it and then a layer of zucchini there we go I think we can get one more then the extra veggies I just kicked them in the fridge I snack on them perfect look how pretty that looks a little bit of spinach right on top see oh nice that looks and then put the top on there we go and push downs everything sticks together and I'll have to do is cut it here we go look at that does that not look great they're gonna be great alright so all I have left to do now is wrap these sandwiches up get all my hiking gear together and one cut get you we're going hiking all right so those cook for a couple of minutes in the meantime I've got my baguette and what I want to do with the leftover marinade is just put it on the bread want to make use of this marinade because
