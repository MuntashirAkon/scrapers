we're going to see the Los Angeles Philharmonic tonight so my dinner has to be classy here's an easy way to make vegetables you can serve at a black-tie event for star success with asparagus and zucchini groovy my corn meal rosemary cake has out of the oven and is cooling so in the meantime I'm going to start on my appetizer and when I went to the store I found these beautiful vegetables these two Keeney which I'm just gonna cut the ends off of and beautiful asparagus I'm going to show you a really great way to make these zucchini are super sweet when they're in season and the skin is tender it's always very very tender so the perfect vegetable for this and you create these little ribbons just like that with the vegetable peeler just keep doing this and it's called khru D in Italian so raw is cruelly so it's like a vegetable Kruti there we go okay that's all we can use a Mac zucchini and now we'll use this one and so you get these nice and long strands go ahead and just run your vegetable peeler all the way down and look at that nice big mound of zucchini now for the asparagus we're gonna cut the ends off of the asparagus I just blend them up and I just cut them on a bias and you get these pretty little pieces look how nice these look aren't those pretty about 1/8 of an inch or so okay add all of my spare this now to make a little dressing now I want to make something really simple and I don't want to overpower the fresh clean flavor of the vegetables make a little bit of lemon juice and olive oil so just squeeze the lemon juice some fresh lemon juice about two tablespoons or so and we're gonna add some salt and some freshly ground black pepper so when I say it's a simple dressing I mean it's a simple dressing the acid comes from the lemon juice but it's very fresh and it brightens up the flavors of the vegetables and that's about a quarter cup or so of fruity extra-virgin olive oil and you just want to whisk it in just to mix the dressing together so you get a nice blended dressing there we go so you add that right in there and we'll toss the salad together you can smell the olive oil on the lemon juice on the veggies it smells so good I'm just gonna place the salad right into the serving bowl here see how beautiful that zucchini is and now to make it extra extra special I'm gonna add some pecorino some pecorino romano right on top and just shave a couple of curls become beautiful it just makes it super elegant and absolutely gorgeous pecorino romano is very similar in texture to parmesan but it's a lot Tangier and a little bit saltier and the salads done how simple was that my corn meal rosemary cake is now cooled and when it's cooked it pulls away from the sides and it gets a nice golden brown color on top so now so you can take the pan in your hand I'm going to put it on this cake stand so I just want to flip it over and because I put butter and flour in the bottom of the pan that's how easy it is to get it out of the pan and look how pretty that looks I love it okay now I want to decorate the top with a little bit of confectioner or powdered sugar adds a little more sweetness on top it makes it look that much prettier so just a little right on top there we go my chrome wheel cake is ready now dinner is almost ready but I have one more thing I got to mix up my cocktail to toast our evening with my apple and thyme martini
