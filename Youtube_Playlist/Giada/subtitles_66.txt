so it's time for my mango lime Bellini and a Bellini is a classic Venetian cocktail except that I'm gonna give it a different spin and I'm gonna just add a little bit of mango nectar and a little bit of lime juice traditionally in Venice they make it with peach so when I do this I take a little wedge of lime and we're just gonna run it around the rim of this little champagne flute then I'm gonna take the glass I'm gonna put it in some sugar and you've got a beautiful sugary rim which I just love and I take that same wedge and I just squeeze the juice right into the glass and the lime just takes out a little bit of that bite of the sweetness of the mango then we take some mango nectar and we're gonna pour about a quarter cup and then for the fun stuff the bubbly we're gonna do some Prosecco so it's Hallion sparkling wine got to have the Prosecco right yeah love it okay so then we're gonna pour about a quarter cup or so of the Prosecco directly on top of the mango nectar and that is my mango lime Bellini I just love the color and I love the whole combo but most of all I love the taste it's a perfect pairing with a little tart a little sweet and of course the effervescence and it finishes it all off with a little bit of sugar this is good stuff here's to Venice
