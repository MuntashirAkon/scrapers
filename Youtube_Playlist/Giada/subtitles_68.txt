it's time to get started my potatoes and I'm making bacon and punch eat the potatoes I love pancetta but Karolina loves bacon so I thought I would infuse both of those flavors in here and I always have to chip it in my fridge in my freezer and I kind of portion it out like this so I can use it whenever I need it in soups and stews and sauces I really like it and it's different from bacon in that it's not smoked like bacon is and has a little less fat and it's also flavored is usually peppercorns in it sometimes even pistachios and so I'm just cutting up the punch it into little cubes so that I can put it in the skillet and just kind of get it all crispy it's gonna render all the fat and then we're gonna cook the potatoes okay I can't think of anything better and Karolina loves or potatoes so then what I just take the bacon and just kind of cut it in little slices here then we're gonna turn it around and tape it there we go let's add all the bacon in there you want the pan about medium-high heat and it takes a couple minutes for all the fat to get rendered and get them nice and crispy so while those cook just start it on the potatoes and we also need a little garlic so let's start peeling our potatoes all right last potato there we go so potatoes are done all right we need a little bit of garlic just one clove is plenty and I'm gonna slice the garlic so that way it can infuse in the potatoes I don't want too much garlic just a little bit just to flavor the potatoes and just slice it up hello Joe so now potatoes are done garlic is done let's check on this bacon and pancetta grab my plate I just want to line a plate with some paper towel just so all of the extra fat can kind of go into the paper towel look how golden brown and crispy this looks I want to just spoon them out with a slotted spoon because I want to hold on to the fat in the pan so I can cook the potatoes in it there's no better way to add lots of flavor to them and to cook them in the rendered fat perfect so let that cool down over here meantime we're gonna add the garlic infused some garlic in there and start cutting out the potatoes and basically just cut them up in cubes about 1/2 inch or so remember the smaller you cut them the faster they cook a little salt a little pepper you want to season them with it great flavor give them a quick little toss the potatoes gonna take about 20 minutes to cook until the outsides nice and crispy in the insides nice and soft who the potatoes looks so good nice and crispy golden brown okay so I grab some time for my backyard and really all I want to do is take the time and just strip off the leaves it's really easy nice and lemony and fragrant and the thyme kind of holds up really well with the potato it's a really Hardy herb and of course that wonderful color give it a quick billster be careful not to break up the potatoes those look good I'm gonna take the cool punch it then bacon put it back in there nice so good nice and crispy salty that nice salty bite okay and grab our bolt turn off the heat and there we go how good does that look well salt all right potatoes are done so up next I have the best welcome home dessert my roasted apple pies with whipped creme good old-fashioned American favorite with a sweet and whimsical twist
