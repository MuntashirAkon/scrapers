I'm creating my pecorino for my three cheese and artichoke Casone I'm gonna make individual cuts Tony today I'm grading about a half a cup of pecorino and the pecorino has a nice sort of salty bite to it it's not aged as long as parmesan so it has a little bit more of a salty bite and it's so good in here so we're just going to put the pecorino directly into the food processor we need to also grate some fontina cheese about 1/3 of a cup of fontina the best kind of fun FINA comes from northern Italy so if you're looking for fontina try and get the northern Italian brands only because they tend to be creamier and almost buttery and fontina is one of those cheese's that melts beautifully it's one of the best melting cheese's but it does have a lot more flavor than mozzarella which is why I like it for the cut Sony it's a semi-soft cheese so I like to put it in the fridge and get it nice and cold before I grade it that way grates really nicely so yeah maybe eat and snack on to just add it right in there next a little bit of ricotta cheese so 1/2 a cup of ricotta nice and soft you need a little bit hold the filling together we got the cheese then we're gonna add a little bit of lemon we're gonna zest a whole lemon and then we're just gonna juice half of it now the lemon works really well with the artichokes okay so lemons in next we're gonna add four ounces of frozen thought-out artichoke hearts they add texture and flavor I love them sort of a staple frozen ingredient for me we're also gonna add some sun-dried tomatoes I'm just gonna give them a rough chop only because they don't have as much moisture as the artichoke so they tend to take a little bit longer to kind of break down nice and sweet some salt season it really well a little bit of pepper so let's just blend this all together until you get a nice chunky filling now let's just taste this make sure she's right mmm I love all that cheese honestly the combo the pecorino on the fontina is divine okay filling is done so let's start rolling out our dough so I have one dough ball that's about a pound and I cut it in four because I'm gonna make individual cuts oniy you can definitely make one big one if you wanted to so what I do is I take the ball and then just want to roll it out into a circle and you can get store-bought dough anywhere these days okay take some of the filling nice and chunky we're gonna put it with the air may be a little bit more I need a little bit of egg white that I just beat and what I want to do is just brush all the sides and this is gonna seal the counts on it okay so then you take one side and you fold it over and then I like to just fold over the sides I'm keeping it kind of rustic and then you want to pick it up move it over to our baking sheet just put a little bit of cornmeal give it sort of a little texture on the bottom then I take a paring knife and I create a little vent on the top so that all the moisture inside can come out then last but not least we're just going to drizzle a little bit of olive oil over the top to get a nice golden color what it bakes all right let's do our second one we're gonna bake these at 400 degrees for about 30 minutes until they're golden and the cheese inside is hot melted and gooey look how gorgeous my calzone is you can see all the filling in there and all the color I'm gonna take a piece of this nice and cheesy and this meeting us from the out jokes and the sweetness screws on our Tomatoes mm-hmm all right up next a sweet and creamy treat my citrus gelato a cool and creamy Italian dessert with a California twist
