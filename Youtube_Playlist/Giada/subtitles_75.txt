the perfect side dish with chicken cacciatore is a big bowl of my smashed Parmesan potatoes my potatoes are cooked I've drained them and I've reserved a little bit of water just because there's not a lot of liquid in these so sometimes I need a little extra liquid with this potato masher I can just mash them all right up and you can tell they're cooked you can just stick a fork in the potatoes when they're fork-tender they're ready to go and I love the texture of the skin but if you don't like the skin you can always take it off these are hot all right those are ready I get all of this stuff out I want all right we're gonna add half a cup of extra virgin olive oil lots of flavor and some salt of course some Parmesan cheese about two-thirds of a cup ground black pepper and I'm gonna mix together here a little bit more and I just want to see if I need a little water if they're too dry add just a little bit of water it'll sit them out but still has the potato flavor that's why you don't want to just use regular cold water you want to use the cooking water and it's just a little dry so I'm just gonna use put a tablespoon or so there we go yeah there we go mmm get to smell the Parmesan cheese my potatoes are ready and so is everything else I'm ready to dig in there's nothing more satisfying than rustic Italian cooking like my classic chicken cacciatore in a tomato and wine sauce smash parmesan potatoes crunchy lemon parsley just get de and might be scuffie flavored with anise and chocolate these dishes are delicious they're simple and they really hit the spot you
