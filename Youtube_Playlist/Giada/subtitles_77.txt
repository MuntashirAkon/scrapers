I'm getting started on my spiced pumpkin raisin cookies and these are super chewy inside and they've got sort of a sugary crust on the outside so we're gonna start with the dry ingredients first so we're doing one cup of flour we're gonna add 2/3 of a cup of whole rolled oats and not the quick oats we really want the texture in here next we're gonna add half a teaspoon of baking soda and the baking soda will help the cookies kind of rise a little bit and half a teaspoon of salt fine salt next we are going to add a teaspoon whole teaspoon of ground cinnamon it's a great spice without being spicy and then 1/4 teaspoon of all spice it asks spicy like cinnamon but not a sweet so the to work really well together now we want to just whisk it now that that's all mixed together we're done with that and we're gonna switch bowls we're gonna continue with the wet ingredients so we're gonna start with some pumpkin puree and this comes in really handy during this time of year I use it for a lot of different things and these cookies don't have any butter and they don't have any eggs and they're vegan cookies I have a French child can't have any eggs so I thought I'd come up with some really delicious cookies that kids are gonna love but that you know my best friend's son can also eat at a party 1/2 a cup of pumpkin puree then it makes them nice and chewy on the inside next we're gonna add some sugar 3/4 of a cup of raw sugar see it's like a light golden brown it has a nice texture to it so it creates sort of a little bit of a crunch on the cookies we're also gonna sprinkle the cookies with a little bit of this raw sugar on top as well but it tastes just like regular sugar then a little more sweetness but this is a different type of sweetness we're gonna add a tablespoon of maple syrup and you can see that maple syrup is thick but not as thick as honey it's got a nice smokiness then 1/3 cup of vegetable oil we need a little bit more moisture since we're not adding any butter perfect vegetable oil but in there and then we're gonna do a little bit of vanilla extract so about a teaspoon of vanilla extract let's mix this first before we add the raisins in there and we're gonna add a half a cup of raisins and Jade is really into raisins these days as most kids are they're chewy and they're sweet it's in place of chocolate chips of course mix this all in we're gonna add the dry ingredients two batches at a time to allow the wet ingredients to slowly absorb the dry agrees that way you get a nice smooth cookie dough great and second batch awesome and that's it so now let's just move all of this stuff out of the way make some room and grab our baking sheet that I've lined with parchment paper just so the cookies don't stick and plus it makes it a lot easier for cleanup make sure you level off the cookies so they're all the same size drop them right there and then I kind of Pat them down just a little bit and then I top it with a little bit of the raw sugar when it bakes it kind of puffs up a little bit it's chewy on the inside and then it has that wonderful sort of sugary crust so what I'm gonna do is finish off my cookies then I'm gonna bake them at 350 degrees for about 20 minutes and up next I'm gonna finish off my chocolate orange pops and it started on my food parfaits a playful Halloween treat that the kids and grown-ups will love
