alright so the chicken is cooked and I've just added some spices in here some dried herbs onion little garlic and white meat chicken so now to thicken this up a little bit I'm gonna add three tablespoons of flour it's gonna thicken the chili and that's what we want and what I want to do is add the flower before I add any liquid to it because I wouldn't just cook at all that raw flour flavor just for a minute here you can already see the chickens starting to get a little thick already so now time for the cannellini beans I've been talking about they're creamy and yummy so we're gonna add two fifteen ounce cans of keneley tea beans that I've already drained and rinsed when they're in the can they have a little extra salt you just want to rinse that out give that a quick little stir oh it's looking good all right so now a little color and because Todd loves corn I'm gonna add a little bit of corn in here about one and a half cups and I just thought it out see it's nice and pretty little corn kernels they'll be really yummy give that a little stir there we go now a little kick and a little seat I'm gonna have a quarter teaspoon of red pepper flakes if you don't want the chili to be too spicy add the red pepper flakes right at the end but Todd likes a little heat in this chili so we're gonna add it right now and let it cook give that a little stir and time for a little greenery so I found some beautiful Swiss chard at the store and I've already washed it and I happen to love Swiss chard it's in the beet and spinach family so we can always you know substitute with beet greens or spinach if you want and I just take the rib that's right in the center here and I just cut it out the ribs are perfectly good to eat but they take a lot longer to break down and they don't get us tender as the leaves do so I just cut them out and I just use the leaves it adds a nice texture and you kind of feel like you get you know a little bit of everything you need right in every single part of the chili so I take all the leaves together just kind of scrunch them up and then just chop them up just like that and they'll just wilt down with the chili I scoop one and just like spinach it looks like a lot but when it wilts down it's not much a little bit more salt just to flavor each layer that we're adding to the chili you gotta love chili everything in one pot everything in one bite it's so easy to cook and it's so yummy so lastly we're gonna add some chicken broth so 4 cups of low-sodium chicken broth and I like to use low-sodium just so I can control how much salt is in my chili and if you're using beef that you can just add beef broth or of course you can always add water but add a little more salt than cuz you need to add more flavor to it and just again get a little stir the Chili's gonna cook for about 50 minutes to an hour until it gets nice and thick and all the flavors can marry together so this is a really good time for me to go set up dinner by the fireplace tonight target's back it's all ready to go me mmm it smells so good it's really getting there it's getting nice and thick all right up next I'm going to show you the perfect crusty cheesy garlicky bread then we're gonna serve with this chili it is gonna be perfect gooey chewy and insanely delicious you
