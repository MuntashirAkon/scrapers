I found these fantastic fava beans at the farmers market and I couldn't resist I love to use them and you see you open up the pod just like that and see they're all in a row they're so cool so just pick them out of here and I've got four cups of chicken stock that's boiling so I'm just gonna throw the fava beans in here and cook them and you don't even have to peel them as long as you cook them all the way through you can puree them and they're good and yummy and nice and tender it takes about 8 to 10 minutes for them to cook through so while that happens I'm going to turn on my skillet and add a little bit of olive oil because we're gonna cook some red snapper fillets so well let's grab the red snapper I like to use you know a white fish for this so you could use cod too if you wanted and see how nice those look aren't they beautiful so basically I just want to season them with a little salt little pepper make it super easy just flavor them salt and pepper on both sides and they'll cook up in no time like three to four minutes because they're nice and thin and I know the girls are going to love it because red snapper is very mild so it's going to work really well with the fava bean puree that way we can really taste the fava beans which is the special ingredient here little salt and pepper on the other side and freshly ground pepper okay just gonna put my fillets there let's go it I'm just gonna cook them for a few minutes just until we get a nice golden crust it'll cook pretty quick all right so let me just clean up real quick so now let's check our beans looking good okay so you know they're cooked when the skin starts to crack a little bit and starts to just kind of get a little Winkley so you know that's cooked so now we're at my oven it's because it's hot and we'll bring it over and now I'm gonna puree it so we take them throw it in there it's gonna be good and I do this with peas too so now I want to add two ladlefuls of the chicken stock that's reduced to kind of clean it out there we go let's put that in the sink and add a little salt and pepper season it up and we're also going to add some Mitch now I picked them into out of my backyard which is kind of the whole idea with you know bringing a little bit of the garden into your home and into the food that you eat it's seasonal it's yummy it's fresh and you know it's clean I'm just gonna save a couple of sprigs here just wanna decorate the fish with it you just wanna pull through until you get the nice correct all right so now we're gonna flip the fish because only use a couple minutes on each side you just want to flip it over yep nice and firm to get a nice golden color on the other side okay another minute on that side I'm going to show you how to do these plates grab a plate and I put a couple of the squash blossoms on the plate I just make them look cute just like that then I grab a piece of fish and ah smells so good smells so minty I love it some of the fava bean puree right over the top it's heaven okay and then I take a little mint sprig and I put the mint sprig right on there how beautiful is that look don't you love it it looks so good it looks like it's fresh out of the garden so you know what I'm gonna plate the rest of my fish and then it's time to dig in and get this garden party started
