so my dough is chilled for two hours and now I just want to cut it in half and I like to store the rest of the dough in the freezer so that way whenever I need cookies I can bake them off so you just want to unwrap the cookies then you just want to cut them in about half inch pieces or so now that the dough is chilled it's really easy to cut through it all right so now the last ones cut I'm just gonna place them on my baking sheet that I'm lined with parchment paper and then pop them in the oven 350 for 15 minutes until they're nice and golden so now that the cookies have cooled it's time to make the icing I'm gonna use powdered sugar we're going to use one in three-quarter cups of powdered sugar to make the icing now the thing about powdered sugar is it's so fine that it dissolves very quickly and so it makes for the best kind of icing and for a little bit of flavor and because of course you need some kind of moisture to make the icing five tablespoons and I met it through liqueur now I mean it was like so sweet almond flavored liqueur I'm gonna give the cookies like this nice almond the flavor and they'll go really well with the almonds that are already in the cookies there we go just one okay now just take my whisk slowly whisk everything together and it should be a nice smooth consistency okay look at that yeah alright so now I take a cookie and the cookies are cooled it's really important that the cookies cool before you put the icing on them otherwise the icing melts all over the place and just kind of want to put a thin layer of the icing right over the top that pretty and as it hardens it becomes shinier and shinier so I get just put it right on top and when you go to nastya at the end of a meal they'll present you with a little cookie plate and a little cup of espresso so that's how I'm gonna end my video meal there we go it's so now I take I look up and I pour myself some espresso that I brewed earlier pour it right in there here we go and I grab a cookie the first thing you get is a chewiness from the apricot and the other thing brings everything together from cookie of course a sip up espresso little little colors with that so these press woke up I feel like I'm dining in Ostia
