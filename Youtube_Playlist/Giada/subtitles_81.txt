pastina maybe the most kid-friendly pasta because it's small and comes in fun shapes I'm going to mix it with sauteed chicken and vegetables then bake it with a cheesy Parmesan crust on top the kids will love baked chicken and piscina and so will you while Charlie and Lucy play outside I'm going to make the perfect lunch for them my Italian pastina with chicken so first thing I want to do is just salt my water for the pasta now pastina just means little pasta so it can be any shape it can be these elbow macaroni which I just love we're just gonna throw in there we go and they puff up so you don't need that much we'll let these cook and because the pasta is so small it only takes about five or six minutes to cook so while that cooks I'm gonna hit my skillet and we're gonna cook some chicken so we're gonna add some chicken to the pastina then bake it with cheese it's gonna be a hit I know I loved it as a kid something that you can make in advance and then just reheat it later on if you need to it you can make a whole bunch like just a big baking dish full so I'm just gonna add the chicken to my frying pan and you just want to brown the chicken a little bit not high in the meantime I am going to just use half an onion and a little bit of garlic just one clove my mom used to make this kind of dish for us and we're your kids absolutely loved it it's one of the ultimate comfort food for us you can smell it all over the house too perfect and what kid doesn't love cheesy pasta dish they always do turn that around and the chicken will finish cooking in the oven with the pasta you just want to give it a little bit of flavor where I browning it in the pan just a bit here there we go then you just add the onions and the garlic a little bit and just saute that just until the onions becomes soft and you can smell the garlic the kill the other all right while that cooks it's time for me to grate all the cheese so we're just going to take the box grater and some what's that like just a little bit more to go perfect so now we've got the mozzarella and let's see about the chicken chickens just about ready and let's check the pasta the pasta should be ready and you just want to cook it until mmm no but under al dente five minutes or so and it's ready to go perfect passed ready now I'm going to add the chicken the onions and the garlic a little bit goes a long way with all of this at all of the mozzarella right on top and see already the hot pasta is melting the mozzarella yummy and we're also going to add some fresh flat-leaf parsley so parsley and some tomatoes gotta add some tomatoes again color and also the tomatoes help keep the pasta from sticking to each other as well so we're just gonna add a can of tomatoes see how pretty that is you don't have to worry about it all being cooked completely because it's gonna finish cooking in the oven and I want to add a little bit of salt and just a little bit of trackbar pepper just attack that's it not too much mmm my gosh look at the mozzarella all melted in there so good now I just want to put it in my buttered baking dish I'm just gonna put it all in there this is the secret on top are you store-bought breadcrumbs what I love about them is they're nice and dry so they make for a nice crisp crust on top and we are going to add some Padme jello dijanna right on top and my family we all love cheese so we always add quite a bit of cheese mix these two together and then just sprinkle it right over the top just like that and ever wonder how you get it to be golden brown I just add a little bit of soft butter right over the top and the bread crumbs absorb the butter and that creates a wonderfully golden crust crispy and kind of buttery it's so good I'm going to bake this at 400 degrees for 30 minutes you
