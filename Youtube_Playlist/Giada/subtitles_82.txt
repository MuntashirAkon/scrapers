in Italy alfresco dining is a way of life Italian dishes are perfect for outdoor eating in California what can be more alfresco than having an Italian feast right on the beach today I'm packing up lots of great make-ahead dishes to serve to my friends like my orzo salad of beans onions tomatoes and fresh mint crostini topped with layers of endive mozzarella and prosciutto my grilled chicken gets a touch of Italian with a basil and garlic dressing and for dessert my own take on an American favorite s'mores wait till you see what's melting inside make it a head and keep it simple that's the recipe for great beach party fire up the barbecue grill chicken is a beach party classic you can give it a fresh new taste by marinating the chicken in lemon juice olive oil and fennel seeds then just keep the chicken and the marinade in a sealable plastic bag until it's time to cook grilled chicken with basil dressing makes eating out of gourmet occasion for my beach party I want to get as much done ahead of time as possible then I put everything in plastic baggies and in containers and then bring it over my friends house and finish everything off there that way I don't get stuck in the kitchen for the whole party the first thing I want to do is the marinade for the chicken and at the same time I'm gonna prepare the basil vinaigrette that's gonna go over the chicken after it's cooked so we're gonna take some lemon and the what I'm gonna do first is just zest the lemon it's a lot easier to zest a lemon before you cut it and I just need a little zest to kind of kick up the flavors in the marinade and now cut it in half and I'd like to roll the lemon just to get the juices flowing we're gonna use a couple tablespoons so about 3 tablespoons of lemon juice and some fennel seeds when you use one and a half teaspoons of fennel seeds YUM it'll really flavor the chicken cuz chicken can be kind of bland and boring like we all know always looking for new chicken dishes well this is a really great marinade over the chicken it really flavors the chicken well then we're gonna grill on it's gonna be great a little bit of olive oil about a third of a cup of olive oil let's see here about that much olive oil alright we're ready to add the marinade to the chicken and I'm gonna put the chicken in a double baggie now the reason I double bag it is because I've had this happen in the past I've put the chicken in and the marinade put in the fridge two hours later I go in there and the marinade has spilled all over the refrigerator so this is a really great way to make sure you keep everything clean nothing gets contaminated and all the marinade stays in the bag not in the fridge just pop all these little chicken breasts they're boneless and skinless that way the marinade can really penetrate into the meat and we get them on the grill and they cook really fast perfect those in there and now we'll add the marinade easy as pie they're they're sealed just massage the ticket so that's the marinade coats pinch it as a piece of chicken breast all right leave that aside I'll pop that in the fridge a little later on but for now I want to finish making the basil vinaigrette so we're gonna add the rest of this lemon right in here just squeeze the lemon eat a little muscle sometimes and some basil fresh basil leaves and this will be really pretty when we poured over the chicken just a little basil chopped it just a little bit here so we don't have the blood or do too much work we'll add garlic just one clove keeping it really clean just go ahead peel it and just give it a quick little chop since we chop the basil as well and now let me run it for a minute and then I'm going to add olive oil and let's add now the third of a cup of olive oil and a little salt of course right on top there right I'm just gonna add a little bit of pepper really use it just right on top just like that and now I'm just ready to pour it into my little container so we're just gonna pour it in here pretty that is seal it up and it's ready to go this is done pop the chicken in the fridge and then we'll grill it up later on one dessert that's delicious in any language is s'mores I put an Italian twist on this campfire classic by using slices of sweet crunchy baguette then I top them with an Italian hazelnut chocolate and of course a toasted marshmallow YUM I've sliced the baguette and before I toast it I need to add a little flavor into it so I've got some melted butter and I'm just gonna brush melted butter right on top now I know most of the time you know of course traditionally s'mores are made with graham crackers but my parents used to make s'mores for us they used to make it with baguette what am I going to say they they were not into the whole graham cracker thing they thought you know the marshmallow is already sweet the chocolates sweet and I've been making it this way ever since you know it's one of those things that just stuck now I'm sprinkling each one of these slices with a little bit of granulated sugar and it's unbelievable but it goes in the oven it toasts and then you get this crunchy golden crust on top perfect I'm gonna pop it in the oven 350 degrees for about 15 minutes until make crispy and golden on top and then put them in my Garrett I containers and we're ready to head to the beach and make s'mores
