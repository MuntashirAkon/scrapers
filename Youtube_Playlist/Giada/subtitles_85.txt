I love this grapefruit salad because it is so clean that claims the palate and nothing does it as well as great freedom I peel the grapefruits just like you would an orange same thing just take a serrated knife and basically peel off the skin until you expose the flesh it smells so good just like that so now I take a grapefruit and I just make little slices you could segment it if you want to but this is a lot easier it actually looks really pretty cuz it ends up looking like a little flower it's really pretty I love it so again just carefully slice it want to slice it about a half an inch or so and then I take the slices I just want to fan them out around the platter there we go and just fan it out do it with this one as well and these pink grapefruits are yummy and juicy look at that here we go take that and just kind of fan it out make it look really pretty and we're gonna add a red onion and then again just little thin slices just like that let's take that and we'll just sprinkle it right over the top so now we need some olives I know of olives they're rich and they're sort of cream Ian and soft so I'm just gonna cut the black olives in half look how pretty that is right against the grapefruit color and some chives just a little chive again a nice little mild onion flavor and a little green freshness too and i love the way tribes look I love to eat salads but you just have to be creative with what you put in them you know you just add the ingredients that you really love and of course gotta finish it off with some fresh basil give it a quick little slice and I just want to have it in like long little slices so I kind of like that see how pretty those are so and that right on top that make a little dressing this is the easiest thing in the world a little bit of balsamic vinegar but a little bit goes a long way with balsamic vinegar extra virgin olive oil remember it's addressing you want the fruitiness of the olive oil again just drizzle it right over the top salt alright salad is done
