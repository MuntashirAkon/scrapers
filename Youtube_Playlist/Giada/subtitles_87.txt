I'm starting with the breadcrumbs which is the topic to my cauliflower and bacon gratin and I have some sliced sourdough bread just three slices and you want it to be day-old because we're going to toast it with a little bit of butter and you don't want it to fall apart so what I do is I put it at your processor and then we just so now a little bit of butter in our pan I'm going to toast the bread crumbs and a half a stick of unsalted butter and we'll put the stove about medium-high and just start melting the butter because we're gonna add the breadcrumbs and get them nice and toasty so just toss the bread right in there let it all out and okay so while these toasts up let's start on my cauliflower grab the cauliflower and just cut the bottom off and I really really like cauliflower and I think that it's a great way to get the kids to eat their vegetables is by just adding some bacon to it and some melted cheese put it in the oven and what kid doesn't like that it's almost like you're hiding the vegetables in the casserole itself so I just cut it in little florets it just breaks up on its own here we go and you know what you could do this with broccoli if you wanted just about anything and we're gonna blanch it and then it'll finish cooking in the oven the water for the cauliflower is boiling so I'm gonna add some salt just to flavor it let's just add all of the cauliflower right in the boiling water okay so while the cauliflower cooks let's get the cream and the cheese the grilled cheese we'll use in a little bit first we're going to start off with the cream and we're going to measure three quarters of a cup of heavy cream now the cream adds that sauce that we need for the cauliflower to continue cooking in the oven 3/4 of a cup there we go of heavy cream and then to that we add some flour we add one teaspoon of flour now the flour will thicken the sauce too so just one teaspoon of flour in there and that's all you need to get nice and thick and just give it a quick little whisk to kind of just dissolve the flour in the cream perfect so now we're gonna swap the bowls we are gonna take the florets out of the boiling water because again you only want to cook them for like a minute or two not too long because you don't want them to get mushy once you bake them in the oven so turn the water off there we go and this is known as blanching and the reason we're putting it in ice water is to bring the temperature down of the cauliflower so they stop cooking immediately otherwise if you just let them sit they'll cool off yes but they'll continue to cook and I don't want them to fall apart in the gret time I still want them to hold their shape well let those cool completely let's take a look at these though they're starting to toast up and boy oh boy it smells so good the butter with the bread mmm I need another minute or so in the meantime let's grate the cheese so I've got some Gruyere cheese and the Greer's has a nice sharp flavor so it works really well with the cauliflower so cauliflower is more of a mellow flavor and it melts beautifully it has a little bit of a sharp flavor to it but it's really creamy and it bakes really well and we need 1 cup of grated Gruyere happen that's gonna go in the cauliflower mixture and the other half is gonna go on top of the breadcrumbs so we get this nice crunchy cheesy crust on top of the cauliflower perfect we get the cheese so now we start building the grete so half of the Gruyere cheese goes inside and the other half we're gonna save it and put it on top then I add capers they add a nice tangy bite to it and then the bacon you can just chop it up you can rip it up with your fingers some salt got a C's in it and some pepper and just give it a quick mix here toss everything together and let's grab the cauliflower and the cauliflower should be cooled and again you want to just put it in cold water the cauliflower to bring down the temperature so it doesn't continue to cook here we go back over here toss it all together make sure that all the cauliflower is coated with some of the cream and bacon caper and cheese mixture bread crumbs are done turn off that and now grab the baking sheet and I have a buttered 8x8 baking sheet and I just toss everything in there there we go get all the bacon all the cheese everything take the bread crumbs that are now toasted and just put them right over the top some want to get away you just put them back in there and we finish it off with some more cheese right on top you get a nice cheesy crust and then to get that nice golden color I want to add a little bit of olive oil right over the top so a little bit of moisture for the cheese in the bread and now we bake it at 350 degrees for about 35 to 40 minutes until it's bubbly crisp and the cheese's all melted on top this is gonna be good next I'll roll out the dough and start on my crispy flatbread with zucchini olives and even more cheese
