my little aunt Carolina is home from college and I'm so excited because she's like a little sister to me so Jade and I are going to have her over for lunch today so we can all enjoy some Carolina's favorites turkey Noonan is it my spin on an Italian classic crispy turkey cutlets served on a bed of tomatoes and peppery arugula bacon and punch it the potatoes comfort food with a double dose of salty goodness and roasted apple pies with whipped cream cinnamon apples and whipped cream piled high on a flaky crust it's true family comfort food and I know Karolina is going to love it I'm gonna start by making a breading station for my turkey muna neza so one cup of seasoned flour 3 eggs lightly beaten and seasoned Italian breadcrumbs it's really easy now before we start coating the turkey I want to turn the stove on turning on about medium-high heat and you want to add about a third of a cup of olive oil because basically we're gonna pan sear the turkey and the great thing about this dish is you can eat it hot you can also eat it room temperature so anyhow I haven't seen Caroline in a while this is going to be a really fun lunch really easy going just the two of us sitting here in the kitchen and enjoying each other talking about you know her time at school because I haven't seen her in so long I thought this would be a nice way for us to kind of catch up so we've got some turkey here and I basically had the butcher take a turkey breast slice it thin about 1/2 to 1/4 inch that way when I bread it and put it in the pan it cooks instantly well not instantly but within a couple of minutes on each side which is pretty darn fast so now I just want to season both sides of the turkey cutlets salt and pepper and we're gonna flip them there we go let's give ourselves a little blip here to flip them and I happen to love trick you know you can make this with chicken if you want to with pork with with veal obviously really anything that you want so we'll salt a little pepper on both sides so here we go this is how we start grab the first one put it a little bit of flour and you want to just a nice even coating of the flour because the flour allows the egg to stick to it and then the egg allows the breadcrumb to stick to it and load three layers together create a really nice coating and into the bread crumbs number two into the flower and I'm telling you as long as you set yourself up like this like a little assembly line this is really really easy to do here we go okay so we're gonna cook those for a couple of minutes on each side in the meantime I'm gonna clean up and grab my platter all righty it smells so good in here we're ready to flip them so nice you can smell good there we go you want a nice deep golden crust on the outside okay they need a couple more minutes I'll get rid of this this is the kind of salad that I'm going to set up I've got a bunch of arugula that have already washed and just need a few these tomatoes what I like to do is just quarter the cherry tomatoes the fact that you put it on greens kind of cuts through the oil in the turkey cuz sometimes when you pan fry it it can be a little bit heavy but when you eat it with the arugula cause it's spicy and peppery all of those ingredients together make for a really heavenly bite perfect so now we got the tomatoes let's just take some of the arugula and just lay it on the platter just like this so it creates like a bed for the turkey milanesa to sit on and just kind of flatten it out a little bit you can pretty much do this with any lettuce you want I just love the arugula with this and a few tomatoes and see already how beautiful and colorful it is really good just like that or do a little bit of olive oil over the top this is basically the dressing extra virgin olive oil really good stuff and some salt just to season it and a little bit of pepper there we go let's grab our fork I just take it so just kind of put it right on there and just kind of layer them on top of each other and the heat from the meat will slowly soften the arugula leaves as well areare last one beautiful one last finishing touch blue pad me down Oh - Jan Oh we'll take a little carrot peeler here and do like long little strips of Parmesan cheese nice and buttery a little bit of salty bite on there it kind of melts on the hot meat an easy so that's perfect all right and that's it that's the holster criminal is they see how easy it was and I beautiful next I'm gonna make the ultimate comfort food my bacon and French eat the potatoes Karolina is gonna love this - decadent ingredients in one fabulous dish
