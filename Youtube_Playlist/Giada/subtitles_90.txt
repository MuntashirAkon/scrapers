should go for tomorrow never stopping for tomorrow I didn't act you were doing the corn tortellini and it is gonna be can corner hosting a working lunch is a perfect chance to make a great impression I've got a lunch menu that's original and easy my roll chicken sandwich is just right it's got lots of juicy chicken and a fresh tasting herb aioli wrapped in an elegant package garbanzo bean and zucchini salad is a colorful blend of beans and fresh vegetables with a light lemon vinaigrette topped with cheese my lemon basil potatoes are full of flavor from the broth are cooked in and to relax afterward a guilt-free shake of hot chocolate and espresso blended with low-fat vanilla yogurt and skim milk this working lunch is hardly any work at all you you I don't want to make anything too complicated for a working lunch so I'm going to create an easy ruled sandwich it starts with a light aioli made from low-fat mayonnaise and yogurt with spicy fresh arugula parsley and garlic I'll mix the aioli with store-bought roasted chicken and spread it on warm tortillas my rolled chicken sandwich with arugula and parsley is fancy enough for working lunch but easy enough to make any time I'm gonna start with some store-bought mayonnaise now they only traditionally it's a garlic flavored sauce and I really like to make it at home but instead of going ahead and making it from scratch I'm actually going to start out with mayonnaise because the texture of aioli is very similar to mayonnaise and the flavors as well and then we're gonna add garlic now it's a garlic flavored sauce you got to have some garlic but I'm only going to use one garlic clove next I'm going to add some yogurt some low-fat plain yogurt and the yogurt kind of adds a little bit of a tart flavor and a little bit of moisture as well to create a nice smooth aioli so 1/2 a cup of plain low-fat yogurt next a little bit of lemon zest just a little bit for a little acidity we're gonna use one teaspoon of white wine vinegar and white vinegar is pretty clean so you don't eat much and it's not too strong either and not to scare anybody but we're gonna use one anchovy and I know that a lot of people are like anchovy oh my gosh but it is so good just creates that salty bite then a handful of peppery arugula and you roogle a-- just gives it a nice green color to it and it has a nice sharp bite too and for a little bit of freshness some parsley flat-leaf Italian parsley and for the parsley I just want to give it a quick little chop so I like to add a little freshness in color to my aioli and of course we're also going to add some chives now the thing about the chives is it gives it a little bit of an onion flavor but it's very very mellow and I think it works really well in the aioli there we go and now just a little sprinkle of salt because remember the anchovies are salty so we don't want to add too much salt and some freshly ground black pepper just seasoning my aioli and it's very easy to do this and it's really great so it is done and take a look at this see how nice that looks the nice green specs and I'm gonna grab my chicken so I've got two chicken breasts and it's just store-bought rotisserie chicken it's very flavorful and it's also juicy when I have people over for lunch I gotta remember sort of well what do people like to eat and make sure that when you have a number of people that you have something for them that most people like and most people will love chicken and they like chicken salads for lunch cuz it's kind of healthy and it's light but it's still filling and satisfying so you want to keep that in mind when you're cooking for people especially when it's a working lunch so well dump the chicken and on top of the chicken here goes B aioli nice and creamy and it creates a nice luscious sauce on the chicken and it lots of moisture too all right so now dragons done I'm gonna turn on my skillet I'm gonna show you a little bit of a different way to make these sandwiches I'm actually using whole-wheat tortillas and what I like to do is to turn on a skillet and kind of heat up the tortilla by heating it up I'm just sort of bringing out the flavors toasting flavors a little bit and it softens tortilla so that you can roll it up nicely so I just warm them up in a skillet about 30 seconds on each side and you'll see that immediately they start to soften which is really great okay so this one's done now will I do that one I'm gonna heat up my second one I take a spoonful of chicken and you put it right in the middle and then you just spread it with the back of the spoon you want to leave a little border because we're gonna roll it up and for some more freshness in color I'm adding a little bit more Rugal ax right on top and then I take the bottom corner and I roll it up like a jelly roll that's why you don't want to put too much on the sides otherwise a little kind of moves out okay and take a knife and I just cut it on a diagonal and look how pretty that is so I couldn't onto my serving platter and I put the other one over it just like that make it look really pretty we can turn the stove off and grab this one roll it up how pretty is that it's perfect right all right so now and this is how easy it is to eat too mmm that I Olli I'm so good its garlicky but it's not overpowering and all that freshness from the urge is perfect creamy but light - up next I'd the perfect salad to go with my chicken rolls my garbanzo bean and zucchini salad
