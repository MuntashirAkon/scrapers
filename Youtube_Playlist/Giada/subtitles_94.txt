we're ready to make a filling the on flavored whipped cream you know what whipped cream is so easy to make at home that there's no need to go out there and buy the pre-made stuff oh this is good 3/4 of a cup of heavy whipping cream chilled nice and cold and we're going to start beating it the Kolbe the clean the easier it is to fluff it up on fat all right we're ready to sweeten it going to use a quarter cup of powdered sugar you don't want to overbeat this otherwise it'll turn into butter when you want it to be light and fluffy when you put it into your tart shell all right now we're ready for the flavoring almond flavored liqueur it's amaretto it's infused with those little I'm addicted cookies so we're gonna do two tablespoons of amaretto liqueur and we're gonna whip that for another minute I wish you could smell this so good already it's done now for a little bit of crunch I'm gonna add some toasted chopped almonds right here all right you want to be careful and fold in the almonds so you don't deflate the whipped cream the almonds add a little crunch okay let's put some plastic wrap pop it in the fridge until my pastry shells cool nice and cool broccoli is a very versatile vegetable and it's a favorite in Italy this is one of the easiest ways to make it it takes less than 10 minutes to cook the florets to bright green crispy perfection then I add my favorite condiment a splash of tangy Meyer lemon olive oil broccoli lemon oil gives your tasteless a little work out of their own what I've been doing is making some broccoli florets and it's super easy you just get a head of broccoli just like this and we'll just cut some of this off just like that and I like to trim them just the top part but you could eat the actual stock if you wanted to and I like to cut them approximately bite-sized all right let's check the water I want to salt the water ahead of time to flavor the broccoli it's a nice handful of salt and put them in the boiling water just a few out of time let them sit in the water for a few minutes and these are gonna take about four or five minutes to cook through in the meantime I'm gonna check on my tart wow that looks good its heart is golden brown on top and it smells heavenly it's puffed up but not too much and the sides of risen I'll hold in the whipped cream perfectly I'm gonna let it sit for a little bit and cool off before I end up filling it meantime let's get these broccoli out oh they look good and you want to get them out of the water before they start turning brown so just a couple of minutes and see how piping hot there this is what I like to drizzle over my broccoli just add some Meyer lemon olive oil and the Meyer lemon is sweeter than regular lemon so it gives a sort of little sweetness a little citrus punch to clean and cleanse your palate after natan that chicken Tetrazzini will just toss it just like that and if you can't find Meyer lemon olive oil you could just use some extra-virgin olive oil and then just squeeze a little bit of fresh lemon juice inside perfect that's it my broccoli all ready and up next I'm gonna fill my TARDIS
