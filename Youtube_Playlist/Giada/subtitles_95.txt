I've started on my fusilli with spicy pesto and I have one pound of fusilli cooking and I love the fuzzy because they look like little cork screws and basically the ridges the pestle sticks to those ridges so it's really good so while the pasta cooks I'm going to start on the pesto and I'm making something a little different today I'm making a spicy pesto and we're going to use a jalapeno pepper in it which is a little different from me but I thought it'd be really fun so we're going to add one cup of walnuts and they're not toasted then we need the garlic and a help enyo pepper so we're gonna use two cloves of garlic now traditionally in a pesto if basil garlic and pine nuts so we're kind of gonna stray off that just a little bit I'm just gonna peel my garlic and let the food processor do the rest of the work toss that right in there and to close for me is perfect if you like your pesto to be super garlicky and you can always add more garlic we'll get rid of that and now for the jalapeno pepper I just cut the top off and I give it a rough chop and I'm leaving in the seeds I'm gonna make it nice and spicy today we're going to add all the seeds and all of the ribbon there the thing you want to do is you want to wash off your board and your knife and wash your hands before you touch anything else there we go there we go let's grab our arugula our spinach and our grated Asiago cheese we're gonna add some greens so we're going to start with some baby spinach the spinach is really nice because it's super tender and it adds nice body to the pesto and it's going to add beautiful color this is going to be so vibrant you're going to love it so we added 3 cups of baby spinach and now for the arugula for a little bit of a kick and I like it the combination of the arugula and spinach together makes it really fantastic and 3 cups of baby arugula as well and I just bought the pre-washed arugula and spinach just to make my life a little easier and I'm going to add 2 cups of grated Asiago cheese now the Asiago is very similar to Romano and Parmesan except it's a little bit milder and a little bit nuttier we round a little salt and a little pepper gotta season it and let's pulse a little bit and then we'll add the olive oil in and we're gonna add 1/4 cup of extra-virgin olive oil there we go boom baby it smells good it's got this beautiful vibrant green color I love that about pesto it's so gorgeous let's check on the pasta I want to taste my pasta make sure it's cooked it should be out hmm pastas all dead Jay let's grab our Bowl and our spoons here and let's do the pasta first so just put the pasta directly in here you want to save a little pasta water in case you need to thin out the pesto a little bit that way you don't have to add any more olive oil just add a little bit of pasta water okay that's done now for the beautiful green pesto look at that beautiful color nice and creamy all that cheese all that cheese that makes it taste so goood okay got that and let's start to toss it nice and thick look at that you can already see how the pesto is kind of getting into all of that pasta now this looks like it's gonna need a little bit of pasta water so grab a spoon and you don't want to add too much at one time because you don't want to make it too loose yeah perfect and just kind of toss it in there and it loosens up the pesto and creates this nice creamy pesto sauce there we go so now you took the time to make it so you want to make it look special I take a couple of walnuts because there's walnuts in it and I just put like a couple of walnuts just like that I'm gonna grab my block of Asiago and I just want to add a few little shavings of cheese and this is what I like to do kind of fan them out just like that all right yeah and look how pretty this looks it makes it look beautiful and tastes even better there one last thing I just want to taste it before my girlfriend comes over just to make sure the flavors are right perfect nice kick it's beautiful it's got a nice crunch from those walnuts this is perfect she's gonna love this -
