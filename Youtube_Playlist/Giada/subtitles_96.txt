orzo is a little put that looks just like rice and it's perfect for salads I cook mine in chicken broth for extra flavor and then toss them with garbanzo beans fresh red onion bite-size tomatoes and herbs this dish is fresh and colorful and since you serve it room temperature it's easy to make in advance and bring to the beach I'm boiling some chicken stock and I'm gonna cook my orzo in some chicken stock because it gives it more flavor in Italian orzo means barley the actual word orzo but it's pasta it's really small it's kind of the size of a pine nut so we're gonna cook this for about seven minutes in chicken stock and it'll have tons and tons of flavor so while that's cooking I'm gonna prepare all the other mediums are gonna go in the orzo salad first we're gonna start with canned garbanzo beans which make my life so much easier and all I need to do is drain them and then rinse them so I've got my girl bonza beans ready just pour those right in there and they're so crunchy next I'm gonna do the red onion and you could also put scallions or sweet onions I like the red onions and like the purple color a little bit of bite they're sweet I'm actually only going to use half an onion so we'll put the other one back and I'm just gonna dice it we'll just dice it up cuz I don't want to have big chunks of red onion up in a salad so we'll toss the red onion in there and now we need some Tomatoes again little sweetness little color I'm using these small little baby Tomatoes that I found they're just so cute I make this orzo salad in lots of different ways depending on you know what the theme is it's easy to store you make it ahead of time and easy to transport toss it with a little dressing and you make everybody happy so we've got tomatoes red onions garbanzo beans now we're gonna do some herbs some basil one of my favorites just chop up the basil mmm smells good and basil bruises pretty easily so you want to just sort of fold all the leaves together and then just chop them up yeah we're gonna also add a little bit of mint it's a nice clean fresh flavor and it really does sort of brighten up the flavors of the salad we're ready to make the vinaigrette I'm gonna take some lemon juice and it will just cut that in half we'll add some lemon juice to the blender now I'm making a little bit more than I actually need dressing wise because I'm gonna use it for the orzo but I'm gonna save a little bit and use it for my appetizer I'm gonna make these a little curly endive prosciutto nuts that I let and then I'm gonna put them on a piece of toast and some red wine vinegar oh and I think our orzo is ready and in this bowl just so it can cool down a little bit before I add it to all my fresh ingredients there we go I got to add some red wine vinegar we're gonna measure 1/2 a cup now a little bit of sweetness honey it's sort of thickens and sort of coats your mouth now a little bit of salt always and some freshly ground black pepper and add the oil I'm gonna measure the oil let's see here we need 1 cup of extra virgin olive oil it's a dressing it's fresh we need the best and we're gonna add the olive oil to the dressing while it's blending continue with the olive oil till it's nice and thick there we are simple simple see how easy salad dressings are to make you don't have to buy them in a bottle you can control how sweet they are how salty they are all that stuff now I'm just gonna pour it in my container here because I'm gonna add it to the orzo when I'm at the beach already be also is cool down nicely I'm just gonna toss all of this together look how pretty that is a little green and I can smell the mint and the basil oh God little bits of purple from the red onion the red from the tomatoes looks perfect just cover it some plastic wrap and pop it in the fridge know what I'm ready to go
