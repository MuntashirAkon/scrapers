all right so I finished my lemon lime custard and I put it over an ice bath basically a bowl of ice just to cool it down because if it's too hot I can't add the whipped cream to it it'll just melt with the whipped cream this is the kind of consistency you want from your custard kind of like a pudding all right so now to flavor it I'm gonna add lemon zest and lime zest we just can't get enough of that lemon lime flavor so lemon zest okay get that all in there and the lime zest that's a really pretty color get all of that lime zest in there so perfumey there we go so now just give it a quick little mix so you can see all the little bits from the lime and a lemon in the custard very pretty okay so it's cooled down enough now move the ice bath then we're ready to add the whipped cream so I just took one cup of heavy cream and added a quarter cup of sugar to it and what you want to do is add a little bit of whipped cream to the custard at a time you want to fold it and just using your spatula mix the custard and the whipped cream together that way you get a nice Airy consistency you want to make sure not overmix otherwise you won't get back nice light fluffy nests afterwards here we go so now I take a metal loaf pan I spray it with cooking spray and then I line it with plastic wrap so now I should just pour it right into a loaf pan see how thick that is okay just like that okay now I pop it in the freezer for eight hours and then we get to slice it and eat it all right I see me fade those frozen it's been eight hours and I just want to take the plastic off and I take my platter and I'm just gonna invert the semifreddo there we go and remember it's a half frozen dessert that is why it's called a semifreddo okay for a little crunch which is what I always like on my frozen dessert I'm gonna add some comedy cookies these are just waiting really airy and crunchy almond cookies and I just kind of break them right on top just like that not too many just a little bit just put a little bit of crunch there we go feel free oh my goodness the MRT cookies are awesome the best thing about these dishes is you don't have to go to a steakhouse to have the perfect steak dinner in fact if you make it at home you can put your own final touches on it and give yourself the best meal ever
