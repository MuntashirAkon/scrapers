my aunt Raffy is cooking with me today and we are having lots of fun today is all about remembering Rome and because we were both born there we have lots of memories so we're making a family favorite bucatini amatriciana with spicy meatballs only Raffy has a slightly different version of the recipe okay so you had the onion in there I'm going to open the tomatoes for you and I'm gonna grab another one of these and I like the sauce I like the sauce - I was just tasting the vegetable you want to lower it a little better now it's on high that looks pretty crispy keep it hit by them the onion should not crisp it should kind of melt yes soften oh okay you know add a little salt it'll help soften it you taught me this and I do it actually design I'm an open it see it because it makes it sweat and you probably make this with whole Tomatoes right hold can tomatoes yes I make it with crushed will leave okay all right so we're ready for the tomatoes no we're gonna put the vinegar in it first there's your vinegar you make messy sena without vinegar I don't would Victor why would I a visitor in Rome there's two schools do either do it with a glass of vinegar or you do it with a glass of white wine I guess we're out of wine how can you make my vision without wine red pepper that I have oh and by the way that was your wine so I can finish my no that's mine no it is dead how much pepper you want one pinch yeah okay once this blows my add some salt yeah okay we'll grab that really teaching yeah I did I fried the garbanzo beans they're good right hmm aren't they good it's delicious I've never had them fried all right so added some salt to the pack why do you put fine salt in your pasta water actually this is kosher salt why didn't you put rough Saul um sometimes I do but I have kosher salts and just add a little bit more and I figure it's the same thing no I was just curious if it was something I didn't know that I had to learn because we in Italy with what rock something I know but then I'm buying rock salt just for the water kosher salt to cook with fine salt for badness figure it's too many salt so just gonna use the kosher salt from the water and everything else and then the clients all just when I'm baking I don't find it changes the flavor that much can I have this sauce now is that a yes good just a minute all right so you have the sauce I'm gonna go grab my meatballs does that do that okay all right I made these special meatballs whoops I made these earlier I love meat bones what do you think didn't put any ketchup in there did you know I'd never do that ketchup why would I catch it with my meatballs I don't that's I don't know you don't put vinegar in your messy Sharna never oh please ketchup not me me to the intro yeah go for it all right well I'm gonna bake those off at 400 degrees for 15 minutes I'm surprised you didn't say anything about cooking them because traditionally you know you don't bake them high do you do battle Madonna oh is that it it should be pink it should not be grand so half of a can of tomato sauce so now I gotta put that away yay do something else with us make us cool for all right I'll take care of this we'll put in a container and I'll save it for later I'm ready to throw some past in here yeah you okay okay and I'm not gonna throw very much it's just you and me yeah and see they have little holes in the center it's nice and thick thicker than a spaghetti okay so I'm gonna throw this I'm gonna give it a quick here can I borrow this yeah all right so that's gonna take 10 10 minutes or so my meatballs 15 minutes and when we're done we can put it all together right all right so just do it for the cook I keep drinking okay so Raffy may be done but I still have some more ideas on making this classic Roman dish extra special
