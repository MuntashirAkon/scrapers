it is a beautiful day here in Eagle River so today we're going to have a walk around Beach Lake what's up guys so yeah today we're going for a hike because honestly I just need to get out like I need to get some exercise get outside get some Sun this feels so so good or what little I can feel of it like it's right there but it's like hardly warm because it's so far away anyways off topic I'm so yeah I've been stuck inside for the last couple of days because my hard drive crashed the hard drive that has like all of the files all the raw files all the footage everything I've ever done for the last ten years and it like honestly it just broke my heart a little bit cuz I'm not going dude if I lose all that like that's a lot of history just gone so I spent a lot of time working on recovering all that stuff and that is scary but anyways I wanted to tell you guys I know there's a lot of new new viewers I wanted to tell you who I am kind of give you a history on on what I've done because I know a lot of you are so new that you've only started watching me since the Rock skipping video and honestly that's just like not even scratching the surface of everything I've ever done on YouTube so Who am I of course my name is Corey Williams a lot of people know me as a mr. safety from SMP films which is my original YouTube channel youtube.com slash SMP films on there I made short films some documentary stuff mostly comedy a lot of music videos and just just a lot of like a wide variety of things not necessarily vlogs where I talk to the camera like this and then later on I started this other YouTube channel called the mean kitty the mean kitty was you know of course for my cats where it was like this fun channel that kind of spawned off this other video that went viral which is the mean Kitty song I think that now has over 80 million views or something like that I ain't looking more Asli and then and then I started dude like hella after some changes in my life happened and I just wanted to see my life from a different perspective so yeah that's what that's what I've done that's who I am that's very very wrapped up quickly for those of you who have watched SMP films and who have watched the mean Kitty leave a comment down below and recommend some videos for these new people who are new to dudelikehella to watch wow my god what a beautiful day so yeah what else has been going on oh yeah so I wanted to talk to you guys about something I had said on Facebook it's something that I've been thinking about for a while right now I am feeling the itch and it's not crabs that's dirty no seriously like I'm feeling the itch the creative itch I really I want to make short films again like after going through all the footage and you know putting on my new computer so I could switch it back and trying to recover everything I'm watching these old videos going man what happened to that like why don't I go back to that that was my roots that was what I'd love to do more than anything else in the world vlogging wasn't always something I did vlogging was always kind of like one of those things with I said I would never do and then I had just ended up doing it which is kind of crazy cuz yeah I'm here and it's working I love vlogging but man really want to go back to doing short films so I know a lot of you guys have noticed last couple days I have been posting a whole lot of videos and some I have been posting and taking down for my own reasons but it's just because what I really want to do right now is just be super creative I mean vlogging yes but just be creative so yeah I've been working on that I actually have been working on music again which has been cool I love making music for those of you who don't know obviously I said earlier I've had two channel I've done a lot of music I mentioned the mean Kitty song a lot of other songs but that's what really got me started on the internet was music myspace back in 2004 2005 I was actually one of the top unsigned comedic music artists in the world and I don't even know why it was okay like my songs were okay but man they're pretty horrible I'm not gonna lie I listened back to some of them and I was like really that's what people liked but I guess there wasn't a whole lot in the talent pool there was this kind of one of the only swimmers out there doing it you know I don't know that's I don't know I'm not gonna beat myself up about it but I still kind of question myself ooh hmm I just realized my back and my butt and the back of my legs are really warm yeah I feel the Sun it's so bright anyways I missed that Sun I really do it's currently like five six degrees outside very very nice it's warm enough oh yeah the other day was uh was it like negative 8 May 8 negative 9 something like that finally we got our snow as you can see it's been great I'm loving it I'm so much happier with the snow like when you sit there waiting and waiting and waiting and never happens you just after a while good get disappointed every day you wake up like dang it no snow it's just cold that's all it is now I'm just like oh yeah it's cold whatever but there's no what else has been going on in my life let's walk backwards for a little bit we're gonna try to try to warm up this side because this side is a little bit cold oh so yeah I meant to tell you guys actually I think I did tell you guys in a different video so this lake actually has a truck underneath that somewhere somebody at some time was driving their truck on this frozen lake and it went under and apparently it hasn't been recovered nobody really knows where exactly it's at somebody else saw it from an airplane that crashed in here or something I don't I don't know somebody told me this story and I don't know how much they know but apparently there's gonna be a search party I'm gonna be a part of it try to find that missing truck which may have a body in it that is crazy like I really hope there's not apparently this lake is like 20 feet deep in the in the part where the truck is switch angles so you guys can see more stuff how you like this blog by the way they're just going we're just going okay just talking about whatever comes out of my mouth I really miss Indian food random I know I talked to my friend Manish who runs this this Indian store back where I came from Simi Valley California and uh
