hi I'm Martha Stewart what if I told you I would come to your home and teach you how to cook from the best of the basics to the secrets of the spectacular I'm about to take your love of cooking to a whole new level frying roasting braising sauteing steaming grilling poaching and enjoying welcome to Martha's cooking school lessons and recipes for the home cook Martha Stewart's cooking school is made possible by welcome everyone to cooking school today's show is all about the sandwich and the bread that makes sandwiches so irresistible some say the sandwich was named after the Earl of Sandwich an eighteenth-century gambler who couldn't break away from the gaming table long enough to eat so his dutiful manservant came up with an easy solution sliced meat between two slices of bread and the sandwich as we know it was born today we're making some all-time favorites a delicious double-decker club layered with roast chicken crisp bacon ripe tomatoes avocado lettuce and mayo next I'll fry some juicy oysters to make an iconic New Orleans specialty the poor boy served with a homemade tartar sauce a legendary olive salad is what transforms the meaty sandwich known as a muffaletta filled with a variety of sliced meats and piquant Peppadew peppers having breakfast on the run is so much better when it has a perfectly fried egg smoky Applewood bacon and melted cheese like my sandwich version does and lastly a classic Reuben made with layers of succulent corned beef Swiss cheese and tangy sauerkraut on fresh rye bread stay tuned the club in club sandwich comes from the fact that they were popular items on clubhouse menus most notably at the Saratoga Club in Saratoga New York where the famous horse races take place what sets this club sandwich apart is a freshly roasted chicken breast and let me show you how I like to do it very easy to do and if you're making club sandwiches you should do a whole breast cut in half or two or three if you have a large family or a large gathering salt and pepper clean beautiful fresh chicken breasts and pre-heat your oven to 375 degrees this makes the tastiest chicken for sandwiches better than poaching actually so just put that right into your 375 degree oven for about 30 to 35 minutes so this is a roasted chicken breast you can take the skin off if you like but I kind of like the skin on my sandwich this chicken roasted like this is also really good shredded for chicken salad so there and we're using a lovely toasted white bread for the sandwich it's actually a brioche slather each piece with homemade mayonnaise if possible or store-bought and another thing people forget to do on sandwiches is to salt and pepper the sandwich so we have the toast you can layer the chicken right on one slice yummy so good-looking and each one of these is a separate layer so you want to build the same sandwich on both so chicken chicken beautiful slice of tomato now some avocado so you can actually slice your avocado right in the shell layer your avocado right on to the tomato the best best ingredients make really really good sandwiches fresh avocado perfectly ripe and here we have our bacon don't forget a little bit of salt and pepper and now top with lettuce this crispy iceberg lettuce will help hold the sandwich together so then this one goes on top of this one now a little bit more Mayo and a sweet and sour gherkin you can use bread and butter pickles dill pickles sweet and sour gherkins but that is a club sandwich that you will remember now once you have it skewered with the toothpicks then with a serrated knife you can actually cut it in half and put this towering kind of Dagwood club right on a sandwich plate served with pickles skewered with toothpicks this is the club sandwich everyone will remember it's an easy way to make an ordinary lunchtime really special and delicious there you have it and now for the po-boy Pio ' Bo white it's a sandwich a New Orleans gastronomic masterpiece and it was created in the 1920s by two grocers who served it free to striking streetcar workers that they called poor boys there are countless fillings from shrimp to catfish softshell crabs sliced meats today I'm piling my po-boy mile-high it with fried oysters frying oysters delicate but good into one cup of buttermilk add a half a teaspoon of pepper freshly ground black pepper and a teaspoon of salt and about 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper so that is our liquid the oysters have been shucked now we have 48 Easter's four dozen they are plump they are clean and they are going to just have a bath of buttermilk and you can sort of stir them around a little bit you want to keep the oysters from getting mashed mushed you want nice big plump oysters so there now we have a cup of cornmeal fresh cornmeal and one cup of unbleached flour and just a pinch of cayenne stir this together you can whisk it with a little whisk this is our coating for the oysters it gives a little crunch and rather than have a temporal like batter this is just a nice little crispy coating on the oysters and a little bit of salt and a little bit of pepper there mix that up the oil is at 350 degrees this is a canola oil you can use canola you can use safflower and I'm just using my fingers because this way I can be sure that the oysters are going to be well coated and just drop one at a time so use one and for the oyster and one hand for the coating and you can put them around here like that if you wish save a little time but don't pour all of these into the cornmeal they're so pretty they take just about four minutes or so I think that first batch is ready to come out so if you thought that frying Easter was fine from assuming you can see that it really isn't now while they're still warm sprinkle those with a little bit of salt I love this spider because it really does allow you to get the food out of the oil without too much grease after they're done you're going to toast your buns and these are top split buns which are typical for lobster rolls doing very well here so real important to watch the temperature of your oil monitor it so it does not get too cool there okay boys just look great and these are ready for our sandwiches so now toast the rolls these are those top split buns just put them on a griddle pan and toast on both sides and make sure you butter this side and that side and 48 oysters enough oysters for the eight poor boys all right and now the tartar sauce 1/3 of a cup of homemade mayonnaise some cornichon about three tablespoons of cornichon about two tablespoons of capers and you can rinse the capers shallot very important ingredient in a good homemade tartar sauce one shallot finely chopped and the juice of a whole lemon just squeeze that right into your tartar sauce oh there and this is good made yesterday for today so now to assemble these wonderful sandwiches just open the roll put as many oysters as you possibly can now don't you want to sink your teeth into this oh so tasty and top with some tartar sauce soft on the inside crispy on the outside you're going to love this New Orleans favorite pull boys in 1906 senior Lupo Salvador a a New Orleans grocer so that some of his customers struggled juggling their lunch items bread salami cheese and olives ingeniously he came up with a way to combine them all in a sandwich and called it a muffaletta named for the round bread on which it was made now I'm using a write country rule a round country bread and I've cut it in half and I'm going to take out just the center all the Brady bread this you can turn into bread crumbs you can eat it or you can give it to the birds but it gives you lots of room to build this muffaletta sandwich do the same thing with the bottom half comes out very easily and what makes this muffaletta is the wonderful olive salad that we use to flavor the sandwich okay so the bread is ready now the olives get yourself one of these little olive Pitters if you like stick it in here like this and watch the seed comes right out and there is your olive so this is perfect for small oil-cured olives but it will not work for these giant green olives so the easiest way is just to cut the olive off the pit like this now I have the olives already chopped six ounces of green olives finely chopped two ounces of the oil cured olives finely chopped one salt packed anchovy fillet finely chopped also and some fresh herbs we have oregano thyme and parsley so stir this around add a quarter of a cup of olive oil and two tablespoons of a red wine vinegar to some salt and pepper now this has to be made the day before I'll refrigerate it and just that it's sick so all the flavors meld one last flavoring and that's a little bit of hot sauce and don't forget the lemon very important the juice of half a lemon cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight and we have one already made it does change color a little bit so we're ready to start we can start with a little bit of the olive just a little bit in the bottom of the bread and then delicious mortadella and whatever way you really feel like layering this mortadella is this big loaf it's kind of the original Bologna it's a very large smoked sausage and it's studded with cubes of pork fat peppercorns sometimes pistachios and or green olives but here is a beautiful sopressata some vino keyonnah salami fontina cheese you can really make up your own mix but you want to have each layer pretty complete like that so that when you slice this everybody gets some some more of the olive now this is a great great sandwich to make for a long weekend with guests in your house with a big green salad oh and don't forget some arugula another slice of mortadella and every muffaletta is a little different from every other provolone's this is a Coppa and this lovely sopressata this is spicy we have another spicy thing to add and these are those delicious Peppadew these are a little tiny red pepper that's pickled and kind of a sweet hot sauce really huge keep going I could put a little bit more olive on here more arugula and arugula is a bitter green try to get small pungent leaves okay and one more layer here and the last bit of olive so the all is good to top it with because this is going to soak into the top layer of the bread because we've made room for the mound now cover it with this put this in the middle of your plastic wrap and draw the plastic wrap all the way around your bread you're going to encase this in the plastic wrap and you're going to press it underneath a heavy weight and it will be ready pressed for tomorrow's picnic so this is a very heavy cast-iron pot that can just stay on it like that it goes into the refrigerator make sure that you have room in your refrigerator for such a weight if you don't have it for this big a pot you can take a smaller frying pan heavy frying pan and fill it with canned tomatoes or something like that but anything that's really heavy that will weight it down and cause all those delicious flavors to sort of mill together so this is the sandwich I made yesterday kick off the heavy pot it's changed quite a bit in volume it is not as high I can unwrap it it looks good it smells really good so there is our funny funny muffaletta looks like a big flat sandwich and you cut this into wedges for your picnic here's a very sharp red knife curious to see the perfect lairs looks very delicious cut this one into thirds and if you want a smaller piece cut it into eighths what a nice way to serve a large group a make-ahead sandwich what could be better than that move Valletta one of the best sandwiches I've ever had is the bacon and egg and cheese sandwich add a little cheese shop right here in New York City it is delicious fontina cheese fried egg bacon and English muffin so I thought I'd show you how to make my favorite breakfast sandwich grated cheese sliced cheese bacon highest-quality bacon you can find it can't be bacon that's been sitting around cooked for a long time has to be freshly cooked like this English muffin just warm it on the griddle outside first then turn it over and toast the inside and I'm going to find the biggest nicest egg I have to toss up I think this one we're going to fry the egg right into bacon grease the bacon can stay in there and just break your egg right into the same pan is now look good I always sprinkle my fried eggs with a little bit of salt and pepper and I don't turn them over so now our English muffin is nicely toasted put on some fontina cheese don't break the yolk if you break the yolk fry another egg if you like you can just take a little bit of the bacon grease and pour it over the yolk that helps feel their bacon looks done so now on top of the egg put a little bit of grated fontina right on top melts into the egg and this is getting nice and soft a little bit of pepper put your bacon right on top looking good and our egg is done this goes on top of the bacon I think I better build this right on my plate and this muffin goes right on top now that's my favorite egg sandwich and I think it's the perfect way to start your day a Reuben sandwich warm juicy layers of corned beef melted Swiss cheese sauerkraut and russian dressing sandwich between toasted rye bread that's what a Reuben is all about I'm buttering the outside of two nice slices of seeded ride and this sandwich was thought to have been created by a New York delicatessen owner Arthur Reuben who reportedly made it with ham for Charlie Chaplin's leading lady in a film shot in the early 1900s how's that for a bit of trivia well here now it puts a buttered side down and start layering this is thinly sliced corned beef and you need about per sandwich three ounces because the best delis don't skimp so we're going to be the best Deli making this Reuben sandwich fold it over try to make the meat as even thickness as possible YUM and then we have lovely Swiss cheese and another layer and remember seeing the Russian dressing so I think homemade russian dressing is the best 1/3 of a cup of mayo some sweet pickle relish just about 2 tablespoons some ketchup again about two tablespoons stir this together and as you can just keep in a little jar in the refrigerator for your liverwurst sandwiches your corned beef sandwiches your Reuben sandwiches a nice sprinkling of black pepper about it half a teaspoon of salt and secret ingredient Worcestershire sauce just about a teaspoon Oh yummy that is a very nice russian dressing so oh you could also put a little bit of lemon juice in here I think that would be a good idea if your lemon has one of those little bobbins on it you can cut that off it squeezes better just about a teaspoon of lemon juice that is good russian dressing so now sauerkraut about 1/2 a cup of nice German sauerkraut which is basically fermented pickled cabbage and put a lot of russian dressing right here on the unbuttered side of the bread the buttered side is going to be cooked and that's what helps toast the Rye bread so a nice slathering of russian dressing and put that right over very nice and get this into a slightly warm pan and let it toast both sides and so now when you think it's nice and brown flip it and that looks really good just about done that cheese is nice and soft the bread is nice and toasted remove it to a board because I think you're going to want to cut this in half so pretty oh wow this is a great looking sandwich and warning this sandwich is so juicy and so delicious that you might need a few extra napkins eat this up while it's still hot and toasty I think you'll really enjoy all the sandwiches I showed you they do make a meal thanks so much for
