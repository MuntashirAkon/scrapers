well when I see luscious plump big blueberries like this I just can't stop myself for making pies blueberry pie is one of my favorites today I'm going to show you how to make individual blueberry pies you'll need about 3 cups of fresh blueberries pick them over you know here's while leaves a few stems just pick them over wash them put them in a big bowl like this and I like to sprinkle them with a little bit of flour about over 3 cups of blueberries which will make about 2 individual pies you're going to need about 2 tablespoons of all-purpose flour and approximately depending on the sweetness of the berries themselves approximately 1/2 a cup of sugar asked at 1/2 for these because not only are these large and plump they are also very sweet blueberries and I also like to add to the filling a little bit a fresh lemon zest this lemon just perks up the flavor of the blueberries not too much zest but just enough to give a hint of another flavor some people put nutmeg some people put cinnamon mace other flavors in their pies but I just love the taste of blueberries and nothing else now this is 1/2 a recipe at Patras a enough for 2 pies and this is the size pie see how cute these are these actually came from New York cake and baking distributors in New York City at dollar ninety-nine each but they last for many many years I have lots from my catering days so roll this out to quite thin you're going to need 4 circles from this of pastry for the tops and the bottoms and you can see that this is the perfect crust because it rolls out without tearing without crumbling without being tough and I can pick it up very nicely just make sure that your surface is floured enough not too much you don't want to get your pastry tough and now the way I like to do this is just to cut around and fit it right in it's nice to chill the dough if it's gotten a little bit soft or warm you can just put it right down into your refrigerator I love these under the counter drawers and then you're going to need two more circles which will be the top of the pie and kind of about the same size and be very generous with the filling the more the better so mound them up and now add a dab of butter on top of each butter is kind of important in a blueberry pie because it thickens the juices it enriches the juices very nicely oh it's so good and here's our tops I want to have a little air hole in the middle of each of my crust I'm using a biscuit cutter and then just place this over the top press gently with your thumbs then you can bake the pies off not long before your guests are due to arrive so here notice how I'm pressing it down and now there's quite a bit of excess cut around leaving Oh approximately an inch from where you're pressing just from here to here about an inch scissors work very well for this now the reason I'm leaving the overhang is because I want to make what I call bears teeth in Maine in Mount Desert Island there are lots of big rocks lining the edges of cliffs that fall down to the sea and those big rocks are known as bears teeth or Rockefellers teeth mr. Rockefeller had a lot to do with the establishment of Acadia National Park notice I'm snipping all the way around the perimeter nature of the crust so before you bend the teeth up just brush with a little bit of water we're quickly because the pastry tends to get soft and the heat now this should go into the refrigerator if you chilled for about 30 minutes before you bake and we have some already chilling and I'll show you how we finish them off brush the entire crust of the chilled pies with water the sugary crust is very nice especially for a individual pie like this it just makes it nice and crispy and somehow the blueberries can really take another sprinkling of sugar now get these pies right into a preheated 425 degree oven they have to cook until they just start to get golden about 20 minutes then lower the heat to 375 and continue baking until the juices bubble up in the center of each individual pie that's going to take maybe 15 or 20 minutes more and I think we have some very beautiful is almost done right here now aren't those just great and they are bubbling right in the center's very important and let them cool it's very important don't try to eat them this hot they smell really good and you might be very tempted but they have to cool a little bit they will burn you if you try to eat them so hot and aren't those little Bears teeth cute well it's serving with your favorite whipped cream ice cream or just as they are happy July 4th for more entertaining decorating crafts and home keeping tips pick up the latest issue of Martha Stewart Living or subscribe today and Martha Stewart comm slash iTunes offer Martha Stewart on demand free on Comcast Cox optimum and DirecTV to learn more go to Martha Stewart comm John - demand
