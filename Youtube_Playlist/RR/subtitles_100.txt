more television catchphrases come from your family while growing up or you've come up with them yourself such as nice guy yeah when it's already every hour I said oh my god that's good my mother my whole life but she taste something delicious oh my god was like a dubby oh my god it's delicious and when my grandpa was alive she told my god daddy that's the best day ever tasted and my grandpa passed oh my God my girl if it was myself or my sister shit in kitchen oh my god my boy my brother she always said oh my god that's most delicious they divert right when I went on Food Network I started saying oh my god that's delicious and some people were offended by me saying God so I started to say young but I couldn't stop myself I day yeah I'm oh my god it was now an effective technique so they can't mention it to me that I was offending people with God and like my mother's Catholic and she never said I mean sound like I'm saying GD this is some really good shit hey I was just saying oh my god that's good but um after while the young oh my god didn't work either so I would try and cut myself off and it became yum oh I would stop at the Oh short of the my god um you have some really great ones Evie follow which everybody probably knows extra virgin olive oil was just about demystifying it for grocery store shoppers for rich people extra virgin olive oil is truly extra virgin olive oil has a very low heat temperature and it's bright green very free for anybody goes through price chopper eb oo was a raid to make you overpay for regular oven it was bright yellow looked like pee and it was absolutely fine to cook with so i said just buy the evo oh that i was the lowest price for a while a short term when grocery stores were trying to take over the gourmet food trade every regular olive oil would put extra virgin olive oil on the label it was a product of its time in history now I try and write 0 0 or Halle broke because now there really is crow Schuster olive oil that is extra virgin and olive oil but when I was teaching cooking my family only cooked in olive on my whole life and unfortunately for a short amount of time the grow store you could only buy extra virgin olive oil and I'm standing alone in the kitchen talking myself and vegetables then I just got sick of saying it over and over again I'm just like whatever evo just grab the DVR arm around cuz im bored talking myself I'm just there alone making four or five shows a day like three guys my favorite ratio is on trade ties up tell us about it because to me finally somebody said what I earn millions of people want sometimes for a meal I think that people look at food with too many rules if you're a half not you think it's too complicated to achieve if you are a have you think you have to produce for everyone that comes to your house this course I that course and the next and a person in the know well pastas a preemie it's not an entree or you have to have the appetizer followed by this followed by that this is not you know Victorian era exactly any user it's ridiculous you should make the food that makes you feel comfortable and you should put out the food that you're proud of if you want to put out deviled eggs and deviled ham and liverwurst with some roots lager toast great fine and then serve cookies if you want to make a big bowl of pasta put that in the middle of the table and then serve some a big tube of Isis from the corner you know lemon ice if I it's your party I think everybody on both ends of the spectrum is too many rules about this stuff okay the plate is yours so I try and put a sense of humor about it to remind people to not take their food so seriously appetizers can be an entree your pasta doesn't have to be free me you don't need nine courses you don't need a full bar you can make one cocktail and offer soft drinks and beer in one wine if you don't have to have this pressure I don't care if you're rich or poor I never met anybody like to be bothered or spent too much money period I don't care if you're old young rich poor it's your house you should be happy in it and you should do what makes you feel comfortable in it I just don't understand the opposite unless you literally royalty your mom have a GD growing up my mother had a boob and marine bucket so this is this is rachel's turn I'm a garbage at Waterbeach bowl if you work in restaurants if you work on a line there's a scrap bucket cut into the sandwich board in front of the grill if you work in a proper kitchen usually take this square part of a ban marie and you leave it for scrap because you'll get your head hit if you throw away food that should go into stock you don't throw away scrap in my mom's kitchen mmm she always had a big Hotel pan or a half hotel or a half sheet and she throw everything on its crap here garbage there and she'd walk over and separated out and you know take care of the other night but whether we were at home or at work we always had scrapped bucket the garbage bowl I tried to explain this to Food Network and they're like well we just can't you can't have you going on air with literally a bucket that looks like a trough so they suggested this pretty malla mean thing that matched the set that was very hot on ebay the time that a friend of mine collected Texas where and the Texas where bowl became the garbage bowl but it was always in our home yes because you know we're fruit service people but it used to just be a stainless steel well you know buckets quicker puppet thing
