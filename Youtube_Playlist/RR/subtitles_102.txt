I think is a week in a day I started work with food network well over a decade ago and Brooke Johnson is a great friend and mentor of mine and she runs for the scripts family of course fee network and she was launching Cooking Channel and she asked me if I could come up with a new promise it had been more than a decade since we launched 30-minute meals so she said what sitting prom is going to be we want to have something for cooking channel so I sat down is that you know I do every day of my life with my little composition books and I just started playing around with words 30 minute meals came about because Domino's promised to deliver pizza in 30 minutes or less so I thought if someone would spend 30 minutes waiting for take-out pizza David spent 30 minutes making dinner and at the time I was working as a buyer and a floor manager food market where everyone was a state worker and we've gone through two or three generations of people that didn't know how to make the most basic of dinners for themselves so my boss and I strategized that we would move more groceries in a market where people didn't know I'm cook if we crafted a cooking class series that we're all based around easy dinners about the same amount of time stoners his anything whole idea sort of fell apart in the Domino's got sued by a few people they had to stop making that promise and we sold the classes series of six of 30 miles before we cost it out what the chef's would want to teach them and all of the local restaurants so my boss said to me she just started scratched your head one of my best girlfriends today 20-something years later she said well what you gonna do do you know everybody likes your food why don't you just teach the class we know we can avoid you and I started teaching 30-minute meals to literally sell more groceries to our own customers and they they really enjoyed that we taught a three hour course and I mean we my boss was my backup she did my knees and help me set up and we have these three hour classes where we play music and yeah and we we hang out and shop and cook and it was more like a little Clubhouse you know be kings almost like a game but in like a friendly food game and we would teach six based recipes and I have five things if you learn that one discipline if you want to make a color you learning to make this sauce or this gravy or you know make a colored or poached chicken you could do all these different things with that knowledge so if you gave us three hours you would actually get 30 30 minute meals so 30 30 minute meals became this sort of happening in town a lot of people came in and wanted to be a part of the class and it became a say on the news let me started to get hate mail because it wasn't in a book for already one place where anybody could get it so it that thing sort of snowballed and overtook my life in a weird way start took on a life of its own will you resist God early 95 is month twice at gunpoint and go back upstate so design me for this is what working at all hell yeah Oh Donny head welcome Giada Cowan carnival is her full name John is still my friend of his day yeah when went back to the country no I started from scratch and I had to wait a year to get a job in that market it was it was literally a series of accidents that led to 30mm so I'm sitting down to write what's going to be like the succession to that I'm like I have no idea because it happened by accident so I just start dueling things that are popular make-ahead kind of a big thing you know maybe today freezer tomorrow vegan or vegetarian or half the people in the house eat this way and have people in that suit that way so I put all these ideas on a piece of paper and I literally did a market study and I went to the library i will tell me be born under this some people into that how much mail do i get about this and which mother get about that and I came up with week in a day with rachael ray because it rhymes with my name and it had some good research behind and then i sat down to write it became the hardest thing I've ever done trying to deliver a whole workweek of food in one day it's a big promise like you have to make the pantry list realistic you have to make the grocery list not back-breaking you know how are you going to get value with this and at the time they want a cooking channel to raise a bar and be a little bit higher than the bar the food now except say people are you like to cook and they're willing to cook so let's make the recipes a little more appealing to home cooks that are already foodies slight a lot of hills to climb with it um but I I like work I enjoy the feeling of long day's worth of work and so it became a really great project for
