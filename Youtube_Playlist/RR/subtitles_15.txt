Monday's they can be tough at work but surprisingly with shows like 24 and heroes on television it's an ideal night for friends to come over and have dinner my friends are cooked for me many times and unfortunately this day it is my time to cook dinner I only have one problem with that I'm just too damn lazy to cook dinner for anybody that's why I call this the real deal 30 minute meal you know you have Rachel rated her 30 minute meals that's true that have you ever really tried to make that 30 minute meal what do you have to do first of all you got to catch the show which is 30 minutes already you got to record that show and write everything down the store fight the traffic fight the lines of sort of bring on the food home cut it all up put it in nice little pretty Bowl and then by all the time you everything's all produced and laid out for you like it is on the show yeah it takes about 30 minutes but what's the real time two days so this is why I kind of put this little video to show people what they can do when it's their time to cook meal for their friends with everybody watching their weight these days you can't go to McDonald's and you can't go order out takeout Chinese phone they want to see the love and the hardship and the good values putting a strong meal at home so let me show you my 30 minute real deal first it starts with TV dinners if you see I bought marie callender's because marie callender's is known for their TV dinners which are tasty but also yet good for you they don't have to worry about 230 calories from fat saturated that's not really important is they're not going to know anyways so you start with the TV dinners the next thing you do is you got to get some tools to help make your meal look authentic did you really cook it how are they going to know what's going to really show them what I like to do is get one of my favorite pieces is corn on cob delicious frozen already pre-cut already taking this whatever the leaves are feeling not a cook I just know you put that in hot water and it gets done in about 5-10 minutes you get some bread cut and butter this put a little spice on it but some reason people feel like you really made a meal with these two things on the side and then the last thing you want to do this really tops all up like the icing on the cake good old parsley knife that a couple times put it on your plate and you're good to go people think it's funny and cute he made a meal for us and he put parsley on it too oh god this is going to be fun 30 minute real deal here we go okay now this is step two I have all the ingredients on the tables ready to go I'm pretty sure I already covered the fact that i am quite lazy but how lazy am I still lazy in fact that after I went out and bought TV dinners for my friend and I'm going to get my girlfriend that microwave them for me go ahead good no I don't know microwave them no babe you got to take the cardboard off I'm pretty sure no baby take the cardboard off get in a cola Micah they're taking them okay so here's the finished product we got ourselves hey Stevie dinner that's all the way cooked now see obviously you can't serve the dinner like this but it's an easy fix all you basically need is some sort of ceramic plate now from here to here for some reason this dinner starts to look a whole hell of a lot better first we take the chicken and we put it on the side there look at that I just cook that chicken Wow I'm a genius take the other piece of chicken go ahead and put it right there man I'm a culinary expert now we got some juices there that I can trickle on top of the chicken but you don't want to do that yet because it might look just a little bit nasty so what I'm going to do is I'm going to take my hands I'm just going to grab that's hot in the more trying to keep it family here all right so that really hurt now we got mashed potatoes how we're going to get that over there some people like to use spoons maybe that's a smart thing to do but I'm just going to go ahead and use my hands i told you i was a lazy okay now see we got a lot of a real estate still on that plate but that's okay because right over here we have some corn cooking we have some bread making oh hi there as you can see we're almost done with our real deals 30-minute meals take a look doesn't that look fantastic you got a little space on each plate here for the bread take that up real nice and easy and of course it only took four minutes for each place to cook that's a grand total of sixteen minutes plus going to Thorne's about 30 minutes now you almost then once the parsley on because that makes you look like a hero oh how cute he is putting importantly in all the place but don't forget you gotta dispose of the evidence and that's the real deal 30 minute meal see you guys happy third-year anniversary you're glad it's a good meal for you and we're happy to have you here we love you very much we love you do thank you guys thank you enjoy the meal is it food good my cousins yet to eat his plate of food alia everything
