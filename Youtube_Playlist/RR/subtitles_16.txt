I'm going to start by preheating the oven to 375 that's for oven baked corn dogs of course out of the refrigerator to make the actual corn batter that we're going to use I'm going to grab some milk and butter and I need the eggs too now I'm making mine kind of chilly style the actual corn batter is gonna taste like chili so I'm gonna spice it up a little hot sauce and I'm gonna grab some scallions to put a little color in there and Oh jumbo pakka dogs now is there any more boardwalk food than big hotdog YUM okay down here I'm gonna use these bowls to help me carry everything I think cuz I need to load up the corn muffin mix and some spices out of the pantry let's get all of that in there yeah that was a good idea that'll help me carry a little bit more you know me I never one make two trips okay I'm gonna put some chili powder and some cumin nice smoky cumin into the batter like I said it's gonna taste like a chili dog come on there I think that works and then I'm gonna grab the corn muffin mix of course we need that pre-measured ingredients are a girl who can't bakes best friend got my garlic on here too Wow I wish there was some sort of boardwalk game that involved carrying lots of stuff coz I'd win now when I was really really little we lived out in Cape Cod near all the beaches and all fun all the excitement of that I've always been really lucky in that I grew up in resort areas then we moved to Lake George in upstate New York we have a huge boardwalk there it's really cool really fun the arcades and all the different you know like the House of Wax Museum Mini Putt golf and all that I love being near the water it is so much fun and one of the things we kids really loved about it was all the junk food we could eat but you know this isn't junk food at all this is gonna be really healthy well-balanced meal actually the kids will love it it'll look like it's something that's bad for him but it's not and you'll love it cuz it'll remind you of all the fun you've had at boardwalks okay I've got half a stick of butter in there now we're gonna bake it in the oven it's not deep-fried we need a little bit of butter so it'll Brown up no big deal pop it into the microwave and oh you know I'm gonna need a cup I'll just use my coffee cup cuz you know I don't have those measuring things and I'm gonna go ahead and start making up our batter here now we need two packages eight ounces each any brand you like of corn muffin mix dump those into the bowl and then we're just gonna spice them up so the actual corn batter tastes just like chili cuz the only thing that can make corn dog better is in my opinion chili okay two of those to that I'm gonna add about a tablespoon of chili powder I'm just gonna measure that in the palm of my hand that's about a palm fault and you go then I'm gonna add some nice smoky cumin I'll be with you in a minute buttered about two teaspoons of that it's about two-thirds of a palm full boom in there that goes all the same spice combinations I used to make a bowl of chili actually that's what I'm doing here a couple of shakes a hot sauce that's cayenne pepper and vinegar of course and then we're gonna go get that melted butter close enough there's a couple little bits left in there but that those will just work themselves out when we stir it all up a couple of eggs two eggs for two boxes of corn muffin mix and then we're gonna start with about a cup and a quarter or a coffee cup and a quarter of the milk and a little bit of scallions in there just for color and to give some oniony action to our chili theme cuz I use lots of onions in my chili so I'll just use a couple little scallions thinly sliced here cut them in half trim off the very tough tops there but then you can use all of the white and all of the green these run my knife through that excellent I'm gonna put in a little bit of salt to a couple of pinches of that didn't go the scallions cup and a quarter of the milk to starch and if we need more we want to loosen it up a little bit then fine we can do that let's start with that okay let's use this big bad whisk here to get it all together real quick break up the egg you might want to give it a poke to get the yolk broken up nice and quickly for you there we go this is coming together quite nicely quite quickly if I do say so myself and I think it looks perfect I don't think we need any more milk at all I think that's gonna be just right I just want to get the lumps out make sure we don't have any big pockets of cornmeal in there perfect so kupo excellent now let's grab our meat fork there we go and I'm gonna use a spoon too just to help me along here I'll show you it couldn't be easier to do this again it's a lot of fun for the kids just break this open and get a nice jumbo dog here now hey you could also use tofu dogs turkey dogs or you could use beef or pork of course these are a nice big juicy beef Frank here and then you dip it right in there and use a spoon to help you coat that corn dog nice really load it up on there then put it on your cookie sheet and just use the spoon to help you slide it right off the fork can also use the spoon to cover up any little bits of dogs that are left exposed there we go really loaded on there that's one of the many benefits of making these at home hey they're not deep-fried so you don't have to feel quite as guilty as eating the ones you might find on the actual boardwalk plus you can really load on those beautiful spicy corn muffin in we spiced up the corn muffin I mean you're not gonna find these down on the boardwalk you know what I mean not with all those spices and green onions going on in there all right you pop them in that 375 oven just let them cook till they're golden brown all over I'm going to show you a neat trick with them you just use a little mop in here so I don't burn myself you can take one of these long bamboo skewers and then it's just like being on the boardwalk you can actually eat the dog off a stick how groovy is that
