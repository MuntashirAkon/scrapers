now if you're a vegetarian or you have one in your life it's a good idea to arm yourself with some meals that are meat free but hard enough for everyone to share I'm going to start by filling up a pot with some water for the penne pasta and out of the fridge let's grab the three vegetables I'm gonna use haricot vert those are just thin green beans and about a half a pound of asparagus half a bundle and a medium zucchini that's a little guy in me and I'm gonna grab my pine nuts as well I keep them in the fridge so that I can get the longest life out of them pine nuts are filled with oils and if you keep them to warm the oils can go rancid and spoil the nuts you get a nice long life out of them keeping them in the fridge or the freezer I'm gonna just cover the bottom of a skillet here with them I love pine nuts because they're nice and buttery and extra delicious and as with any nut you're gonna get the most flavor out of them if you toast them up a bit before you use them that allows the oils to come out and really deepen the flavor of them I'd say we got a couple of handfuls in there we're gonna make a pesto sauce so I always put pine nuts in my pesto delicious everybody puts pine nuts in their pesto right classic basil pesto genovese well today is kind of a take-off on that we're gonna do a combo a basil and tarragon which I think are very related in taste they're both kind of sweet licorice ange it's delicious now I'm gonna put a lid on our pasta pot there so the water comes up to a boil quicker now let's start talking about the veggies here let's start with haricots vert I reco vert that's just French for green beans and they're very skinny and delicate just pretty in this recipe all right I'm gonna pile up all these ends together here I think I could do this last bunch in one swoop I don't want to leave them straight you know a few stragglers here there we go last bundle it's a little bit time-consuming but if you take the time to pile them all together it makes the trimming so much easier done garbage bold that now these are already you know not too long not too big so I'm just gonna make one cut down the middle of the whole pile and that'll be about the size of the shape of the penny well pile that off to the side we'll end up putting them all into the green bean bag there so one medium zucchini it's not too fleshy in the middle here's what I'm gonna do cut off the ends and then cut them into strips and then take my strips cut those into sticks and cut the sticks across into little penny sized pieces now the asparagus this is half a pound I had some as a side dish the other night but you remember how to trim it right these guys are already trimmed but you just hold it at both ends give it a little snap and wherever it breaks that's your guideline for where to cut the asparagus once you get all the nice tender tops together line them up in a row you might want to cut these at a bit of an angle sort of like pen a is the name for the quills of a pen and that's the pasta we're using and they're cut on kind of an angle so you just want to cut those on an angle as well right down there and we're just gonna pile them all up here together let's gather up some more ingredients and get our pesto sauce made I'm gonna grab a big bag full of herbs I've already got prepped and ready to go I'm gonna grab a celery heart a nice big piece of parmigiano-reggiano really yummy and I'm gonna grab some portobello mushroom caps I'm gonna need one lemon for our pesto and some garlic this is such a nice easy pesto but once you learn the method of making a pesto n-- you've probably already made them at home but it's so much fun to experiment with the ingredients you could make an artichoke heart pesto you could make spinach pesto you can change up the nuts you could change up all the different herbs that you use so this is just a nice variation on a theme let's say let's start with the herbs let's talk about these first I think this is a nice complement here now basil that's gonna be our primary if you've made pesto genovese or your basic pesto at home before you've worked with this right you just get the nice leafy tops all together I find about 20 leaves or so makes about a cup we want about a cup of basil leaves in there maybe a couple more excellent and then I'm gonna add some nice licorice in there the licorice flavor is gonna come from fresh tarragon I love the sweet liqueur she tasted it and I think it's just such a nice pair to the basil basil is super sweet to me so the licorice she leaves of the fresh tarragon make a nice companion a nice buddy I'm gonna do well maybe five or six sprigs of that in there now these are very tender see this how this tarragon is you know kind of wilting over like that that's because it's very young and tender but usually the stems are pretty woody so I try and pull the leaves off as gently as possible and just get the leaves in there not the stems parsley our next ingredient here well it's easy to go ahead and use up a little bit of the stems in here that's fine parsley stems have a nice bright flavor just like the tops and I'm gonna reserve some of my flat leaf parsley here that's from my salad that we're gonna make in a minute I'm gonna take the rest gather up the stems to the bottom but you know have to be too careful about it it's a great use for the stems actually now I always put parsley into just about any pasture I make you know why cuz it helps the pesto keep a nice bright green color to it okay so let's get that off to the side plus it's got a great flavor right I'm gonna zest a lemon in here next I think the citrusy action with the licorice she flavors and the sweet basil just really works together quite nicely and it turns this into a sort of a four-season dish this is an excellent dish even in the summer although I would recommend serving it cold rather than hot now we're gonna get one clove of garlic in there we'll just pop it and drop it boom pull the skins off throw those in the old garbage bowl and goes the garlic let's do a little bit of salt and pepper next and then I've got a nice big piece of parmigiano-reggiano not parmesan Parmesan si n that's domestic cheese it's made to taste like Carmen gently Reggiano but I think Parma jog parmigiano-reggiano is such an important ingredient especially when you're making something like a pesto get the real deal you know this is aged at least eighteen months and it has a really nutty wonderful aroma and flavor to it I'm just going to grab a grater here just put it right over the top and you want the equivalent of a couple of handfuls just grate away in there and then we're good to go we're just gonna turn it on and stream in our Evo Oh our pine nuts of course we gotta get those with it right all right okay almost there we can always add more cheese to it later too as we're tossing it all together yep we got a little heat off the nuts let's put those in there we're good to go pop it on let her rip and then stream in your evo Oh your extra-virgin olive oil until it's a consistency you like I like a nice thick pesto cuz I add a little bit of the cooking liquid right before I mix the pasta and the pesto together so we're good there once the pastas going a couple minutes guys you can drop your whole collection of vegetables right into the same cooking water it's so cool this is an easy cleanup meal great for vegetarians or meat eaters it's awesome and you know you could even serve this speaking of a nice summer meal you could serve this cold in the summer months I'm gonna take out a little bit of this starchy cooking liquid here when I got a little piece of zucchini there but that's okay I'm going to add this to my pesto now the pesto remember was a mixture of basil and tarragon and flat leaf parsley with your usual suspects the garlic and the cheese and the pine nuts and the olive oil now I'm turning it into a nice sauce here by adding a little bit of that hot cooking liquid it thins it out a little and the starchy liquid helps it stick right to the pasta now I cooked the veggies my combination of asparagus and haricot vert those thin green beans and zucchini all in the same pot I started the penne first whoo remember to get penne with lines penne Rigate the lines help oil based sauces stick to the pasta better so now I'm gonna drain off the veggies and the pasta you start the pasta first then a few minutes into the cooking process you add the veggies you want to pull the veggies when they still have a nice bite bright color and a good bite to them just like you want a good bite to the pasta al dente pasta give that a good drain you don't want too much liquid in with our sauce and then we'll dump it right back into our dish here let's make sure we can still toss it I still have a little bit extra here I want to make sure we can toss it I'm gonna get a few more veggies in there now if you're watching your car - whether you eat meat or don't eat meat this is a great meal for you because there's tons of vegetables and a little bit of pasta all mixed up together in a really healthy tasty sauce oh look at that the colors and the fragrance remember you could use this terrific pesto if you do eat meat on top of meats as well you could make some nice grilled chicken or fish and put the pesto down over the top be delicious in the summer you could serve this as a cold pasta salad or even a cold pesto potato salad as well nice I think that's fine
