hey welcome back to 30 Minute Meals I'm Rachael Ray and today I'm using my entree as a passport a passport in Venice I'm starting my Venetian scallops and shrimp and look at the color look at the color these have been in the pan just two minutes with I've been cooking less than ten and look at this look at the color we've got that's all sugar coming out of those scallops they are just gorgeous I'm going to turn them rather quick and I'm going to let this guy go just one minute because I don't want them to cook all the way through and you don't want to overcook your scallops I don't need that I need my wine and I need my saffron that's one of my surprise ingredients in the sauce a little chicken stock and tomatoes and we're good to go myself little room to move here okay now as I said I'm just gonna let those go one minute so I want them out onto a plate I'm going to slide them back into the sauce later and let them just finish at the end those are gorgeous plus they're still warm they're continuing to cook right now take it over the color smells so great in here okay so all we had in there was a little olive oil and butter I'm going to add a touch more olive oil a little crushed red pepper flake for heat give it a little pop in the palm of my hand and we've got our garlic and shallots all ready to go smells wonderful touch more EVO Oh on that extra virgin olive oil look at all those good pan drippings - we're going to get those up with our wine nice wooden spoon here oh so fragrant okay now I'm going to get all those good bits up by adding a little liquid now use good wine why do you actually want to drink out of a glass because when you're cooking with wine you're concentrating that flavor I got about a cup in there I'm just gonna let that reduce by half which will take no time what side smelling great and this is a lot more affordable you know buying some good seafood a lot more affordable than getting on an airplane although I am gonna get on an airplane later this year me and mom are actually gonna go to Venice I'm so excited I really want to see what she saw when she was a girl what kept her up all night you know the canals and fireworks we're gonna go during the big regatta in the boat race Shino theme nights like this you can go there any day of the week I put on little music open a little wine and it's fun it's like you're a little kid again you know you get to pretend and play for the night great it's a good idea okay now I'm just going to add one small can of diced tomatoes it's a couple of cups ooh yummy and little chicken stock cup of that and now the secret ingredient remember how I was telling you that Venice is a spice port well this is saffron and in Venice you get saffron you get curry you get all these interesting spices mixed in with the base which is always tomato and wine and garlic so with the expected you get the unexpected now a little goes a long way with saffron you just want to put a pinch in there it's actually the stamens of a flower ooh so fragrant wonderful and that's going to be the really interesting backdrop flavor in there that's what makes this Venetian perfect hey the waters ready for the asparagus yeah perfect let's come up to a nice simmer and this is a classy little side dish that takes no effort asparagus and prosciutto okay now let me show you how you know where to break your asparagus I leave these on I give these Fergus to rinse and leave these on keeps them all together and easier to cut how do you know where to cut take your asparagus and let it tell you just give it a gentle push and it'll say okay right about there see just hold it from either end give it a little pop and that's how you know where to cut now I'm just going to go right down the line and I just save those scraps there's a couple of veggies I like to save the trimmings up like mushrooms and my asparagus they're terrific for soup okay now these are only going to be in here a couple of minutes you want them to keep their color you just need them nice and tender ooh the sauce is ready I got to take a quick break but I'm just going to get the shrimp into the sauce and let it cook nice and gentle okay welcome back to 30 minute meals today I'm making a meal straight off the boat from Venice I guess I should say straight off the gondola the asparagus is just perfect that's for my asparagus wrapped with prosciutto it was only in there about two minutes so it's still got all of its color it's gorgeous I'm spreading it out on that plate so it cools really quickly and in less than 20 minutes I've already got my sauce completed with tomatoes wine saffron shallots and garlic really delish the shrimp's in there cooking right now the scallops are already cooked well pretty much almost all the way through I didn't want to finish them off because they're going back in but look at all of the sugar that came out during the cooking process remember we got our pan really hot we just used a little flour to edge that whole thing along now I'm zesting a lemon real quick here and I'm just going to leave a little bit of lemon zest off to the side of my board because I'm going to layer that flavor into my Venetian shrimp and scallops later I'm also going to use up the whole of the lemon because I want to get a little of that on the asparagus just to drizzle I always juice this side up so the seeds don't go in the dish a little drizzle of evo Oh extra virgin olive oil and a little salt and pepper now I'm doing all this to these Farragut's first because I'm going to wrap it with micro judo and I don't want to put the lemon juice on top of the prosciutto it will discolor it now I'm going to streamline the process of this here by just setting up everything in a line so I'm going to do probably let's say I probably got enough for at least five of these little bundles here so I'll put five pieces of my Persian bow down it's so nice you can get prosciutto de Parma right in the regular grocery stores now and at a terrific price okay now exactly the same thing make five little bundles of asparagus now remember I said this was fun for cocktail parties too you could individually wrap these and people can just pick them up and it's a a wonderful utensil free healthy snap look at that isn't that cool now I just rock and roll and wrap and roll there we go one two three see it goes much easier if you're just doing the same action over and over again cool man we're done with that let me just grab a plate I think it'll look nice on there you know even if you're cooking for yourself take the time to make it pretty you know set these for your eyes first in your stomach second and that's what's neat about these little getaway nights these passport nights you know you can really treat yourself then it's very inexpensive you buy a couple special ingredients take a little extra time with your food and hey all you got to commit to is half an hour right everybody's got 30 minutes somewhere in there okay woo my meant to say and really use me oh this smells so good nice fresh basil that's to finish off our shrimp and scallops look at the holes on blackberries and raspberries I couldn't decide between the two so I got them both and I've got some lemon sorbet in here I really want that to come to room temperature so it's easier to scoop so I'm just going to put that out now get it out of the way oh it smells fantastic now let me show you this is kind of cool I'm just going to pile up a few of these leaves here oh you know what I don't want that shrimp to go too far and they're starting to curl up when the tail goes towards the end here when it starts to make that shape that's a and hey I'm almost done so I'm going to slide my scallops right back into the pan so they can finish off very gently combine that sprinkle in that lemon zest there's another layer of flavor going on and just let that hang out and cook very gently the last couple of minutes oh it's gorgeous now for color and sweetness to balance the heat that I put in there with that crushed red pepper flake and to really offset that beautiful saffron I'm going to get a little basil going watch this you just pile the leaves together make a little
