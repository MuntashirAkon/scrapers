with images truly want to talk with you sandwich Caroline of our few upper is sweet potato fries / turkey guys welcome back i'm working on a meal to celebrate the flavors at the end of summer which you can make it all year long anytime you want my fish and corn chowder well if you're working with fresh corn on the cob may need three years for this lot of geography four to six people I'm going to scrape down the corn on a small bowl sitting upside down in the bottom of a larger bowl that's so that as you sprayed the corn all the liquids and all the kernels are captured by the large hole it's the least messy way to do a really kind of fun job if you're making this out of season you're going to need about twice a two and a half three cups of frozen kernels or you could do what my friends and I trying to remind ourselves to do the recipe and again in the summer so if we have the corn for the rest of year make up a bunch of corn no Bree and I'll boil it up scrape it down throw it in the freezer and you can cook with it for months over here I had a lid on my chowder I kind of force the veggies along a little bit they're getting nice and tender at the same time my vegetables were slumping up a bit giving up their juice I was heating up some chicken stock so i can add that down in and it doesn't slow up the cooking process I've got one quarter stock you can use chicken or seafood and it's nice and hot already up to a boil not slowing anything down i'm giving a good stir to release all of the drippings at the bottom of the band from our bacon and onions a little bit of garlic they time and I chopped up those too starchy potatoes through Roman here got some celery in there as well put the celery and onion in first so we can sweat out a little and the potatoes will suck up all the drippings from the bacon too quickly X throw our corn in there the corner chill it out a little bit so immediately I'm gonna pop the lid right back on so it's screaming hot for the heck gonna put the attic in the chanukah cook up a few minutes like five minutes or so and then we're going to stir it some milk and cream to really help me that that were just picking it up I have two bounds have had a fillet here or you can do Scott hope I need my cheese too i want to get going on my grilled cheeses means i need my butter as well i'm going to show you a neat trick but to show you the neat trick for the grilled cheese on english muffins we're going to be making you gotta soften up your butter spread of these ten seconds for a stick-on do you grab my english muffins deal with that in a minute almost got up to a boil there with you in a second butter it's a beautiful haddock you want skin off nice white flaky fish whatever looks good if they destroy that day now you just might use tongs here just gently set this endeavor not to cut it up or anything or break it up once the fish becomes opaque and coach through that one back on yes let me show you how we assemble grilled cheese samples there's something so awful American just fun about any sandwich you serve about an Englishwoman just kind of ironic because of the name of the month English I grabbed the butter I'm going to slice some super sharp cheddar sometimes it crumbles up on you no big deal and let me roadmap this for you so how to take another quick break here in this cheese I got to be slow and careful I do have the brick to come back to it over the break so get your cheese all sliced up your extra sharp cheddar I take your English muffins split them turn them inside out so all of the nooks and crannies are facing out and then you're going to butter them before you put them on the griddle then the butter is evenly distributed on both sides of the grilled cheese is then that really other one I didn't do much I came up i'll meet you guys back there to go home / really and also our silver car needs it from Bobby free trip best recipes of the season everything favorites decide Southwest

they've been bubbling away in here a few minutes am NOT just going to gently break the love it it's a big pretty light I'm going to leave the lid off of the office length and let it start reducing we're going to add our milk and cream in there let that thick enough over the break I was just making up our English muffin dippers making grilled cheese on imported English muffins take the inside the muffin comes outside your language butter in it on both sides and then as they thrill up on the griddle they're perfectly there's a perfect distribution of butter than 90 innovation golden crunch to both sides in the middle super sharp cheddar cheese there you go i soften up the stick of butter in the microwave just a couple of minutes I mean it's a couple of seconds don't do a couple minutes still be suit with butter soup but 10 seconds or so for a stick and it makes it perfect spreadable I love super sharp cheddar and if you grow up in New England or New York State and weird she's loving she's making people all over them on you are England you'll find the same ingredients used over and over sharp cheeses maple syrup and everything chowders fish chowder clam chowder corn chowder crab
