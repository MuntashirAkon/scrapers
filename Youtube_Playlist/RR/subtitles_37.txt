guess we're for drizzle DB Yolo down on the bottom of my bagel shop get that nice and uh sprouted some bacon and over here I'm going to turn on my griddle pan so I can make my grilled cheese Sammy's inside-out English muffins I'll explain that to you later yeah by me for here's a jump bacon gonna grab some bacon some celery some fresh bay where you could use dry bay leaf 2 sprigs of thyme and a couple years of corn on the cob I need a couple of bowls to scrape the corn off the cob I'll explain that to you in a few and then she's my basket with my nice starchy potatoes and excellent let's start by getting the bacon in there because you've got our children and that is very small like a lily bitty up through kindergarten or I went to kindergarten mastery Central School when I was real small we lived on Cape Cod so I know we became real chowder guys out here my whole family we love a good scratch out of corn chowder fish chowder you name it we love it this one is one of my favorite recipes because it combines fish chowder and Corchado in one beautiful delicious pot and the actual inspiration for this particular chowder came years and years later when I was growing up I was given his gift a old cookbook from a flea market designed by Barbara Sinatra it was the Sinatra family and friends cookbook and in it Teddy Kennedy had a fish chowder recipe he got me thinking on Schauder I said I'm gonna make my version that lots of corn spiced it up he's a little soft work in his family recipe I put in four or five slices nice smoky bacon slice the bacon lengthwise and then across so you end up when it cooks up these little tiny bacon bits run it all through each other now this is a meal that certainly celebrates the end of summer I love making shouters especially early September you know when it first starts to get crisp and cool at night my favourite time here for chowder anyway this chowder can send you back to those end days of summer any time here always makes me think of Cape Cod of those first few nights when it's chilly enough to throw your sweatshirt on take a cool evening walk that's great like that isn't it it's like a um like a scrapbooking to eat if it appeals to all your flavors meets all of your senses you know one wheel can really take you away all over place almost that later pop this back in the fridge it's coming out and just start traveling and dropping in no particular order and take a few bricks of celery here when you're cooking with celery use all including the leafy tops there's tons of flavors in and don't you know keep this recipe around and only make it and if summer we can still get nice corn on the cob like is in the winter it gets up to two frozen corn kernels couple cups of them for this recipe for my friend and I are always talking about out in this summer it's super smart take time to buy a ton of corn shuck it all up marv oil a little bit scrape down throat and ziplock baggies throw any freezer and you have that nice fresh end of summer corn taste well into the winter months it's a little bit sweeter than any of the frozen corns you can get the grocery store oh they have some great frozen veggies out there these days it's one of the last bargains in the grocery store frozen vegetables and there's lots of organic brands down there something about making your own taste delicious you give this a stir move it around a little bit get it rendered out get o in people or not you chop Kesari off to the side do a nice big one in next nice sweet on potatoes you know lots of times for quick cooking I use those little baby potatoes because you don't have to peel them but for chowder I likes nice turkey fiddling Idaho potatoes it starts really helps thicken up the chowder for you and because I grew up on the Cape we who are eating a ton of scrog haddock and KY so that's what I'm gonna put in the soup today so nice having can't wait to eat this so happy all right kind of daydreaming about you know and at the end of the summer that's the first inkling you have when your head kind of goes back to comfort foods you know when it's super hot the dog days in the summer all you're thinking about our cold salad suppers ice cream crushing drinks arbic Ute burgers towards the end of summer that's we start thinking about your soups you chowder's stews or as I called Stoops fixed observable cinnamon soup excellent our Bacon's ready let's grab our food over here it's your onion celery down in there I don't put the potatoes in first because they're so starchy they stick to the bottom to soak up all the fat I put in the celery onions first so they can start giving off will their juices keep a nice moist oh heck I forgot my stop I gotta grab a container of stock and get that going this can be the stock and getting warm while the veggies and potatoes are cooking up so they're cooking out of simultaneously so that when you bring them together you're not slowing down with cooking process I'm gonna put a quarter stock in this pot before you could use seafood stock for the mellow flavor of chicken stock myself pop that on let that get warming up a couple potatoes here I get my herbs in now - I'm gonna throw in ice fresh bay leaf and a few sprigs of thyme I'm just going to throw the whole stem in because those little tiny leaves they'll fall off while the chowder's cooking up and we'll just fish the stems out later I'm gonna be at least potatoes up and get them and I'm going to start shucking the board I'll show you why I have two bowls just break that board off the cob right off
