I am adding these sweet potatoes to the water here now I'm making mashed sweet potatoes so if you want them to cook up quick cut them small just dropping those in oh where do you taste these sweet potatoes oh there's a trick to him they are good and nobody's gonna know it only took you half an hour it so doesn't look like it did I got about a half a stick of butter melting in there it's over about medium heat now and I'm gonna add some sliced banana don't worry you won't taste it you won't really know there's banana in there it's just hanging out in the background everybody's gonna say why are her mashed sweet potatoes so delicious what does he do with that well this is what you do with it just slice up the banana let it cook up in the butter a bit it just adds complexity to the flavor of the sweet potatoes and it's super delicious you won't really be able to pick out banana in it it's just extra yummy I'm gonna go ahead and pop the whole thing in cuz it's kind of a small banana okay now to that I'm gonna add a little citrus flavor some orange orange goes so great with sweet potatoes where's my little handy dandy there it is my little microplane and when you're zest and orange just take the orange part of the peel you don't want to take the white that's bitter okay so I've got all this orange zest I'm gonna put that in there once the heat hits it it's really gonna make that flavor pop bring all the oils out I'm gonna roll the citrus to get the juices flowing go ahead and give that careful don't do that squeeze it from afar well it ain't a party till you pop yourself there you go gave my shirt some character my dry cleaner just loves me okay got my orange juice in there I'm gonna let that cook down a bit just takes one minute well I grab my potatoes now you can add your sweet potatoes right to that conglomeration in the bottom and just start mashing them up with the brown sugar and the chicken stock I use about a half a cup brown sugar for three pounds of sweet potatoes and that'll do you for about eight people about a half a cup couple of handfuls you can always adjust so it's better to err on the side of caution there add a little bit of sugar a little bit of salt and pepper herbs you can always go up it's my nutmeg grater nice fresh nutmeg going on in there delicious okay now you just start giving it a mash with a chicken stock what usually takes me about a cup but again I'm gonna start on the side of caution there what about a half a cup and then I can keep adding to it you could take them as smooth or leave them as thick as you like just like with your regular mashed potatoes I'm more of a smashed girl myself and then our secret ingredient was a banana sauteed in there with a little butter the banana cooked up I added orange zest which you can really smell very fragrant a little bit of orange juice brown sugar we kept it kind of trim instead of cream I just used some of that same chicken stock to mash them up
