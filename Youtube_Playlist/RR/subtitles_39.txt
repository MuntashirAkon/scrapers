now I'm gonna get myself all set up here to do this turkey show you real quick turkey breasts come out and into the pan then we're gonna get this skin off of the turkey and loosen it up that's where I have my small knife here to help me pull it off so that we can get the herbs in there beautiful let's get this guy going excellent now into that pocket I'm not even gonna use this spatula I'm gonna stuff lots of herbs see that coating it fold that down over the top grab another big handful of the parsley and sage mixture get it in there fold it down over the top I've got my butter melting up here I'm gonna use this to continually base the bird as well get the butter down over it that'll give it some great color - nice there we go salt and pepper again on top of the skin and then when we transfer it to the oven I'm gonna knock that oven back to 400 because I don't want the skin to get black on me I want it nice and crispy and perfect knock that back to 400 when did you ever cook on ol Thanksgiving turkey in less than an hour well I did because I cooked off two turkey breasts boneless turkey breast remember you get these right at the regular market go up and tell your butcher what you need and what you're thinking about look how gorgeous they are huh now just like with any other meat I've ever made on 30 Minute Meals you got to give it time to rest to let the juices distribute so I'm gonna take the turkey out and transfer to the serving platter look how gorgeous that is oh my god that gorgeous it's full of herbs you can see the herbs that we put underneath the skin it smells so fragrant and amazing I'm just going to pick out the bay leaves that we had in these pan drippings here because we need to get them out to make our gravy and I'm gonna put a little heat right underneath the pan that I roasted the turkey in to bring it up to temperature cuz I'm gonna turn these wonderful pan drippings into gravy so I'm gonna add a few tablespoons of flour so it can be our thickening agent I'm gonna whisk that in so we don't get lumps and there's not a lot of fat in there because of course we just made turkey breasts right I'm gonna let that cook for a minute I've got a nice bubble up on this I'm gonna season it up with a little salt and pepper Oh smells amazing and I've got all that nice turkey broth in there and it's gonna thicken up beautifully with my flour and now I'm gonna add a layer of flavor with the apple brandy don't worry about the alcohol in here it cooks right off just a splash of that in there and then let it reduce a minute it'll intensify the flavor and the alcohol burns right away and then chew that I'm gonna add some of the cider see that's the theme it layers into every course of our meal here Apple Apple Apple so it'll slightly sweeten our gravy too and make it really interesting well put the cap back on hello so get that in there oh yeah and just keep working that together this is just bubbling away I took the drippings from that because they were just full of good turkey flavor and not too much fat because it was just turkey breast right and I thickened it up with a little flour seasoned it up with a little salt and pepper then the theme ingredient of my Thanksgiving feast is apples so I doubled up on my apple flavor I added a little bit of apple brandy to it and let it cook out so I'd cook the alcohol off and concentrate the flavor of the brandy mmm oh man is that good one more grind of black pepper I think cuz it's super sweet cuz I also put apple cider in here what a nice surprise and look at the gorgeous brown color we got out of that gravy now I'm gonna get that into my gravy boat here just pour that off and into there oh look at the gloss and the color to that beautiful check out this turkey how gorgeous is this now remember these two and a half pound turkey breasts I started with two of them have layers of flavor going all around them herbs everywhere on the bottom of the pan I started with Evo oh and lots of fresh bay leaf as the oven heated up that bay leaf the flavor went up through the meat between the meat and the skin look at this look at all this green in here that's another layer of fresh herbs parsley and sage I combined that in a food processor with some lemon zest and some extra-virgin olive oil and then I put it in between the two and there's just flavor everywhere and look how nice and crispy it is that's because we put it into a super hot oven and then we basted it with even more herbaceous flavor melted butter with Bailey from the butter - isn't this gorgeous now the cool thing about this is that you could actually make three of these guys in the same amount of time you can make two of these guys just line them up in their roasting pan and then you can feed up to twelve people this right here - two and a half pound pieces of boneless turkey breast that would feed up to eight adults gorgeous isn't it really pretty
