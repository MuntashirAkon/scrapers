two biggest challenges for working people or eating healthy and not having enough time to properly prepare for a meal what are your strategies of working around those I think I gave up a long time ago because my mom never lived this way is that that whole idea that you can have balance in your life I I just don't think exists I will not give up I you started this I think you have to be a little bit cognizant of that and you have to forgive yourself if dinner's at eight instead of 630 and I think it's about where he put your priorities my mom let us stay up past bedtime if she could get home after working and make sure she was with us at the table the table was really the function of communicating with each other and getting some meaning out of her day it wasn't whether she physically was in the kitchen for two hours prior to that if she defrosted something or even if she brought home from a restaurant and I lived that way today it's not you know what time we dinner it's if I can still come home and go through the process of making dinner and sit down and share a half an hour an hour with my husband my mom my friends that my niece my nephew my dog even if I'm alone in my husband's traveling it's meaningful to me as a human being to be able to go home and make a little 6-inch bin frittata for myself and instead of just eating a bowl of cold cereal or take out or make a handful of spaghetti and you know put a little kale and onions and garlic and chewing and I feel better if I can provide for myself and when I started out in my own life my food budget for the entire week was ironically forty dollars I felt so empowered to be able to buy a whole chicken some root vegetable some dry beans to be able to provide for myself whether your child is going to be the next rocket scientist neurosurgeon or the next great chef it is very empowering for a young person to be able to provide for themselves and then later in life to be able to provide food for the people they care about it gives you great self-esteem it gives you great sense of being you know you feel safe when you get off the subway if you know you can go home and make food for yourself you have to stand on line or go out someplace or meet a bunch of friends to try and you know get somebody to buy your burger you go home and need a little bit of soup or something you got in the cupboard it gives you a great a great sense of um well just being safe you know and knowing yourself and I'm person who was mugged twice at gunpoint hospitalized the second time hadn't heard some ultras like Liv Tyler blow all of it was okay as long as I could provide for myself I didn't have to call mom and say I'm in dire straits I'm okay and I will always be okay cuz I can make my way
