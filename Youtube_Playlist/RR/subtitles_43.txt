hey it's time to get cracking on my special soup for our big Thanksgiving feast mine has butternut squash carrots and oranges every which way that's why I call it hey orange I glad it's Thanksgiving soup mm-hmm I kill me all right this is a very simple soup and you don't have to make it just at Thanksgiving it's a good one for any cool day warms up from the inside out I'm starting by chopping up four carrots here this will make enough soup for six starter portions or you could get four entree portions out of it just run your knife through it and the small you chop your carrots of course the quicker they're going to cook up for you and this soup is a combination of fresh veggies and frozen veggies the butternut squash would take me the longest so I'm taking a little help from the store on that one I bought two boxes of puree that's gonna go into the soup I'm adding some evo Oh to coat the bottom of my soup pot and a generous pad of butter melt those two together and it'll let the butter come to a little higher cooking temp I put a little butter in there cause it adds a little sweetness to the soup nice creamy taste in the background gonna get my carrots in there and working run my knife through a small onion mmm smells good already yeah my mom is a riot she loves squash she especially loves butternut squash and she loves sweet potatoes too uh and she definitely loves pumpkins but if you bake any of those things up in the pie if you make a squash pie you know pumpkin pie or a or a sweet potato pie my mom eats out all this Center of the pie and refuses to eat the crust she is not satisfied with small portions of it either so I'm left with just a bunch of empty pie shells grumpy people that got gypped out of the pie and my mom um you know is happy and full of her squash so I thought hmm maybe I'll just move courses and do the squash as a soup he works out well then mom doesn't go out to go through all the trouble of eating out the pies so you let this cook together a few minutes then you hit it with the orange the orange flavor and the added extra orange color of a little pulpy orange juice now you can use half a cup of really pulpy orange juice that's ready to drink or you could use two big spoonfuls of orange juice concentrate from your freezer let that cook together and season it up with just a little salt and pepper excellent after a few minutes we'll look sort of like this over here this is just the cooked up carrots and onion I'm going to get this into the food processor so we can puree this The O'Jays sweeten this up nicely and that orange flavor has concentrated threw it away we go once you get it fairly smooth a little bit of weight left to it ain't bad which get it fairly smooth get it back into your soup pot easy cleanup on this one too let me tell you it's a neat trick hold on to the blade with your finger when you're scooping stuff back out of here you'll end up fishing your blade out of your soup pot then you're gonna just add some store-bought chicken stock there's no cream in this soup that's another really great reason I love it because I can eat bowls and bowls of it and not feel at all guilty about it it's very helpful store-bought chicken stock and two boxes right from the frozen food section of pureed butternut squash you know looks like this this size box two of these guys then you just combine that together see it's got a nice weight immediately but I just let it thicken up a touch let it go about ten minutes over a nice simmer and it looks like this and that looked great look at that oh that's just perfect and it smells delicious with the orange I'm gonna turn that off so we can get it ready to go mm-hmm now the finishing touch a little nutmeg boy that pot is a poppin I'm gonna put the lid back on it get it off the heat for a second there we go a little zip and nutmeg is the thing that's gonna make them go hmm what is that in there perfect garnishes for this a little fresh chevre some snipped chives some fresh thyme be delicious then no need to transfer this check it out just put the lid right back on top just going to wipe that up a bit and it's good to go I'm ready to hit the road and so is my soup when I get there I'm just gonna put this same pot right back on the stove over a very low flame until it's time to eat I told you it was easy right it's a winner and it works every time enjoy guys
