in your opinion what city in the world and you can't say New York what city in the world has the best food well I would absolutely same here are my favorite ladies and the reason is one because I truly believe the entire world lives here I love I love visiting friends that live in Los Angeles I have to go to a few times here I love Rome it's a beautiful ancient city I I love a lot of cities on this planet i love the city my mother comes from this little tiny speck of a place jealous this look but all of the world lives in New York and you really can have any budget and be of any background and if you're in any other city there is one business or another that's predominant so the culture is led by one group of people or another I Love New York because there is every representation here at every price point I still love the dosa guy in washing and I love you know having a fifty-dollar veal parm car bomb you know i mean i love i love it all I I love being able to step back in time or move forward and I think New York definitely offers that more than any city I've been to but I haven't seen no bueno I mean for my it's not just because I'm a New Yorker but I'm very proud of New York State I'm very proud upstate New Yorker I love the outer on wax and it wouldn't trade where I come from for anything but I love that I get to share my time and the most comfortable place to eat for me he's New York City period it's the best green markets because of the great work Danny Meyer didn't totally almost single-handedly rebuilding the neighborhood I physically live in I'm surrounded by amazing restaurants and great farmers markets where you can buy seconds you can buy direct from the farmer you can still get bargains and food I live in a great rich food community and I told you before I show tonight even when I'm in upstate New York I take a lot of the farmers market from here and drive it home because unfortunately we can't get it there and that's not like Walmart and Target aren't a caring sustainable seafood it's not like the price chopper hasn't brought in local but we do not have so they've built the green market we just don't have the people living there to sustain you know folks to bring to this market and the small farmers they drive it all down stink you bring it all here it's not in my community I can't go to the lake luzerne green market on a Saturday doesn't exist it's just not there you know so my life is very much in marriage of the to another city that I'm a big big fan I was Austin they were agreeing before it was cool there are very special special group of people there's no ages in there there's no sexism you can see a man who's very clearly conservatively dressed fella sitting on a bus with his dog and talking to a kid with gauges in his ears and I love that I love being in a community that feels that familiar and it being in Texas I think that's real special and they have food trucks and small businesses celebrated in that whole self come Chris district I I love starbucks i love Walmart alip dark I love what everybody does for our economy in different ways but I do like a place like Austin where there's a few blocks where it's still about independent business and the American spirit and that whole kind of everybody's okay here and everybody belongs I mean we're a country of kicked out from every place and then we became these forerunners in a lot of ways I like a place that mixes those two ideas and I think Austin is another big place
