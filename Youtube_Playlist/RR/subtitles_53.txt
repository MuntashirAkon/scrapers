now let's start our sauce for penny wise pumpkin pasta I guess it's also penny wise because the whole wheat pasta is a wise choice it has more protein and more fiber in it and put a little Evo on the bottom of a nice high sided skillet so we can toss our penne with our honking sauce trim up some garlic here let's get the shallots in first though I got two big beautiful shallots they'll take a little longer to cook up now shallots are their own thing they're somewhere between a garlic and an onion and flavor but you could certainly use up some onion if you have that on hand instead now let's trim up our garlic and get that in there I'm just gonna grate it right down into the pan really turn that down a little bit now now that it's got some heat under it and it's rocking and rolling pull a cop side just eyeball of your duck all of your pumpkin the sauce is made of a couple of shallots and a few cloves of garlic saut√©ed an EVO oh then you add in two cups of stock and one 15 ounce can of pumpkin puree make sure you don't get the pumpkin pie filling okay that's a little over the top with the sweet flavorings now keep your stock on hand just in case your sauce gets a little bit too thick i seasoned it up with a few dashes of hot sauce well actually I like things hot so I used a few teaspoons you can start with a few dashes and work up from there for yourselves and then I seasoned it to taste with a little freshly grated nutmeg so the thing that makes them go hmmm what is that in there and just a pinch tiniest little pinch of cinnamon salt and pepper of course now it's bubbling away and I'm gonna turn that back down to low so all the flavors can combine and it will just simmer up beautifully just running my knife through home seven or eight leaves of nice fresh sage go so beautiful with the flavor of not only the pumpkin but the earthiness that I was talking about I've got my whole wheat penne drained I'm going to add my whole wheat pasta to my pumpkin sauce how pretty is that and a whole can - it's about a 15 ounce cancer about two cups of pumpkin puree mixed in there mmm yeah it smells good shallots garlic I've got some nice fresh sage stirred in there one little guy was trying to escape uh-uh no brother you're going in okay let's pour this out into the big serving bowl from the big Black Cauldron oh this is so good and it's very nutritious guys yeah you've got lots of fiber of course from the pumpkin and our whole wheat pasta extra protein from using pumpkin pasta
