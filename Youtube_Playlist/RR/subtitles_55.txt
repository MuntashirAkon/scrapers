hi this is rachael ray you may know me from 30-minute meals or food travels well i'm here with a new show for people who just don't have time for 30-minute meals it's rachel ray this is two to five minute meals due to food okay okay today we're going to be making cupcakes and this is a dish that my mom always used to make you want to start with a bowl okay now yeah okay first thing you want to do is you want to put down your base which for this we're making a nice vanilla cupcake you want your base to be really flavorful and really bring out the spices of the dish so we're going to start with garlic salt I'm going to put some in here okay now we're going to whip that up I remember when I was a kid my grandpa used to used to take me fishing right before we made cupcakes and that was one of the best experiences of my life it was so nice I know yeah I used to joke you know that um that we put the fish in the cupcakes well for these cupcakes we are really going to put in fish I started doing this after shortly after my grandpa died and actually tastes really good so for this we just want one two three whoa and just pick that up it's for God made dirt and dirt don't hurt you know what they say okay um all right this is going to be one of our longer meals pushing towards five minutes because they have to bake so next we're going to add a little bit of evo oh that's extra virgin olive oil just going to put that in okay now we're going to wait for 10 seconds while it sits and while you do this I like to kind of prepare the other ingredients right now the next ingredient we're going to be adding is our liberate tablets they they have a really nutty flavor almost like an almond and it just it really brings out the natural vanilla taste in these cupcakes and it's great for alcoholics I would suggest in one bottle if you don't drink and to view delivery tablets you can find them pretty much anywhere okay that's done sitting we're going to add our tablets okay okay we go the little little gray thing yes okay and once you've done that you want stir it gently but be careful because you don't want it to get too fluffy because that will damage it um Evie LOL that's extra virgin olive oil next we're going to add some carrot juice make sure you shake it this is really going to pull this all together right now we have a lot of the dry ingredients but what we really need is something to pull it all together and that is carrot juice we're just going to add some in okay there we go this is looking really great all right stir this up now finally we're just going to add a little flour here because it's our that sugar sugar or flour it's about the same thing either get it sweet or you'll get um really moldable cupcakes they're both good things so either one works now we're going to stir it mmm we're going to insta bake it like this okay insta baked this reminds me of this one time when I was out hunting and I actually we're just going to wait for Tim fake and I caught this wild deer and I was so hungry that day that I just ate it I right there i just ate the deer by um my bare hands okay now this is done insta baking and cupcake yeah just like my mom used to make so this has been to 25 minute meals with Rachael Ray happy cooking goodbye
