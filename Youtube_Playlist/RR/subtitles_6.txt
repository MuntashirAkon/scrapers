I'm going to heat a big skillet over medium heat and put in about a half inch of olive oil to fry it in that's called a shallow fry this is nice fresh thyme the trip to the tenders well there's a couple of tricks to them you put cheese grated cheese all through the breadcrumbs and lots of nice fresh herbs and this time you just hold the stem at the top gently pull backwards and the leaves just come right off and they're so small you don't even need to chop them a few sprigs of that and you're ready to go just pop those in the pie plate there rosemary you take the leaves off the same way but you do need to chop those up a little because you don't want big pieces of rosemary getting stuck in everybody's teeth you just hold the stem of the top pull nice and gentle all of those really fragrant woodsy leaves will come off just give it a quick chop nice and fine keep your fingers curled under there I don't want to put any of those in your chicken tenders okay pop that in the bowl a little bit of flat-leaf parsley now whenever I bring my produce home I do a one big shopping week bring the produce home I give it all a wash and a dry then I wrap it in paper towels keep the moisture away from the greens put it in food storage bags and then it's ready to use all week long good little time-saver there the flat leaf parsley is a little peppery err than the curly but you can use whichever one you prefer give that a quick chop put your herbs in the dish four cloves of garlic go in there that we reserved I've got three cloves in with my owner remember I needed it twice so I chopped it once I popped the first three cloves in with my onion there it's sauteing gently can unwrap well you know what before I even touch those chicken fingers let's finish our breadcrumb you want two cups of Italian bread crumb that's about one that's about two and one full cup of grated cheese I use parmigiano-reggiano because it's so yummy and nutty tasting get it already fresh grated just hand them a hunk and they hand me back a nice pile of grated parm just mix that together real quick with your fingertips and you're ready to go with garlicky cheesy breading there now your eggs go in your center dish two of those in there and then look real quick with a fork great first one just gets plain old flour about a cup of that now we're ready to make our assembly line chicken tenders just pull your wrapper off little salt and pepper on those guys okay now they're ready to go into the flour quick dredge you just shake off your extra flour then they're going to go into the egg now the breading's got a couple of secret ingredients going on it's got lots of grated parmigiano-reggiano cheese in there and tons of fresh herbs the time the rosemary the parsley little crushed red pepper flake and the Italian breadcrumbs and we just go flour egg crumbs and right into the hot oil now I'm just shallow frying these I'm just browning the outside that I'm transferring to the hot oven which we preheated at about 350 see there they browned super quick on the second side enough for a big platter full and they'll finish off in just a few minutes in the oven I'll turn that oil right off pop these in the oven oh yeah hey get nice and brown because I put parmigiano cheese all through the bread crumb lots of nice fresh herbs they are definitely a crowd-pleaser and because you just shallow fry them and then you finish them in the oven they're only in the frying pan actually for a couple minutes and if you want you can just keep transferring them straight to the oven so some are already cooking and there's batches all coming out say you had to cook for a huge crowd say your gangs up over four or five people then you'd want to do it that way just keep running them back and forth into your oven there but isn't that gorgeous huh doesn't need a thing
