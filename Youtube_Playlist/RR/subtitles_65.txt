okay first things first I'm gonna get a big pot of chicken stock going because the chicken gets poached in the stock and then the stock you make the sauce with that's the base for the two different dishes my mom always cooked like this cuz she worked what my like 150 hours a week oh maybe 85 285 200 she's serious - and so she do all the cooking on Sunday I don't know it never seemed like my mom wasn't there mom I always had really great homemade food how did you do that actually you must remember you were there you helped well not really now I was little kids all helped yeah we were slave labor seriously did you always just make double No well if there if if we were lucky you remember I had a couple of days a week off we'd cook one day do the chores and then the next day we could go shopping and playing okay so I'm putting the shallots in with the butter in the olive oil these are gonna hang out they're gonna get nice and sweet and soft and translucent then we're gonna make a quick roux with a little bit of flour my how many we're making double sauce so couple couple tablespoons of butter yes something like to Pat she likes a little bit more butter than I do so I'll put that in because I know she's gonna be like gives it a nice her way or it gives it a nice finish a nice gloss fine how we doing with the broccoli it's about ready I'll hold the lid for you pop it in there just pop it in there as it's going so anything salt okay yeah I just didn't want it to discolor on us well no you got a mountain of it though that's divine Devan it's gonna be fine with that okay very important when the shallots start to brown you sprinkle in your flour to make your roux and I always cook mine just a minute or so I need about three tablespoons that's good alright so you want me to cook this right mom for a bit yes all right turn it down a little yeah the only thing we have to be cautious oh it's not too dark of it got it you don't want it dark though yes it gets dark it gets too nutty tasting and it dis colors the bra mom the broccoli is probably cool no can you drain as I looked alright okay bring that up I'll bring it right over yeah I'm gonna finish off the I'm gonna turn this chicken right down cuz he's good and I'm gonna get going on the sauce here so I've got the butter and the flour cooked together as long as mom likes a couple of minutes we're adding the wine whisking that in how much wine MA I think a cup for that amount oh that looks good smells good to go ahead and put the chicken stock in now best part okay I'm gonna set the chickens out so we can add the stock hey mom you want to come down here and slice up some of the bird okay I'll be right down can I bring my own knife yeah you could bring your knife sure it's more nice in the car but everybody has their own special knife mom's no different oh it looks perfect oh yeah it does it's coming together nice okay maybe I should cook my real anger cuz yours is working really well so this will thicken up pretty quick and then my you want me to add a touch of cream for this right just a little dab a doodle dabble doodle and then she's got a special ingredient she puts in all of her cream sauces what is it my are not mad not mad we have it under the pillow mom puts it in anything with dark greens cuz grandpa did right yes grandpa and anything with cream sauce it's nice not it not

and I'll go through the chickies you want more chicken rachel is this enough well we're making two times the recipe so I got eight that's good right yeah all right okay can you put the broccoli in the pan for me a layer of it already coat this in the sauce okay now this is the point where you'd split it up if you're making this two ways the divan and the Tetrazzini it's at this point you divide it in half and you could pop it in the freezer put it in the fridge if you want to have it two nights that week if you're doing chicken a couple nights that week just pop it in the fridge for a few days freezes up great too and we're gonna turn half of this into the divan and then half of it into the Tetrazzini cool right but it's all out of that one base sauce and one big batch of chicken that's so cool I love this recipe it's delish mommy will salt salt pepper salt pepper oh just pour this over right mom yes mom you want to grab that Gruyere cheese there now this is the divan divine it's the broccoli the chicken the special sauce top it with a load of that Gruyere cheese and then we're just gonna pop it under the preheated broiler and brown it up really well mommy can you put cheese all over that do you have I'm gonna put the noodles into the egg noodles that's for the Tetrazzini and these are gonna go with mushrooms and egg noodles beautiful I'm just slicing up mushrooms now for the Tetrazzini which is one of the two dishes we're making today out of our one chicken base we got nice cremini mushrooms here and I've got my pan all preheated I'm just gonna hit it with a little evo Oh extra virgin olive oil get my mushrooms in there mmm smells good how's this going to saute toes yes I can cuz the noodles are just good here what do you think mom hey noodles look alright they look perfect actually here's the thing the divan the one bubbling under the broiler that's the chicken the sauce Grier cheese and broccoli right and it's super duper sauce and we made a double batch of the sauce poach some chicken set it back in the sauce and now we're doing my mom's Tetrazzini you get our breadcrumbs ready now mom tops the Tetrazzini with both bread crumbs and cheese so that's the way I'm doing it of course wouldn't want to mess with that one on each side here okay mushrooms in okay I'll switch with your mom cuz I want to lift that pan for you it's nice I don't want you to be dealing with that that's good that's fine get your self stationed there for the breadcrumb topping okay up fold those mushrooms right in oh this looks so awesome mom my mom's got a little bit of nutmeg in her cream sauce and let me tell you it makes such a difference and this isn't knockoff cream sauce there's not a lot of cream in it just a half a cup it's mostly chicken stock well that looks awesome killer good that looks fine so hit it with some breadcrumbs I'll hit it with some cheese and we'll like Batman and Robin it grooviness going in the oven now this just goes into our hot oven just to brown up the toppings there I bet you that demands divine now let's check that mom it looks awesome look how it browned we took one sauce one big pot of special sauce it's the cream right
