ton of money publishing shows two from 30-minute meals to forty dollars a day do you think you think things are lost by spending less money and time on meals you think about money I I begin with the fact that my mother was one of ten children to me as the richest life of any human I've ever met our quality of life wasn't based on what was in their bank account it was how much time they spent together and then each person learned their value in the family one person was great the sewing and then they became the family seems trust her Taylor another person who's great at music they would be the entertainment dinner the you know the storyteller the Joker you know the beauty of large families which not many people laugh anymore is that you really can admire and see the difference in and everyone and the importance of them and I think in a you know beyond have fun drink Pepsi or as much money as fast as possible then keep it and they keep the way for everybody else and have smaller families and get more at all I think a little bit can be lost in there I would trade my passport for any on the planet I love being an American and all of the complications that comes with it but I think there's a big complication and always being the first or the best were getting to hear and not appreciating all of those hooks and crooks along the way and devaluing over time all of our jobs are important not just technology or what's going to happen tomorrow and medicine or science you know the next thing apples launching i miss growing up with people that admired stonemasons and shoemakers and tailors and poets you know I miss growing up around people had appreciated everything about each other and I think that we're coming back to that time because we've lived now for several years of everybody learning a new face to hunger everybody learning a new face to need everybody having neighbors that oh my god they were so successful and now where did they go they've left our neighborhood I think our face has changed a lot of the country and I think we're coming to know each other again and I think that's a great opportunity and most of talk radio and talk new shows every morning i watch them at the gym every day 545-6 i watch everybody from Fox MSNBC it's all about division you know this being the biggest division in our history and I actually see a little bit of the opposite of that I see around the edges we're starting to try and look for each other again each other and gave Meyer everyone's job and appreciate each other a little bit more money does not necessarily translate into quality sometimes by having less money makes you become more creative in quito my cats have food brought elation exception your ancestors from italy and stuff a lot of a lot of them didn't have a lot of money but some of the greatest food and stuff you don't necessarily need to have a lot of know i think i'll live well certainly everybody knows that they cover for movement but way before that and the last several decades in food have been about reinventing comfort food and you know all these cajones other hamburgers and risottos risotto is rice yeah pasta stuffed pasta and versatile a burger I mean people go back to comfort food because we're trying to get back to a different error maybe and again using foodies to cover I'm great handling other people's money I'm lousy in Italy my own i hate the stuff and i give it away as fasika i don't think that that means you have to give up being a good business person or a savvy marketing professional our yellow organization is a Children's initiative because they don't have children by Amin and quite frankly Don a time to Chile at them it was very important to me to be able to have an avenue for kids so I could see some kids going to school we don't have votech in public schools anymore we do not have the culinary programs there being a shop mechanic being a carpenter working in the food industry these all used to be available in public school when I was kid on 45 and you could have vocational training for anything in a school where we only have 50 for children in the graduating class you could graduate and go become a mechanic or a carpenter working in a restaurant or hotel you know a job you'd have a life you could be really proud of an honor decent living and that doesn't exist anymore home it doesn't even exist you know people can make dinner for themselves the lunch hour has gone down to 20 minutes very few children have recess most of them don't have a decent lunch many of them are not offered school breakfast anymore if they are it's an apple even that matters I spend a lot of my time lobbying just to get these things you know back into schools I want it to be able to send some kids to school because they didn't have mound and I wanted to be able to feed hungry kids because I make my living through food so we started our initiative that are three tiers one third of the money goes down relief one third goes to Lauren the obesity rate and getting families cooking one third goes to scholarship program for any public school child who wants to go to anything even remotely food elated so we started doing fundraisers and dinners things in like system make sense when you look at the net net net so we created product lines that would attract families to cook together and products that would get families together and gave all of my proceeds to that thing to fund make this greatly lunch so now we do that for him will leave too because my actual daughter is pimple
