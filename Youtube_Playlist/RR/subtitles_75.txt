we're going to smother some mushrooms and kale in this pan now by smothering you're going to want to look for a lid that fits inside one of your skillet so you can press down press down press is the word of the day here we want it nice and hot if you want great color out of your mushrooms well don't salt them draws out all the liquid and they'll get a much richer deeper color if you just let them go and then we'll use our lid here to smother them it's so big back of the day my smothered mushrooms and onions I'm gonna smother the kale and press it down into my mushrooms working in that back pan so here here's what I do I hold on to the stem and I just give it a little yank there that's all hold onto the stem give it a Yank and then you're good to go run your knife through it I love kale I grew up with it as a kid but I find most of my friends don't know much about it they don't use it as a green much it's full of vitamins and we always used it in cooking in our family in our house because it stands up to cooking so well it keeps its its heft you know it adds such a great background of soups and I find that spinach is a little too delicate to put into soup so we use this a ton and I think it'll smother up great cuz it doesn't give off too much liquid just gets nice and tender but it stays firm all look how beautiful those are what did I tell you don't mess with them smother them don't salt them and you get this great color look at that gorgeous looks like a picture mmm shame to cover them up but gotta get the kale in there mounded up hi guys cram it in the pan here we go get in there this is kind of a brutal meal I'm smothering and I'm pushing things around dinner with the wise guys okay a little salt and pepper action here and then we put the lid back in there oh that's hot okay mother down oh that's so much fun this is such a great little meal it's a lot of fun I got it in there with my cremini mushrooms and now I'm gonna pick up all the color and the flavor up off the bottom of the pan with some Marsala Spanish theme today going on so I'm using Marsala but you can use any cooking sherry you have you should always buy good quality though cuz you're concentrating the flavor or you can put in a little shot of wine you want to pick up all the good color and flavor off the bottom of the pan you I'm gonna let that marsala cook out a bit and reduce that is a good one impressive
