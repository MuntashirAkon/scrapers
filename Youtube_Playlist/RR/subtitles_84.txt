gonna do oh yes I would oh you seriously won't get Rachel write it up we have to die my dad no really don't want to hurt myself okay welcome to cooking with rednecks and today we're making Fettuccine Alfredo hesitate fettuccine alfredo dollar index one pound of pasta have found a grated parmesan happen how to butter and a cup of milk absolutely never margarine margarine in this recipe does not work it gets all oily and my close to the top and it doesn't mix with teeth okay it's a really simple process burney age 36 butter because we're going to make a recipe and a half tonight so it's actually going to be a pound and a half of pasta three-quarters of a pound of cheese and three-quarters of a pound of butter and a cup and a half of milk the milk you may need to adjust by as much as two or three tablespoons just depending on how creamy like your saucer if you wanted to really stick your process the one thing they will say is we're going to boil the pasta in this pot and then use the same hot pot to make the sauce so that we can make the sauce right on the pasta because the Potter if you clap it will melt the butter and cheese much quickly than if we were to make the sauce and its own cock separately and later let over the top yeah almost like that early and cheese only we don't have to bake it after we make sauce and pasta um right now what I'm going to do is I'm going to butter up some of this garlic bread and if I can figure out where i sat down the garlic salt I would be a much happier person got a little green and on the table besides it has parsley in it he wanted to buy the pre-made frozen garlic oh this is anil semi-homemade with sandra lee i'm making awful on fresh made real garlic red run over semi-homemade ebooks and early pretty much yeah but anyway hi welcome back right now what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and put five minutes in spaghetti into the water as you can see it's hot white women but we've got a lot of bubbles on the bottom and putting across hand is going to cool it right back down again anyway just because we're putting a cool solid into a hot liquid so just to you know not worry about defying physics or could burn my hands we're going to go ahead and put all this in there now especially so we're doing this double back Justin this is Chloe four ounces top ten that's ten and a half also apparently supporting the susan g komen for the Cure Foundation I don't know why I mean obviously it's not that I problem with breast cancer just don't know why it's in my pasta right pasta in the water and normally I would tell you always be sure double check the cook time on the back of your positive one since it says right here five minutes been thin spaghetti everyone gets a time is cross the oven should be preheated so we're going to go ahead and sprinkle our garlic and what to Patricia do you it should be at 450 we're doing it for 25 can I understand that the sevenths most for 50 years idea you want to make sure that you get a good shot of garlic on each piece Walker can people like garlic has done this alone especially because it's garlic salt salt garlic sugar parsley garlic oil its marital carrot oil for color okay Boston is doing its little cost anything we're going to give this lecture boys best to watch your pasta starts you know coming back up to a bubble sort of helped it along in the boiling process yes you're stirring some cool air into the water there but by praying up the pasta to sort of move around the pot as it sees fit it's going to cook more evenly and it's not gonna stick together as bad okay come on put this garlic right into the 425-degree oven our pastas ready as you can see it's doubled in volume that's why we needed the larger pot I mean can you see this massive spaghetti fitting in that tiny little pot we had before so as you can see this was a great professor meant to have a really good pasta pot so what we're going to do now is we're going to go ahead and strain the pasta now if you were making a cold pasta salad or if for example you wanted to you know eat your pasta and just put cold tomato sauce out the fridge on it touch of butter anything of that nature we're gonna run some cold water over it stop the cooking process and make it stay where it is so it doesn't get any softer but we're not going to do that because we want it to stay high I've cooked it a little harder than al dente like it's not quite done yet because we're going to put it back into the hot sauce and it's going to cook some more you in our butter first and remember we're making a one and a half times recipe tonight certainly use three sticks of butter that's three quarters out of town again the last two days on the fridge some are butters starting to melt this is much easier done on the stove that's actually levelled your stove lean that way okay you can buy a wedge of parmesan and shred your own if you're picky about brand or you feel like fresh cheese like the little wedges of fresh taste better I'm lazy I'm a semi homemade on the cheese mostly because it takes so long to shred it you don't know time properly and beer garlic bread um one thing I will say is that that if you do buy these free shredded cheeses don't waste a lot of time and money trying to figure out which brand is going to taste of us if you're going to go to the ziplock bag of cheese go for cheap don't go with quality the whole point is to just get the cheese in the sauce no salt pepper and garlic your sauce to your heart's content now you're going to want to keep a pretty consistent search this was not helping the way I wanted it to and to so I turned it back up to four you were real close eye on dairy products on the skills though you stole them there's no getting it back contact us out this is looking great it should look kind of like cream cheese like that sort of thickness nice and melty are kind of watery more for me I was actually thinking like potato soup cream of potato soup when the cheese is kind of melted into the butter and the milk and there's one thing there's not like a blob of cheese that you're moving around as you start then it's ready for the pasta so and I turned it back down all the way to 22 and a half after I got the cheese pretty good melty we're going to leave the heat on we're going to pour back in articles hey see we are going to shift back into our noble for is a shelf but you get the general I so you're going to want to push the pasta through the sauce so that I get evenly coated throughout and so that that cheese that's not quite well to get can really stick to the pasta white sauce at the bottom of the pan okay guys we have absolutely alfredo pasta ready to eat No happy birthday to you have a birth way rescate it and we'll give you some utensils that's a fine-looking girl I must say hey are you in class you have I'm actually preheated I just started instead of fake I just put it to that's like I will edit that part put that in yet
