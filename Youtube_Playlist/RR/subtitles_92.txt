I'm making what I call spaghetti and meatballs stoop that's because it's thinner than a stew but thicker than a soup I'm gonna start the soup with classic soup fixins carrot celery and onion got to get a couple of cloves of garlic in there if you give it a good whack the garlic I mean just a good crack with your knife it'll be good to go with a lot less chopping just pop the skins off that and half the work is done for you and it'll get nice and soft and yummy in the soup it'll sweeten up and get delicious run my knife through that real quick kind of mill it got a little piece of skin on my finger there okay into the pot it goes give it a little stir hmm now we're gonna start those meatballs now ground meatloaf mix is ground beef pork and veal combined and you get it right in the regular grocery store you could also certainly use just ground sirloin for this that would be excellent now to the meat I'm gonna add some bread crumbs here and then about half as much of the bread crumbs I'm gonna use that as grated cheese the cheese really adds such a great flavor this nice parmigiano-reggiano here has a really mild and nutty flavor to it just gonna sprinkle that in if you use about 3/4 of a cup of bread crumbs to a cup you want to use about half that amount and cheese to that I'm gonna chop a little parsley here and just throw that in there that just brightens up the flavor the Italian breadcrumbs of course just have dried seasoning in them so this just brightens everything up a little bit and then I'm going to get this on up here and get the egg in there so I can start mixed it up now when you're making the meatballs you want to go for a golf ball-sized here I had about a pound of ground beef pork and veal combined that's called meatloaf mix to that I added some Italian breadcrumbs some grated cheese a little fresh parsley and an egg and some salt and pepper and you roll it up into balls about this size here about an inch and a half to two inches now I'm just going to get my hands rinsed off so it's a combination basically of soup and just spaghetti and meatballs supper all in one pot now I'm gonna add the liquids the meatballs are gonna cook like meat dumplings right in the soup itself adding lots of flavor now I'm going to add my combination of chicken stock here hands are too wet to get into that little guy well take a little help from a knife I'm gonna add a combination of chicken stock you want 1/4 of that and 3 cups of tomato sauce you could also use marinara if you had that left over in the fridge you could use stewed tomatoes you just want to have a combination of stock and tomato product ok I'm gonna crank the heat on that get these tomatoes in there little kids love this meal and they could totally help you make it invite them into the kitchen with you whenever you're cooking it's nice family time to not just eating dinner together but making dinner together and I was really lucky because I grew up in a family where my mom loved to cook at home but she also worked in restaurants she didn't want anybody else watching her kids right so she used to take us with her everywhere and I'm lucky because I grew up learning so much about food and feeling really comfortable in the kitchen so I don't really dread cooking when I get home at the end of the day but a lot of my friends really do that's why I try and come up with meals like this that are like really foolproof can do easy easy easy meals look how good that looks yummy so we got the tomato and the stock working together with the fresh veggies that'll make the store-bought stock taste nice and slow cooked in homemade put a lid on it as I said crank up the heat to bring that up to a fast boil now I'm adding my meatballs to my spaghetti and meatball soup here and I'm doing it one at a time so that I don't get splattered on cuz this is boiling I put a lid on it and brought my combination of chicken stock tomato sauce root vegetables and garlic up to a fast boil then I dropped in my meatballs that was just the ground beef pork and veal combined with bread crumbs cheese a little fresh parsley an egg salt and pepper all right I'm gonna get my spaghetti in the pot just gonna take a good handful of it you certainly can't add a whole pound in there it would suck up all the juice right now in this one case mom I hope you're not watching I'm gonna break the spaghetti in half just cuz it's soup you don't want big long pieces of spaghetti hanging out of your spoon when you're trying to get it up to your mouth so I'm gonna add my spaghetti see I put the meatballs in a couple minutes before the spaghetti coz the meatballs take like add around 10 minutes to cook through and the spaghetti doesn't need that long only needs like 7 or 8 minutes to get to al dente with a nice bite to it now my meatballs were a combination of beef pork and veal with breadcrumbs and grated cheese the soup itself was root vegetables and garlic and a combination of chicken stock and tomato sauce now I'm mixing in some torn leaves of basil I put in a handful of spaghetti and now that is just perfect I'm just gonna turn it off and give it a quick taste for seasoning it's good to go normally I would add a pinch of salt but I like grated cheese on top of my spaghetti and meatball soup so I'm gonna hold off on the extra salt there cuz the cheese is nice and salty oh look how good this looks huh and even if you're just making this for yourself a leftovers our killer kids so make a big pot my dog boo could always help beat this one - she loves spaghetti and meatballs look how good that looks Oh amazing
