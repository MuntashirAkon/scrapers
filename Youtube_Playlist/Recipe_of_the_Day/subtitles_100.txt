you'll love my beat pops with pineapple and parsley sauce they're easy to eat and full of flavor and the parsley sauce really makes the dish glisten so it tastes amazing and looks beautiful on the plate I'm going to make the marinade for my beef pops I'm gonna start with a little bit of garlic now I need two cloves of garlic you don't want to make it too garlicky but we want to make it taste really good and these beef pops are really cool because I get the beef cut in little cubes and you stick them on skewers with little pieces of pineapple just about the same size and between the caramelizing of the pineapple which makes it super sweet and the marinating beef which is super tender it ends up being really yummy a little bit of parsley and I'm just going to cut the stems off the parsley flat-leaf Italian parsley super yummy and even if a little bit of the stem gets in here it's no big deal the food processor kind of chops it all up so garlic parsley we need red wine vinegar and the red wine vinegar just tenderizes the meat just use two tablespoons there we go it's nice and acidic it'll be nice with the sweetness of the pineapple red wine vinegar then we need a teaspoon of sugar getting the right combinations in the marinade that make beef pops so yummy little sugar to balance out the acidity of the red wine vinegar it's funny there's a purpose for everything some salt and just a little bit of black pepper because I'm gonna make it nice and spicy with some red pepper chili flakes and just add just a little bit here I want to give it just a little bit of kick so when they bite into it they're like YUM because I like the heat with the sweetness of the pineapple together really good so I just want to give it a quick little pulse kind of break it up then we're gonna add 1/2 a cup of olive oil here we go a little Italian in this let it come together and it's beautiful and green and that's what I like you'll see the green on the meat and you'll also see the the yellow from the pineapple telling the combination of flavors is phenomenal we'll get rid of this one and grab my bowls and that's what's so great about this is that in no time I have both a marinade and a dipping sauce and it's kind of special and the flavors are sort of different too so it's very special so I'm just gonna dump half of the marinade in here and I grab a little spoon and grab the rest of it and basically just pour the rest of it in here look how beautiful it is have a little kick there we go all right we got all that in there this will hold on to later so I went to the butcher and I had him basically cut up some things about one and a half pounds of beef tenderloin and it's nice and tender so it's kind of melts in your mouth when you eat it and if you want to use a different cut of meat you can but you just have to make sure and let it marinate a little bit longer so about four to five hours if you can use a different cut but my favorite is the beef tenderloin three-quarter inch pieces and I call ahead and just have the butcher do it for me so that way when I have to get you know a party together I can just do it kind of quick cut a few corners so just make sure all the beef is coated with the marinade it smells good I'm very excited about this just want to cover it up a little plastic wrap and I want it to sit in the fridge for a couple of hours to marinate that way the beef can kind of just soak in all the flavors of the marinade so I'm just screwing my beef pops and I just basically just use two pieces of beef and two pieces of pineapple per skewer and the beef is been marinating for like three hours so it's got lots and lots of flavor it smells really good too all right so these guys should be done I'm just gonna pull these guys off kind of nice they smell so good there we go it's super easy to do as long as you marinate the meat you get give it lots and lots of flavor it really is a very simple thing to do oh they're looking good and they smell even better you can see the grill marks looking good so we'll just kind of put them on there look how beautiful this platter is it's like the perfect platter to put something grilled like this my little beef pops pink and pineapple parsley we've got the dipping sauce there we go look how gorgeous that looks
