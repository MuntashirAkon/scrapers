[Music] now we're going to make this this jerk marinate it could be a jerk marinade it can be a jerk rub sometimes it's dry sometimes it's wet this is kind of the guy's big bite version I throw in a couple little secrets okay first things some onion some Wow it's a bunch of ginger some ginger a little jalapeno I need this I need that I need that okay let me get this out of the way the microplane gonna zest a little bit of lime in here okay not a lot of seeds in there fresh orange juice is just perfect okay a little bit more put about but don't want to put the orange peel on this one that's that's not what we're looking for okay down let's get some jalapeno now I'm gonna put actually Believe It or Not seeds and the whole thing not the stem but the ribs and everything in there I'm looking for some of that big heat okay that goes in a little onion go red onions really nice in this okay but you know what you got to kind of put everything in there that you know a similar size so something doesn't get cut up or or processed down farther than the other you know okay dice on that there we go really great big flavor people sometimes a little bit scared of it because it is spicy but there's different you know there's different degrees of it depending on what you're putting into it and how far you're taking it like I said you can do it as a dry rub if you want this is kind of like a wet marinade it's going to sit on here for about eight hours so that's in some garlic clove look at I just put everybody in the pool here a little green onion get these bad boys down now here's one of the real big pieces to this and that is a little bit of thyme there you go this follows in that real traditional idea of doing the jerk not being the jerk doing the jerk okay get a few of those in there try to keep the stem detter these don't break down real well okay and I always like a little soy sauce I think that it's you know kind of follows along in the in bringing some salt into it but its own style of salt so just a little bit of that down some fresh cracked pepper now you can make this ahead of time hold it in the fridge a matter of fact as the flavors kind of hang out with one another for a while I think it actually improves there you go a little bit of salt here's the kicker the allspice actually a berry kind of has a flavor of cinnamon nutmeg and clove but it's actually a little berry now this is the ground-up version but it'll work real nice in here and just a touch it's kind of like that Chinese five-spice powder you don't want to put too much in there you'll really know it's in there okay hold on keep your hands inside the ride and then I'm gonna go ahead and get this marinade in here look at that all you should smell it get all that jalapeno right at the beginning there we go okay nice and thick now you could even take this farther and you could use this a little bit later but if you're going to put it on the chicken right now it's pretty much just going to work as a marinating can't be incorporated into a sauce so check this out now this can marinate up to like eight hours especially when you've got the skin and the bone on it see I'm gonna go skin side down first there we go there we are Caribbean jerk chicken first we whip up a tangy marinade of OJ olive oil lime juice allspice onion ginger jalapeno and time then we'll grill each side of the bird and then throw it in the oven what comes out is one funky chicken
