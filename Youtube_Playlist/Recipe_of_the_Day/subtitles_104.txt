[Music] when I have adults and kids coming for dinner I always want to do something that both of them love I'm gonna make a strawberry rhubarb crisp so I've got four cups of strawberries and I cut them in 1 inch dice which mean it's cutting most of them in half four cups of rhubarb I was really lucky to get really tender rhubarb it's in season for such a short time but when it is I love it 3/4 of a cup of sugar and this I'm going to do one may have tea spoons of grated orange zest and then later I'm gonna put the orange actually into it one of the things I love about crisp is you can make any kind of crisp and it's really seasonal when apples are in Anik apple crisp in the summer I make peaches and blueberries or peaches and raspberries it's a classic nursery dessert but it's really delicious okay so that's got to be at least one and a half teaspoons right into the mixture and then to thicken it a little bit I'm actually going to take the juice of the orange and some cornstarch kind of like making a pie just something to absorb all the juices and so it thickens it a little bit so this should be about a half a cup of freshly squeezed orange juice and a tablespoon of cornstarch it's a good idea to dissolve it in advance so you don't get any lumps in the fruit lumps not a good idea I'm gonna pour it right in and mix it all together give a big toss it's really important to cut the fruit and sort of big chunks cuz you don't want to end up with a jam for this you want to put fruit crisp so this is the crumble topping which is sometimes called a crisp one cup of flour I use pretty much the same kind of topping for each one it's just the perfect amount of crumble and sweetness and it's a good foil for the fruit 1/2 a cup of brown sugar 1/2 a cup of white sugar [Music] have a teaspoon of salt even sweet things need salt one cup of oatmeal I just think it's a really nice crunch okay give it a little stir I love the texture of the crispy oatmeal against the sweet fruit so next is butter I need 12 tablespoons of butter I'm just gonna dice it up and then mix it in into the bowl and just mix it in until the butter is like the size of peas okay that should do it so this is what it looks like in the bowl it's just big crumbles and all I have to do now is just put it on top of the fruit just distribute it evenly on the top you don't really have to cover the entire thing but I think there's enough of the crumble topping that you will this dish is about 11 inches long 8 inches wide and about 2 and 1/2 inches deep it's perfect for this 350 degrees for about an hour and it's gonna be bubbly and juicy and crisp on the top okay strawberry rhubarb Chris that it's really good and a little vanilla ice cream Wow nobody's that all up and we're running some yeah this is the holy heaven yeah
