[Music] today I'm making a variety of stuffed vegetables I'm starting by making a filling out of some chopped onions a little bit of olive oil and some salt I want to sweat these onions out that'll bring out the juices and then I'm gonna add in some of the chopped vegetables left over from the cuts that I'm gonna make I've got some crimini mushrooms now I'm just using a handful here so they're not gonna be expensive but I'm gonna get a lot of flavor already a little bit of garlic I've got three cloves of garlic into the food processor and I'm gonna mix this whole a bit of vegetables up with some bulgur and then stuff these vegetables cut out two stuffed peppers there we go just lift that out and try to get the whole hunk of seeds at once it's just a little bit easier and pull out the membrane okay so stuff pepper cut easy enough but don't throw away this little lid go ahead and cut that up rough chop and we'll stick this into the food processor as well did you know you can also make cups out of your zucchini and other summer squash just cut off the ends just cut off between 1/3 and 1/2 the zucchini lengthwise and then we're gonna use the smaller piece just with a rough chop to go into the filling and this bigger piece here I'm just gonna take a spoon just go right along the seeds they should be fairly easy to remove because it is a Keaney it's a young squash so it's not all that firm just scoop it all out you're making a boat where I'm gonna put in the filling alright just take that spoon and there you go let me go ahead who wants some chunks in here but this is all gonna get mixed up with my bulgur and then go into the vegetables that go into the oven in a little bit anyway so there we go a little more salt and yes you can make cups out of tomatoes to just take off the top and again just the spoon just go right around and take out that big hunk of core and seeds okay I've got my vegetables mixed up in here I'm gonna add in my bulgur wheat now this is just a cup of bulgur wheat that I've added two and a half cups of liquid in two and let it sit for about 20 minutes just to heat it up half stock and half water and that was it a little bit of salt and pepper on these vegetables and this is the only chance we're gonna get to season my vegetables so I want to go ahead and make sure I do it let's get this stuffing over here just take your cups stuff them loosely I don't want to pack it in these are gonna go in the oven for about 45 minutes at 350 I'm gonna drizzle the vegetables with just a little bit of olive oil that's gonna make them moist and flavorful cover them with some oil I want to cover them pretty tightly with the foil because I want to make sure that they stay nice and moist these are going to cook for about 45 minutes at 350 and then I'm gonna uncover the vegetables and top them with a little bit of Parmesan cheese [Music]
