[Music] this is a completely no bake cheesecake I need a little rubber now remember when I started cooking the chicken I took out the tub of cream cheese you need 12 ounces that's a brick and a half or a 12 ounce tub and you want to soften it up a little that's why I brought it out right when I started cooking dinner he just put that in the food processor with about a teaspoon of vanilla extract just eyeball it who smells great and then sour cream that's just to loosen it up about two-thirds of a cup a small container an 8 ounce container that is a cup so you just eyeball about 2/3 of that it gives a little tang to then I like to have strawberries going all through the cheesecake not just on top to garnish with so I just coarsely just hull a few and kind of run the knife through them and put them in the food processor right along with the cheese that way you get a little bits of strawberry going all through the cheesecake that's fine and now you need about a cup of confectioner's sugar just to sweeten this up again I just eyeball that too it's about a cup ok food processor together let it rip just about there and it gets a beautiful pink blush too from the strawberries great now I've got these little individual graham cracker crusts you look for these right on the baking aisle on the bottom there where they have all the other pie crusts and it's so cute just makes them fun to eat this little individual size you're gonna line these up they have little liners in them to set the graham crackers and make a little assembly line here garbage Bowl those and I'm gonna show you a neat trick I do this to fill cannolis i buy the shells down at the bakery I don't make those but I will make the filling because I like a little bit of chopped candied citrus in it then I put the filling inside a plastic food-storage bag and I just cut one end off and you make a makeshift pastry bag so I'm just gonna spoon this filling right into that food storage bag squish it down and see that helps you make it really easy Phil to these I'm just garnishing up the last of my easy no bake cheesecake that's just sour cream sugar little confectioner sugar cream cheese and strawberries all whipped up together and in those little individual pie shells it's fantastic
