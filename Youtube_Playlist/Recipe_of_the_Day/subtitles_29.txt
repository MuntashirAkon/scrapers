now let's start off marinating our meat because they're gonna be here in a minute and here we have our beautiful meat which we need to marinate in layers because you want all those flavors in every single layer you want all that flavors so we need one layer of meat and then one layer of yummy flavorings which is a little bit of orange so mashed garlic just throw it up on top there we go and then some onion a little bit of soy sauce you're gonna end up using about half a cup so we'll do half right now and the other half with the last layer that looks good and then half the beer that smells amazing and it's not even on the grill yet and the flavors haven't even marinated so this is gonna be absolutely amazing and then we do we have one more piece of meat we can put on top and then we add all this stuff that we have right here just layer it on top I'll last amount of beer and the beer I mean I'm not gonna get into like the whole carbonation and why this works all you need to know is this is gonna help the flavors absorb better a little bit of soy sauce let's fire up that grill [Music] so you just need to grill this meat about six minutes per side [Music]
