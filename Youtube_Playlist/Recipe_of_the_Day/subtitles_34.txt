I know the grilling chicken on the bone can sometimes be a little tricky but I have the perfect recipe that'll help you get it right every time so my pulled chicken with basil dressing so let's start with the marinade for the chicken you really want to marinate the chicken for a little bit to really give it lots of flavor I love grilling chicken but sometimes it can be kind of bland so what I do is I juice one lemon and makes it nice and tart and the lemon kind of keeps everything really moist and gives the chicken lots of flavor I love lemons for that exact reason so now we're gonna season it with a little bit of salt some pepper and some ground-up fennel seeds and I love that licorice flavor that the fennel seeds have so we're gonna add that and then some extra virgin olive oil so it's about a quarter cup of lemon juice and 1/3 of a cup of olive oil really fruity and yummy and then we just whisk this all together it's the easiest marinade ever Cameron you're gonna love it grab the chicken I have bone-in chicken breasts and thighs with the skin on because it keeps it nice and moist and really good they take the marinade and I pour it right into this resealable plastic bag I seal it up and then massage the marinade right on the chicken and then pop it in the fridge for 30 minutes and let it marinate and now we're ready to put it on the grill put it on a hot grill just like that you wanted to be smoking hot just put it down skin side down first and we'll create a little bit of a crust so while that cooks let's make the dressing I take one cup of fresh basil and basil is so sweet and so good it's what I do is I put the fresh basil right in there and basil kind of reminds me of summer time in Italy just smells so fresh and light and it makes the chicken really light and really refreshing as well a little bit of salt some pepper and lemon what I love about lemon zest is how it perfumes the dressing it smells so good all right that's enough lemon zest I'm gonna juice the lemon as well and what I love about this dressing is that it kind of guarantees that the chicken is gonna be nice and moist and flavorful now a garlic clove the Italian in me needs a little bit of garlic in this dressing and let's blend it just to break up the basil and the guy perfect 1/3 cup of extra-virgin olive oil basil smells so good blend it all together so then I just take the loophole and look at that color it looks so pretty I love that great so now the dressing is done so let's check on the chicken all right time to flip the chicken okay so now we're getting it the chicken cooked just right what I like to do is turn they keep it down to about medium-low to finish cooking the chicken so it doesn't burn see you at 8 minutes there's something about perfectly cooked chicken grilled chicken that just makes your mouth water it looks so beautiful
