[Music] tequila lime chicken it's like Geoffrey's favorite Friday night roast chicken but with the volume turned up what I'm doing is I'm going to make a marinade for the boneless chicken breast and it's going to make them taste so fabulous so the first thing is 1/2 a cup of tequila always helps and the next is freshly squeezed lime it's really important none of that bottled stuff you really do need freshly squeezed lime juice it makes all the difference in the world so one cup of freshly squeezed lime juice that actually also tenderizes the chicken 1/2 a cup of orange juice to give it a little sweetness chili powder to give it heat 1 tablespoon if you want more heat you can use more chili powder that's also good tablespoon of chopped garlic give it spice and this is the key ingredient jalapeno pepper it's really hot and I'll show you how this works so slice right in the middle and what's really hot is the seeds so I'm just going to take the seeds out and while you're working on this pepper be sure that you don't touch anything you really care about before you wash your hands because it's incredibly hot don't rub your eye what I'm going to do is just chop this finely I like the tequila lime chicken to have a little bit of heat but I don't want to have third-degree burns when we're done so that goes right in it'll be so good two teaspoons of salt teaspoon of ground black pepper and then the lesson is chicken so I've got six boneless chicken breasts I actually like them with the skin on it think they stay moister so I asked the butcher to take the bone off but leave the skin on and I'm just going to put them in the marinade the great thing about this is not only is it good to leave it overnight but it's actually the more it sits in the marinade the better it tastes so it's a wonderful thing to do for entertaining so that's tequila lime chicken it's gonna be so good on the grill [Music]
