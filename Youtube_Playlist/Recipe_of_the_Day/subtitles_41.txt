so I'm making strawberry oatmeal bars for the kids to eat tomorrow it's one of their very favorite desserts I've got a cup and a half of all-purpose flour and a cup and a half of quick oats I cannot believe how quiet the house is I love cooking and baking when the house is quiet like this it's a real luxury for me and then I'm also gonna add a good cup of brown sugar packed brown sugar I want to get as much in there as I can and then I also add a teaspoon of baking powder and about a half a teaspoon of salt and then I'm gonna stir this together a little bit and then I have two sticks of butter that I've cut into pieces I'm gonna throw it in and you can use your fingers and work it in or you can use a pastry cutter which I prefer just kind of work it around it's gonna take a while you basically just need to work it in until the butter is completely incorporated with all the dry ingredients all right this is all nice and work together now I'm just gonna press top of this mixture into this buttered pan this is a really easy recipe and then just use my fingers to press the mixture all the way into a single layer and get it over to the corners okay got a battle all pressed in there and now for the strawberry part I'm using strawberry jam but you can use apricot jam pretty much any kind of jam you have in your fridge I'm just gonna pour this into a single layer you'll need about 10 to 12 ounces of jam which is about how much I had left pretty lucky and then I'll just spread this over the first layer you know what I just had an idea I was looking at my empty jam jar there and I thought you know tomorrow we're planning on having a science experiment involving pond water of all things but I think I will also teach the kids about canning and use that as an opportunity to replenish my jams supply I think that's the plan all right got the jam spread out and then I'm just gonna add the second half oat flour and butter mixture and then just carefully press that you don't have to push too hard cuz you don't want to disturb what's below just give it a light Pat to kind of anchor it on there and that's it now this is gonna bake for about 30 to 40 minutes in a 350 degree oven the strawberry oatmeal bars are done and they look and smell so good I'm just gonna let these cool on the counter overnight and then I'll cut them into squares tomorrow anyone's dessert
