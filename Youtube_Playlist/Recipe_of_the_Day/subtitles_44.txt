[Music] so I'm using this beautiful rainbow of veggies to make a colorful pasta salad when I look at this my mouth waters I just love the way all this looks all those colors how can you not want to eat veggies when they're so pretty so Jeff I'm gonna ask for your help on this course I put a bunch of different vegetables on the grill I've got some zucchini here that I just finished up cooking there's some squash in front of you some green onions if you'll just chop those up for me I also did some corn and some orange bell pepper I've got some cherry tomatoes here this is so yummy I'm gonna make the dressing right in the bowl where I'm gonna put the pasta salad so one less thing to clean up and I'm just using some store-bought pesto a few tablespoons of that I'm gonna add to it some more olive oil if you don't have this pesto you know just make it a traditional vinaigrette it'll still be great you can add some fresh basil to it some pepper I like a lot of pepper and each Oh creams and make some pesto I'm gonna put a little bit more salt and now to brighten this up because I think a lot of times when you get that store-bought pesto it's really heavy because there's so much oil in it so it's always good to add a women to it and I love the lemon zest super yummy so much flavor in there and then I'm gonna use the juice from this lemon too so I'm just gonna slice it open still waiting for a grocery store to come out with lemon zest in the moist pouch got my juice in there and I'm just gonna whisk this up and add to it now you can use any kind of short pasta that you like I've got a few sealy here if you wanted to make this gluten-free easily could just use gluten-free pasta like a brown rice pasta would be great and then I'm gonna add to it my veggies I love that you punched up the store-bought pesto that's so smart you got so much flavor yeah green onions to put in the zucchini and squash so you can really just go to the farmers market see what looks good pick up a bunch of different vegetables or if you've got stuff hanging out in the fridge put it on the grill make it good Oh some fresh parsley hmm this punches up the flavor a lot too I'm gonna add a little bit more salt be sure to cook that pasta in salted water as well Jeff you might grow those right in there this is perfect for a barbecue to have as a side dish and I really like when I'm doing a barbecue party to have a side dish that can double as a main for a vegetarian guests so this could easily be your vegetarian friends entree one once vegetarian you know as much as I love my meat now when I was in high school in college for like about five or six years I didn't eat any meat so here is my colorful vegetable pesto pasta so receptive yeah so much great fresh texture in here beautiful color I love the way this tastes and I definitely loved the way it looked
