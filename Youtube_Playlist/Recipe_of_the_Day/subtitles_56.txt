lemon was one of my favorite desserts unfortunately one of Frank's two so I'm gonna make Frank and Steven and now I'm gonna make the base of the lemon mousse so first I'm gonna use three whole eggs and then I'm gonna separate three eggs and put the yolks in the base and with the egg whites to make it nice and light and fluffy okay next I need a cup of sugar and lots of lemon zest 2 teaspoons 1/2 a cup of freshly squeezed lemon juice just gonna whisk it all together a little salt mmm I'm gonna flip this over double boiler and just cook it until it thickens so the first thing I need is half of the egg whites 2 tablespoons of sugar just sweeten it a little bit pinch of salt and just whip those on high I'm gonna get the cream and I'm gonna get the base for my lemon mousse just done so I'm just gonna take this plastic wrap off the base so you make a really thick custard and then you lighten it by folding in egg whites and whipped cream and that's how you make a mousse this is the thing about folding you just want to put it on top and then fold it in slowly want to do nothing that will deflate the egg whites put the spatula down in the middle and then just fold it over really carefully can really smell the lemon zest in this so now I'm gonna whip some cream make it even lighter hard to imagine cream is life okay one cup of cream and you can just do it in the same bowl so I put the cream I'm just gonna pour it on top and fold it in this is so many layers of things but the good news is you can make it in advance and let it sit in the refrigerator for a long time just want to fold it in really carefully just like the egg whites make sure you don't deflate them okay and then I'm gonna give an extra special flavor I'm gonna put in half a cup of lemon curd gives it a real lemon bite it's about half a jar and then fold that in again carefully but not too much but this is really good mmm so good so lemonade the millet has disaster the lemon curd and yet it's really still very light so you can really do a lemon mousse just like this but I'm gonna make it ex-special and decorate with cream and lemon slices
