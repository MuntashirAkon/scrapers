lemon ricotta cookies with lemon glaze will put a smile on the face of anyone you send them to so I'm going to start with the dry ingredients we're going to use two and a half cups of flour so now I'm going to add some baking powder one teaspoon so the flour kind of gives the cookies their structure and the baking powder lets them rise just ever so slightly we're also going to add a teaspoon of salt I'm going to start with my wet ingredients I'm going to use one stick of unsalted room-temperature butter so we're going to use two cups of sugar so I'm going to cream the butter and the sugar together perfect now I want to add the eggs we're going to add two eggs one at a time and I'm going to add lemon zest the only one use the yellow part you don't want to use the white part which is kind of bitter and that's called the pith okay so now I want to roll the lemon just to release all of the juices we're going to use about three tablespoons we're gonna give it another mix buddy-cop the cheese that's why they're known as lemon ricotta cookies we're going to use one 15 ounce container of regular ricotta cheese now I'm done with that and I'm ready to add my dry ingredients I'm just going to add a little bit at a time basically like thirds I'm just gonna take a small ice cream scoop and you want to leave about an inch or so between the cookies so that way when they bake they can spread apart and not touch each other my lemon ricotta cookies are cooling so now it's time to make the lemon glaze so I'm going to use one and a half cups of powdered sugar and again you just want to level off the top now to flavor it I'm going to add some lemon zest so I added lemon zest inside the cookies and I'm going to add it on top of it too and we're gonna use again about three tablespoons of lemon juice there we go take your spatula mix it all together and basically the powdered sugar will absorb all the lemon juice and create some nice glaze I love these cookies with the glaze on top okay so it's slowly coming together and you see the little bits of the lemon see how pretty that is see how thick it is - I just love it so now grab the cookies that have cooled and I put them on this rack that way I don't have to worry if any of the glaze sort of seeps off the sides of the cookies so just want to put a little bit of glaze on each cookie you want to let them sit for about two hours that way the glaze becomes nice and hard and you can pack them up
