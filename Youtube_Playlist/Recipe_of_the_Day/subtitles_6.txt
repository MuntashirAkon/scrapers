[Music] today I'm making turkey noodle casserole to my bacon you don't want it to be fully brown guys you just want it to start rendering the fat just like this to the bacon now I'm going to slide the bacon off to the side a bit I'm gonna now get my turkey breasts in the pan so this is nice and lean and delicious and you could even make this with leftover roast turkey of course or even six slices of deli turkey it's a paper out of there start breaking that up with the paddle here you want to use a wooden utensil if you've got a big nonstick skillet like this of course you could be kind of rough with it start working it up now I'm gonna go ahead and spice it up with a little bit of salt and pepper and poultry seasoning because this was an ode to a leftover Thanksgiving dinner and because I always have plenty of poultry seasoning left over after Thanksgiving that will put a palm full of at it but if you don't have poultry seasoning on hand guys you can use some ground thyme or thyme leaves or sage or a combination of the two but those are your predominant flavors in your poultry seasoning see now the onions are working over here while the turkeys working over there and then to the onions we're gonna add tons of mushrooms now I chose just a white mushroom for this but if you have some shiitakes or some cremini little baby portobellos on hand please feel free to use those any kind you like I was going with kind of a classic feel here and you know back in the day when I was a kid we couldn't get those fancy mushrooms in the regular store like we can today so I went with the white ones now of course you just want to wipe off the top with your damp cloth you don't want to run them under water they get tough on you and rubbery then again thinly slice it chop it whatever you like and just drop it right into the pan on the half with the onions in it I can mix all of those veggies and Turkey all together now and whatever little bits are on the bottom of the pan I'm gonna pick up now with about a half a cup once around the pan of a good quality dry white wine I decided to lighten this up just a bit so I'm gonna use a combination of chicken stock and cream I'm gonna put in about a cup of chicken stock you've got 2 cups of liquid total half a cup of wine 1 cup of chicken stock and about a half a cup of cream I've got some nice whole nutmeg here I'm just gonna grate a little bit over the sauce I use my microplane for this or you could use any small side of your box grater that's fine too you want the equivalent of about a quarter of a teaspoon of it that's all bubbly and delicious and I've got my wide egg noodles here about a half a pound of them all cooked up I'm gonna drain them I don't like to cook them more than three or four minutes you want to drain them when there's still a little bit firm because they're gonna soak up all that delicious juice in our sauce now I'm gonna put these into the colander and then put them right back in the hot pot to get all the water off the noodles before they go into our sauce we don't want it thinning out our sauce give it a good shake sometimes I give it a really good shake at home half of them fall out so be careful not to do that pop them right back into that hot pot and then I'm gonna mix the whole thing together in this nice big pot here I'm gonna add the entire skillet of the turkey mixture and sauce do it nice and careful guys don't make one big dump or you could spatter yourself and that might hurt stir that all together look how good that looks huh insane and because it's all done on the stove top all we're really gonna transfer it to the oven for is melting all the grated cheese that we've got here now I use some Gruyere cheese and you find that in this specialty cheese case but you could use any hunk of good-quality Swiss cheese or you could use a Gouda you just want to slow melting cheese oh you know what I'm gonna get breadcrumbs I like a nice crunchy topping on mine I'm gonna need some vinegar for this Alex you like a little bit of punch in that topping so the bread crumbs they'll take up the oils of the cheese as the oils cook out and give you an extra crunchy top we used to fight over that when I was a kid that was one of the great things about the casseroles was the nice crunchy topping I just melted the Gruyere cheese underneath the broiler on my turkey noodle casserole now let's remember back in the day this would have been made with canned soup mix cream of mushroom soup mix leftover meats or canned tuna we've replaced all that our sauce is made with white wine and stock and a little bit of cream and nuts make it stop to that fabulous Gruyere cheese remember a great meal even an updated retro classic it's never more than thirty minutes away
