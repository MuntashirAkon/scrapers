you know you don't always need a barbecue to make barbecue sometimes an oven is just as good as any macdaddy grill that you have outside and I've got an old-fashioned barbecue plate with your name on it my ultimate barbecue ribs start with a meaty slab of baby back ribs we're gonna cook in the oven until they fall off the bone so we've got two racks a baby back ribs all right we're gonna season these guys up with some salt and pepper we're gonna drop these into the oven I get some fresh cracked pepper the flavor is gonna taste fantastic and it's gonna have a beautiful color all at the same time and then halfway through the process we're gonna start to baste it with a sauce all right into the oven low and slow 250 degrees for probably two hours Jeffy's goes in cool so the slab is in now I was talking about making some homemade barbecue sauce all right so what we have here is a pot now there's something about you know buying the stuff in a jar but there's also something about making it yourself and it doesn't take that much time it's just basically like putting a couple of ingredients into a pot and this kind of lets simmering away so we're gonna do start off with some smoked bacon now the smoked bacon is actually we're gonna get a lot of our smoky flavor from because we're not using wood chips we're not using charcoal so we're gonna pull a lot of flavor out from the bacon itself and what we're gonna do is we make a little bundle with a fresh thyme and we're gonna wrap this up pretty tight it just add a little bit of extra virgin olive oil to the bottom of our pot here and then we're gonna start to sear this and really extract some delicious flavor out the whole thing it's gonna go in just like that chop it away so we let that start to render okay then we're gonna do and just take an onion I've got a garlic head here I'm gonna use half an onion and I'm so to cut this guy right in half and pull the paper off and we're gonna throw this straight to the bottom of the pot and we're gonna leave us into a big piece we're gonna straighten all this out later we're just making the sauce and we let this start to simmer away okay they're all smooth do the same thing with a garlic we're talking about a couple pieces here and I've got two cloves maybe three we're gonna smash the paper off and throw them in as large big chunky bits okay take the paper off and I'm gonna throw them right into the pot if you definitely want a lot of garlic because it's gonna taste delicious with a pork and it's really gonna make the sauce nice and bold it's gonna let everything start to do its thing right so we've got some great base flavor here now what we're gonna do is add some Basin sauce we got some ketchup some peach preserves they've also got some spicy Dijon mustard we're gonna take probably two cups of ketchup and this is gonna be the base for the whole thing and it's also gonna give the barbecue so it's a lot of discuss it is to make it nice and thick okay drop that in all right then we're going to take our peach preserves peach and barbecue tastes really really good together and then great now we're gonna start to balance out our flavor it with a Dijon so it's nice and spicy if you don't have the Jean you certainly use mustard powder but I think the the spice really kind of comes out with Dijon mustard okay so we got that now let's talk about some spices we got some other things here okay we've got some paprika I love a little bit of cumin behind which I think it's gonna be really delicious all right we also got some molasses some red wine vinegar and some brown sugar so you got about a quarter cup of molasses okay we got the same thing with brown sugar okay take a whole fresh box of stuff the brown sugar is really delicious so Brown sugars gonna go in break a big chunk looks pretty good and then we're gonna add a little splash of red wine vinegar just to give it a nice fresh balance about two tablespoons to do the trick all right then we add a little bit spice to it I've got the the paprika which is a little smoky they were also going to add the cumin to that humans are really delicious for the southwestern spice which I think it's gonna balance out everything else as well so it's very distinctive bold you know alright a little bit of cumin I've got some salt all right we got some fresh cracked pepper I'm telling you that smells delicious already I'm gonna stir this together and then kind of let the whole sauce just do its thing right 20 minutes later we're gonna have the best barbecue sauce you ever tasted it is absolutely delicious and that's it now we have two slabs of baby back ribs have been cooking low and slow they smell really delicious and we're basing them with a homemade peach barbecue sauce which smells fantastic and they are they're about to fall off the bone at this point we're gonna go in for one last dab we're gonna mop on the sauce and then we're gonna throw them back into the oven smelled absolutely delicious by the way they're gonna go into the oven under the broiler just to get a nice crunch on top and they gonna look really beautiful
