okay so I'm preheating a nonstick skillet you don't want to let those preheat too long though they give off some fumes I'm gonna put a little oil in the bottom so that the chicken meat has a place to go and that oil can get scorching hot I'm not using evo oh here extra virgin olive oil it's a little bit heavy for this I need a lighter oil so that it can get to a really high cooking temperature oh that's nice and hot good let's get these guys in there I think that's a good amount they're quite a few big beautiful tops of shitake there let's run a knife through it yeah new clean night there we go okay I'm gonna sprinkle these in and I'm about to add a lot of flavor here with a couple of big cloves of chopped garlic and ginger now remember I said you can switch this up these lettuce wrap fillings and you can make it with shrimp or pork or beef or even all veggie and tofu but don't change up on the garlic and ginger it's a fantastic combination together a terrific one-two punch well salt and pepper in here I'm gonna add a little orange zest and orange juice right into the skillet here actually I'm just gonna do the zest because I serve up the orange in wedges and then you can squirt it on like you would a lemon you know with seafood you can squirt it on when you make up your own lettuce wraps there we go pop these in here love crunchy delicious water chestnuts they're so mild it's like a celery thing it's got a flavor it's very distinct it's not overpowering and it's got that great bite to it love it excellent now let's get a little color in there half a red bell pepper should do me there we go look at how colorful that is now just by adding a little bit of red they're nice now I'm gonna add the flavor the hoisin sauce now I scent is a soy bean chili and garlic sauce that's just slightly sweet add tons of flavor and it does add some carbs but it's worth it hey we're not eating rice we're not eating wraps we're being good here and that sauce just lightly coats everything in a delicious flavor they've got shitake mushrooms in here ginger-garlic so fragrant this is I tossed it out with a little hoisin sauce which is a Chinese barbecue sauce of soy bean chili and garlic just slightly sweet it smells fantastic now I would want a big bowl of rice with that normally but instead and instead of a flower wrap I'm gonna have a nice crunchy lettuce wrap this is so refreshing and delicious I got to tell you it these lettuce wrap things are way cool I'm loving them just take off the outer leaf I've got a nice big head of iceberg lettuce here you quarter this up and this way I said this is great for parties or for dinner because you just put out these piles of lettuce leaves that's enough wrappers there and I'll show you how this works you kind of build your own it's really fun you take one of your lettuce wraps put your chicken in there you can make this with seafood or pork or beef remember a little squeeze of orange juice down over the top and that is a low carb a wonder look how gorgeous that is and you just know it's good for you too look at that YUM can't wait
