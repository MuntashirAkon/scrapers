okay so we're going to first start with some ribs now we have some pork ribs here nice big meaty this spice rub is going to do a couple of things it's going to help tenderize it's going to help create a crust when we smoke the ribs so we have some paprika some ancho chili powder some pasilla powder New Mexican red chilies some coriander seeds and some cumin and a little black pepper and some salt okay so we're gonna mix up our spice rub and that's gonna go on top of the ribs and then we also have the maple glazed maple maple syrup and horseradish glaze and this is gonna sort of act as my barbecue sauce although it's not gonna be tomato base like tomato base or mustard base like you might be used to or vinegar base so we're gonna put the maple syrup in here okay lots of horseradish okay lots matter of fact I'm gonna put this whole bottle in there some Dijon mustard okay and then some more chili powder whisk this up and this is really gonna act like a glaze it's gonna get it's gonna give a lot of moisture obviously a lots of flavor and it's actually because of the heat and the sugar content it's gonna actually caramelize the ribs so you're gonna get that nice sort of caramelized texture on the outside give me a little sweet from the maple syrup it's gonna be a little spicy from the horseradish and from the chili powder and of course the mustard okay now we have our ribs and I'm gonna take the spice rub [Music] and why do they call it rug could you rub it in I'm just gonna rub it in on one side like this all right so now we just kind of rub these in very nicely now some recipes will say that you know you should let this sit for you know four hours or eight hours but you know for me I don't really think it makes a difference as long as you rub it in really well and then we can go over to our smoker come on over the idea here is that you start the charcoal and you take some woodchips and you you soak the wood chips and you put the wood chips right on top of the charcoal to create the smoke and then we can close this up and we want to cook this to a you know about 220 degrees for about 4 hours and then we'll come back [Music] four hours later what you want to see the rub it's become part of the crust now most of the work is done but they're not done quite yet now we're gonna we're gonna slide them with some of that maple glaze I'm gonna finish them on the grill now some people like their you know their ribs dry without sauce but I like to slather a lot of sauce on here little glaze get some more moisture going and then we'll get that nice caramelization on the outside of it I mean you can actually smoke your ribs a day a day or two ahead of time and as soon as your your crowd comes over you can finish them off on your and your charcoal grill not bad
