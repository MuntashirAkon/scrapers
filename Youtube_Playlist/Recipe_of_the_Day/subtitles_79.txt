[Music] so the first thing I want to make for my lunch today by getting facial is a crunchy noodle salad with lots of Asian spices so I'm going to start with thin pasta actually like thin spaghetti for seems to absorb the flavor the best go down the bowl okay the next thing is sugar snap pea it's about a pound I'm going to salt the water and then blanch them for about 3 to 5 minutes just until they're crisp tender okay first guy is going to the salad and the red peppers and the next thing is the sugar snap peas shock them first which means take them out of the boiling water putting them ice water stop the cooking really sets the color and it stops them from getting overcooked just takes a second [Music] perfect just make sure they're really cold and they are right into the salad it's really cold okay now this soft got great flavor okay the first name is called a vegetable oil I don't use olive oil here because I want the other Asian flavors come out I wanted it clear oil no flavor in total a quarter of a cup of rice wine vinegar you find this in the Asian section means grocery store third of a cup of soy sauce 3 tablespoons of toasted sesame oil this is a clear one takes the one that's the dark one and it's got lots of flavor one tablespoon of honey give it a little sweetness and to close the chaff garlic so what's the spoon of grated ginger if you want to hatter you can always put more in okay and this is a good step 1/2 cup of peanut butter that's really what gives it sort of an Indonesian flavor and you want to use smooth peanut butter and then just whisk it all together you can make the sauce way in exam and you can make the salad in advance but not too far because actually the soy sauce will break down the noodles I think the less I'm going to put in the sauce is some toasted sesame seeds I trusted them in a dry pan just put about two tablespoons in we've saved the rest to decorate the salad okay right on the salad so this is the warm noodles is spaghetti tin spaghetti and the scallions sugar snap peas red peppers toss it all together I like lots of sauce on it you some chopped parsley such a rough chop and then some more sesame seeds so it looks like sesame perfect
