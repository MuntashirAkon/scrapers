I'm just making a quick soup. This is a really quick and easy corn and cheese chowder. I've had some onions cooking in some butter, and I threw in some pieces of bacon. Now, I'll just stir this around and let it cook. And I've also got some diced bell pepper. I've got red, orange, and yellow, because they're so pretty together. But you can use whatever you have on hand. OK, I'm going to let the peppers cook. And then I've shaved the kernels off five cobs of corn, and I'm just going to dump the corn in. This is a piece of cake, this soup recipe, but you wouldn't know it when you taste it. It is extremely impressive and yummy. Now, stir the corn around. OK, now I'm going to add a quarter cup of flour. Just sprinkle it over the ingredients and give it a stir. And now I'll just pour in some chicken broth, as I dribble it across the counter. So I'm going to grab half and half. You can use milk instead of half and half, but why would you want to do that? So I'm just going to add a little salt, good amount of pepper, and just give it a stir. And that is it. All you need to do is put the lid on and let it simmer for about 15 minutes or so. Oh, my. Oh, it looks so good. It's really thickening up. The kitchen smells divine. Now, I'm just going to finish off the soup by adding some cheese. I've got a cup of Monterey Jack, which I think is great in soups, because it's so creamy and it melts so nicely. And then I'm also going to add a cup of Pepper Jack cheese, and that's going to add a nice kick. I'll stir it in. Oh, the cheese really, really sends this soup over the top. So good. And then last thing, I've got some sliced green onions, about 1/3 cup or so. And that is one yummy soup. But I think I should make sure it's one yummy soup. I'm going to give it a taste. Mm. Yep, my suspicions were confirmed. It's perfect.
