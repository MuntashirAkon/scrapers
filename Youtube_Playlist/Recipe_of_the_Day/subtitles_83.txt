[Music] at Barefoot Contessa we used to make hundreds of pounds of shrimp salad and we used to do it in big pots of boiling water I never really thought it'd add any flavor to the shrimp and then one day we started making chicken salad by roasting the chicken first instead of poaching it and it was so delicious and I thought why not do that with the shrimp you're not gonna believe how easy it is okay start by peeling and deveining the shrimp just run your knife down the back of the shrimp and use a small paring knife to remove the shell and the tail you want to make sure that you get the vena that's that dark little line down the back of the shrimp then put the shrimp on a sheet pan for this salad you need two and a half pounds of 16 to 20 count shrimp drizzle them with olive oil sprinkle them with salt and pepper and mix it all together then spread them out in a single layer so they cook evenly and roast them in a 400-degree oven for six to eight minutes until they're pink firm and just barely cooked through now see what I mean about simple that's simple okay so the shrimp are gonna go into a big bowl oh these smells so good I want the shrimp so that they're warm not really hot and not cold they absorb the sauce best that way good news about this shrimp salads you can make a lot of it at one time it's not as much sauce as you like probably most of this sauce I never put the shrimp into the sauce I put the sauce into the shrimp just so you can moderate how much sauce you know give that a good toss fantastic and then the last thing I was add is the vegetables and the herbs get just the right proportionate so this is dill red onion and capers it's gonna be fantastic I always hold just a little bit back to decorate the top mix that together I love the smell of this shrimp and red onion and dill and the roasted shrimp it makes such a difference you won't believe it a little salt and pepper just to finish it so we're sort of that so leper at the end that you take first hits your tongue just have to make sure it's okay you never know [Music] after best from shallot I ever had we're gonna taste the orange mmm I'm just gonna let these sit for about 20 minutes and let the flavors absorb when the Shrimpers just slightly warm they absorb the sauce best and then I'm gonna put it in the fridge [Music]
