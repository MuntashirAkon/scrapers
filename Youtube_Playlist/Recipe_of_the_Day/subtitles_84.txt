we're starting with a crab cake slider first let's start with one egg in a bowl it's gonna be our binder we're gonna add four dashes of seafood seasoning about eight dashes of hot sauce your favorite now give it a nice little edge that crab about 1/4 cup of mayo depending on how juicy your crab is maybe you gotta up it to a half a cup make sure all those spices are incorporated and instead of bread crumbs I'll use one of my favorite things on the planet 18 butter crackers right this is not only gonna help it bind together a little bit but it's also gonna fuse that crab with tons of butter flavor so just crack them right in there let's chop up some fresh parsley to put into our crab mix here about two tablespoons of that just lay out a nice green color to it brighten it up a little bit all right once this is all incorporated we can then add the crab here I have two pounds a blue crab meat we don't want to overwork the crab because you don't want to break up these sweet chunks mmm that's good I can just eat that with a spoon right pick through these got any cartilage any shells out of the way very important step do not skip it so we're gonna lightly fold this using that tip right people don't know that but a rubber spatula has this shape for a reason right this you can scrape the side of the bowls with but this little tip is for folding you take that tip you put it through and you can kind of cut through whatever you're mixing so you can gently fold turn over perfect now we can scoop it out onto a silicone lined sheet I got my oven at 350 so we got a two tablespoon ice cream scoop here and this I have done the research folks this is perfect slider size if you're doing this by hand just look for the size of a golf-ball so you can fit our tiny slider buns so cute all right that's number 24 out of my silicone line sheet pan here and just to kind of get a nice little golden brown top I'm there I'm gonna put a little more mayo right on top spray coal with a little bit of seafood seasoning and these can go in the oven at 350 for 10 to 15 minutes so they're golden brown beautiful look how those taps got golden brown let's grab my slider buns we buttered and toasted our slider buns here perfect party bites right all right while these cool I am going to make my blood orange I only starting with a cup of mayonnaise a tablespoon of stone-ground mustard for some tangy Tang tang we're gonna zest one garlic clove in here it's awesome now to make it a blood orange aioli we are gonna use with a blood orange right not only just the inside but the zest okay now we can cut this open and juice it let's I ball it may be an orange a half an orange and look at that almost sangria like collar whisk it up put a little dollop on the bottom of that blood orange aioli and that's why I wanted to make sure our blood orange aioli and a nice thick consistency so it stays on that bunch couple those greens here a nice selection we'll take these crab cakes it's beautiful its elegant it's fresh party food it's fantastic to the DJ car he's about to begin [Music]
