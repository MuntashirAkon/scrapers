[Music] lemons are one of the most versatile things that we have in the kitchen we can use them for marinades for sauces for salad dressings for desserts the funny thing is we would never eat a lemon just by itself ooh a little sour we have a few different varieties here so what do we look for when we buy these guys they should be nice and heavy that means they have lots of juice in them they should be really shiny and the skin should be nice and oily one of my favorite varieties of lemons is the Meyer lemon this is available in the springtime and this is a cross between a mandarin or a tangerine and a good old-fashioned lemon and it is just an amazing beautiful wonderful smell so let's talk about lemon curd we all know lemon curd yes this deliciousness right here it's kind of like pudding lemon lemon curd sort of a little mix between eggs sugar and then we whisk in some butter and let it set up I'm using the zest of the lemon it's amazing when you start to do this how much this smells the zest is just the colored part of the lemon once we start to get through to the white it gets really bitter tasting so we stop I'm using a fantastic piece of kitchen equipment called a microplane this is great for zesting I'm zesting my Meyer lemon zest onto some blueberries I'm going to toss in a little bit of sugar hey sugar so we give this a little stir and let's for fun do a little mint chiffonade this is a very fancy word for cutting little minty goodness he strips all right let's give that a little toss in there and it's amazing how much that will really brighten up the flavor and a little lemon juice oh yeah you are so good-looking let's take our macerated blueberries and assemble it with a little bit of Meyer lemon curd for a really quick and easy springtime dessert little lemon curd a little blueberries whipped cream is that good look beautiful I'll see you in a minute so dessert for later but let's talk about what else we can do with lemons so I have some lemon juice that I took out of the inside of my lemons I've got lemon zest to really punctuates everything brings a beautiful good freshness to everything extra virgin olive oil little chopped sage and rosemary this is how I rolled when I worked in Italy we did this a lot with grilled chicken so a little bit of crushed red pepper just for some fun and some garlic why because it tastes good let's give this a little stir let's give it a little pinch of salt as well and that we're just gonna pour it over some chicken I have chicken thighs here we let this hang out I cover it and put it in the fridge overnight or on my counter for up to two hours but not more than that I grill my chicken so look at these Oh baby do those look good and along with my chicken I go ahead and I grilled some lemon halves do these look beautiful they get really caramelized in lovely lemons for my marinade lemons for my dessert lemons for salad dressing lemons lemons everywhere everywhere I use a lemon it helps make my dish a superstar
