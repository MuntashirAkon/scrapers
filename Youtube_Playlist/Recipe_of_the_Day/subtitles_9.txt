[Music] being from upstate New York corn season is one of the things that we look forward to all summer we have a saying upstate me high by the fourth of July that's what the corn plants do shucking corn takes me right back to being a kid this was always my job to take the paper grocery bag out on the back porch and just shuck the corn so I've spent a lot of time doing this in my life so when we're looking at corn we always look for nice healthy ears with nice and tight corn kernels doesn't that just look pretty I'm so excited to get cooking pull off all this little silky stuff yeah we don't need to floss and eat usually wreaths we boil corn we throw it in a pot of water with some sugar and some milk and that helps bring out the sweetness but there are so many things we can do with corn and one of my favorite ways is to toss these guys on the grill I love that chari black goodness so let's give these a little oil up and some salt of course make things taste really delicious yeah and we just shoot these guys right on there could not be more cinch you know while you're making your your barbecued chicken or steaks or something shoot some corn right on the grill look at us multitasking all right very nice when my corn is done what I like to do with these guys look at that beautiful chard I see my kernels all nice and tender and delicious we're gonna go right back onto that plate we're gonna give it a little squeeze of lime this is something I learned visiting Mexico it's a really bright freshness you're like whoo now we're gonna roll it in some cheese you know what we can be cheesy and corny altogether that yeah roll it around there we really pack that cheese on there ah delicious this is a great side dish or you know what sometimes I like that just by itself that's a nice lunch to me give it a little spicy stuff a little cayenne pepper now for a little bit of kick look it doesn't that look delicious another way I love to eat corn is with pasta I'm a pasta fan I try to eat pasta as often as I can so pasta into my really beautifully salted water I've got some cherry tomatoes that I have got going here sauteed with a little bit of chicken stock and let's add a little bit of crushed red pepper just for a little pika a little kick and of course why salt that makes everything taste good all right I've got my cherry tomatoes going I've got my pasta cooking what am I missing some corn kernels so let's just take my shuck tear of corn I'm gonna cut these guys right off the cob and toss them in at sort of the last minute with my cherry tomatoes so my corn cooks ever so gently but it still has that lovely nice pop when I eat it very nice that a toss around now it's interesting Italians probably wouldn't ever eat pasta and corn together but to me this is the Italian spirit it's the Italian mentality it's seasonal it's fresh it's local yes look at that it looks beautiful it looks delicious so let's just toss some basil in there it is just gorgeous all the colors yes ah smells so good my corn looks beautiful and the tomatoes have let off their juices so it kind of makes like a little sauce stuff going on right in there altogether yeah let's get all that goodness in there see all that corn I'm gonna finish up this beautiful pasta dish with a little bit more grated cheese oh yeah baby all right let's taste this guy whatever way I do it on the grill on the cob in my pasta corn rock
