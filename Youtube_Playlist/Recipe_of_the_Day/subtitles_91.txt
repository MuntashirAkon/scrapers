[Music] I've got some ratty Ettore pasta which is really cute and frilly and I drained it and rinsed it under cold water because I need it to be cold when I add all the other ingredients and now I'm gonna fry up some bacon this is one of the reasons this is a kid-friendly pasta salad I've never met a kid that argued with bacon I'll put it about eight slices or so I'm going to cook the bacon until it's just beyond the chewy States just so it's slightly crisp okay now I'm going to get started on the dressing I'll start with half a cup of mayonnaise and then I'll add a half cup of milk and then just plain white vinegar I'll add about three tablespoons so I'll whisk this together yeah that looks just right you don't want it to be too too thick you want it to be nice and horrible so it'll coat all the pasta I'll add some salt and plenty of black pepper give it a stir and that's the dressing simple as that okay and with that that bacon is done don't want it to get too too crisp I'm gonna drain it on a paper towel so the pasta salad won't be too greasy all right now let that cool for a minute throw together the salad I'll just put the cheese in I've got about a half a pound of mild cheddar cheese very palatable for all kids and their lovely yellow and red tomatoes I've got about 10 ounces of tomatoes give or take and now the bacon is cool I'm just gonna give it a rough chop there's almost more extras than there is pasta in the pasta salads then for a little flavor I've got three green onions [Music] now I'll just pour in the dressing [Music] I need a spoon for this oh so pretty now to really send this kid-friendly pasta salad over the top I'm going to add some fresh basil this is just perfect got the right amount of bacon right amount of cheese the girls are gonna love it
