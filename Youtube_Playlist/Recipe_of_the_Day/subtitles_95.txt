so we're gonna do sort of like a soy ginger garlic marinade you know basically like the Chinese marinade for for our next shrimp and we're gonna start off with some fresh ginger the great thing about ginger is it's sweet it's spicy and its really no substitute for the flavor so everything in the blender some ginger some lime juice some scallions you can use an onion oh I'm gonna use a shallot and then some garlic [Music] and then some soy sauce this is really going to be the foundation of your marinade you know you have the pungency of the of the of the garlic and the shallots and the and the green onions and you're gonna have the sweet and spiciness of the ginger we also need a little sugar not too much and actually the sugar will actually help to create sort of a nice little caramelization on the outside of the shrimp together with the saltiness of the soy sauce lots of flavors going on here this is what I call shrimp right yeah okay again we're gonna leave the shell on here okay and we're gonna put a little of peanut oil into the marinade [Music] just pour it over sounds great I love that ginger okay ready go to the grill alright let's spread these out really want all these flavors to kind of cook in there you know the sugar the soy sauce the ginger the scallions the garlic all those flavors no come together we blend them all together and now that we want to make them part of the shrimp so that when you bite into these shrimp you'll pick up at least two or three of those flavors right away and you'll know that they're Asian style I would just sort of slice up a little green scallion garnish go check on the shrimp now you have to be careful with these because remember we do have some sugar in there they're gonna really caramelize pretty quickly let me show you what I'm talking about oh yeah that's that's actually exactly what we're looking for [Music] little lime scallions family-style [Music]
