[Music] last year I went to a spa in Arizona and I fell in love with this rustic salad that I had and it reminded me of one of my all-time Italian favorites panzanella salad which is basically an Italian bread salad there we go so I've taken whole wheat bread and cut it into about 1 inch cubes and I'm gonna spread it out and to that I'm also going to add course some veggies some artichokes so when you thaw them out and then to give them some flavor we're gonna grill it all so a little bit of olive oil just a tad just to kind of moisten everything just like that and then you just want to toss it all together I'm gonna put it on a hot grill pan and hear that sizzling that's what you want and that'll give you nice grill marks and a little bit of that smoky flavor put the tongue you just want to even it all out the bread and the artichokes are looking good all right so to my whole-wheat panzanella salad I'm also going to add some black olives I happen to adore black olives now you could add green olives if you want to or kalamata olives but there's something about black olives they're very tender and slightly sweet so just want to cut them in half you want to get pitted black olives I want to keep everything kind of like a rough chop everything sort of the same size okay so now put the olives in there we're also going to add some tomatoes now tomatoes are one of those traditional ingredients in pens and nelj√§ salad so kind of have to have it and they add sweetness little crispness and lots of color and then cut them in wedges [Music] so tomatoes are done now gotta have some freshness of course it's a spa salad after all so color and some clean movie tastes and flavors so fresh and clean tasting nice colors we got all of that now taking the bread and the artichokes and the riff from the bread and the artichokes just heats up all the rest of the ingredients and it brings out the flavor of the tomatoes and the olives and then we put the dressing over it it's gonna help absorb everything so now I'm gonna make the dressing and I'm going to keep it really simple some white wine vinegar is very light so it's perfect for this salad and won't overpower the rest of the flavors in the salad we're also going to add a little bit of extra virgin olive oil not too much just a little remember this kind of oil is good for you and you need it to keep your skin your hair everything looking so vibrant and beautiful and of course very Italian give it a nice little whisk very easy dressing a little bit of salt and some freshly ground black pepper Jenna has to finish off the season make sure the salads get enough salt and pepper in it and just pour it right over the top everything will just absorb the dressing I just want to toss it everything kind of gets combined [Music] don't you grab really go wow a little Bever Blackhall of them their whole sweetness and that artichoke
