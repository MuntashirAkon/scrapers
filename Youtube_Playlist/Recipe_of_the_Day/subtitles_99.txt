one of the things you see sort of an old school grilling or barbecue is kebabs you know the thing I don't like about kebabs is usually it has more than one thing on and they all cook at different time in a different rates I just like to make skewers of one particular thing at a time one of my favorite things actually put on a skewer it's chicken thighs they have a lot of really terrific flavor I actually like them better than chicken breasts but don't tell anybody the chicken thighs is really the way to go all right first things first let's talk about the skewers if you're going to use wooden skewers you have to waterlog them this way it will keep them from sort of burning away actually want to soak them for at least three or four hours you can soak them overnight it works totally fine I'm going to make a very quick marinade for these skewers I'm going to start with some citrus juices first just some orange juice and a little bit of lime juice and some chili powder I'm using some ancho chili powder and some Chipotle and I think I'm going to put a little bit of garlic in there too I'm gonna add a little bit of salt and pepper okay next sort of the detection that you're looking for a little bit thinner than the paste a little bit thicker than the sauce okay now I use two skewers for each chicken thigh and I go on both sides of the chicken the reason why I'll just put one and throw it on the grill is because then it actually kind of plumps up like a hot dog and I want to keep them nice and flat so they cook very evenly and then what we can do is after we cook them we can actually cut them straight down there you'll have two skewers all right so we're going to take our marinade we're just going to paint this right on here if you want to marinate this a few hours ahead of time or even overnight that will work totally fine and now we can go to the grill if you take a look at my grill I've actually created three different zones here I have one with a lot of charcoal so is going to be the hottest part of the grill then I have some with just a few pieces of charcoal there so it's going to be a sort of like medium heat and then I have a portion of the grill that has almost none and that's going to be a place where I can sort of finish the the chicken thighs and let them cook through without getting too charred that's what you want to hear that nice sizzle and it smells good right away and these cooks for about four to five minutes on each side all right now at this point we just want to let the grill do its job okay the best grillers stay away from the grill as much as possible and just let it happen all by itself in this case we're actually going to flip these just one time don't forget the chicken thighs are actually going to take a little bit longer than chicken breasts because they're a little bit more moist they have to cook through your juicier but the results are way worth it I'm actually going to put a couple of limes on here we're actually going to grill them because we're grilling we're addicted to barbecue so we're going to grill everything we can and I'm going to just take a couple of scallions just to give a little more flavor and just for you know good to garnish the plate now how do you know when they're done that's that's the question I get all the time well in this case you want to make sure that you use a completely firm obviously we're not cooking chicken anything but all the way through I feel like they're cooked almost completely through it was another minute so I'm going to do is actually cover our grill and I think once the limes are grilled the chicken will be done who's got the top down chicken on a skewer that's simple a little bit of flavor on there a few ingredients throw them on the grill and your guests gonna be happy and this isn't even the main course delicious
