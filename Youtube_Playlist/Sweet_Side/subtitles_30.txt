NARRATOR: How to make maraschino cherries. Start by washing fresh cherries. Then, with the help of a clip-- yeah, a paperclip-- remove the pits and place in a sterilized jar. It's time to make the syrup. In a pan, add sugar, water, and salt. Cook it over medium heat for eight minutes, or until the sugar crystals the salt. Turn off the heat and add lemon juice, maraschino liqueur, and almond extract. Almond extract is what enhances the maraschino flavor. Amazing! Add enough syrup to cover the cherries in a jar, and let them rest for a week before you use it, to develop all the awesome flavors. This is what I call real maraschino cherries. Yay.
