NARRATOR: How to make creme brulee without a torch. Creme brulee in French means 'burnt cream.' And to make your own, in a pan, add heavy cream and vanilla-- with the seeds, of course. Cook it over medium heat until it comes to a boil. Cover with the lid and let it steep for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, in a bowl, add the egg yolks and whisk it with the sugar until it's pale yellow and fluffy. Continue on whisking and temper the egg yokes with the hot cream-- it means making the yolks slightly hotter. Remove the vanilla bean from it. Now, my secret ingredient-- mascarpone-- mm, so rich in fat, that makes everything creamier. Pour the better into shallow ramekins and bake it in a water bath at 300 Fahrenheit for 30 minutes. Once they have cooled, we can broil the top. I'm not using a torch. I'm going to use to a spoon. Select one that you don't love, 'cause it's going to get destroyed. It has to be a metal spoon. Place the back of it in direct heat and let this heat up for a few minutes, or until it gets really red. Always wear and oven mitt for extra safety. Spread a thin layer of sugar on top of the creme brulee, and burn it with the burning spoon. The handle won't be hot, 'cause silverware don't conduct heat. Now, you just have to get ready for the orchestra of crunchiness. Beautiful. That's what I call real happiness. Hey, don't forget to subscribe to Food Network's YouTube channel. Hmm. I'm watching you.
